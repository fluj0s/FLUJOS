next step updated december 20 2004 linda levine specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress the gender wage gap and pay equity is comparable worth the next step summary womens participation in the labor market has undergone considerable change in the last few decades with more than half of all women now in the workforce in addition legislation and regulations have since the 1960s prohibited discrimination against women in employment and pay although womens pay relative to mens has increased over time so that today women typically earn 7679 cents for every dollar earned by men the persistence of the gender wage gap in the face of these changes has prompted concern in some quarters about the equity or fairness of the markets wagesetting process hence the terms pay equity and fair pay studies have estimated that perhaps onehalf of the observed gender wage gap can be justified by productivity differences measured by work experience and educational attainment for example if women had the same human capital attributes as men they might earn about 80 as much as men jobrelated factors eg occupation and industry of employment affect relative earnings as well studies that include both sets of characteristics estimate that they might explain twothirds of the observed wage gap if women were like men in terms of their individual and job attributes they might earn about 90 as much as men some believe that the unexplained portion of the wage gap represents discrimination others an inability to accurately measure and include all factors that affect gender differences in pay comparable worth supporters contend that corrective action is needed because employment discrimination relegates women to different jobs than men and wage discrimination causes womens work to be devalued that is paid lower wages than jobs predominantly employing men comparable worth policy would extend the current mandate of equal pay for equal work to equal pay for equivalent work within firm it thus would not directly address sex segregation in employment by job occupation industry and firm size under comparable worth an employer would through such means as an unbiased job evaluation determine those jobs that had equal total scores for such job attributes as skill effort responsibility and working conditions the employer would then raise the wages of jobs deemed underpaid eg jobs having wages below other jobs with the same total scores in this manner workers would longer incur wage penalty for employment in traditionally female jobs the size of workers paycheck would be unrelated to supplydemand conditions in the labor market under comparable worth policy some highly rated jobs within firm may not warrant pay increase if there is an abundant supply of workers in the labor market to perform them however in other words legitimate nondiscriminatory pay differentials can exist between jobs equally rated by an evaluation critics regard the substitution of job evaluations for market conditions to determine relative wages as critical flaw of comparable worth by eliminating wage differentials between equivalent male and femaledominated jobs it could increase unemployment of women in the short run as well as remove the strongest motivation for women to overcome discrimination

concluding remarks 25 appendix 26 list of tables table 1 ratio of femaletomale earnings 3 the gender wage gap and pay equity is comparable worth the next step womens participation in the labor market has undergone considerable change in the last few decades women comprised 47 of all workers in 2003 up from 33 in 1960 more than onehalf of the noninstitutional female population age 16 or older has been in the paid work force since 1979 according to us bureau of labor statistics data the majority of todays married women have forsaken the traditional role of fulltime child care givers for the dual role of unpaid homemakers and paid workers over the same period legislation was enacted with the intent of mitigating labor market discrimination against women among other groups the equal pay act of 1963 an amendment to the fair labor standards act mandates equal pay for men and women employed in the same or substantially same jobs in firm the civil rights act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in employment and compensation against women and other protected classes of workers eo 11246 also forbids labor market discrimination and requires affirmative action for protected classes of workers at federal contractors and subcontractors one constant over time however has been the lower wages of women compared to men the persistence of the gender wage gap in the face of workplace antidiscrimination edicts and of significant changes in womens labor force participation has prompted concern in some quarters about the equity or fairness of the markets wagesetting process it is contended that corrective action which goes beyond current law is needed because ongoing discrimination against women is distorting the allocation of human resources and creating inefficiencies in the labor market others believe that the pay gap reflects differences in freely chosen labor market qualifications between the sexes that legitimately affect relative wages they assert that as the work expectations schooling and labor market experience of women and men continue to converge the wage gap will narrow further in the absence of additional intervention which could itself impede economic efficiency this report examines the trend in the malefemale wage gap and the explanations offered for its existence remedies proposed for the gender wage gaps amelioration are addressed with an indepth focus on the comparable worth approach to achieving pay equity or fair pay between women and men crs2 the malefemale wage gap the issue termed pay equity or more recently fair pay originates from the chronic fact that women as group are paid less than men in 1960 half of all women employed yearround fulltime ie 5052 weeks at least 35 hours per week earned more than 3257 and half earned less than that amount in the same year the median annual earnings of men employed yearround fulltime were 5368 more than 4 decades later according to us bureau of the census data for 2003 the median earnings of women with strong commitment to the workforce were 30724 while those of men were substantially greater 40668 it is often noted that even when comparisons are made between similar groups women still earn less than men women with bachelors degree employed year round fulltime earned 47910 in 2003 while similarly educated men earned an average of 69913 male high school graduates were paid 38331 on average well above the 27956 paid to female high school graduates women typically earn less than men of the same age as well the wage gap tends to widen as age increases according to census bureau data for 2003 female 1524 year olds were paid 79 as much as male 1524 year olds female 2544 year olds earned 67 as much as males in the same age group and female 4564 year olds were paid 59 as much as male 4564 year olds although these disparities between seemingly similar groups of men and women sometimes are taken as proof of sexbased wage discrimination they have not been adjusted to reflect gender differences in all characteristics such as differences in school course work among those with the same educational attainment1 that can legitimately affect relative wages the size of the malefemale wage gap has shrunk at slow and uneven pace over the years see table 1 in the 1960s and 1970s women employed yearround fulltime typically earned less than 60 cents for every dollar earned by men the gap narrowed steadily during the 1980s so that by the end of the decade women were being paid about 70 cents on the dollar according to the data series on annual earnings of yearround fulltime workers columns 2 and 5 and on weekly earnings of fulltime workers columns 3 and 6 the ratio of femaletomale wages fluctuated erratically during the 1990s and the ratios derived from the two series at times moved in different directions the extent of improvement in the gender wage gap that occurred during the 1980s does not appear to have been sustained during the 1990s more recently the trend seems largely positive and in 2003 women typically earned 7679 cents for every dollar earned by men despite substantial changes in womens labor force participation over the 40plus year period however the observed or unadjusted wage gap has narrowed by just 15 percentage points 1 portion of the wage gap between male and female college graduates is due to gender

data on fulltime workers note the wage gap based on annual data is wider than the wage gap based on weekly data because women generally work fewer weeks and hours per week than men in addition the annual data include selfemployed workers who have larger earnings differences by gender than the wage and salary workers covered by the weekly series regardless of the interval the gender wage gap would be wider if all workers were compared because relatively more women than men work parttime or partyear schedules na not available based on median annual earnings of all workers age 15 or older

weekly earnings of wage and salary workers age 16 or older employed fulltime crs4 reasons suggested for the wage gap the persistence of the gender wage gap has led to search for explanations basically two schools of thought have developed the human capital explanation has supplyside focus that is it looks at the personal characteristics of working women and men the sexsegregationintheworkplace or discrimination explanation has demandside focus that is it looks at the characteristics of the jobs in which women and men typically work the human capital model focuses on the voluntary choices made by women the discrimination model on the restrictions faced by women the human capital explanation one school of thought asserts that women earn less than men because of the division of labor within the family which results in productivity differences between the sexes2 anticipated family responsibilities are believed to influence womens decisions about the amount and kind of investment in educationtraining eg number of years of schooling subject matter of course work and general versus firm specific training as well as the length and pattern of time devoted to market work ie total years and timing of work experience intermittentcontinuous participation and parttimepartyear or fulltimefullyear schedules because women expect to spend fewer years than men in the labor force it is less profitable for women to invest in marketoriented skills according to the human capital explanation then womens smaller human capital investment lowers their productivity and hence their earnings relative to mens the discontinuous employment history of women is thought to further depress their relative wages3 because skills deteriorate with prolonged nonuse womens wages upon reentering the labor force initially are lower than their wages had been when they exited the labor force to bear and care for their children it is argued that women who anticipate moving in and out of the labor force choose to enter occupations having the least earnings penalty for intermittent employment that is occupations having the lowest rate of skill depreciation therefore women more so than men would prefer employment in jobs in which wage growth is not closely 2 jacob mincer and solomon polachek family investments in human capital earnings of women journal of political economy vol 82 part 2

voluntary choice4 women who do not expect to work continuously would want jobs that offer smaller reward for additional work experience ie jobs with flatter experienceearnings profile than would continuous workers human capital theory thus not only attempts to explain the relatively lower wages of women but also the difference in the occupational distributions of men and women the division of labor within the family could have more direct impact on womens wages than through its effect on human capital accumulation married women continue to be largely responsible for child care and other energyintensive household responsibilities because they consequently expend more effort than men on these family duties it arguably reduces the effort that women can put into market work if wages and market work intensity are positively related then married womens wages will be lower than those of married men even for workers having the same human capital endowments5 some analysts also believe that household duties affect married womens occupational preferences by encouraging them to seek lessdemanding jobs which allow them to economize on the energy they expend on market work6 researchers have tried to explain the existence of the wage gap by estimating the proportion that is due to differences in the average amounts of human capital accumulated by female and male workers the residual or unexplained portion of the pay differential is due to differences in the rates of return reward to working women and men with the same productivityrelated characteristics because productivity rarely can be directly observed commonly used proxies include amount and quality of formal education onthejob training hours of work job tenure and amount and continuity of labor market experience 4 the human capital explanation assumes that individuals preferenceschoices are voluntary it does not consider the possibility of prelabor market societal discrimination for example social normscustoms may constrain womens ideas about appropriate careers eg becoming nurse rather than doctor for more information on the relationship between socialization and occupational choice see margaret mooney marini and mary c brinton sex typing in occupational socialization in barbara f reskin ed sex segregation in the workplace trends explanations remedies washington dc national academy press 1984 in addition the access of workers to firmspecific onthejob training may be constrained by the organizations that employ them thus the amount of specific human capital accumulation may not entirely reflect individual preferences for more information on this point see don tomaskovicdevey and sheryl skaggs sex segregation labor process organization and gender earnings inequality american journal

of the gender pay gap indicates the existence of sexbased wage discrimination to others it indicates the limits of knowledge for the residual to solely reflect discrimination that is all earnings differences between the sexes not accounted for by differences in their human capital attributes then all relevant variables must be included in the empirical studies and the included variables must be measured accurately however productivity characteristics may be omitted from studies because they are difficult or impossible to measure eg motivation or are not included in particular data set eg field of specialization in school and they may be imprecisely measured eg use of potential rather than actual work experience based on its review of seven empirical studies the national academy of sciences found that less than onehalf of the wage gap between the sexes could be explained by human capital variables alone7 while this finding lends credence to some researchers questioning of the ability of the skill depreciation hypothesis to account for the wage gap over the longrun and to explain the different occupational distributions of women and men8 it also reflects the inherent difficulty of accurately measuring all productivityrelated characteristics in addition the finding gives support to claims that factors other than productivity affect wages including the presence and strength of unions the industry of employment and the size of firms the discrimination explanation in contrast to human capital theorists other researchers look to jobrelated variables as justification for the existence of the wage gap some focus particularly on the relationship between sex segregation in the workplace and womens comparatively low wages segregation encompasses the clustering of women and men in different occupational groups in different occupations within these larger groups in different jobs within occupations and in different industries or firms performing the same jobs sex segregation by occupation gender integration of occupations would be expected to somewhat narrow the pay gap given the relatively greater penalty women are estimated to experience

wellington changes in the malefemale wage gap crs7 relationship9 and indeed the gradual narrowing of the gender pay gap has occurred over period when the occupational distributions of women and men slowly have become more similar in the 1960s occupational segregation of the sexes declined somewhat due partly to the movement of men into femaleintensive jobs eg elementary school teachers librarians and social workers10 in the 1970s gender segregation decreased to greater extent due primarily to both men and women entering neutral occupations11 women also increased their presence in few maledominated occupations during the 1970s with the greatest inroads being made in the rapidly expanding occupational groups of executive administrative and managerial workers as well as professional workers the pattern of and changes in sex segregation by occupation are sensitive to the percentages that researchers utilize to define female dominated maledominated and neutral occupations12 the occupational distributions of women and men have kept converging over the ensuing decades but at progressively slower pace13 the index of segregation is the share of women men who would have to change jobs for their occupational employment distributions to be identical the index stood at about twothirds in each census year through 1970 it then dropped substantially from 677 in 1970 to 593 in 1980 the index at 520 showed further convergence by 1990 in the occupational employment patterns of women and men based upon current population survey data as opposed to decennial census data the index in 1990 was 564 its level of 539 in 1997 reflected continuing albeit slowed reduction in occupational sex segregation it should be noted that national data underlie the abovedescribed trend in occupational segregation most workers and organizations function in local labor markets and the degree of occupational segregation by gender may vary from one area to another research suggests that the size of the wage penalty for working in femaledominated jobs is related to the degree of occupational segregation that exists in given local labor market14 9 stephanie

forces vol 81 3 mar 2003 continued crs8 why does segregation depress womens relative wages the crowding hypothesis offers one explanation of why occupational segregation is associated with lower earnings for women relative to men15 according to this theory women are excluded from many jobs due to the discriminatory tastes of employers male employees or customers because women have access to only limited number of occupations the supply of labor to those occupations increases which in turn reduces the capitaltolabor ratio as result the productivity and wages of both women and men in the crowded femaleintensive occupations are depressed similarly productivity and wages in maledominated occupations are higher than they would otherwise be the case because the supply of labor to them is restricted discrimination it is asserted prevents labor mobility between the two sets of occupations which would equalize wages between male and female workers with the same human capital endowments the dual labor market theory offers another explanation for the relationship between occupational segregation and the wage gap16 according to this model the labor market has both primary and secondary sectors the former is comprised of jobs having opportunities for advancement offering good wages and working conditions and providing job security the latter is comprised of deadend jobs with low wages poor working conditions and substantial employee turnover because primary sector jobs require firms to invest in employee training wage differentials can arise from this market segmentation primary sector employers will want to hire stable workers so that they have some assurance of recouping their training costs since women historically have tended to move in and out of the labor force more often than men riskadverse employers who rely on their impressions of the relative job turnover of all men and women when deciding about hiring individual men and women ie statistical discrimination would prefer men over women for primary sector jobs the outcome some analysts claim is that women are relegated to the secondary lowpaying sector of the labor market it is suggested that limiting women to poor job opportunities could make their alleged high turnover selffulfilling prophecy because the jobs provide women little reason to stay with any one employer17 labor market discrimination could have other feedback effects if it discourages women from making human capital investments weakens their attachment to the labor force and provides economic incentives for the family to place priority on the husbands career18 as 14 continued and philip n cohen and matt l huffman individuals jobs and labor markets the devaluation of womens work american sociological review

variables then empirical studies that use these variables to explain the wage gap could understate discriminations impact rather than the gender wage gap being due to either womens choices or womens constraints the explanation likely is mutually reinforcing combination of human capital differences between the sexes and discrimination against working women some portion of the wage gap remains unexplained studies have attributed the wage gaps existence to characteristics of both workers and jobs typical job characteristics include occupational prestige supervisory status union status industry occupation and percent female in those studies that adjust for differences in the employment distributions of men and women at the detailed occupational level more of the gap is explained than in studies that adjust across major occupational groups19 this was the case among the seven empirical analyses reviewed by the national academy of sciences which took into account job as well as worker characteristics all but one of the studies that used detailed occupational classifications could explain between 30 and 71 of the malefemale pay differential20 the results of empirical studies reviewed by the national academy of sciences and other researchers indicate that the addition of jobrelated variables to human capital variables increases the ability to account for differences between the wages paid to women and men21 in one study for example taking human capital variables 18 continued men and work upper saddle river nj prentice hall 1998 p 214 hereafter cited as blau ferrer and winkler the economics of women men and work 19 the greater explanatory power of studies that use more detailed occupational classifications is due to the fact that employment and earnings differences between men and women can be quite large even within occupational groups for example us bureau of labor statistics data for 2003 show that within the major occupational group of professionals women were 82 of elementary and middle school teachers while men were 93 of electrical and electronics engineers among fulltime wage and salary workers female elementary and middle school teachers had median weekly earnings of 757 and male electrical and electronics engineers had median weekly earnings of 1348 these intraoccupational differences are obscured in studies that use highly aggregated occupational categories 20 treiman and hartmann women work and wages 21 other reviews of empirical work on the malefemale wage gap are included in cynthia b lloyd and beth t niemi

the gender pay gap unexplained while the addition of job related variables reduced the unexplained portion to 38022 according to the analysis if women had the same human capital attributes as men they would have earned 805 as much as men and if women had the same occupational industrial and union characteristics as men the adjusted ratio would have been 882 another study that included both human capital and jobrelated variables was able to account for somewhat more of the gender wage gap but it still left about 20 of the pay disparity unexplained23 generally even those studies that incorporate both types of variables leave substantial portion of the wage gap unexplained one of the job characteristics frequently included in empirical analyses such as those described above is occupation however to the extent that the difference in occupational distributions of women and men partly reflects employment discrimination or unequal occupational access then clearly this gender difference cannot legitimately be used to help explain the gender wage gap24 in other words the result of including occupation as an explanatory variable is underestimation of labor market discrimination to the degree that gender differences in occupational distributions reflect discrimination rather than personal preferences the feedback effect of discrimination on other variables commonly included in empirical analyses eg job tenure and unionization also would lead to understatement of discriminations impact on womens relative wages25 because neither discrimination nor productivity can be measured directly it is likely that debate will continue on precisely how much of the wage gap is due to each of them by extension disagreement also will continue about whether remedial action is needed and if so what kind of action 21 continued elsevier science publishers 1986 francine d blau and marianne ferber discrimination empirical evidence from the united states

responses crs11 reasons suggested for the trend in the wage gap as shown in table 1 the wage gap has narrowed gradually and sporadically over the years some assert that the intransigence of discrimination despite enforcement of equal pay and employment legislation accounts for the slow and fitful erosion of the wage gap others conclude that it is related to among other things the timing of market skill convergence between the sexes and to nongender specific changes in the labor market during much of the postworld war ii period the human capital endowments of women entering the labor force worked against contraction in the wage gap26 working mens educational attainment increased more than working womens as greater number of less educated than more educated women joined the labor force through the 1970s in addition the average work experience of employed women was held down by the entrance into the labor force of many women who had little or prior experience it is thus argued that the lack of skill convergence between working women and men during the 1970s kept the wage gap fairly constant despite decreases in occupational and industrial segregation over the period27 the 1980s rapid improvement in womens relative wages the situation changed in the 1980s when the work experience and schooling of women increased relative to men about 25 of the 1 per year reduction in the wage gap between 1976 and 1989 can be ascribed to the increase in the amount of womens work experience compared to mens and another 3540 to the rise in the monetary return reward to an additional year of experience for women compared to men28 the relative gain in the level and reward to womens educational attainment accounted for significant but smaller share of the wage gaps contraction29 in terms of schooling level the incidence of college graduates among female labor force participants grew more than among male participants30 while the financial payoff for an additional year of schooling increased for all workers the 26 james p smith and michael p ward womens wages and work in the twentieth century santa monica ca the rand corporation 1984 27 fields judith and edward n wolff

labor economics vol 11 1 part 1 jan 1993 hereafter cited as oneill and polachek why the gender gap in wages narrowed in the 1980s 29 results from another study also suggest that the primary factor in the wage gaps narrowing was increases in womens average levels of work experience rather than of educational attainment wellington changes in the malefemale wage gap 19761985 30 between 1992 and 2002 for example the share of working women aged 2564 with bachelors degrees rose by almost 7 percentage points from 250 to 315 while the share of comparably aged working men with bachelors degrees rose by lesser 4 percentage points from 275 to 317 us bureau of labor statistics women in the labor force databook report 973 feb 2004 crs12 greater increase among women may be related to changes in their college schooling characteristics31 another 20 of the decrease in the wage gap can be attributed to the decline in wages of bluecollar workers predominantly male occupational group compared to whitecollar workers32 thus some nongenderspecific factors changed the labor market in different ways for men and women during the 1980s for example decreases in unionization and employment shifts by industry eg away from manufacturing depressed mens wages more than womens thereby narrowing the earnings differential between the two33 increasingly unfavorable changes in the wage structure for lowpaid workers over the period also seemingly harmed men more than women with greater widening of male wage inequality and growing returns to intellectual visavis physical skill strength one economist has argued that intellectual skills are less equally distributed by gender than physical skills and as result growth in the relative value of intellectual skills will increase wage inequality among men while simultaneously increasing the relative earnings of women who are assumed to be more intellectually than physically endowed compared to men34 others similarly have advanced the notion that an inverse relationship exists between trends in wage inequality among men and in the pay gap between the sexes35 the unexplained portion of the wage gap decreased during the 1980s as well interpretations of this finding are ambiguous however the improvement in womens unmeasured labor market attributes or decline in discrimination or some combination of the two could have reduced the residual36 as womens relative level of measured productivity characteristics increased over the decade eg work experience and occupational upgrading it is possible that unaccounted for personal characteristics eg work expectations and job motivation also improved among women compared to men as result of womens increased commitment to the labor force and enhancement of their job skills during the 1980s it is possible that employers rationale for statistical discrimination may have diminished as well 31 in study of young workers with college educations it was estimated that changes in college major and grades accounted for much of the decrease in the groups gender wage gap while changes in the distribution of college majors among women contributed to the narrowing of the pay differential more of the narrowing may be explained by increasing monetary rewards to womens skills compared to mens skills within given major college grades was the measure of skills used in the

gap narrowed further during the 1990s it did so to lesser extent that during the prior decade according to one study when human capital variables alone are taken into account the ratio of womens compared to mens wages rose from 708 in 1979 to 819 in 1989 and then remained basically unchanged in 1998 at 812 when the specification was expanded to include job related factors the ratios were higher but the trend was the same 816 in 1979 and 910 in both 1989 and 199837 differences in work experience by gender decreased less in the 1990s than in the 1980s but it appears that relative increases in womens educational attainment played much larger role in shrinking the pay gap during the 1990s than during the preceding decade consequently work experience and schooling were estimated to have had similar impact over the 20year period when considered jointly more favorable changes for women in both occupational upgrading and deunionization occurred in the 1980s compared to the 1990s women moved into managerial and professional occupations and out of clerical and service occupations at about the same rate in both decades womens representation in bluecollar occupations did not expand to the same degree in the 1990s however as men more often lostleft those jobs during the 1980s similarly gender differences in the pace of deunionization were larger in the 1980s than in the following decade but unexplained gender differences in wages appear to have been the main contributor to the slowed convergence in womens and mens earnings during the 1990s as against the 1980s one unmeasured characteristic that might have contributed to the slowdown is hours spent performing housework as previously discussed it has been argued that housework decreases the amount of effort put into ones job and the gender difference in this measure decreased much more quickly in the 1980s than the 1990s if employers perceived that women had made greater commitment to the labor force more in the former than the latter decade it could have prompted reduction in statistical discrimination against women again more substantially in the 1980s as compared to the 1990s in addition the occupational upgrading women experienced in the 1980s put more of them in positions that might have been subject to the glass ceiling which could have impeded their wage advancement in the following decade it has further been suggested that shifts in labor demand associated with for example technological change eg computerization were considerably more beneficial for women in the 1980s than in the 1990s 37 francine d blau and lawrence m kahn the us gender pay gap in the 1990s slowing convergence nber working paper 10853 oct 2004 crs14 policy responses policy responses to the gender wage gap depend upon where the roots of the pay differential are thought to lie their effectiveness in raising the wages of women relative to men depends in part upon how much of the gap really is associated with each causal factor the explanations and remedies presented below are not necessarily mutually exclusive for example both socialization and employment discrimination might affect womens occupational distributions and wages and consequently multiple remedies would be appropriate explanations and remedies some think that even before women enter the labor market their career aspirations are shaped by societal factors which individuals such as parents or peers and institutions such as schools or the media inculcate in youngsters38 proponents of this viewpoint would support measures directed at schools eg title ix of the 1972 education amendments 1976 vocational education amendment and womens educational equity act and at acquainting girls with role models employed in broad range of jobs eg ms foundation for women initiated take our daughters to work day in 1995 others conclude that the wage gap is due to measured and unmeasured human capital differences between the sexes they would argue that additional government intervention in the labor market is unnecessary because ongoing relative improvements in womens productivity characteristics will cause the wage gap to shrink further with women continuing to opt for market work as major lifetime activity human capital theory suggests that women will increasingly make occupational choices that differ from those they made in the past which should in turn raise their relative wages but as nondiscriminatory legitimate reasons for the gender pay disparity are unlikely to change radically in the near future unless the roles of women and men in the home become more nearly identical an unadjusted gender gap may be with us for quite while39 still others believe that labor market discrimination in part manifested through sex segregation in the workplace is responsible for the portion of the wage gap that cannot be explained by gender differences in productivityrelated characteristics policy responses that these observers would support range from improved enforcement of antidiscrimination laws and regulations by the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and the office of federal contract compliance programs40 to government dissemination of information about and provision of 38 this has been referred to as societal or prelabor market discrimination 39 oneill the gender gap in wages circa 2000 p 314 40 one

21 4 oct 2003 estimated that continued crs15 training in comparatively highpaying nontraditional jobs for women41 to employers paying their female and male employees in comparable jobs the same wages comparable worth the last approach has commonly been referred to as comparable worth comparable worth would extend the current mandate that an employer pay equal wages to workers in the same or substantially same jobs in firm to an employer paying equal wages to workers in equivalent jobs in firm equivalent jobs typically have been defined as those whose performance involves commensurate skill eg education and training requirements effort responsibility and working conditions the idea motivating comparable worth is that the size of workers paycheck should be related to job content and not related to the predominant sex of employees in an occupation comparable worth proponents argue that some jobs are undervalued that is pay relatively low wages because they are largely held by women some also believe that the kinds of skills traditionally exercised by women eg nurturing social skills are valued less in wage determination than are traditionally male skills eg physical or supervisory skills42 supporters of this viewpoint thus have concluded that marketset wages are tainted by genderbased discrimination rather than continuing to rely on supply and demand conditions in the labor market to determine wages comparable worth advocates have proposed that single job evaluation study of all jobs or key positions in firm be conducted so they can be compared with each other in terms of such attributes as skill effort responsibility and working conditions employers would then raise the wages of workers in all jobs or in femaledominated jobs deemed to be underpaid on the basis of the evaluation ie jobs having wages below other jobs with the same total scores on the attributes included in the evaluation the comparable worth approach to wage determination has made the most headway in state and local governments public sector unions often have played large role in organizations making comparable worth pay adjustments 40 continued about half of the gender wage gap is due to women having lower wages than men in narrowly defined occupations in the same firms which suggests that enforcement of the equal pay act might be effective in raising womens relative earnings

evidence new york walter gruyter 1992 p 40 hereafter cited as england comparable worth crs16 the usual function of unions to bargain with management over wages has prompted some to suggest that the collective bargaining process may be more effective and practical means of narrowing the gender pay gap than relying on legislative or judicial action43 however unions might be reluctant to press for comparable worth pay raises if they thought it would jeopardize membership solidarity this could occur for example if workers in jobs determined to be overpaid through an evaluation were downgraded ie had their pay cut or red circled ie had their wage frozen at its current level or raised at slower rate than that of underpaid workers in addition private sector unions have shown much less interest in the issue than have public sector unions and only about 15 of all workers are represented by labor unions congressional action comparable worth was considered by the 98th 99th and 100th congresses the primary focus of legislation introduced during the 1980s was the wagesetting practices of the federal government while there was considerable debate on the issue legislation was enacted see appendix for legislative history covering this period comparable worth as remedy for gender pay differentials continued to generate great deal of controversy in the 1990s when the 102nd congress subsequently took up civil rights legislation pl 102166 the civil rights act of 1991 the version considered by the house hr 1 aroused dissent partly because some members believed section 102 pay equity technical assistance to be stalking horse for eventually allowing comparable worth claims under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 that is allowing job evaluations finding of unequal pay for equally rated female and maledominated jobs to be used as evidence in trial to prove the presence of sexbased wage discrimination44 the decade also marked shift in the focus of comparable worth which continues today45 rather than seeking to apply the approach to the wagesetting practices of the federal government alone proponents have tried to extend comparable worth to all employers subject to the fair labor standards act flsa predominantly firms in the private sector the fair pay act which has been introduced in each congress since the 103rd would require that employees within an flsacovered firm who work in dissimilar but equivalent jobs when viewed as composite of skill effort responsibility and working conditions be paid equal wages regardless of sex race or national origin the bill thus would expand the standard in the equal pay act of 1963 epa an amendment to the flsa which makes it illegal for covered employers to pay different wages to men and women who 43 marvin j

jobs would continue to be those based on seniority or merit system or system linking pay to the quantity or quality of output however the bill would longer allow any factor other than sex to be legitimate reason for wage differences as it currently is under the epa the epa prohibition against achieving its equal pay standard by reducing the wage of any employee would remain in force in contrast the paycheck fairness act which also has been introduced in several congresses would have the us department of labor issue job evaluation guidelines based on objective criteria eg education skill and decisionmaking responsibility for voluntary use by employers occupational desegregation as remedy to the wage gap the comparable worth approach to wage determination is endorsed by those who believe that the prohibition of gender discrimination in the equal pay act of 1963 title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 and eo 11246 is not sufficient to reduce the male female pay differential because of the intransigence of sex segregation in the workplace they point out that even if one thought workplace integration were an adequate remedy to the wage gap it would take an extremely long time to achieve pay equity given the very slowly growing similarity in womens and mens occupational distributions see earlier discussion in this report on this point comparable worth adherents further observe that occupational desegregation as remediation approach has its own drawbacks since the influx of women continues to be largest in those occupations where it began some initially male jobs have now tipped and become disproportionately female thus further increases in the proportion of women in these jobs increase rather than decrease segregation46 because occupational desegregation and job desegregation are not necessarily the same proponents also contend that the increased occupational similarities between the sexes may overstate integrations potential impact on relative wages within the occupation of bus drivers for example women tend to hold parttime lowpaying jobs driving school buses while men tend to hold relatively highpaying jobs driving buses for city transit systems it thus is asserted that the growing presence of women in nontraditional occupations may have unexpected outcomes namely resegregation as well as ghettoization with women and men having the same occupational titles but working in different specialties which limit its ability to reduce the wage gap47 comparable worth advocates point out that occupational desegregation does not address directly the low wages of workers in femaledominated occupations48 they question whether it is reasonable to expect numerous women in the middle or near 46 england comparable worth p 16 47 barbara f

forgone wages and benefits like pensions as well as educationalretraining expenses comparable worth policy would raise the wages of workers in traditionally female occupations who are unable or unwilling to change jobs critics of comparable worth respond that the wage gap has in fact been narrowing because the productivityrelated characteristics of working women have come to more closely resemble those of men some observers claim that employment discrimination rather than wage discrimination accounts for womens depressed earnings if more nontraditional jobs were open to women the wage gap would shrink 1 because female entrants to these occupations would receive higher pay and 2 because the supply of labor to traditionally female jobs would decrease thereby raising the wages of workers in those positions according to both these perspectives comparable worth is not directed at the real issues namely gender differences in human capital qualifications and discrimination in hiring and promotions while comparable worth opponents consequently might support more active enforcement of current antidiscrimination laws and regulations they see need for further government intervention in the markets wagesetting process job evaluation as wagesetting mechanism supporters of comparable worth believe that discrimination results in misallocation of labor by steering equally productive women and men into different jobs and paying women relatively lower wages firms operating in such labor market produce more of the goodsservices that use underpaid female workers and less of the goodsservices that use overpaid male workers than they would if the market were free of gender bias comparable worth advocates therefore reason that action is needed to correct the market wage to remove the distortions caused by discrimination that is to bring wages closer to what they would be in nondiscriminating market thus increasing efficiency and productivity49 according to this viewpoint it is discrimination rather than comparable worth policy that interferes with the optimal functioning of the labor market job evaluation is the mechanism that comparable worth advocates usually propose to use for both redefining the status hierarchy of jobs as it relates to relative wages50 and for adjusting market wages 49 janice peterson the challenge of comparable worth an institutionalist view journal of economic issues vol 24 2 june 1990 p 607 50 it has been suggested that the amount of controversy over comparable worth relates to its being about more than wages in the view of some individuals comparable worth challenges basic cultural assumptions about the relative value of the activities of different groups in society it also would redistribute not only economic resources but also labor market power to women workers ronnie j steinberg want of harmony perspectives on wage discrimination and comparable worth pp 2425 in helen remick ed comparable worth and wage discrimination technical possibilities and political realities philadelphia pa temple university press 1984 crs19 this is the fundamental problem with comparable worth according to its critics namely the substitution of job evaluation for market conditions in the wage determination process wages differ not only because different jobs require different levels of skill effort or responsibility but also because of the inherent scarcity of certain skills and talents relative to societys demand for such skills and talents51 some jobs may have high valueinuse as measured by the inputs of skill effort and responsibility but they may not warrant high wage ie valueinexchange for labor services if there is plentiful supply of workers to perform them52 because of varying occupational supplydemand conditions legitimate non discriminatory pay differentials can exist between jobs that evaluations conclude are of equal value to employers moreover opponents assert that requirement to equalize wages of jobs having the same total scores on evaluations would not allow the market to efficiently allocate labor across occupations if sewing machine operators wages were raised based on job evaluation findings for example the higher wages would prompt more workers than otherwise to enter the occupation because the demand for sewing machine operators did not change however firms would be unwilling to hire these new entrants and unemployment would increase the wage determined by job evaluation would have sent an incorrect signal to workers with misallocation of labor resources the result further if demand for sewing machine operators were to subsequently increase comparable worth would prevent firms from using higher wages to effectively signal this to workers if they wanted to offer higher wages to attract more sewing machine operators firms would also have to offer higher wages for other jobs found to be of equal and higher value even though there was an ample supply of labor at the lower wage for the other jobs these inefficiencies and the likelihood of different firms job evaluations producing varying ratings for the same occupations have led some critics to predict additional government intervention once comparable worth becomes the law of the land53 it is suggested that one form of federal intervention might be the development and administration of national job evaluation system because the government would be the only entity capable of reconciling possibly discriminatory differences between firms in their evaluations results some sort of regulatory or adjudicatory process could well be needed to at the least resolve disputes over the specifics of individual firms evaluations and to decide when evaluations should be revised to reflect changes over time in job content another form of intervention might be 51 john raisian michael p ward and finish welch pay equity and comparable worth contemporary policy issues apr

could longer be used to attract workers to specific jobs under comparable worth system the government might have to encourage or direct people into occupations in order to resolve imbalances between supply and demand comparable worth proponents respond that they have not endorsed national job evaluation system and that it is not unusual for some economists and business groups to make dire predictions about the effects of legislation which would increase government regulation of the labor market in addition supporters claim that comparable worth policy is not intended to measure the inherent value of jobs but rather to eliminate the wage disparities between femaledominated and male dominated jobs that cannot be justified by differences in productivity requirements as to the use of job evaluations in setting wages comparable worth adherents contend that many firms have long used them and that wages set by market conditions actually are incorporated in job evaluations depending on the type of system used market wages have varying degrees of influence on the weights ie relative importance accorded the job attributes in evaluations in fact this is one of the problems with relying on job evaluations to achieve comparable worth according to its supporters they find this drawback to be especially egregious at firms which conduct separate evaluations of female and maledominated job families eg clerical workers and bluecollar workers respectively it is claimed that the use of multiple pay plans within firm is the single most important reason that the common practice of job evaluation has done little to close the sex gap in pay54 for this reason comparable worth advocates not only call for unbiased job evaluations but also for the same evaluation system to be applied across all job families within an establishment the job evaluation tool also has been criticized for its complexity and subjectivity55 even before an evaluation is begun definitions of firm eg an establishment within multiestablishment enterprise without regard to proximity of other locations and of female as well as maledominated jobs eg composed 60 or 70 by one sex must be made after developing job descriptions for all positions within firm the evaluators must select the job attributes or compensable factors to be analyzed then for each job included in the analysis they must assign numerical value to each of the chosen attributes in order to develop total score for each job the evaluators also must determine weights for the individual factors for example they must decide whether jobs skill component is more important ie given more weight than jobs supervisory component after having gone through these several steps final decision must be made about how to relate scores to wages and whose wages should be adjusted eg should the wages of all underpaid jobs be raised or just underpaid femaledominated jobs should the wages of overpaid jobs be reduced frozen or given smaller increases and what level should wages be raised to the average of all jobs or maledominated jobs with the same total points or some proportion of the difference between female and male dominated jobs with the same total points comparable worth opponents argue that 54 england comparable worth p 219 55 raisian ward and welch pay equity and comparable worth crs21 the decisions required at each stage of this complex procedure provide an opportunity for the biases of evaluators and others to affect the outcome supporters of comparable worth acknowledge the possibility of bias by noting that job evaluations as typically conducted often have favored mens work over womens work sources of bias against women in job evaluations include writing job descriptions that omit some compensable factors typical of womens jobs giving lower ratings to womens jobs on the factors that are included weighting factors typical of mens jobs eg unsafe working environment more heavily than those typical of womens jobs eg finger dexterity and using separate evaluations of job families predominated by men and by women because of these practices comparable worth proponents want biasfree evaluations to be conducted the policys detractors suggest however that what actually could occur is the substitution of one set of biases for another the economic effects of implementing comparable worth critics of comparable worth expect that its efforts to raise wages in femaledominated occupations could harm women through disemployment if employers must raise wages of femaledominated jobs deemed to be underpaid by job evaluations employment in those occupations will decrease unless demand is totally inelastic ie demand does not change in response to change in the wage the higher labor costs resulting from comparable worth pay raises could lead firms to replace workers in previously underpaid positions with now cheaper laborsaving technology in addition the resultant increase in production costs could prompt decrease in output and total employment or an increase in prices to consumers the outcome of implementing comparable worth under this scenario would be both reduced employment in traditionally female jobs and higher wages for the women still employed in those fields opponents of comparable worth also expect its implementation would cause the wages of some women to fall this is because some sectors or groups eg small firms or parttime workers often are not covered when law is enacted56 specifically with regard to comparable worth policy it is more likely that medium and large firms rather than small firms eg those with fewer than 100 employees would be covered because numerous different job titles are needed to conduct job evaluation and because the cost of using job evaluations decreases as firm size increases57 women who either were displaced from or were unable to get jobs in the part of the economy covered by comparable worth legislation would increase the supply of labor in the uncovered sector thereby putting downward pressure on their own wages as well as the wages of other uncovered workers with whom they would most directly compete eg other women 56 for example the comparable worth policy in ontario canada exempts private sector firms with fewer than 10 employees among covered firms those with fewer than 100 employees are treated somewhat differently than larger firms us general accounting office pay equity experiences of canada and the province of ontario ggd9427br nov 1993 57 richard s smith comparable worth limited coverage and the exacerbation of inequality industrial and labor relations review vol 41 2 jan 1988 crs22 the results of one analysis suggest that if comparable worth were implemented with small firm exemption it could well help higherpaid women more often employed by large firms and harm lowerpaid women more often employed in small firms moreover it appears that occupational segregation is highest in the sector least likely to be the target of comparable worth policies and lowest in the sector most likely to be covered58 comparable worth advocates concede that there could be tradeoffs for elevating wages in traditionally female occupations but as this is true of many policy initiatives they do not consider it an adequate reason for maintaining the status quo how much comparable worth actually would cost depends in part on how many workers are displaced how quickly and what happens to them at present we simply do not know how severe these problems would be59 some believe that indirect benefits might flow from comparable worths direct costs women longer able to get traditionally female jobs after the upward adjustment of the jobs wages might leave the safe harbor of the female occupations and consider competing for jobs heretofore filled with males60 while men might be more attracted to the now higher paying traditionally female jobs the implementation of comparable worth might thus encourage occupational desegregation comparable worth also might raise womens aggregate compensation as they expand their presence in traditionally higher paid male dominated jobs and in now relatively better paid femaledominated jobs61 comparable worths potential impact on the wage gap comparable worth is intended to eliminate pay differences between jobs within firm that are related to an occupations sex composition given its intrafirm focus the policy will not affect the portion of the gender wage gap that is due to other manifestations of workplace segregation including differences between the firms eg large versus small or industries eg manufacturing versus services in which women and men typically work62 in order to estimate the potential effect on the wage gap of enacting comparable worth legislation then studies should control for job characteristics as well as measures of productivity in order to separate their impact from that of occupational segregation generally the more variables included in empirical analyses of the causes of the wage gap the smaller the portion related to an occupations gender composition 58 ibid p 237 59 blau ferber and winkler

differentials and the gender wage gap industrial and labor relations review vol 49 1 oct 1995 3138 of the observed wage gap may be explained by differences in womens and mens employment distribution by industry and by differences in their pattern of interindustry wage differentials crs23 studies that use different units of analysis eg occupations or individuals also estimate varying magnitudes for the wage penalty caused by working in female dominated rather than maledominated occupations analyses that take into account the industry of employment produce smaller estimates of the effect of occupational segregation on the wage gap than do other studies results also can vary because of differences in time periods analyzed for these reasons studies have produced wide range of estimates for the effect of an occupations gender composition on the wage gap 0 to 42 according to one review63 given the breadth of this range empirical research conducted to date provides little guidance as to the potential impact of comparable worth policy on the gender wage gap more definitive answer about the potential magnitude of comparable worths impact on the wage gap also is lacking based on studies of state and local governments implementation of the policy64 analyses conducted before the policy went into effect in five state governments and in san jose california predicted that womens relative wages would rise by 15 the researchers assumed that when implemented the policy would increase the pay in femaledominated jobs to the pay in maledominated jobs deemed equivalent through job evaluation in reality however most of the governments included in the two studies raised the wages of all underpaid jobs which likely made the actual increase in womens relative wages less than the predicted increase other studies examined the effect of comparable worth on the wage gap after the policy had been implemented65 while iowas comparable worth policy also called for raising the wages of all not just femaledominated underpaid jobs it originally called for pay cuts as well in light of union objections however compromise was reached which gave smaller wage increases to underpaid jobs in return for pay cuts study of the actual experience with comparable worth in iowa found not surprisingly that womens relative pay rose by just 1466 in minnesota by contrast most of the comparable worth pay adjustments went to women on the states payroll and particularly to workers in femaledominated jobs mainly women by definition one study estimated that the state governments comparable worth policy was responsible for almost 12 increase in womens relative pay67 thus the manner in which comparable worth is implemented can 63 elaine sorensen comparable worth is it worthy policy princeton nj

in narrowing the gender wage gap misgivings have arisen about how comparable worth has been implemented in some instances because of the influence this can have on the achievement of pay equity the pay for points approach would in theory adjust the wages of all jobs based on their job evaluation score with overpaid jobs having their pay cut and underpaid jobs having their pay raised because of objections from representatives of workers whose pay is to be cut however this approach typically is compromised such that underpaid jobs receive smaller wage increases than they otherwise would have and ones pay is reduced this compromise pay for points approach has three serious weaknesses 1 it does not achieve the basic purpose of comparable worth to eliminate the underpayment of womens work 2 it does not target pay adjustments to femaledominated jobs and 3 it is overly dependent on the job evaluation system this approach cannot achieve equal pay for comparable worth because it relies on pay cuts to achieve this aim but these cuts are never enacted by targeting all underpaid jobs for pay adjustments this approach increases the cost of comparable worth and undercuts the gains to female workers finally it relies primarily on the job evaluation system to determine salaries system that is known to be subjective and arbitrary comparable worth policy only needs to eliminate the variation in wages that is negatively correlated with the femaleness of job once job requirements are taken into account this approach tries to eliminate all wage variation once job requirements are accounted for68 it appears that political considerations can erode comparable worths ability to raise womens relative wages because the interests of broader constituency come into play69 as with other policies employers may be able to avoid comparable worths mandate and thereby both limit its cost to them as well as its effectiveness as remedy for the gender wage gap70 if comparable worth policy were not universally applied covered employers could contract out the functions of femaledominated jobs to uncovered firms similarly they might increase their use of parttime or temporary workers if coverage did not extend to these groups possibly jobs could be redefined in order to downgrade femaledominated jobs by shifting their more complex tasks to already higher paid employees eg have managers assume the 67 continued of comparable worth difference of some 420 jobs male employment would have risen by 39 without the policy instead of 29 with the policy difference of about 160 jobs number of other

raisian ward and welch pay equity and comparable worth crs25 word processing functions of their secretaries jobs might also be redefined in order to raise the wages of particular incumbents whom employers wanted to retain concluding remarks whether the proponents of the human capital explanation or the discrimination explanation are correct about the underlying reasons for the gender wage gap the same end result is expected according to standard economic analysis namely depressed wages whether women limit their fields of work in order to fulfill family responsibilities or discrimination confines women to certain jobs the markets wage response is the same the abundant supply of women to certain jobs relative to employer demand will prompt firms to use more women than otherwise and in hiring each new worker spread complementary inputs eg capital more thinly this in turn decreases the productivity of workers in femaledominated jobs and consequently their earnings in neither the human capital nor the crowding model are the wages of predominantly female jobs necessarily depressed because employers unconsciously decide that particular jobs should be devalued that is worth relatively low wages rather it is the presence of numerous qualified persons ready to fill those jobs that removes the firms incentive to offer higher wages in order to attract more workers or to keep from losing workers already on the payroll regardless of the reason for pay differentials they are economically desirable from the perspective of an efficiently functioning labor market wage differentials encourage workers especially new entrants to seek higher paying jobs71 and they encourage firms to use more of the plentiful source of labor if comparable worth were mandated however both these incentives would disappear with wage differentials between equivalent female and maledominated jobs gone the strongest motivation for women to overcome discrimination in the long run would be lost in addition female unemployment would increase in the short run without wage differentials to encourage workers to exit from or not enter crowded traditionally female jobs comparable worth also would adversely affect the allocation of labor among occupations in which wage differentials might not be due to discrimination while the advocates of comparable worth have plausible and empirically supportable case that discrimination is responsible for substantial portion of the malefemale wage gap the policy itself offers limited solution ie raising the wages of workers in traditionally female jobs which cuts two ways with respect to gender equity 1 increasing unemployment in femaledominated fields and 2 reducing womens incentive to further integrate maledominated jobs these economic costs may be worth incurring but that is judgment for policymakers to make 71 even if women are traditionally excluded from higher paying jobs the incentive still exists for them to try to obtain better positions to the extent that women encounter discrimination in this effort it is of the type that current law exists to remedy crs26 appendix hr 5680 passed the house in the 98th congress but became stalled in the senate title i of the bill the federal pay equity and management improvement act of 1984 specified that study of the federal classification systems be conducted to see if they discriminated against women s 958 the civil service amendments act of 1984 omitted such study conference committee was appointed after passage of s 958 the senate subsequently voted down an amendment to continuing resolution that would have adopted hr 5680 during consideration of the amendment compromise was reached on pay equity study in return for passage of bill to reform the merit pay system and to reorganize the senior executive service it was agreed that the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office would report on methodologies for conducting pay equity study of the federal classification systems hearings would be held on the gao report and legislation would be introduced to authorize pay equity study based on gaos findings gao subsequently issued options for conducting pay equity study of federal pay and classification systems gaoggd8537 it discussed two approaches for determining why some female federal employees earn less than male federal employees an economic analysis to measure and explain gender wage differentials due to employee characteristics eg educational attainment and seniority and job content analysis to examine job characteristics eg skill level and working conditions in gaos view an effective pay equity study would use both analyses then during the 99th congress house and senate committees held hearings on the gao report the house committee on post office and civil service reported out hr 3008 the federal equitable pay practices act of 1985 it would have established commission on equitable pay practices which was required to contract with private consultant chosen from list of experts drawn up by gao to conduct pay equity study employing both an economic analysis and job evaluation the consultants study and commission recommendations were then to be forwarded to the president and the congress the house passed the bill as amended and referred it to the senate committee on governmental affairs in the senate the subcommittee on civil service held hearings on similar bill s 519 the federal employee antisexdiscrimination in compensation act of 1985 and s 5 the pay equity act of 1985 was proposed as well hr 387 the federal equitable pay practices act of 1988 was introduced during the 100th congress and was passed by the house it was identical to the 99th congress hr 3008 s 5 the pay equity act of 1987 also was reintroduced but in substantially revised form it was broad bill requiring that the equal employment opportunity commission develop guidelines for eliminating discriminatory wagesetting practices in the federal government and among federal contractors as well as furnish report detailing its activities under the equal pay act and commission on compensation equity to select consultant who would conduct pay equity study of the governments pay system the study included in s 552 the federal employee compensation equity act of 1987 was similar to s 5s study with both calling for conducting an economic analysis and job evaluation the senate took action on this legislation for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98278
