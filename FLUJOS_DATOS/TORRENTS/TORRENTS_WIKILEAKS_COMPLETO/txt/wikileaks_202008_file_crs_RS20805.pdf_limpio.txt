legislative attorney american law division summary this report addresses inquiries from congressional offices for information on the federal statutes regulations and guidelines concerning restrictions on the acceptance of personal gifts by the president of the united states while the president like any other officer or employee of the federal government is prohibited from receiving personal gifts from foreign governments and from official foreign interests without the consent of congress he is generally free to accept personal gifts from the american public most of the regulatory restrictions on the acceptance of gifts by federal officials from socalled prohibited sources are not applicable to the president of the united states although the president may not solicit gifts from such sources the president in any event may receive gifts that are given on the basis of personal friendship when personal gifts accepted by the president or his family exceed certain amount those gifts are required to be publicly disclosed in financial disclosure reports filed by the president the president remains subject to the bribery and illegal gratuities law which prohibits the receipt of gift or of anything of value when that receipt or agreement to receive is connected to the performance or nonperformance of an official act while federal laws have long prohibited corrupt payments to federal officials such as those in the form of bribes from favorseekers in the private sector1 the regulation and limitation on mere gifts to federal officials from domestic sources where there is not necessarily any bargain reciprocity compensation or favor explicitly sought understood or agreed to are of more recent vintage2 the ethical issues and problemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20805crs2 2 continued governmentwide rule on gifts was promulgated in 1965 by president johnson in executive order 11222 superceded by eo 12674 april 12 1989 president bush and modified by eo 12731 the current

cfr 735202 of gifts to public officials may arise because of the tacit or subtle influence or feelings of gratitude and appreciation that public official may feel towards his or her benefactors that might sway his decisions and erode the officials sense of mission to the public in favor of loyalt to his private benefactors and patrons3 this concern of course must be balanced to some extent with the normal expected and innocent expressions of gratitude from the public the realities of friendships and personal relationships as well as the requirements of protocol and etiquette in an officers official and ceremonial duties and functions with respect to the president the exigencies of the office and considerations of protocol courtesy and etiquette have led to an express exemption from the general limitation on the acceptanc of private gifts which might apply to other officers and employees in the executive branch of the united states government4 general gift limitations in federal law the current restriction under federal statutory law on the receipt or solicitation of gifts by federal employees and officials was enacted as part of the ethics reform act of 19895 the underlying statutory restriction enacted in 1989 in many respects merely codified similar gift standards which had been applicable to executive branch employees by way of executive orders and regulations since 19656 the current law codified at 5 usc 7353a prohibits any federal officer or employee from soliciting or receiving any gift of any amount from prohibited source that is from someone who is seeking action from doing business with or is regulated by ones agency or whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of ones official duties 5 usc 7353 except as permitted by subsection b member of congress or officer or employee of the executive legislative or judicial branch shall solicit or accept anything of value from person 1 seeking official action from

gifts of minimal value under 20 incidental food or drinks at events bona fide awards normal loans prizes honorary degrees continued2 whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the individuals official duties the statute expressly provides however that the designated supervisory ethics agencies in the government may make exceptions to this general restriction and may issue regulations setting out circumstances under which gifts may be accepted7 thus the rules of the senate as interpreted by the senate select committee on ethics operate as the regulations and exceptions under the gift law for senators and senate employees the rules of the house and the interpretations of the house committee on standards of official conduct operate as the regulations and exceptions for members and employees of the house and in the executive branch it is the regulations and interpretations of the office of government ethics which apply to executive branch officials executive regulations on acceptance of gifts the regulations of the office of government ethics oge set out the guidelines and standards for recei pt of gifts by officials in the executive branch of government8 the executive branch gift regulations generally follow the statutory prohibitions which restrict the solicitation or acceptance of gifts by executive branch employees from prohibited source and further restrict the solicitation or receipt of any gifts that are given because of the employees official position9 the regulations at 5 cfr 2635202 state 5 cfr 2635202 general prohibitions except as provided in this subpart an employee shall not directly or indirectly solicit or accept gift 1 from prohibited source or 2 given because of an employees official position prohibited sources under the regulations are persons seeking official action from the employees agency those who do business or are seeking to do business with the agency those whose activities are regulated by the empl oyees agency persons whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance of the employees official duties or an organization majority of whose members fit the above categories10 while an official may not receive gift given because of his official position11 an executive branch official may accept gift without limitation when it is clear that the gift is motivated by family relationship or personal friendship rather than the position of the employee12 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20805crs4 12 continued pensions generally available discounts and

generally exempt by regulation from the statutory gift restrictions and the regulations promulgated by the office of government ethics as to the receipt of gifts13 under these regulations the president is expressly exempt from the broad restrictions on receiving or accepting gifts from prohibited sources or gifts given because of his official position and thus may accept gifts from the general public even from prohi bited sources or gifts given because of his official position as long as the president does not solicit or coerce the offering of gifts from such sources14 nor accept gift in return for an official act15 the exception for the president and vice president in the oge regulations states because of the considerations relating to the conduct of their offices including those of protocol or etiquette the president and the vice president may accept any gift on his own behalf or on behalf of any family member provided that such acceptance does not violate 2635202c1 or 2 18 usc 201b or 201c3 or the constitution of the united states16 in promulgating its rules and exceptions the office of government ethics has noted that the ceremonial and other public duties of the president and vice president make it impractical to subject them to standards that require an analysis of every gift offered17 the regulations and the exemptions indicate that the president is still subject to the prohibition on receiving gift in return for being influenced in the performance of an official act18 and is still subject to the instruction not to solicit or coerce the offering of gift under 5 cfr 2635202 c2 it appears that the continued restriction on solicitation in 2635202c2 would reach only solicitations of gifts restricted by the general rule that is from prohibited source or concerning gifts given because of the employees official position19 if the 2635202c2 caveat to the exemption extended to solicitations of gifts from any source even gifts from those who are not prohibited sources then what was intended merely to be limitation on an exemption from thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20805crs5 20 see singer sutherland statutory construction vol 2a 4605 4701 4708 4711 21 the underlying rule is that one may not solicit directly or indirectly gifts from prohibited sources and an indirect solicitation may arguably be one done by ones agents acting for and on behalf of the principals in the case of the clintons first legal expense trust fund the office of government ethics however noted we do not view the mere establishment of the trust as solicitation nor do we view the provision of an information sheet as solicitation solicitation must involve some request letter from oge to michael h cardoza executive director presidential legal expense trust july 22 1994 that first fund did not actively solicit contributions later legal expense fund set up in 1998 was not established by the clintons personally as grantors as was the first but was established by third parties and was allowed to solicit money for the trust without an imputed violation to the president note washington post clintons approve new legal fund at a12 february 191998 indicating oge approval of solicitation of funds by the new trust 22 article i section 9 clause 8 23 5 usc 7342c1a minimal value is pegged to the consumer price index and adjusted every 3 years and as of 1999 it is 260 or less 41 cfr 101 49001 5 24 5 usc 7342c1b 25 5 usc 7342c1bi note 41 cfr part 10149general rule would actually operate as broader restriction than the general rule itself and would result in an inconsistent and illogical statutory construction of an exemption from prohibition barring something not even barred by the underlying prohibition20 it is also not precisely clear how broadly the solicitation prohibition would apply to suggestions or recommendations for gifts by members of the first family without any specific request for gifts nor whether solicitation by another with the president or first ladys knowledge and acquiescence could be considered as an indirect solicitation by the president it may be noted however that establishing fund and specific repository for gifts by the president and first lady and providing information sheets on how the public may contribute concerning the establishment by the president and first lady of legal expense trust fund did not constitute solicitation of such funds even though the president and first lady personally set up the instrumentality and repository for contributions and such establishment certainly suggested or intended to invite the giving of gifts21 gifts from foreign governments the president and all federal officials are restricted by the constitution from receiving presents from foreign governments kings or princes without the consent of the congress22 the congress has consented generally in the foreign gifts and decorations act to the acceptance of gifts of minimal value from foreign governments offered as souvenirs or marks of courtesy23 and the acceptance of other gifts when refusal of the gift may cause offense or embarrassment or otherwise harm the foreign relations of the united states24 tangible gift of more than minimal value accepted for reasons of protocol or courtesy may not be kept as personal gift however but is considered accepted on behalf of and property of the united states and must be utilized and disposed of in accordance with instructions of the general services administration25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20805crs6 26 united states v sundiamond growers

occasions was subject to series of criticisms note the washington post irs looking into gifts to reagans december 5 1989 new york times looking gift house in the mouth september 19 1999 as was the reagans acceptance upon leaving office of the use of 25 million home in bel air purchased by undisclosed friends the washington post reagans probably could accept house as gift ethics office says april 13 1988 which has been described recently by mrs reagan as merely loan which was paid back with interest national journal at p 358 february 3 2001 criticisms of gifts received by the clintons upon leaving office has led to their decision to pay for large portion of those gifts and to return others which were apparently intended for the white house rather than as personal gifts the washington post clintons will pay for half of gifts february 3 2001 and clintons say theyll return disputed gifts february 6 2001bribery illegal gratuities the president and all federal officials are subject to the restrictions of the bribery law at 18 usc 201b2 prohibiting the receipt of or agreement to receive anything of value in return for being influenced in the performance of ones official duties and the socalled illegal gratuities clause of that statute 18 usc 201c1b prohibiting the receipt of anything of value for or because of an official act performed or to be performed the bribery provision requires corrupt bargain or understanding to do some official act in return for something of value often referred to as quid pro quo where the payment was the motivation for the official act while under the illegal gratuities provision the official act may have been done even witho ut the payment as motivation but the payment was connected to the act in some way for example as thankyou or other reward ie gratuity neither provision is technically gift law and neither applies merely to gifts given with shown connection to an official act26 financial disclosure in addition to restrictions on the receipt of gifts the president is required to publicly disclose personal financial information including gifts over minimal amounts now 260 which have been received by him and his immediate family these public disclosure reports are required each may 15th and upon leaving office under the provisions of the ethics in government act of 1978 as amended27 public opinion criticism despite the permissibility of the receipt and acceptance of gifts by the president and the first lady from the general public such receipt of private gifts has in the past engendered some public criticism and thus the receipt of particularly lavish or excessive gifts even if free of legal liability may not be free from political consequences28
