oxidation oxidation is chemical process in which substance combines with oxygen during this process energy is given off usually in the form of heat the rusting of iron and the rotting of wood are common examples of slow oxidation fire or combustion involves rapid oxidation with the evolution of heat and light typically fire involves rapid oxidation at temperatures above 1500 c0095f accompanied by the evolution of highly heated products of combustion and the emission of visible and invisible radiation the combustion process occurs in two modes flaming and surface combustion including deepseated glowing embers 5553132 start of fire all matter exists in one of three states solid liquid or gas vapor the atoms or molecules of solid are packed closely together and those of liquid are packed loosely the molecules of vapor are not packed together at all they are free to move about in order for substance to burn its molecules must be well surrounded by oxygen molecules the molecules of solids and liquids are too tightly packed to be surrounded therefore only vapors can burn when solid or liquid is heated its molecules move about rapidly if enough heat is applied some molecules break away from the surface to form vapor just above the surface this vapor can now mix with oxygen if there is enough heat to raise the vapor to its ignition temperature and if there is enough oxygen present the vapor will ignite 5553133 combustion combustion involves the rapid oxidation of millions of vapor molecules the molecules oxidize by breaking apart into individual atoms and recombining with oxygen into new molecules it is during the breaking and recombining process that energy is released as heat and light 55531331 radiant heat the heat that is released is radiant heatðthe same form of energy that is radiated by the sun heat radiates in all directions part of the heat radiates back to the seat of the fire to the burning solid or liquid 55531332 radiation feedback the heat that radiates back to the fuel is called radiation feedback see figure 555311 part of this heat releases more vapor and part of it raises the vapor to the ignition temperature at the same time air is drawn into the area where the flames and vapor meet the result is the newly formed vapor begins to burn the flames increase 5553134 selfsustaining reaction selfsustaining reaction starts in which burning vapor produces heat which releases and ignites more vapor the additional vapor burns producing more heat which releases and ignites still more vapor this process continues until all available fuel or oxygen has been consumed or the fire has been extinguished when the combustion process is confined so that rapid pressure rise occurs it is called an explosion 55531341 flammable gases burn more intensely than solids or liquids because they are already in the vapor state all the radiation feedback goes into igniting the vapor so it is more fully ignited gases burn without smoldering or leaving residues the size and intensity of gas fire depend on the amount of fuel availables9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0052figure 555311 c0046c0032c0032radiant feedback 555314 requirements for combustion 5553141 fire triangle from the preceding section three things are required for combustion fuel to vaporize and burn oxygen to combine with fuel vapor and heat to raise the temperature of the fuel vapor to its ignition temperature the fire triangle illustrates these requirements see figure 555312 it also illustrates two facts of importance in preventing and extinguishing fires if any side of the fire triangle is missing fire cannot start b if any side of the fire triangle is removed the fire will go out 5553142 fire tetrahedron the fire triangle is acceptable for describing requirements for surface glowing or smoldering but does not completely describe flaming combustion requirements fourth requirement figure 555312 c0046c0032c0032requirements for combustion s9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0053an uninhibited chemical chain reaction is needed for flames to exist this is illustrated by the fire tetrahedron figure 555313 tetrahedron is solid figure with four triangular faces figure 555313 c0046c0032c0032tetrahedron and fire triangle tetrahedron is solid figure with four triangular faces it is useful for illustrating the flaming combustion process because it provides for the chemical chain reaction requirement and each face touches the other three sides see figure 555314 as described for the fire triangle flaming combustion stops when one of the four sides of the fire tetrahedron is removed dry chemical fire extinguishing agents work by interrupting the chemical chain reaction 5553143 fuel 55531431 solid fuels the most obvious solid fuels are wood rubber plastics paper and cloth these are found aboard ship as insulation canvas packing electrical cabling wiping rags and mattresses 555314311 pyrolysis before solid fuel will burn it must be changed to the vapor state in fire situation this change usually results from the initial application of heat the process is known as pyrolysis which is generally defined as chemical decomposition by the action of heat the decomposition causes change from the solid state to the vapor state see figure 555315 if the vapor mixes sufficiently with air and is heated to high enough temperature combustion results 555314312 burning rate the burning rate of solid fuel depends on its configuration solid fuels in the form of dust or shavings will burn faster than bulky materials that is small wood chips will burn faster than solid wood beam finely divided fuels have much larger surface area exposed to the heat therefore heat is absorbed much faster and vaporization is more rapid more vapor is available for ignition so it burns with greater intensity and the fuel is quickly consumed on the other hand bulky fuel will burn longer than finely divided fuel burning rate is measured in kilowatts kw one kw is approximately 095 btumin small waste paper basket fire peaks around 10 kws9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0054figure 555314 c0046c0032c0032chain reaction figure 555315 c0046c0032c0032pyrolysis 55531432 liquid fuels the flammable liquids most commonly found aboard submarines are diesel fuel lubricating oil hydraulic fluid torpedo otto fuel cooking oil and oil base paints and their solvents see paragraph 555365 for flammable liquid firefighting tactics 555314321 vaporization flammable liquids release vapor in much the same way as solid fuels the rate of vapor release is greater for liquids than solids since liquids have loosely packed molecules in addition liquids can release vapor over wide temperature range see figure 555316 heating increases the rate of vapor release 555314322 flashpoint the flashpoint is the lowest temperature at which liquid gives off sufficient vapor to form an ignitable mixture an ignitable mixture is mixture composed of vapor and air that is capable of being ignited by an ignition source gasoline has flashpoint of 45 c0095f 43c0095c this makes gasoline continuous fire hazard it produces flammable vapor at normal temperatures the flashpoints temperatures of liquids are determined in controlled tests described in nstm chapter 541 for discussion of the classification of flammable liquids see nstm chapter 670 555314323 burning characteristics poundforpound flammable liquids produce about 25 times more heat than wood this heat is liberated 3 to 10 times faster from liquid than from wood these ratios illustrate quite clearly why flammable liquid vapors burn with such intensity when flammable liquids spill they expose very large surface area release great amount of vapor and produce great amounts of heat when ignited this is one reason why flammable liquidspill fires burn so violentlys9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0055figure 555316 c0046c0032c0032vaporization c0078c0079c0084c0069c0058

temperature and pressure is not explosive with flash point of 140 c0095f and an ignition temperature of 450 c0095f liquid diesel fuel is in fact difficult to ignite however atomized fuel oil exposed to hot surfaces over 400 c0095f will burn readily giving off dense black smoke the fuel spray fire is of serious concern because the heat can be intense and dense smoke will rapidly obscure the source of the fire immediate action is required before heat and smoke force personnel to abandon the compartment securing the source of the fuel is the most important step in combatting the fire 555314325 hydraulic fluid hydraulic fluids 2190 tep used in the ship service stern diving and missile tube hydraulic systems and 2075th used in the external hydraulic system are relatively safe when not under pressure because of their high flash points 400 c0095f for 2190 tep and 315 c0095f for 2075th however under casualty conditions pressurized fluid spraying from hydraulic system 3000 psig for ship service stern diving and missile tube hydraulic systems and 1500 psig for the external hydraulic system may become atomized and susceptible to ignition from sparks open flame or hot surfaces prevention of hydraulic fluid fires is best accomplished by ensuring that all fluids are contained and that leaks and spills are controlled immediately to prevent the spread of the fluid and its vapor 555314326 lubricating oil lubricating oils are relatively safe due to their high flashpoints which range from 350c0095f minimum and their ignition temperature of over 650 c0095f however when sprayed on hot surfaces over 650c0095f lubricating oils will burn readily giving off very dense smoke lubricating oil has the same fire characteristics as hydraulic fluid 5553143261 prevention of lubricating oil fires is best accomplished by ensuring that all oils are contained and that leaks and spills are controlled immediately to prevent the spread of the oil and its vapor the main propulsion turbine and ship service turbine generator lube oil sump tanks are equipped with electrostatic precipitators which minimize oil vapor from entering the submarine atmospheres9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c005655531433 flammable gases flammable gases found on board submarine include acetylene and hydrogen see paragraph 555366 for flammable gas firefighting tactics 555314331 burning characteristics flammable gases are already in the vapor state only the proper ratio with oxygen and sufficient heat are needed for ignition most gases like flammable liquids produce visible flame they do not smolder hydrogen burns with flame that is often invisible in normal light unless there are other materials present in the flames 555314332 radiation feedback radiation feedback is not necessary to vaporize the gas however some radiation feedback is still essential to the burning process to provide continuous reignition of the gas 55531434 explosive range flammable range flammable gas or the flammable vapor of liquid has to mix with air in the proper proportion to make an ignitable airvapor mixture the smallest percentage of gas or vapor that will make an ignitable mixture with air is called its lower explosive limit lel if there is less gas or vapor than the lel in the mixture it is too lean to burn the greatest percentage of gas or vapor in an ignitable mixture is called its upper explosive limit uel if mixture contains more gas or vapor than the uel it is too rich to burn the range between the lower and upper explosive limits is called the explosive range of the gas or vapor 555314341 explosive limits table 555312 gives the lel uel and flashpoint for number of substances it shows that mixture of 14 percent to 76 percent gasoline vapor in air will ignite mixture of 9 percent gasoline vapor and 91 percent air will not ignite because it is too rich above the uel large volume of air must intermix with small amount of gasoline vapor to form an ignitable mixture certain devices can detect the presence of potentially hazardous concentrations of flammable gases such devices include the combustible gas indicator see nstm chapter 079 volume 2 555314342 safety guidelines it is important to realize that certain ranges of vaporair mixtures can be ignited and to use caution when working with flammable liquids the explosive ranges of specific types of flammable liquids are published in national fire protection association nfpa fire protection handbook and the fire protection guide for hazardous materials published by the national fire protection association and dod 60505cd hazardous material control and management 5553144 oxygen the oxygen side of the fire triangle refers to the oxygen content of the surrounding air ordinarily minimum concentration of 15 percent oxygen in the air is needed to support flaming combustion however smoldering combustion can take place in an atmosphere with as little as 3 percent oxygen air normally contains about 21 percent oxygen 78 percent nitrogen and 1 percent other gases principally argon 55531441 oxidizing materials an oxidizing material is material that releases oxygen when it is heated and may react readily with other materials such substances include the hypochlorites chlorates perchlorates nitrates chromates oxides and peroxides all carry their own supply of oxygen enough to support combustion oxygen is released when the materials break down as in fire for this reason burning materials with their own oxidizers cannot be extinguished instead large amounts of water are needed to cool surroundings while permitting controlled burnout oxidizers are hazardous materials and must be stored in approved locations for information on oxidizing materials including approved stowage see nstm chapter 670 5553145 heat heat is the third side of the fire triangle when sufficient heat fuel and oxygen are available the triangle is complete and fire can exist heat of ignition initiates the chemical reaction that is called combustion heat can come from the flame of match hot surface see table 555313 sparks caused by ferrous metals striking together heat generated by friction lightning an oxyacetylene torch cutting or welding metal an electrical short circuit or an electrical arc between conductor and motor casing see appendix b glossary for definition of hot surfaces for flammable liquid piping sufficient heat may also be produced internally within the fuel by chemical reaction called spontaneous heatings9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0057table 555312 c0046 properties of

spontaneous heating is the process whereby material increases in temperature without drawing heat from its surroundings spontaneous heating of material to its ignition temperature results in spontaneous ignition spontaneous heating to dangerous temperatures is governed by the rate of heat generation material configuration air supply and insulating properties of the surroundings in order for spontaneous ignition to occur sufficient air must be available to permit oxidation but not so much air that the heat is dissipated by convection as rapidly as it is formed spontaneous ignition occurs typically in materials that are tightly packed and saturated in greases paints animal and vegetable oil or fats an oily rag which might spontaneously heat in the bottom of waste paper basket will not if laid out in the open where air movement can remove the heat aboard ship spontaneous ignition has occurred in materials immediately removed from clothes dryers and stored in laundry bags current dryers are fitted with cool down cycle that minimizes the potential for fires occurring in laundry bags 55531452 ignition temperature the ignition temperature of substance solid liquid or gas is the lowest temperature at which sustained combustion will occur without the application of spark or flame ignition temperatures vary among substances for given substance the ignition temperature also varies with physical form surface area and other factors the ignition temperatures for common combustible materials lie between 300c0095f 150c0095c and 1000 c0095f 540c0095c 55531453 spark ignition finely atomized fuel vapors and gases can be ignited by hot spark that provides the minimum ignition energy mie for that fuel the hot spark can come from many sources such as grinding operations or operating an uncovered electrical switch for hydrocarbon vapor in air the minimum ignition energy is approximately 02 millijoules mj which is much less than the spark energy from electric power systems low flashpoint flammable liquids such as gasoline mogas vaporize from standing pool at normal room temperatures and always present spark ignition hazard however the high flashpoint flammable liquids normally found on us navy ships such as diesel fuel lube oil and hydraulic fluid must be finely atomized by spraying leak to be ignited by spark this is because the minimum ignition energy mie increases rapidly with the vapor particle size course large particle spray of high flashpoint fuel will not ignite with small spark but will ignite with steam pipe or diesel exhaust duct that is hotter than the fuels ignition temperature because the fuel is first vaporized by the hot surface see table 555312 and table 555313 since most electric spark sources are enclosed it is very unlikely that high flashpoint fuel spray will be ignited by spark 555315 hazardous products of combustion 5553151 general fire produces flames heat gases and smoke each of these combustion products can cause serious injuries or death 5553152 flames direct contact with flames can result in total or partial disabling skin burns and serious damage to respiratory tract to prevent skin burns during fire attack crew members should maintain safe distance from the fire unless they are properly protected and equipped for the attack protective clothing should be worn when combatting an advanced fire respiratory tract damage can be prevented by wearing breathing apparatus firefighting personnel must remember that breathing apparatus does not protect the body from the extreme heat of fire 5553153 heat fire can generate compartment temperatures in excess of 2000 c0095f 1093c0095c particularly when compartment has flashed over temperatures above 150 c0095f 66c0095c are hazardous to humans studies have shown that skin surface temperature as low as 160 c0095f 71c0095c will result in second degree burns if contact is maintained for 60 seconds the dangerous effects of heat range from minor injury to death direct exposure to heated air may cause dehydration heat exhaustion burns and blockage of the respiratory track by fluids heat also causes an increased heart rate firefighter exposed to excessive heat over an extended period of time could develop hyperthermia dangerously high fever that can damage nerve centers see table 555317 for more information 5553154 gases the particular gases produced by fire depend mainly on the fuel the most common hazardous gases are carbon monoxide co the product of incomplete combustion and carbon dioxide co 2 the product of complete combustion in smoldering fire the ratio of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide is usually greater than in well ventilated free burning fires9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0049c004955531541 carbon monoxide carbon monoxide co is the major threat in most fire atmospheres exposure to co results in an oxygen deficiency in the brain and body see table 555314 exposure to 13 percent concentration of co will cause unconsciousness in two or three breaths and death in few minutes exposure limits for co are listed in the technical manual navsea s9510abatm010 nuclear powered submarine atmosphere control manual carbon monoxide co is classified as flammable gas see table 555312 table 555314 c0046 human tolerance to carbon monoxide co ppm co co incapacitation

carbon dioxide co 2 works on the respiratory system above normal co 2 concentrations in the air reduces the amount of oxygen that is absorbed in the lungs the body responds with rapid and deep breathing signal that the respiratory system is not receiving sufficient oxygen exposure limits for co2 are listed in the technical manual navsea s9510abatm010 nuclear powered submarine atmosphere control manual see also table 555351 55531543 oxygen reduction when the oxygen content of air drops from its normal level of 21 percent to about 16 percent at an atmosphere pressure equal to that at sea level human muscular control is impaired at 10 percent to 14 percent oxygen in air judgment is impaired and fatigue sets in unconsciousness usually results from oxygen concentrations below 10 percent during periods of exertion such as firefighting operations the body requires more oxygen and increased demands may result in oxygen deficiency symptoms at normal oxygen levels 55531544 other fire gases several other gases generated by fire are of equal concern to firefighters toxic hydrocarbon vapors are produced by fuels hydrogen chloride hcl is produced when polyvinyl chloride pvc electric cable jacketing is burned hydrogen cyanide hcn is produced when chilled water piping insulation is burned fluorocarbon refrigerants such as r12 r114 and hfc 134a are nonflammable and nonexplosive but exposure to flames or hot surfaces will cause these compounds to generate hydrogen chloride acid gas hydrogen fluoride acid gas and other poisonous gases see paragraph 55535103 for more information 5553155 smoke smoke is visible product of fire that adds to the problem of breathing it is made up of carbon and other unburned substances in the form of suspended particles it also carries the vapors of water acids and other chemicals which can be poisonous or irritating when inhaled 55531551 smoke greatly reduces visibility in and above the fire area it irritates the eyes nose throat and lungs either breathing low concentration for an extended period of time or heavy concentration for short time can cause great discomfort to firefighter 55531552 firefighters who do not wear breathing apparatus in the fire area will eventually have to retreat to fresh air or be overcome by smoke and toxic gases 555316 classification of fires 5553161 general there are four classifications of fire class class b class c and class d the different classifications are briefly described in the following paragraphs 5553162 class fires class fires involve wood and wood products cloth textiles and fibrous materials paper and paper products class fires are extinguished with water usually in fog pattern if the fires9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0049c0050is deepseated aqueous film forming foam afff when available is more effective than sea water and can be used as wetting agent to rapidly penetrate and extinguish the fire the afff system installed in the ssn 21 class submarine provides an afff capability to all 112 inch seawater fireplugs 5553163 class b fires class b fires involve flammable liquids such as gasoline diesel fuel hydraulic fluid and lube oil these fires are normally extinguished with afff or potassium bicarbonate or water see paragraph 5553144 for flammable liquid burning characteristics see paragraph 555365 for flammable liquid firefighting tactics class b fires also involve flammable gases which should never be extinguished unless there is reasonable certainty that the flow of gas can be secured see paragraph 55531433 for flammable gas burning characteristics see paragraph 555366 for flammable gas firefighting tactics 5553164 class c fires class c fires are energized electrical fires that are attacked at prescribed distances using nonconductive agents such as co 2 or water fog the most effective tactic is to deenergize and handle the fire as class fire when fires are not deep seated clean agents that pose clean up problem such as co 2 are preferred paragraph 555362 provides information on combatting class c fires 5553165 class d fires class d fires involve combustible metals such as magnesium pyrotechnics lithium hydride countermeasures sodium potassium aluminum zinc titanium zirconium and iron heat from radiation conduction or convection can be sufficient to cause ignition flame is not necessary probable causes of this class of fires include the exposure to high temperature magnesium or violent reaction to water sodium potassium firefighting methods vary with the type of metal involved paragraph 555368 provides information on combatting class d fires 555317 burning characteristics of propellants and explosives 5553171 composition of propellants and explosives propellants and explosives typically are composed of energetic materials that combine both fuel and an oxidizer these materials once ignited cannot be extinguished burning will continue until the material is consumed cooling streams of seawater or afff in the ssn 21 class should be used to control the burn and cool the surrounding area from damage control standpoint efforts should be directed at tube loading and jettisoning the weapons in the presence of flammable liquids burning explosives or propellants will pose continuous source of ignition see op4 ammunition afloat for further information on weapons fires firefighting procedures for nuclear weapons are addressed in od 46199 ssbn officers guide for trident i strategic weapon system and opnavinst 344015 minimum criteria and standards for navy and marine corps nuclear weapons

compartments are addressed in the ships casualty procedures flammable liquid fires should be fought with afff pkp and water in the form of fog after the fire is extinguished the area should continue to be cooled with afff when available or water as required combined use of afff hoselines and seawater hoselines should be avoided because seawater will dilute and degrade the afff film 5553173 torpedo otto fuel otto fuel ii is stable liquid monopropellant used in the propulsion of the mk 46 mk 48 mk 55 mk 56 and mk 60 torpedoes otto fuel ii is composed of nitrate ester in solution with desensitizing agent and stabilizer it is bright red free flowing oily liquid that is heavier than water it is insoluble in water detailed safety handling and cleanup instructions for otto fuel are contained in references cited in table 555311 see paragraph 555369 for guidance on extinguishing an otto fuel fire 55531731 otto fuel ii liquid and vapor are extremely toxic otto fuel toxic effects may occur from inhalation of otto fuel ii vapors inhalation of combustion byproducts absorption from direct skin contact or ingestion the nitrate esters in the otto fuel are known for their acute effects including nausea turgidity swelling blood pressure changes headaches and dyspnea difficult breathings9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0049c0051 warning personnel shall not be exposed to otto fuel ii vapor concentrations in excess of 02 ppm 13 mgm3 injury or death of personnel could result warning the smoke from burning otto fuel must be considered as hazardous and toxic as otto fuel fumes 55531732 for otto fuel ii fires personnel without selfcontained breathing protection or eab masks should not enter smoky areas personnel without full protective clothing should not enter spaces containing spilled or burned otto fuel ii 55531733 fire team personnel should take extreme care not to expose skin surfaces fire party personnel clothing and equipment exposed to otto fuel ii should be considered contaminated until tested once the fire is extinguished otto fuel ii spill cleanup and decontamination should be conducted in accordance with the applicable references in table 555311 555318 heat transfer 5553181 general heat from fire is transferred by one or more of three methods conduction radiation and convection 5553182 conduction conduction is the transfer of heat through body or from one body to another body by direct physical contact for example on hot stove heat is conducted through the pot to its contents wood is ordinarily poor conductor of heat but metals are good conductors since submarines are constructed of metal heat transfer by conduction is potential hazard fire can move from one space to another one deck to another and one compartment to another by heat conduction 55531821 in many cases the skillful application of water typically applied using fog patterns to rapidly coat and recoat surfaces with film of water will retard or halt the transmission of heat by conduction fog patterns coat surfaces more efficiently than solid streams reducing run off and the effect on ship trim 5553183 radiation heat radiation is the transfer of heat from source across an intervening space material substance is involved the heat travels outward from the fire in the same manner as light that is in straight lines when it contacts body it is absorbed reflected or transmitted absorbed heat increases the temperature of the absorbing body for example radiant heat that is absorbed by an overhead will increase the temperature of that overhead perhaps enough to ignite its paint 55531831 heat radiates in all directions unless it is blocked radiant heat extends fire by heating combustible substances in its path causing them to produce vapors and then igniting the vapor radiant heat flux is the measure of radiant energy heat flow per unit area and is normally expressed in kilowatts per square meter kwm2 55531832 within compartment radiant heat will raise the temperature of combustible materials near the fire and depending on the ships design at quite some distance from the fire ship fires can spread as result of radiating bulkheads and decks intense radiated heat can make an approach to the fire extremely difficult for this reason protective clothing should be worn by firefighters 5553184 convection convection is the transfer of heat through the motion of circulating gases or liquids heat is transferred by convection through the motion of smoke hot air and heated gases produced by fire 55531841 when heat is confined as within compartment convected heat moves in predictable patterns the fire produces lighterthanair gases that rise toward high parts of the compartment heated air which is lighter than cooler air also rises as these heated combustion products rise cool air takes their place the cool air is heated in turn and then rises to the highest point it can reachs9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0049c005255531842 hot smoke originating at fire on low deck will travel horizontally along passageways and then upward by way of frame bays and ladder and hatch openings heating flammable materials in its path to prevent fire spread and assist the fire party in combatting the fire it may be necessary to vent the heat smoke and gases overboard via ships hatch the intense heat may cause secondary fires along the ventilation path if the ships ventilation system is used it is imperative that the fire be confined to the smallest possible area joiner doors should be kept closed when they are not in use if fire is discovered attempts should be made to close off all openings to the fire area until firefighting personnel and equipment can be brought into position to fight the fire 555319 space fire dynamics 5553191 fire growth in space during its life space fire normally experiences four different stages growth flashover fully developed fire and decay see figure 555317 figure 555317 c0046c0032c0032stages of space fire growth 55531911 growth stage in the growth or preflashover stage the average space temperature is low and the fire is localized in the vicinity of its origin high local temperatures exist in and around the burning materials and smoke from the fire forms hot upper layer in the space see figure 555318 figure 555318 c0046c0032c0032growth stage space fire s9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0049c0053555319111 rollover rollover is the formation of flame front of burning gases across the overhead of space rollover takes place in the growth stage when unburned combustible gases from the fire mix with fresh air in the overhead and burn at some distance from the seat of the fire rollover differs from flashover in that only the gases are burning and not all the contents of the space 55531912 flashover stage flashover is the period of transition from the growth stage to the fully developed fire stage flashover occurs in short period of time and may be considered as an event as ignition is an event it normally occurs when the upper smoke layer temperature reaches 1100 c0095f 600c0095c and the radiant heat flux at the deck reaches 20 kwm2 the most obvious characteristic of flashover is the sudden spread of flame to all remaining combustibles in the fire space survival of personnel who have not escaped from the space prior to flashover is unlikely 55531913 fully developed fire stage in the fully developed or postflashover fire stage all combustibles in the space have reached their ignition temperature and are burning during this stage the burning rate in the space is normally limited by the amount of oxygen available in the air for combustion flames may emerge from any opening unburnt fuel in the smoke may burn as it meets fresh air in adjacent spaces structural damage to exposed steel normally occurs as it is heated to extreme temperatures fully developed fire may be inaccessible by fire teams prohibiting direct attack space can reach the fully developed fire stage very quickly in flammable liquid fires 55531914 decay stage eventually the fire consumes all available fuel andor oxygen at which time combustion slows down decays and the fire goes out 5553192 significant exposure thresholds significant exposure thresholds are provided in table 555315 table 555316 table 555317 and table 555318 table 555315 c0046 ignition

airtight compartment fuel vapors may still be formed from flammable liquid which is above its flashpoint or from pyrolysis of solid material if fresh air is then introduced and the fuelvaporrich air is still above its ignition temperature the three elements of the fire triangle are again present and the mixture can ignite explosively this is known as backdraft backdraft is an unusual occurrence and has never been known to occur on submarines9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0049c0054table 555317 c0046 human tolerance to heat hot air exposure 200c0095f 90c0095c incapacitation 35 minutes

submarines have some unique characteristics that affect the growth of fire and the spread of smoke and heat from fire these characteristics are discussed in the paragraphs that follow 55531941 fire growth and intensity the primary characteristics unique to submarine that affect fire growth are the closed environment of submarine and the oxygen concentration 555319411 fires tend to become intense quickly in the closed environment of submarine the insulated hull reduces the transfer of heat from the submarine to the environment this increases the amount of heat from the fire contained inside the submarine also the pressure increase caused by the fire may contribute to the rapid growth of the fire in submarine without any ventilation to the atmosphere personnel without protective gear could be forced by heat from the immediate area of moderately severe fire in less than minute after the fire starts 555319412 in closed environment eventually the fire will be extinguished due to lack of oxygen but in the typical large submarine compartment there is sufficient oxygen for fire to generate severe untenable conditions before the fire consumes the available oxygen in compartment 555319413 increasing the concentration of oxygen will increase the intensity and growth rate of fire higher than normal concentrations of oxygen can occur locally at oxygen bleed points the chlorate candle furnace or at leak in the oxygen system in addition increased oxygen concentration tends to lower the ignition temperature of materials causing materials to burn that otherwise might not be thought of as combustible for example fire in an oxygen candle furnace caused the steel deck supporting the furnace to burn 555319414 decreasing the concentration of oxygen will decrease the intensity and growth rate of fire the minimum oxygen volume concentration has been lowered to 17 2 in technical manual navsea s9510abatm010u nuclear powered submarine atmosphere control manual to reduce the fire risk on submarines 55531942 spread of smoke and heat the primary paths for the spread of smoke and heat in submarine are openings to the frame bays and open ladder ways between platforms other openings such as ventilation openingss9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0049c0055in doors and bulkheads and open structure at the top of joiner bulkheads also provide paths for the spread of smoke and heat smoke and heat will spread very quickly to the upper level from fire in lower level particularly where there is continuous path such as frame bay for the smoke to follow 555319421 heat from fire in the lower level can force personnel from spaces in the upper level of the compartment quickly emergency air breathing masks will not protect personnel from heat exposure the firefighters ensemble ffe will provide some protection from heat 555319422 heat from fire in the upper level will accumulate first in the upper level and then spread slowly to the lower levels the lower levels will remain tenable longer than the upper level 555319423 smoke from the fire will impair visibility reducing the operating effectiveness of the crew impairing firefighting efforts and impairing safe evacuation of the compartment in the upper level where smoke tends to accumulate the quickest visibility can be lost in less than 30 seconds 555319424 venting the fire compartment to weather may help reduce the heat and smoke in the compartment venting can be accomplished by opening hatches when surfaced or by operating the ventilation system when snorkeling venting by opening hatch probably will not cause the fire to grow significantly operating the ventilation system increases the risk of additional fire growth and of spreading smoke and heat through the operating ventilation system in any case if venting initially improves tenability to allow successful attack on the fire the advantages of venting may outweigh the disadvantages 55531943 typical fire growth scenario typical growth scenario for moderately severe class fire in the lower level of the forward compartment is provided below see figure 555319 0 30 seconds to 1 minute 1 to 3 minutes 2 to 6 minutesc0045 c0084c0104c0101

fire spread 55531101 general if fire is attacked early and efficiently it can be confined to the area in which it started if it is allowed to burn unchecked it can generate great amounts of heat that will travel away from the fire area igniting additional fires wherever fuel and oxygen are available 555311011 steel bulkheads and decks and other fire barriers can delay but not prevent transfer of heat 555311012 when space such as the radio or sonar control room is fully involved in fire eg postflashover fire is most quickly spread to other spaces within the compartment through openings such as doorways vent ducts and open pipeways and wireways it will also spread to adjacent spaces by heat conduction through the bulkheads fires normally spread faster vertically to the space above than to adjacent horizontal spaces 55531102 fire spread in electrical cable runs the spread of fire in electrical cable runs and the water from firefighting efforts can interrupt power lighting and communications which serve vital spaces and functions even though cables in cable run may be armored fire experience has shown armor does not deter fire in cable the metal braid is not sufficiently heavy to act as heat shield to reduce cable temperature nor is it sufficiently gastight to prevent the burning of outgassing products emitted from the insulation if fire is allowed tos9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0049c0056figure 555319 c0046c0032c0032spread of smoke and heat moderately severe class fire on lower level s9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0049c0057extend to grouped cables deepseated fire that feeds on electrical insulation and generates toxic dense black smoke can occur new cables currently in use are in accordance with milc24643 and are designed to reduce the amount of smoke generated cable run fire will spread past penetrations through nontight partitions bulkheads and decks cable fires will not spread past properly installed stuffing tubes in watertight bulkheads cable fire burning against bulkhead can ignite combustibles on the other side by heat conduction 55531103 difficulties associated with fires in electrical cable runs the tight grouping of cables limits the ability of firefighters to direct hose streams to the source of the fire because cable fires generate so much smoke significant delay can be expected in locating the seat of the fire 5553111 theory of extinguishment 55531111 general fire can be extinguished by removing the fuel removing the oxygen or removing the heat cooling another method is flame inhibition breaking the combustion chain reaction 55531112 removing the fuel one way to remove the fuel from the fire is to physically drag it away it is often possible to move nearby fuels away from the immediate vicinity of fire so that the fire does not extend to these fuels 555311121 sometimes the supply of liquid or gaseous fuel can be cut off from fire when fire is being fed by fuel line it can be extinguished by closing the proper valve if pump is supplying liquid fuel to fire in the engine room the pump can be shutdown to remove the fuel source and extinguish the fire 555311122 fire involving acetylene or hydrogen can often be extinguished by shutting the valve on the cylinder 55531113 removing the oxygen fire can be extinguished by removing its oxygen or by reducing the oxygen level in the air to below 15 percent many extinguishing agents for example co 2 and foam extinguish fire with smothering action that deprives the fire of oxygen 555311131 extinguishment by oxygen removal is difficult but not impossible in an open area with gaseous smothering agents like co 2 co2 would be blown away topside on the other hand fire in galley trash container can be snuffed out by placing cover tightly over the container blocking the flow of air to the fire as the fire consumes the oxygen in the container it becomes starved for oxygen and is extinguished 555311132 aqueous film forming foam afff portable fire extinguishers are installed in all submarines the ssn 21 class will also have fixed afff fire extinguishing system afff acts by establishing film over flammable liquids to exclude oxygen and by preventing the formation of flammable vapors afff also cools the liquid surface to reduce vapor formation 55531114 removing heat water when applied in fog or straight stream is the most effective means of removing heat from ordinary combustible materials such as wood paper and cardboard cooling with water can ultimately stop the release of combustible vapors and gases associated with the burning of solid fuels 555311141 when fire is attacked with hose line one gallon per minute gpm of water could theoretically absorb heat at approximately 10000 btu per minute 180 kw if fully vaporized this water will vaporize to steam and expand approximately 17001 greatly reducing the percentage of oxygen concentration in an enclosed space 55531115 breaking the combustion chain reaction flaming combustion occurs in complex series of chemical chain reactions once the chain reaction sequence is broken fire can be extinguished rapidly the extinguishing agents commonly used to attack the chain reaction and inhibit combustion are dry chemicals these chemical agents directly attack the molecular structure of compounds formed during the chain reaction sequence the breakdown of these compounds adversely affects the flameproducing capability of the fire the attack is extremely rapids9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0050c0048555311151 it should be understood that these agents do not cool smoldering fire or flammable liquid whose container has been heated above the liquids ignition temperature in these cases the extinguishing agent must be maintained on the fire until the fuel has cooled cooling medium such as water or afff should be used to cool the smoldering embers or the sides of the container 5553112 firefighting agents 55531121 primary agents there are many materials that may be used as firefighting agents the primary agents discussed in the following paragraphs are the most extensively used aboard submarines the primary firefighting agents are water b aqueous film forming foam afff c carbon dioxide co 2 d potassium bicarbonate pkp aqueous potassium carbonate apc 55531122 water water is cooling agent and on board ship the sea provides an inexhaustible supply if the surface temperature of fire can be lowered below the fuels ignition temperature the fire will be extinguished water is most efficient when it absorbs enough heat to raise its temperature to 212 c0095f 100c0095c at this temperature the seawater will absorb still more heat until it changes to steam the steam carries away the heat which cools the surface temperature 55531123 straight stream water in the form of straight stream is used to reach into smokefilled spaces or areas at distance from the firefighter when straight stream is needed as an extinguishing agent it should be directed into the seat of the fire for maximum cooling the water must come in direct contact with the burning material straight stream is best used to break up and penetrate materials 555311231 water volume keeping in mind the constant problem of excess water disposal high volume water discharge should be used as little as possible the 112 inch varinozzle provides constant flow at all pattern settings warning to avoid shock hazards do not use straight stream water pattern on an energized electric source maintain minimum standoff distance of four feet when applying water fog to an energized electric source 555311232 electrical hazard straight stream water is the greatest conductor of electricity as opposed to the spray pattern and straight stream should not be used on electrical fires see paragraph 555362 for additional discussion on the electrical hazard of straight stream of water 555311233 effect on class b fires straight stream of water is ineffective for extinguishing class b fires and can cause violent fire reaction if the water stream atomizes the fuel into the air causing greatly increased surface area 555311234 heat transfer characteristics straight streams do not have good heat transfer characteristics and do not absorb nearly as much heat as fog patterns 55531124 water fog water in the form of fog is very effective for firefighting purposes however the fog must be applied directly to the area to be cooled if its benefits are to be realized warning do not use fog pattern to extinguish charcoal bed fire in reaction with water fog charcoal fires may produce ªwater gasº mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide straight stream of water should be used to extinguish charcoal bed fires9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0050c0049additionally water fog can provide protection to firefighters from both convective and radiant heat 555311241 electrical hazard see paragraph 555362 for guidance on the electrical hazards of water 555311242 use on class fires water fog extinguishes by cooling see section 35 for class firefighting tactics 555311243 use on flammable liquids because of the cooling qualities of the finely divided water particles water fog can be used successfully on fires involving fuels with flashpoints above 140 c0095f such as diesel fuel and hydraulic fluid extinguishment occurs by cooling the flammable liquid below its flashpoint water fog should be used on flammable liquids only when afff is not available danger of reflash exists until all of the fuel is cooled down below its flashpoint see paragraph 555365 for flammable liquid firefighting tactics 55531125 aqueous film forming foam afff is composed of synthetically produced materials similar to liquid detergents these film forming agents are capable of forming water solution films on the surface of flammable liquids for general shipboard use the navy typically uses six percent afff solution six parts afff concentrate mixed with 94 parts water using type 6 concentrate per military specification milf24385 the ssn 21 class uses three percent afff solution using type 3 concentrate nonmilitary specification commercial afff should not be used 555311251 description afff concentrate is clear to slightly amber colored liquid the afff solution of water and concentrate possesses low viscosity and is capable of quickly spreading over surface afff concentrate is nontoxic and biodegradable in diluted form afff concentrate may be stored indefinitely without degradation in characteristics the concentrate will freeze if exposed to temperatures below 32 c0095f if the frozen concentrate is thawed out it can be reused but storage in heated areas is recommended 555311252 firefighting advantages afff when proportioned with water provides three fire extinguishing advantages first an aqueous film is formed on the surface of the fuel which prevents the escape of the fuel vapors second the layer of foam effectively excludes oxygen from the fuel surface third the water content of the foam provides cooling effect 555311253 use of aqueous film forming foam the principle use of foam is to extinguish burning flammable or combustible liquid spill fires class b afff has excellent penetrating characteristics and is superior to water in extinguishing class fires 555311254 electrical hazard the electrical hazard of afff is the same as that for water alone see paragraph 555362 555311255 environmental restrictions afff is designated as an environmental pollutant except when used during fire it shall be disposed of in accordance with opnavinst 510019 navy occupational safety and health navosh program manual for forces afloat appendix b3c afff should not be discharged into any system which when pierside may feed into an ashore sewer treatment plant afff may kill the bacteria that aids in sewer treatment and disrupt plant operation 55531126 carbon dioxide method of extinguishing fires by smothering is the use of the inert gas carbon dioxide co 2 co2 is about 15 times heavier than air this makes co 2 suitable extinguishing agent because it tends to settle and blanket the fire 555311261 general characteristics carbon dioxide co 2 is dry noncorrosive gas which is inert when in contact with most substances and will not leave residue and damage machinery or electrical equipment in both the gaseous state and the finely divided solid snow state it is nonconductor of electricity regardless of voltage and can be safely used in fighting fires that would present the hazard of electric shock 555311262 method of extinguishing carbon dioxide extinguishes the fire by diluting and displacing its oxygen supply if gaseous co 2 is directed into fire so that sufficient oxygen to support combustion is longers9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0050c0050available the flames will die out depending on the fuel this action will take place when the 21 percent oxygen content normally present in air is diluted with co 2 to below 15 percent oxygen some ordinary combustible class fires require that the oxygen content be reduced to less than 6 percent in order to extinguish glowing combustion smoldering fire co 2 has limited cooling capabilities and may not cool the fuel below its ignition temperature and is more likely than other extinguishing agents to allow reflash therefore the firefighter must remember to stand by with additional backup extinguishers the temperature of the burning substance and its surroundings must be lowered below its ignition temperature if the fire is to remain extinguished 555311263 use on materials producing oxygen carbon dioxide is not an effective extinguishing agent for fires in materials that produce their own oxygen supply such as flares fires involving reactive metals such as magnesium sodium potassium lithium or titanium cannot be extinguished with co 2 because of the relatively high temperatures involved these metal fuels decompose co 2 and continue to burn 555311264 health and safety hazards of carbon dioxide carbon dioxide co 2 is colorless odorless gas that is naturally present in the atmosphere at an average concentration of 003 percent it is used for extinguishing fires since it reduces the concentration of oxygen in the air to the point where combustion stops typically co 2 concentrations of 30 to 70 percent are required to extinguish fires 5553112641 carbon dioxide for fire fighting is maintained as liquid at high pressure when discharged into the space large portion of the liquid co 2 flashes to vapor and the rest is converted to fine dry ice particles snow at temperature of 109 c0095f 78c0095c this dry ice gives the discharge white or cloudy appearance the low temperature condenses water in the entrained air creating fog that will persist after the dry ice is evaporated co2 is 15 times heavier than air and will collect at low points until forced ventilation is provided the co 2 will remain in the protected space and may migrate to adjacent spaces especially adjacent spaces at lower elevations than the protected space 5553112642 the primary hazard to personnel is death by asphyxiation if carbon dioxide is breathed at extinguishing concentrations over 30 percent loss of consciousness will occur in less than 1635 seconds cardiac arrest can occur within seconds of loss of consciousness depending on the individual serious and permanent injury to the brain can occur within 35 minutes after cardiac arrest unless cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr is started 5553112643 at low co 2 concentrations 710 percent an increased rate and depth of breathing will occur almost immediately for example at three percent co 2 concentration the volume of air breathed each minute is approximately doubled at five percent it is tripled and at ten percent it is ten times what it is at resting condition even at these low concentrations loss of consciousness can occur for example at ten percent co 2 concentration loss of consciousness can occur in four minutes at ten percent co 2 headaches and vomiting in addition to the severe discomfort from hyperventilation will occur personnel who lose consciousness may be revived without permanent injury if they are immediately removed from the hazardous atmosphere and provided cpr if necessary 55531127 dry chemical extinguishing agent potassium bicarbonate potassium bicarbonate pkp is dry chemical principally used as fire extinguishing agent for flammable liquid fires it is the preferred agent for 3dimensional running fuel fires it is used in portable extinguishers 555311271 additives various additives are mixed with the pkp base materials to improve their storage flow and water repellency characteristics the most commonly used additives are silicones which coat the particles of pkp to make it freeflowing and resistant to the caking effects of moisture and vibration 555311272 method of extinguishing when pkp is applied to fire the dry chemical extinguishes the flame by breaking the combustion chain pkp does not have cooling capability 5553112721 when pkp is applied an opaque cloud is formed in the combustion areas this cloud limits the amount of heat that can be radiated back to the heart of the fire less fuel vapors are produced due to the reduced radiant heats9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0049c0045c0050c00515553112722 when pkp is applied to the fire it attacks the chain reaction required to sustain the fire it is believed that pkp reduces the ability of the molecular fragments to recombine therefore breaking the chain reaction 555311273 use of potassium bicarbonate pkp pkp is highly effective in extinguishing flammable liquid class b fires although pkp can be used on electrical class c fires it will leave residue that may be hard to clean if afff is not available pkp can also be used in the galley for such items as the hood ducts and cooking ranges 5553112731 the following is list of limitations for pkp use like all other fire extinguishing agents pkp is not effective on materials that contain their own oxygen b pkp should not be used in

may combine with it to corrode or stain surfaces on which it settles when possible it should be removed from the surfaces pkp does not produce lasting inert atmosphere above the surface of flammable

boundaries 5553211 fire boundary is physical boundary to retard the passage of flame and smoke the watertight transverse bulkheads are typically utilized as fire boundaries fire boundaries confine fire within space or compartment and provide staging areas for fire parties 5553212 smoke boundary is physical boundary which is set to prevent or reduce the spread of smoke for example the bulkhead at the aft end of the forward compartment in the ssn 688 class is smoke boundary smoke curtain is located at the side passageway door and should be rigged during fire it will reduce smoke spread between compartments when personnel or hoses pass through the door 5553213 although watertight transverse bulkheads separating compartments serve as fire and smoke boundaries fire and smoke boundaries generally cannot be set within compartments such as the engine room and missile compartment since complete bulkheads and decks do not exist 5553214 the boundary of certain spaces within compartment such as auxiliary machinery room radio and ecm room and sonar control room are generally of sufficient tightness to serve as fire and smoke boundary doors and hatches serving such spaces should be kept closed during fire to minimize fire and smoke spread 5553215 to retard the spread of smoke from fire smoke stops are installed in frame bays at deck edges in the forward compartment in the ssn 21 class the smoke stop is fume tight barrier of flexible sheet material installed between the deck edge and the hull the flexible barrier material is installed on each of the 3 platform levels along the length of the forward compartment the smoke stops will help to control vertical fire spread from fire in the lower levels 555322 ventilating systems 5553221 ventilating modes the ventilation system which includes vent ducts fan coil units and fans circulates clean conditioned atmosphere throughout the submarine the recirculate mode is closed loop operation which provides the conditioned atmosphere in the ship while keeping the ships atmosphere completely isolated from the outside the recirculate mode is the normal submerged operating mode of the ventilation system the emergency ventilate mode is the ventilation means used for evacuation of specific compartment or compartments of atmospheric contaminants such as smoke toxic gas or other objectionable gases in this open loop mode supply of fresh air is brought into the ship through the snorkel induction system while air from the contaminated space is exhausted overboard using either the diesel generator or lp blower surface ventilate is an open loop operating mode that is normally used when surfaced for an extended period in calm seas and when in port 5553222 fire emergency when submarine is in fire emergency immediate action must be taken to isolate the unaffected compartments and secure the ventilation system in accordance with the fire bill smoke from relatively small fire can completely fill the entire ship in short time normally class b fire should be completely extinguished reflash watch stationed and search for hot spots with the nfti completed before preparations for emergency ventilation of the affected compartment are commenced for class or c fire emergency ventilation may commence after the fire is reported out as defined in the glossary see paragraph 55535102 however the presence of heavy smoke and heat in the compartment may dictate venting the heat and smoke overboard to assist the fire party in combatting the fire the ships installed ventilation system should normally not be used in the burning compartment as the intense heat may cause secondary fires along the ventilation path in nonaffected compartments c0053c0053c0053c0045c0051c0050c0046c0050c0046c0050c0046c0049 c0032c0032the decision to ventilate the burning compartment using the ships ventilation system before the fire is out will be made by the commanding officer see paragraph 555358 for key factors to consider in the decision to ventilate prior to fire extinguishments9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0050c0045c0050555323 trim firemain system 5553231 auxiliary function of the trim system the trim system consists of pumps

energized electrical equipment in place of co 2 unless necessary so as to avoid fouling of electrical and electronic components dry chemical may be used as first aid fire control measure to effect flame knockdown on class fire however seawater or afff will be required to complete extinguishment 5553316 gas pressure cartridge the co 2 gas pressure cartridge supplies the propellant force to discharge dry chemical onto the fire co 2 is released through the gas tube when the puncture lever is depressed the disk which is punctured by this operation is also safety seal disk which will rupture at 4050 to 4500 psi internal pressure this disk is held in position by retaining nut which is hollow to accommodate the puncture pin consequently discharge of co 2 due to disk rupture or puncture of unattached cartridges will be directional and unless precautionary measures are taken will cause the cartridge to become missile for this reason an antirecoil cap is installed for shipment and storage this cap must remain in place until the cartridge is installed on the extinguisher warning do not exchange the safety disk of co 2 extinguisher and the co 2 gas pressure cartridge used with the pkp extinguisher the safety disk furnished for co 2 extinguisher cylinder valves is smaller in diameter than the dry chemical extinguisher cartridge disk and will easily go into the disk recess the co 2 extinguisher disk however is thinner and the hole in the dry chemical extinguisher gas pressure cartridge retaining nut is larger consequently the rupture pressure will be less than 2650 psi use of co2 extinguisher disks as replacement for dry chemical co 2 cartridge disks will result in an unsafe cartridge the alteration of disks intended for use with dry chemical co 2 gas pressure cartridges to fit co2 extinguisher valves will result in unsafe co 2 extinguisher cylinders used cartridges should normally be returned for recharge and replacement of safety disks if cartridges are recharged in the field the safety disk and retaining nut must be obtained from the extinguisher manufacturer 555332 carbon dioxide extinguishers 5553321 general portable co 2 fire

mile24652 to vapor secure small fuel spill to prevent fire to extinguish small class b fire including deep fat fryer fire to extinguish small class fire and for use in standing fire watch during hotwork afff extinguishers are typically located throughout the submarine 5553332 description the portable afff fire extinguisher is stainless steel cylinder that stores 212 gallons of premixed solution of afff concentrate and fresh water see figure 555333 it is pressurized with air to 100 psi at 70 c0095f and weighs approximately 28 pounds when fully charged afff is discharged from the bottom of the cylinder through the siphon tube extinguisher valve and discharge hose to the nozzle the solution undergoes an expansion of about 65 to 1 when passing through the nozzle which produces around 16 gallons of expanded afffwater solution foam after discharge the afff fire extinguisher has 55 to 65 second continuous discharge time and an initial range of 15 feet which decreases during discharge 5553333 operation for use against deep fat fryer fire see paragraph 555363 to vapor secure small fuel spill and for use against small class or class b fire the following guidance applies c0097c0046the afff fire extinguisher is intended for use on class fires and class b pool fires it is not recommended for use on class c fires however on class c fire afff extinguishers can be used if the nozzle is kept at least four feet from the energized electrical source c0098c0046before approaching the fire ensure that the pressure indicated on the pressure gage is within the indicated range and pull the pull pin on the extinguisher valve hold the extinguisher by the carrying handle with one hand and hold the discharge hose just above the nozzle with the other hand to operate squeeze the operating lever to the carrying handle the extinguisher is capable of continuous operation or multiple bursts c0099c0046afff extinguishes class fires by cooling it is superior to water because afff has added wetting and penetrating ability for small class fires apply the afff to the base source of the fire c0100c0046afff extinguishes class b fire or protects an unignited fuel spill by floating on the flammable liquid and forming vapor seal one afff extinguisher will effectively extinguish 20 square feet 412 feet by 412 feet of flammable liquid fire to apply start 15 feet away and sweep the afff from side to side at the base of the fire one afff extinguisher can be used to vapor secure fuel spill to prevent fire up to 40 square feet approximately 6 feet by 6 feet in size the fuel spill should be confined within direct stream reach of the afff extinguisher and entirely visible fuel spill which is spread over an area larger than 40 square feet is not accessible or entirely visible

class each fire hose station has one ready service hose of 50foot length and one unconnected 50foot hose faked on the hose rack underneath the ready service hose the ready service hose is made up to the fireplug and nozzle is attached to the other end the hose is always faked in the rack with the ends hanging downward so that the couplings and nozzles are immediately at hand the bottom of the folds should be at least 6 inches above the deck to prevent chafing the hose see figure 555334 55533552 stowing hose hose to be stowed is rolled into coil and sometimes tied with small line the coil is made by first laying the hose out on deck and doubling it so that the male end reaches 3 to 5 feet from the female end the rolling is started at the fold which is rolled inward on the part of the hose leading to the male end the completed coil then has the female end of the hose on the outside and covering the male end of the hose the male coupling is therefore protected from damage to its thread the double roll also allows the female couple to be connected and the hose run out without twisting see figure 555335 figure 555335 c0046c0032c0032preparing fire hose for stowage 5553356 hose maintenance the synthetic jacketed soft hose milh24606 will not deteriorate due to prolonged exposure of the jacket to water continuous exposure to fuels and lubricants will soften the rubber components of fire hose however these effects can be negated by washing the exposed area as soon as practical after exposure hose couplings can be damaged by excessive abuse such as being dropped or being dragged around the deck also hose fitting threads can be damaged by cross threading cotton jacket fire hose per zzh451 is obsolete if found replace with synthetic jacketed fire hose the cotton jacketed hose will suffer fungus rot if it remains wet 555336 fire hose fittings 5553361 introduction not all of the fittings discussed in this section are commonly used on submarines however the information is included to ensure familiarity with the equipment used on tenders dry docks and other support activitiess9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0051c0045c00575553362 general fire hose fittings used for assembling fire hose aboard ship consist of the female coupling the male coupling the double female coupling and the double male coupling two reducing couplings are used the straight reducing coupling and the wyegate for reducing to two small hoses the straight increasing coupling is also used all hose couplings for fire hoses on navy ships are made with uniform thread dimensions they have an unobstructed waterway that is the full diameter of the hose rubber gaskets in female couplings should not protrude into the waterway the couplings are made fast to the hose ends by means of expansion rings which are set inside the hose and forced against the coupling see figure 555336 figure 555336 c0046c0032c0032fire hose couplings 5553363 double female coupling the double female coupling either 212 or 112 inches in diameter is furnished to connect two male couplings to make jumper hose assemblies and to connect male coupling to fireplug both ends are identical with swivels and gaskets see figure 555337 figure 555337 c0046c0032c0032double female coupling 5553364 double male coupling the double male coupling 212 or 112 inches in diameter is furnished to connect two female couplings and to make nozzle connections on female outlets see figure 555338 5553365 straight reducer coupling the straight reducer coupling serves to reduce 212 inch size fireplug or fire hose to 112 inch size it has female threads at the large opening and male threads at the small opening see figure 555339 5553366 straight increaser coupling the straight increaser coupling serves to increase 112 inch size to 212 inch size either on fireplug or fire hose it has female threads at the small opening and male threads at the large opening see figure 5553310s9086s3stm020ch555v2r5

inch hoses the standard wyegate is equipped with two stop valves so that either hose can be controlled independently of the other see figure 5553311 where wyegate is installed on fireplug with one hose connected the outlet gate with hose will normally be left open as telltale for leaking fireplug valve close the open outlet before opening the fireplug 5553368 spanner wrench to facilitate the

none of the preceding steps corrects the discharge problem it is probable that the trim system pressure is too low if this is the case the firefighter should immediately inform the man in charge at the scene the man in charge at the scene should request the chief of the watch to verify that the trim system lineup and operation is in accordance with the approved procedures for supplying pressurized water for firefighting 5553372 friction loss the firefighter does not have to calculate friction losses it is only necessary for the firefighter to understand what happens when he connects additional hose reduces single hose to two smaller hoses or makes other adjustments although friction loss through hose varies with the flow rate it can be roughly estimated for 112 inch hose friction loss is roughly 25 psi per 100 feet at 100 gpm one hose line 5553373 appraising the water stream in appraising the performance of stream of water from the nozzle the firefighter should take into consideration the loss of pressure in hoses resulting from the internal friction between the moving particles of water and the lining of the hose increasing the length of hoses by connecting additional hose or reducing single large hose line into smaller hose lines increases the overall friction losses friction loss not only in the hose but in the trim system piping and fittings as well accounts for much of the usual difference in pressure between the trim pumps or source tanks and the nozzles 5553374 causes for pressure loss other causes for pressure loss include clogging static head that results when pipes and hose are led upward 10 psi per 25 feet in height ruptured hoses and kinks in the hose 555338 navy varinozzles 5553381 general the navy nozzle used on seawater and afff ssn 21 hoses and on the freshwater hose reels ssn 21 is referred to as the varinozzle see figure 5553314 the spray pattern from this nozzle can be varied from straight stream through range up to at least 90 c0095 fog stream pattern some nozzles may adjust up to approximately 110 c0095 depending on the manufacturer stream patterns are changed by rotating the black shroud which surrounds the last 4 to 5 inches of the tip end of the nozzle markings are provided to indicate position settings for straight stream narrow fog 30 degrees and wide fog 90110 degrees the gallons per minute flow rate remains constant throughout the pattern range the varinozzle flow rate can also be throttled from trickle to full flow by operating the bail handle shut off table 555333 provides varinozzle stream characteristics the varinozzle produces an acceptable fog pattern down to 60 psi below 60 psi the fog pattern is not full and radiant heat protection is degraded note only the 112 inch 95 gpm flow

waterway clearances to pass typical firemain debris this feature permits the nozzleman to flush out debris if the nozzle becomes partially or fully clogged the flush setting allows higher gpm flow in distorted fog pattern there are two styles of flush mechanisms depending on the manufacturer c0097c0046on the akron style ªflushº is reached by rotating the pattern adjustment shroud past the wide fog setting until it stops at the flush marking c0098c0046the elkhart style has rotating ring about midway along the nozzle barrel with two indicated positions the normal operating setting is indicated by ª95º ª125º or ª250º depending on nozzle size and rating and the ring is held in this position by spring loaded thumb latch the flush position is reached by rotating the pattern adjustment shroud to wide fog and unlatching the flush ring and rotating it to the flush position note the pattern shroud must be in wide fog setting to achieve the maximum waterway clearance table 555333

damage control equipment and the training of the damage control party 5553432 during emergencies the dca will act as assistant casualty coordinator 555344 damage control party 5553441 general the damage control party provides personnel to respond to shipboard emergencies for fire the damage control party provides the man in charge at the scene scene leader fire teams and rapid response fire team the damage control party is typically located as follows at battle stations or during the maneuvering watch c0049c0046ssbn 726 class the forward damage control party will muster in the crews mess and the after damage control party will muster in amr 2 upper level c0050c0046other submarine classes the damage control party will muster in the crews mess b when normal underway watches are stationed ie not at battle stations nor during the maneuvering watch and an emergency occurs the damage control party of the offgoing watch section will provide and proceed to the scene of the casualty if possible the damage control party of the oncoming watch section will proceed to the crews mess muster and await instructions from control c in port the duty section damage control party will proceed to the casualty scene d selected and trained personnel shall be designated on the watch quarter and station bill within each watch section and duty section to comprise damage control partiess9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0052c0045c00505553442 man in charge at the scene the man in charge at the scene hereafter referred to as the scene leader is in charge of firefighting at the scene of fire he directs the attack against particular fire he directs deenergizing of electrical equipment as required he communicates with the casualty coordinator and receives coordinating instructions from him the senior man in the affected compartment acts as the scene leader until relieved the designated scene leader is usually the executive officer when underway or the ships duty officer when inport in case of multilevel fire the scene leader coordinates firefighting efforts in the entire compartment 55534421 the scene leader decides what resources are needed for fire team including the need for separate individual as fire team leader backup hose and nfti 5553443 fire teams each ship should designate minimum of four fire teams for underway and one for in port the number of people in each fire team will vary depending on fire conditions the number of people available and the individual ships organization 55534431 fire team leader responsibilities shall be assigned by the scene leader for every fire to either the nozzleman or to an individual whose only function is that of fire team leader separate individual is necessary as fire team leader if nfti is used separate individual as fire team leader is desirable to direct the rotation of fire team personnel the fire team leader directs the nozzleman in employment of the hose directs the hosemen asks that the hose be charged or secured selects the spray pattern to be used and directs the rotation of fire team personnel fire team leader should not be responsible for more than one fire team 55534432 the scene leader determines the number of hosemen necessary to man each hose typical hose manning in addition to the fire team leader when assigned separately is nozzleman and two hosemen for 112 inch hose line the last hoseman operates the fireplug as required 55534433 generally the nozzleman works the hardest and will need to be relieved before the hosemen rotating the nozzleman and the hosemen can extend the endurance of the fire team 55534434 the nfti operator when assigned should be senior experienced individual he should don an oba if available and the maximum personnel protection available and proceed to the scene of the fire and report to the scene leader 5553444 rapid response fire team as discussed in section 35 submarine fire fighting depends on an immediate and escalating attack on the fire the rapid response fire team fills the gap between the capabilities of the discovering crewman and the fire team and is of the highest importance in maintaining an unrelenting attack on the fire each ship should designate rapid response fire team for underway as minimum the following functions will be performed immediately proceed to the fire and combat the fire with portable extinguishers or hosereel when available b establish communications with control c rig fire hoses d see additional discussion in paragraph 55535322 the rapid response fire team should be relieved as soon as possible by the fire team discussed above 555345 fire team equipment 5553451 personnel protection if fire has been burning for any length of time it can reach temperatures exceeding 2000 c0095f 1093c0095c and

retreat or may be burned or overcome by smoke if they become casualties then they reduce an already limited firefighting force the scene leader makes the decision to request the firefighters ensemble factors he considers are tenability of the area stage of the fire and success of the initial attack the scene leader should also consider the time required for personnel to dress out in protective clothing and equipment the greater time required to completely dress out allows time for the fire to grow in certain situations rapid response of less protected personnel may result in quick knockdown of fire for large well established fires eg machinery space fuel fire adequate protection of personnel is generally required before sustained attack is made the optimum time to don the firefighters ensemble is about 2 minutes with another 1 to 2 minutes required to don an oba under these conditions the time to don full personnel protection will range from 212 minutes to 5 minutes under these conditions standby personnel should assist fire team personnel in donning protective equipment this reduces response time 55534511 c0080c0114c0111c0116c0101c0099c0116c0105c0118c0101

highest possible point or navy issue coveralls breathing apparatus scba or oba or eab mask antiflash hoods and protective gloves if the firefighters ensemble is not available multilayered clothing will provide improved protection the most important aspect is to protect all normally exposed areas of the body with some type of clothing areas particularly susceptible to steam burns include hands wrists neck knees ankles and feet 55534512 c0070c0105c0114c0101c0102c0105c0103c0104c0116c0101c0114c0039c0115 c0069c0110c0115c0101c0109c0098c0108c0101 the firefighters ensemble shown in figure 555341 consists of firefighters coveralls firefighters antiflash hood and firefighters gloves all designed to protect the firefighter from the heat generated by growing preflashover fire for flashover or fully developed fire the ffe provides only few seconds of protection for escape on submarines the firefighters helmet and boots are not provided with the ffe two layers of flashhoods are recommended with the ffe to increase neck protection the firefighters glove size should be selected for loose hand and finger fit to reduce heat transfer from continuous material contact and allow glove adjustment at hot points additional hand protection can be gained by wearing flash glove as an extra inner liner to an oversized firefighters glove while waiting to enter the fire area the ffe coveralls should only be donned to the waist tying the coverall arms around the waist rubber coats or unlined rubber or plastic gloves should not be worn next to bare skin as this commonly invites burns breathing apparatus should be activated before fire hoses are advanced into the fire area oba or scba operating times should be kept by designated persons remote from the scene in fighting major long term fires which may occur in port firefighters should leave the fire area after 30 minutes in conjunction with the breathing apparatus alarm and ensembles recycled to fresh personnel to minimize personnel heat stress in high heat environment personnel endurance in an ffe may be 10 minutes or less personnel in an ffe may be forced to evacuate due to hot hands hot feet or other local hot spots on the body in training common sense should be used to judge how long firefighter should be kept in the suit 55534513 c0065c0100c0106c0117c0115c0116c0105c0110c0103 c0080c0114c0111c0116c0101c0099c0116c0105c0111c0110 the scene leader may adjust personnel protection as the situation changes for example as progress is made during the attack the fire is under control and spaces are cooled endurance of relief personnel will be improved by wearing only engineering coveralls rather than the ffe coveralls 55534514 c0069c0120c0099c0101c0115c0115c0105c0118c0101 c0072c0101c0097c0116 c0069c0120c0112c0111c0115c0117c0114c0101 when clothing in contact with skin becomes wet the water or water vapor formed may become heated enough to cause severe discomfort and burns firefighter reaching this condition should immediately retreat to safe area and be treated in accordance with paragraph 55535610g if rapid escape from heat is not possible he should be wetted down on site to prevent or reduce burns great care should be exercised in the decision of wetting down the firefighter to prevent or reduce burns if the firefighters clothing is dry and hot enough to burn the man initial wetting could scald him if clothing is already wet and burning the man additional wetting probably will help however emphasis should be placed on remaining dry for as long as possible and switching to dry clothing after leaving the fire area for relief when compartment fires have reached ªflashoverº the firefighters ensemble will only offer sufficient protection to permit time to escape fortunately fully developed postflashover fires are not common on submarines at sea but have occurred in port see paragraph 55531913 for complete description of all navy personal protection equipment see nstm chapter 077 s9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0052c0045c0052figure 555341 c0046c0032c0032firefighters ensemble 5553452 naval firefighters thermal imager nfti the naval firefighters thermal imager nfti is device that allows the user to see through dense smoke and light steam by sensing the difference in infrared radiation given off by objects with temperature difference of at least 4 degrees fahrenheit see figure 555342 tvlike black and white image is displayed on the rear of the nfti when looking through the nfti the image presented looks like negative picture with hotter objects appearing lighter than cooler objects it can be used to investigate reported fires b locate the seat of the fires9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0052c0045c0053figure 555342

firefighting using the naval firefighters thermal imagerº as pin 805433 55534521 stowage the nfti should be stowed in its box in cabinet or strapped down to the deck to protect it from shock one nfti should be stowed in the forward part of the ship and the second unit if available should be stowed in another convenient far separated secure space it is important that the imager be stowed at moderate temperatures prolonged exposure to temperatures in excess of 140 c0095f will severely damage the nfti unit nevertheless the nfti can be used in high temperature spaces 55534522 deployment the primary function of the nfti is to help locate the fire when smoke or darkness restricts visibility the nfti also may be useful in assessing temperatures from outside space and behind habitability bulkhead sheathing and in searching smoke filled compartment for injured personnel following knockdown of the fire the nfti can be useful to the reflash watch and to personnel overhauling the fire to locate any remaining hot spots the nfti should be brought to the scene whenever the fire is severe enough to require that firefighters wear ensembles and whenever requested by the scene leader the nfti is deployed as directed by the scene leader the nfti should be operated only by qualified personnel if the fire team is directed to use the nfti it should be carried by the fire team leader 55534523 operation the nfti operator as designated by the scene leader should turn on the nfti red button and check the battery status lights before entering smokefilled space with fresh batteries five leds9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0052c0045c0054lights should be illuminated in the lower left hand corner of the viewing screen as batteries weaken lights will go out it is good practice to change the battery pack when more than one light is out in addition verify that the nfti is operating in ªchopº mode not in ªpanº mode by checking the status of the blue button on the front of the nfti the ªchopº mode is best for firefighting the ªchopº mode allows the user to focus on one area while holding the unit still but provides less than sharp image the ªpanº mode provides greater sensitivity to small differences in temperature but the nfti must be kept in motion or the image will white out 555345231 when using the nfti it has been found that slow steady advancement along with periodic scanning of the scene during an approach helps the operator to judge distances better sidetoside scan also provides important information on hazards in the area and the best direction in which to proceed an occasional vertical scan will detect hazards above deck level ie cable way or overhead fires 55534524 limitations water dirt or soot will distort the nftis image if deposited on the viewing lens if this should happen wipe the lens carefully with soft clean cloth if the units internal temperature gets too high the picture degrades and gets lighter the screen will turn uniformly gray or white if the unit is exposed to excessive heat the nfti if not otherwise damaged will return to normal operation when removed to cooler area 555345241 battery pack requires 10 ªaaº alkaline batteries with fresh batteries battery pack has life of approximately 6090 minutes to conserve power turn the nfti off when it is not in use allow one minute for warmup when it is turned back on spare battery packs should be stored with the nfti the nfti operator should carry at least one spare battery pack with him if viewing images are distorted gray or dark to the extent that the nftis performance is not satisfactory it is good practice to verify that the lens and viewing screen are clean and if not wipe them with dry clean soft cloth b check the battery pack to ensure adequate charge c operate in cooler place such as closer to the deck or d move out of the fire area to cooler location the nfti may not be fully operable topside due to electromagnetic interference consider this possibility when operating the nfti topside the nfti should not be pointed at the sun doing this will temporarily saturate its sensor and the viewing screen will white out the nfti cannot be used to locate fires by viewing through glass windows glass is opaque to infrared radiation and thus the nfti can not see through the window 555345242 the nfti operator should stay low to avoid hot gases high in the space and to maintain clear image with the nfti when pointed directly at large fire the units sensor may become temporarily saturated the picture will return if the camera is pointed toward cooler scene better image is given if the fire is kept at the edge of the cameras field of view the spray from fire hose nozzle may form an optical barrier which the thermal imager can not penetrate this is sometimes problem when fan patterns are used by the nozzleman on the nfti screen this appears as an opaque black curtain if the nozzleman temporarily redirects the spray away from the fire the nftis field of view is improved when approaching large fire hot gases flowing out of the fire space and along the passageway overhead will appear as white flashes through the camera the operator must be aware of this and not mistake these flashes for flamess9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0053c0045c0049section 35 firefighting tactics 555351 general 5553511 fires on submarines are unique because the ship is functionally closed pressure vessel fire will heat the atmosphere raising the internal pressure in accordance with gas expansion laws additionally the fire compartment must normally be maintained in operation 555352 initial actions 5553521 the initial actions by the person who discovers fire can make the difference between controllable fire and one which threatens the very life of the ship even small fire can create untenable conditions within space in as little as two minutes any crew member discovering fire or indication of fire must sound the alarm immediately the report of fire and its location compartment name upper level lower level etc must reach the officer of the deck by whatever method available such as 4 mc messenger sound powered phones or other announcing system following that the discovering crewman or rapid response fire team will normally attack the fire using portable extinguishers or hosereels when available before advancing fire hoses warning personnel not wearing obas or eab masks should evacuate smokefilled spaces toxic fire gases can cause unconsciousness and death all nonessential personnel shall leave the fire area the initial attack can be made by personnel with limited or protection incipient fires should be attacked by personnel in the immediate area using portable fire extinguishers portable afff extinguishers are provided for class and class b fires potassium bicarbonate pkp and carbon dioxide co 2 extinguishers are provided for class b and class c fires respectively however the immediate use of pkp or co 2 extinguishers on incipient class fire while hoses are being advanced may control fire and prevent major incident the simultaneous discharge of two portable extinguishers onto fire is more than double the effectiveness of discharging one after the other if the fire is large located in energized electrical equipment fed by pressurized fuel source or oxygen leak or the fire origin is unknown then initial actions should include isolation of affected systems 555353 fire attack 5553531 reports from fire scene the fire characteristics fire location resources available and fire growth all determine the overall plan of attack reports to be made from the scene are 1 location of fire 2 class of fire 3 identification of the man in charge at the scene 4 action taken to isolate and combat the fire 5 fire contained 6 fire out 7 reflash watch set 8 fire overhauled 9 ventilation recommendations 10 compartment ventilated smoke status 11 compartment tested for oxygen 12 compartment tested for flammable gases and 13 compartment tested for toxic gases additional reports from the scene include number and extent of injured personnel and damaged equipment refer to the glossary of terms for definitions of ªfire containedº and ªfire outº 5553532 fire attack steps whether one manned hose or multiple manned hoses attack fire the steps are the same size up evaluate the fire b attack the fire c rig for fire and general emergency isolate affected equipment systems and spaces in accordance with casualty proceduress9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0053c0045c0050d protect spaces exposed to the fire attacking the fire should occur simultaneously with the other steps the following paragraphs discuss each step and some of the judgment factors that come into play when formulating plan for attacking fire 55535321 size up evaluate the fire determine the location of the fire for fires involving significant smoke spread often only general location can be determined initially more precise definition will require men with obas or eabs and thermal imagers to investigate further discolored or blistered paint or smoke puffing from cracks or penetrations of nonstructural bulkheads are indications of fire on the other side of the bulkhead determine what is burning the class of fire and what other combustibles are at risk of igniting determine the preferred type of portable extinguisher pkp co 2 or afff to use on the fire simultaneously hoses should be rigged and advanced to the scene determine what systems should be isolated 55535322 attack the fire the attack should be multistage effort with smooth uninterrupted transition between stages 555353221 the first stage is an immediate attack by the persons discovering the fire sound the alarm and if conditions permit grab the nearest portable fire extinguisher or hosereel when available and attempt to extinguish the fire or gain immediate control and prevent or minimize the fire spread consideration is given to donning an eab or to determine if adequate protective clothing is worn in this stage come as you are and attack the fire to the extent feasible 555353222 the next stage is continuation of the initial attack by the rapid response fire team upon hearing the word ªfireº the rapid response fire team members proceed immediately to the scene and continue the attack with portable extinguishers or hose reel when available rig fire hoses and establish communication with the controlling station these team members don eabs and take protective measures simultaneously with fighting the fire 555353223 the fire team relieving the rapid response fire team is the third stage of the attack the fire team advances charged hoses into the immediate fire area if not already being used with the nozzleman in an eab if possible an oba or scba and all members with flashhoods and flashgloves nozzleman and hosemen wearing eabs should be replaced with oba or scba personnel as they become available 555353224 the final stage if needed is the fire team aggressively continuing the attack with the appropriate fire team members in breathing apparatus and wearing the firefighters ensemble ffe the nfti operator is also at the scene in breathing apparatus to assist the fire team as directed by the scene leader 555353225 it is strongly emphasized that an aggressive hoseline attack should immediately follow an initial attack with portable extinguishers the rigging of hoselines should not be delayed during the initial attack with portable extinguishers nor should the use of the hoselines be delayed once the initial attack fails to extinguish the fire in direct attack firefighters advance into the immediate fire area and apply the extinguishing agent directly onto the seat of the fire access to the fire may be straightforward in the early stages but heat gases and smoke from an advanced fire make access increasingly difficult if high temperature denies close access to the fire area from one direction but the burning material can be seen aggressive attempts should be made to apply water from another access or direction 55535323 rig for fire and general emergency every effort should be made to secure and isolate those systems and equipment that are the root cause of fire or have the potential to feed the intensity of fire fires fed by pressurized fuel source or oxygen leak normally can not be extinguished until the fuel source or oxygen is secured in general when class or class c fire occurs affected equipment and systems are to be isolated except for firefighting equipment lighting and ic circuits complete electrical isolation will be very difficult due to the number of cables terminating within and traversing space to the extent possible all electrical equipment except lighting and ic circuits should bes9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0053c0045c0051secured from outside the affected space at power distribution panel load center or even at the electric plant control panel if necessary the purpose of securing power is to promote the safety of the firefighter and to reduce ignition sources in the fire space effective firefighting should start before electrical power is secured b the decision to secure lighting must be made on scene by the scene leader normally the fire team will benefit from improved visibility and therefore lighting should be left energized lighting should be secured if it is determined that an actual hazard to the firefighter such as arcing or sparking exists c when fire is discovered immediate action should be taken to secure the ships ventilation system smoke from relatively small fire may completely fill the entire ship in short time therefore the compartment must be isolated to keep the fire and smoke contained as the fire attack progresses it may be necessary to restart ventilation in the affected compartment before the fire is out see paragraph 555358 for guidance on ventilation d set smoke boundaries smoke curtains are provided on submarines at watertight doors between compartments to reduce smoke spread in the ssn 21 class forward compartment smoke stops are provided in most frame bays at the deck edge to block vertical heat and smoke movement and retard flame spread up through frame bays after fire has been discovered and fire team sent to the scene smoke curtains should be set at doors in these boundaries as directed by the man in charge based on his judgment of potential effectiveness curtains should be checked periodically to ensure they have tight seal 55535324 protect spaces exposed to the fire the scene leader must be alert to the rapid vertical fire spread that can occur outboard in frame bays he should direct search for vertical fire spread the persons conducting the search should recommend to the scene leader any further action such as manning hoselines on an upper level deenergizing equipment or isolating systems removing combustibles fire outboard on lower level must be treated as multilevel fire such fire should be reported and acted upon on all levels of the compartment with the same urgency as the original fire the scene leader may have to move to different level to better assess the multilevel fire and direct the attack many fires can also spread by heat conduction through decks or nonstructural bulkheads without mechanical breach if fire spreads cascading casualties occur and damage control parties are driven away from their tasks in casualty involving flashedover fire ignition of combustibles located in the compartment directly above the fire may occur within as little as 3 minutes and within 5 minutes for other combustibles in the space in adjacent compartments on the same deck ignition of combustibles in direct contact with bulkheads may occur in as little as 7 minutes and within 20 minutes for other combustibles in the space fire spread through frame bay openings can be even faster exposure protection involves protecting uninvolved areas surrounding the affected space including above and below typical exposure protection includes using hose streams to cool nonstructural bulkheads and decks wetting combustibles cooling flammable compressed gas cylinders and moving or cooling ordnance cooling decks of spaces above the affected space is particularly important 5553533 typical response to class fire this paragraph shows how the crew response relates to the submarine compartment fire dynamics for moderately severe class fire scenario see figure figure 555319 some typical fire growth and crew response times are provided below for fire in the lower level of the forward compartment these times are also illustrated in figure 555351 the actual compartment fire dynamics will vary significantly for every fire the times shown here cannot be expected to stay the same for all fires 0 the fire starts and is detected and located 15 seconds initiate attack with portable extinguishers 30 seconds to 1 minute visibility in the upper level is lost due to smoke 1 to 3 minutes unprotected personnel driven by heat from the scene this time can be extended by as9086s3stm020ch555v2r5

hose handling is to accomplish rapid placement of hose at the desired location ready for use and to provide mobility during the fire as changing conditions necessitate the following practices can more efficiently accomplish these objectives 5553542 c0065c0067c0084c0073c0079c0078 c0084c0079 c0069c0078c0083c0085c0082c0069 c0082c0069c0065c0068c0073c0078c0069c0083c0083 hose properly faked or rolled to

additional hoseman near the nozzle normally designated as ªnumber one hosemanº b the function of the number one hoseman backing up the nozzleman is push the hose forward to compensate for the nozzle reaction force pushing opposite the direction of flow b hold the weight of the hose and c move the hose left right up down to assist the nozzleman in directing the stream the latter requires team work as in lifting the hose behind the nozzleman when he is directing the stream down or moving to the left when he is directing the stream to the right the hosemans actions should not be fighting the nozzlemans efforts the hosemans position is as close to the nozzleman as possible without impeding his movementss9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0053c0045c00545553544

coupling additional personnel if available should be located at the midlength of each 50 foot section of hose this procedure reduces friction due to dragging on the deck and prevents couplings from being snagged on door openings or other obstructions hoseman approximately every 25 feet along hose is adequate additional persons can slow down the evolution inhibit nozzleman mobility and create higher accident potential b hose should be advanced to the nearest practical location of use prior to charging with water water filled hose is heavy and bulky and slows down the advancement evolution c as soon as the nozzleman is in position and the dry hose completely off the rack the nozzleman asks for water from the last hoseman as the water fills the hose hosemen straighten any kinks and check hose couplings for leaks opening the nozzle slightly will allow air to escape in addition once the decision is made to use hoselines the scene leader must inform control so that the trim system operator can maintain the flow and pressure required for firefighting as well as compensate to maintain trim when submerged d it is best to place hosemen on the same side of the hose this principle allows easier maneuverability in narrow areas and makes space available for equipment and personnel to pass along the hose similarly when passing two hoses through door hoses can be moved with minimum interference if the two hoses are passed side by side down the center of the access with all the hosemen for each hose positioned so that the two hoses pass between them and the other hosemen when bringing charged hose down an inclined ladder one method is to carry the hose over ones shoulder with the nozzle in front in one hand proper hose tending by the hosemen will ensure that the nozzleman on the ladder maintains his balance 5553545 c0084c0069c0078c0068c0073c0078c0071 c0084c0072c0069 c0072c0079c0083c0069 once the hose is deployed and charged the hoseman nearest the nozzle works closely with the nozzleman helping the nozzleman to position and direct the hose the hoseman farthest from the nozzle feeds or retrieves hose as required by the nozzleman and operate the fire plug as required they can move along the hose as needed or they may be stationed at critical location such as the door or hatch into the fire space b if hose tending will allow the hosemen farthest from the nozzle can function as communications link between the fire team leader and the scene leader c to avoid unnecessary heat stress due to added time and hose handling in the hot environment and to minimize the delays between attacks on the fire the attack hose may be left in the fire space with the nozzle closed rather than moved in and out as fire teams are changed however if conditions permit every attempt should be made to relieve fire team members on station so that the firefighting effort can continue without interruption if the space is being abandoned the hose should be withdrawn so that the accesses to the space can be secured 5553546 c0070c0082c0069c0083c0072c0087c0065c0084c0069c0082 c0072c0079c0083c0069 c0082c0069c0069c0076c0083 hose reel ssn 21 class can be activated and effectively used by one man or by the rapid response fire team in an initial quick attack the noncollapsible hose on the reel can be charged with all or some of the hose still on the reel it is easier to handle than standard fire hose because of its smaller size lighter weight and lower nozzle reaction force when flowing water the noncollapsible hose should be advanced to the scene by first ensuring the nozzle is closed then opening the hose reel cutoff valve thereby charging the hose and then advancing to the scene the assistance of hoseman may be advisable at ladders or other changes of direction 555355 nozzle handling 5553551 c0078c0079c0090c0090c0076c0069c0077c0065c0078c0039c0083 c0077c0073c0083c0083c0073c0079c0078 the mission of the nozzleman is threefold he must direct the stream where desired he must do so with the appropriate pattern and at the appropriate flow rate all three of theses9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0053c0045c0055actions are subject to continuous change as conditions dictate the primary factors that affect how this mission is accomplished are type of breathing apparatus worn interference with hose and the physical build strength and position standing crawling lying crouched of the nozzleman because of physical differences between individuals and variations in fire scenarios there is specific nozzle handling method required to accomplish the nozzlemans mission the correct way for nozzleman to handle nozzle is the method which permits him to accomplish his mission in the most physically comfortable manner figure 555352 shows some acceptable hose and nozzle handling methods see paragraph 555338 for nozzle information 5553552 c0072c0065c0078c0068 c0080c0076c0065c0067c0069c0077c0069c0078c0084 the nozzleman should devote one hand to holding the nozzle and directing the stream the other hand should be available to alternate between the pattern shroud and the bail shut off handle to control patternflow variations as appropriate this hand knuckles up on top of the nozzle is typically the most comfortable and provides for the least movement between pattern shroud and bail handle when using tactic of short bursts of water this hand would typically be kept on the bail for continuous flow tactics keep the hand on the shroud for instant pattern variations and to assist in aiming the nozzle 5553553 c0072c0079c0083c0069 c0080c0076c0065c0067c0069c0077c0069c0078c0084 the nozzle may be held with the hose over the shoulder or under an arm whichever works best to provide the necessary control warning when holding the hose line under an arm the oba breathing bag on that side may be collapsed if the hose is pressed against it 5553554 c0080c0073c0083c0084c0079c0076 c0071c0082c0073c0080 on the 112 inch varinozzle the

manning hose in addition to those nearby it is important to keep the nozzle end of hose line under control loss of control can knock the hose crew down and direct the stream on others or critical electrical equipment loss of hose control can create whip capable of causing severe injuries and equipment damage loss of control results from excessive nozzle reaction force greater than 100 psi at the nozzle or from losing the hand grip slippery gloves muscle cramps fatigue another crew member lets go when nozzleman senses that he is losing control he may apply several techniques to reduce reaction force and regain control the obvious technique is to shut down when flow must continue the nozzleman should throttle down the flow or go to wide angle fog these actions are quickly performed when keeping one hand on the bail or the pattern shroud at all times the operation of adjusting to wide angle fog or throttling back should also be used when personnel manning the hose are making significant changes in position climbing over objects or operating on ladders when it is not feasible or safe to shut down the same tactic should be applied when changing nozzlemen while not shutting down 5553556 c0082c0069c0071c0065c0073c0078c0073c0078c0071 c0078c0079c0090c0090c0076c0069 c0067c0079c0078c0084c0082c0079c0076 if fire team loses their grip and hose line becomes thrashing whip three methods of regaining control are 1 shut off the flow at the fireplug to stopreduce flow in order to safely approach and shut off the nozzle 2 take control of the hoseline at nonmoving point and fold hose twice in ªzº or ªzkinkº to stop flow 3 take control of the hose line at nonmoving point and advance along the line toward the nozzle regaining control of the line while advancing 5553557

addresses compartment fires that involve predominantly class material these compartments include living spaces administrative and support spaces shops and storerooms other portions of this chapter deal with compartment fires where class b and class c fires are of major concern many spaces that contain predominant amount of class material may also contain limited quantities of flammable liquids for fully involved compartment fires the contribution of limited quantities of flammable liquids to fully involved compartment fire will not change class firefighting tactics in spaces such as shops and cleaning gear rooms class b materials may exist in aerosol spray cans when exposed to fire these containers may explode and be propelled into the air spreading burning fluids and creating safety hazard to the firefighters 5553562 c0083c0072c0079c0067c0075 c0072c0065c0090c0065c0082c0068 nearly all spaces contain electrical cables and fixtures however the shock hazard to the firefighter is low this is due to frequent use of watertight or spraytight enclosures cable insulation electrical circuit protection devices and low voltage 120 volt electrical service historically the primary shock hazard is caused by direct contact between the firefighter or hose nozzle and an electrically energized object and not by electrical conduction via the hose stream see paragraph 555362 5553563 c0083c0080c0065c0067c0069 c0069c0078c0084c0082c0089 when entering space the attack team leader typically should be the first man into the space either the space adjoining the fire or the fire space to look for fire and assess conditions he should enter without hose so that if conditions do not permit entry of the attack team there will be fewer people and less equipment to back

also warp and jam in their frames hand tools such as crow bar may be required to open jammed closures wearing flash gloves under firefighters gloves or use of hot mats may be required to protect hands

three distinct techniques available during direct fire attack direct attack on the seat of the fire fog attack to control the fire and direct attack from the access after assessing the fire space condition the team leader must determine the best technique to use direct attack at the seat of the fire when direct access to the seat of the fire is available the preferred method is to advance to the seat of the fire and apply water directly onto the seat of the fire for extinguishment see figure 555353 and paragraph 5553565 access to the fire may be straight forward in the early stage of the fire but heat gases gases and smoke from an advanced fire make access increasingly difficult b fog attack to gain control of fire when entry can be made into the fire space but direct access to the seat of the fire is not possible firefighters may use fog attack to gain control of the fire see figure 555354 and paragraph 5553566 the following conditions indicate the use of fog attack to gain control 1 where overhead gases are burning known as rollover 2 where the seat of the fire is obstructed and water streams cannot be applied directly to the seat 3 where multiple seats of the fire are growing within compartment such that one seat of the fire would grow out of control while water is being applied to another seat of the fire c direct attack from access if high temperature denies access to the fire space but the burning material can be reached by hose stream from an access water can be applied to the seat of the fire from the access see figure 555356 and paragraph 5553567 d if conditions become too severe for these direct attack techniques the attack team must withdraw and use other techniques such as indirect attack or venting to improve conditions to allow direct attack see figure 555355 5553565 c0068c0073c0082c0069c0067c0084 c0065c0084c0084c0065c0067c0075 c0079c0078 c0083c0069c0065c0084 c0079c0070 c0084c0072c0069 c0070c0073c0082c0069 when direct access to the seat of the fire is available firefighters advance into the immediate fire area and apply water directly onto the seat of the fire see figure 555353 the direct attack technique involves application of short bursts several seconds of water with narrow angle fog or straight stream nozzle pattern onto the seat of the fire the nozzleman pauses and lets the resultant steam pass over and subside during this pause the firefighter listens for noise to help locate fire after the steam has subsided water is again applied in short burst the duration of the short burst is function of the amount of steam production as steam production lessens greater duration water burst may be used as the firefighter moves forward and attempts to directly attack the fire or heat source water should only be used when the firefighter is faced with the fire or when the firefighter can not approach closer due to radiant heat the practice of using continual water flow from all hoses when making interior entry should be discouraged this does nothing more than disturb the thermal balance in the compartment which causes large amounts of steam to be produced before the firefighter has chance to advance on the fire reduces visibility to the point where he can not see where he is going or where the source of the fire is and creates potential flooding and stability problemss9086s3stm020ch555v2r5

c0051c0053c0045c0049c0053b full water flow from nozzles during space entry has the additional drawback of wetting the firefighters outside and inside their fire suits in general firefighters should avoid getting wet inside their garments since any contact with hot fire gases when wet will result in water vapor burn as the moisture inside the garment is heated c hose streams should be directed at the area of combustion not blindly into smoke the fire area may be visible particularly once space has been vented if the thermal balance of rising smoke and gases has not been disrupted flames and smoldering areas may be located by the use of the naval firefighters thermal imager with the operator providing directions to the nozzlemen burning areas may also be located by trials and error using short bursts of water into the suspected fire location and listening for the crackling popping sound of water hitting the fire d overhead fires such as in cables fed from burning combustion gases generated from the fire below will be quickly extinguished as soon as fires at deck level are extinguished straight stream or fog stream less than 30 degrees is most effective if energized electrical equipment or cables are not involved see paragraph 555362 where the hot upper gas layer is burning fog attack see paragraph 5553563b should be considered before extinguishing the fires below when the fire is knocked down shut down the nozzle look and listen for flare ups and flame crackling hitting these areas with sufficient bursts of water for knockdown when the fire is out perform overhaul and apply water only as necessary to complete extinguishment unnecessary and prolonged application of water adds to ship damage and to weight stability and dewatering problems f along with entry into the

fire firefighters may use fog attack to gain control of the fire paragraph 5553564b describes the conditions where use of fog attack is desirable fog attack is the application of short bursts several seconds of water with medium angle fog nozzle pattern into the overhead gas layer to control the fire fog bursts applied directly over the seats of the fire will reduce fire space temperatures and radiant heat and will knock down flaming combustion b in fog attack adjust the nozzle to medium angle 60 degree pattern and point the nozzle upward approximately 45 degrees above horizontal halfway between floor and ceiling see figure 555354 apply short fog burst 2 to 3 seconds with bail handle fully open into the upper gas layer followed by 2 to 3 second pause during the pause the team leader checks for flames and directs additional fog bursts until the flames are knocked down c use of short fog bursts followed by short pauses will maintain acceptable conditions in the space for firefighters if the initial fog bursts are too long the wrong fog pattern is selected or the nozzle is not directed properly then too much water may be applied onto the hot steel overhead or the hot upper portions of bulkhead and excessive steam is generated this excessive steam could force firefighters to withdraw d the flame knock down allows the attack team to advance for direct water spray into the seat of the fire see 5553565 for the technique of direct attack on the seat of the fire 5553567 c0068c0073c0082c0069c0067c0084 c0065c0084c0084c0065c0067c0075 c0070c0082c0079c0077

c0066c0065c0067c0075c0085c0080 c0072c0079c0083c0069 the decision to layout charge man or bring the backup hose to the immediate scene of the fire shall be made by the scene leader considering the following the need for coordinated second attack line working the fire b the need to control burning combustion gases in the overhead c the need to protect combustible materials exposed to heat from the fire d the need to provide protection for or aid in the rescue of the initial attack team in the event of rapid spread of fire or explosion the need for backup in the event of ruptured hose or some other unexpected event if the backup hose is laid out position it so that it does not add unnecessarily to the congestion in the fire space or the adjoining space 5553569 c0077c0085c0076c0084c0073c0080c0076c0069 c0072c0079c0083c0069 c0067c0079c0079c0082c0068c0073c0078c0065c0084c0073c0079c0078 special coordination is required when operating with multiple hose lines each hose should be operated as an attack hose or alternatively as back up hose if needed it is the duty of the attack team leader to coordinate this effort in safe and effective manner and to report status and progress to and receive direction from the scene leader each manned hose must strike balance between greater mobility and greater risk brought on by separation firefighters must ensure they do not force flames and heat onto another manned hose this is of particular concern when firefighters attack from different directions when assigned by the scene leader the attack team leader nfti operator should be in position where he can best see the fire observe the operation of the nozzle and urge the nozzleman forward at the proper time he should ensure the nozzle is being operated properly the repair party leader keeps track of oba operating times and requests reliefs for nozzlemen and hosemen the repair party leader ensures that firefighters are available for relief when at general quarters the damage control party will form fresh fire teams and rotate personnel and equipment to reduce fatigue and heat stress 55535610 c0082c0069c0076c0073c0069c0070c0083 to compensate for fatigue and heat strain during prolonged attack which may occur in port additional personnel should be provided to relieve hose teams in high heat stress environment personnel endurance in firefighters ensemble may be limited to less than 10 minutes the maximum time for personnel to function in firefighters ensemble is 30 minutes if personnel are relieved before becoming completely exhausted they may be able to return to firefighting duties after brief rest the primary objective of orderly reliefs is to maintain an uninterrupted attack on the fire secondary objective is to relieve personnel frequently enough to avoid losing personnel to heat strain for the duration of the firefighting effort the casualty coordinator scene leader and attack team leader plan ahead and work together to provide for and rotate teams and individuals as dictated by the situation b in severe situations the attack team leader probably will not give any advance notice before being forced to evacuate the scene leader and casualty coordinator must anticipate the need for reliefs without communication from the attack team leader and have relief personnel don their ffe shortly before they are needed on scene c the attack team may be relieved as unit or individuals may be relieved one at time procedure that works well in many situations is to relieve attack team personnel one at time keeping the attack hose functionals9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0053c0045c0049c0056throughout the relieving process this maintains an uninterrupted attack on the fire and eliminates the extra work and delay from backing hose out of the space or bringing hose into the space it is often helpful for the attack team leader to assume temporary control of the nozzle to reduce confusion when the nozzleman is being relieved d using personnel being relieved to carry messages and status information from the team leader to the scene leader may help maintain good communications reliefs shall be managed by single point of contact identified by the casualty coordinator f standby or relief personnel should take measures to minimize heat strain experienced while waiting to enter the fire area 1 personnel standing by outside the firefighting area should don the firefighters ensemble only to the waist until called to relieve personnel on scene 2 when staged on weather decks in port standby personnel should stay out of the sun and be kept cool 3 drinking water prior to donning the ensemble and breathing apparatus may increase endurance on the scene 4 in the firefighting area the scene leader should station standby personnel in areas as cool as practical g relieved crews should leave the scene for an adequate break to reduce their core inner body temperature before reassignment to duty personnel returning from the scene will need rehabilitation from heat strain the rehabilitation area may be the same area in which standby personnel are staged the following guidance applies to rehabilitating personnel returning from the fire area 1 be prepared to help them remove the firefighters ensemble 2 when staged on weather decks in port keep personnel out of the sun 3 put them in cool area exposed to breeze or provide fan to move air 4 moisten them down with wet cool towel over their head on their face wrists etc 5 ensure that each person drinks about 12 to 1 liter about 12 to 1 quart of cold water such as melted ice water or other fluid meant to replace bodily fluids 6 monitor personnel during the recovery period for signs of heat exhaustion or other problems 55535611 c0087c0073c0084c0072c0068c0082c0065c0087c0065c0076 hose team withdrawal will normally consist of backing out the hose in the reverse order of entry however if the attack team leader determines that the hose must be abandoned in place due to an immediate threat to life and the exit is not visible firefighters should follow the hose by feel back to the exit it is very easy for even the most experienced personnel to become lost in smoke 55535612 c0067c0072c0069c0077c0076c0073c0071c0072c0084c0083 portable chemical light chemlight sticks can be useful under smoky or dark conditions for marking key damage control party members eab manifolds stairs ladders and equipment the light from chemlight penetrates smoke very well which not only helps locate the marked item but also helps orient you to your surroundings chemlight should be prestaged on each emergency air breathing eab manifold the prestaged chemlight should be left in its package torn open at the end for attachment to allow inspection of expiration date and easy recognition of used lights chemlight should be attached to key personnel such as the man in charge at the scene the nfti operator nozzleman and injured personnel to make them distinguishable in smoke chemlights may leak in an extremely hot environment but are not toxics9086s3stm020ch555v2r5

c0051c0053c0045c0050c0049555357 indirect attack 5553571 an indirect attack is the application of water fog into the fire compartment through topside hatch or watertight door figure 555357 or figure 555358 when heat or other conditions deny access to the fire compartment an indirect attack may improve conditions to permit reentry for direct attack the following guidance applies only to attacking class fire while in port or in an industrial availability the basic technique for an indirect attack is to apply water fog to the fire compartment for some time then stop the water flow and then assess conditions in the fire space through cracked open access conditions in the fire space can be assessed by using nfti to monitor temperatures or by the severity of heat and steam that blow out of the access to the fire space if it appears that the space can be reentered and the direct attack team is ready to enter the space immediately reenter the space and conduct the direct attack otherwise continue with the cycle of indirect attack and assessing conditions until the space can be reentered the attack team leader should adjust water fog application times and indirect attack points based on his assessment of conditions b do not conduct an indirect attack when people are in the fire space or when direct attack is underway c isolate the fire space during the indirect attack keep the fire space isolated between indirect attacks d if the location of the fire is known conduct the indirect attack from point that allows application of water to the fire obstructions around the fire should be considered if the fire space is large it may be desirable to conduct simultaneous indirect attacks from multiple points if the fire is spread out or its location is uncertain separate the attack points to maximize coverage of the fire space by water spray communications between attack teams is important f apply water fog continuously for approximately five to ten minutes for the initial attack g since the indirect attack may not extinguish the fire temperatures in the fire compartment may begin to increase after the indirect attack is stopped after the final indirect attack enter the fire compartment as quickly as practical within one or two minutes if practical use the final indirect attack to cool the access route inside the fire compartment h when attacking through an existing access crack open the door or scuttle just enough to admit the nozzle it may be difficult to contain the steam blowing out of the access using smoke curtain or smoke blanket once the nozzle is in place the attack team should position themselves as far away from the access as they can to reduce their exposure to steam while still maintaining control of the nozzle when attacking through scuttle one method is to put the scuttle down to help hold the hose and restrict the steam flow out of the fire space while the nozzleman directs the nozzle by holding the hose about four to six feet back from the nozzle only few inches of hose should extend beyond the scuttle into the fire space i maintain the water spray until steam blowing from the access forces the firefighters back or until water has been applied for approximately five to ten minutes if steam forces the firefighters back before the indirect attack is completed close the access and retreat after waiting one or two minutes crack open the access to assess conditions in the fire space based on the conditions found either reenter the fire space and conduct the direct attack or conduct another indirect attack 555358 ventilation considerations during the fire 5553581 if the fire has gained headway heat and smoke can quickly make the fire scene untenable restricting access for firefighting and preventing personnel from locating the burning material 5553582 normally the fire should be out and reflash watch stationed before preparations for emergency ventilation of the affected compartment are commenced in some cases however the presence of heavy smoke and heat in the compartment may dictate venting the heat and smoke overboard to assist the fire team in combatting the fires9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0053c0045c0050c00505553583 the decision to ventilate the burning compartment using the ships ventilation system before the fire is out and reflash watch is set should be made by the commanding officer key factors to consider in the decision to ventilate prior to fire extinguishment include the following specific recommendations of the ood casualty coordinator and the scene leader b the tactical situation with respect to ventilating snorkeling and surfacing c the ability to maintain ship control functions mission capability and reactor containment d the negative factor of providing fresh air to the fire the nature of the existing fire with regard to size location and fuel sources when consideration of these factors has resulted in decision by the commanding officer to ventilate the choice must be made between the various options of normal or emergency ventilation by the blower diesel or both 5553584 when surfaced in calm seas or when in port the added option of opening hatch may vent sufficient heat and smoke to facilitate the fire attack the choice of how to ventilate is critical to the success of the effort 5553585 if smoke or heat in spaces outside the burning space is impeding the attack on the fire then venting or ventilating of these spaces can improve the environment for firefighters 555359 search and rescue 5553591 successful rescue of trapped personnel requires systematic approach the task is difficult and dangerous factors to consider when organizing and directing search are searchers should wear breathing apparatus hose line should be available in the immediate area to protect the searchers and their avenues of escape b searchers should use some method of indicating where they have searched so that other teams will not repeat their efforts colored tags or chemlights fastened to doors are two possible methods c it should not be assumed all personnel have been located until the fire is out the area has been ventilated and the area has been searched second time d the nfti can be used to detect body heat against cooler background and is very useful in searches searchers should carry spare eabs and be trained in their use and how to place an eab on personnel overcome by smoke 5553510 fire overhaul 55535101 final extinguishment overhaul of fire is an examination and cleanup operation it includes finding and extinguishing hidden fire and determining whether the fire has extended to other parts of the compartment it is usually best to start at the perimeter of the fire and work toward the fire origin check for all possible areas of fire spread including behind electrical cabinets and habitability bulkhead sheathing in thermal or acoustic insulation and in concealed spaces clues to concealed fires are smoke creeping out of openings and bulkheads hot to the touch fire overhaul should commence after the fire is out and the reflash watch is set search for hot spots with the nfti should be conducted after the fire is out and before commencing preparations for compartment desmoking these clues can be used to trace hidden fire if necessary pull down material bulkhead sheathing false overheads etc to discover and extinguish all remaining fire 55535102 postfire desmoking after compartment fire is out combustible gases may be present for all classes of fire carbon monoxide will be the predominant gas although combustible substantial quantities of carbon monoxide must be generated to reach the flammable range 125 percent is the lower flammable limit heavy carbon monoxide production which does not ignite is typically associated with confined fire that has smoldered for several hourss9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0053c0045c0050c0051555351021 for compartment which has experienced class or class c fire after the fire is out visible open flaming has been extinguished desmoking to support fire overhaul can proceed with minimal risk there are recorded incidents where postfire atmosphere involving class or class c compartment fires has ignited as result of operating installed ships ventilation systems 555351022 if the fire involved class b material the presence of flammable liquids can create flammable atmosphere in postfire environment therefore desmoking of spaces cannot commence until the fire is totally extinguished deep seated burning completely overhauled and fuel surfaces cooled or made safe 555351023 the goal in desmoking is to replace 95 percent of the smokeladen air with fresh air this will require approximately 4 complete space volume changes in compartment this can be achieved with fully operable ventilation system ships ventilation procedures must be consulted in order to calculate minimum ventilation times for all spaces 55535103 postfire atmospheric testing on submarines 555351031 general the purpose of postfire atmospheric testing is to certify the atmosphere as safe which includes safe for breathing without respiratory protection this guidance is applicable to all classes of fire warning atmospheric test personnel shall wear breathing apparatus until testing is completed and the atmosphere is certified as safe warning if an unsatisfactory combustible gas reading at or above 10 percent lel is obtained there is risk of an explosion the space shall be immediately evacuated and additional desmoking conducted after the fire is out the fire has been overhauled and the compartment has been desmoked series of tests shall be conducted in the compartment for oxygen combustible gases and toxic gases concurrently or in that order all spaces should be desmoked before atmospheric testing is started because oxygen analyzers do not operate reliably if the sensor is exposed to excessive moisture or is in contact with postfire atmospheric particulates also combustible gas analyzers will not operate reliably in oxygen deficient atmospheres therefore an acceptable oxygen concentration is required before the combustible gas measurement can be considered for acceptance if particular location fails test only that location must be retested for the failed test additional ventilation and retesting is required only if initial test results are unsatisfactory for satisfactory test series oxygen concentrations shall be between 17 percent and 21 percent by volume as specified in navsea s9510abatm010u nuclear powered submarine atmosphere control manual b combustible gas concentrations shall be less than 10 percent of the lower explosive limit lel and c toxic gas concentrations shall be acceptable as specified in navsea s9510abatm010u nuclear powered submarine atmosphere control manual for class or c fire the toxic gas series shall include carbon monoxide co and carbon dioxide co 2 the toxic gas series shall include hydrogen chloride hcl and hydrogen cyanide hcn when material which produce these gases have been involved in the fire hydrogen chloride is produced when polyvinyl chloride electric cable jacketing is burned hydrogen cyanide is produced in otto fuel fires and when vinylnitrile rubber submarine hull insulation or chilled water piping insulation is burned other toxic gases should be tested for when their presence is suspected for class b fire an additional toxic gas test for hydrocarbons is required toxic gas concentrations on submarines shall be below the exposure limit as specified in navsea s9510abatm010u see table 555351 use of 90day exposure limits is recommended warning if the 1hour emergency or 24 hour exposure limit is used to permit removal of emergency air breathing eab masks duration of crew exposure should not exceed the designated period of times9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0053c0045c0050c0052warning when more than one toxic gas is present the cumulative effects of the gases may be hazardous even though the concentration of each gas is below the exposure limit see nstm 074 volume 3 gas free engineering paragraph 074208 for information on evaluating cumulative toxic gas effects caution do not use the submarine central atmosphere monitoring system cams until it has been determined there are acid gases such as hydrogen chloride present acid gases will damage the cams the cams may be used for postfire atmospheric testing when it is ensured that acid gases are present 555351032 locations for atmospheric testing test locations are determined by the gas free engineer or other authorized personnel based on conditions the following guidance is provided to aid in determining the appropriate locations however additional test locations may be needed depending on specific conditions this guidance does not replace the good judgement of the knowledgeable test personnel 5553510321 general during fire combustible or toxic gases spread with smoke and heat fire gases initially rise due to their buoyancy from being hotter than surrounding air however as fire gases cool and mix with surrounding air particularly outside the fire space they spread through the ship with normal air currents generally atmospheric testing should be conducted in the fire space and at locations high center and low in the affected watertight compartment since some gases are lighter or heavier than air and may accumulate high or low the rate of ventilation airchanges will vary for different ship locations extra ventilation and testing may be required for locations or spaces which have low ventilation rate as they may maintain hazardous concentrations of flammable or toxic gases residual light smoke is sign of poorly ventilated location and indicates the need for additional ventilation and testing table 555351 c0046c0032c0032toxic gas exposure limits from the nuclear powered submarine atmosphere control manual chemical name90day limit24hour limit1hour limit

chapter 074 volume 3 appendix b the nuclear powered submarine atmosphere control manual currently lists exposure limit for hcn 5553510322 small fires when small fire such as waste can or localized electrical fire is extinguished quickly there is little fire damage and light smoke which does not spread beyond the fire space in this case the spread of toxic gases is probably minimal therefore single test series at one location in the fire space may bes9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0053c0045c0050c0053adequate and overboard desmoking may not be necessary the need for testing will require judgement by the manincharge 5553510323 growing fires in the event of growing fire where smoke spreads beyond the original fire space single test location is not sufficient even when the ventilation system remains undamaged after desmoking an atmospheric test series should be conducted in at least one location in fire space eg fire area and at locations high center and low in the watertight compartment at least one test series should be conducted on each level this would result in four test locations in threelevel compartment additional locations should be tested where poor ventilation and gas accumulation is suspected 5553510324 large fires when large fire damages the ventilation system or extensive partiallyburnt material remains including the result of class b fire extensive postfire atmospheric testing will probably be required damaged ventilation system will result in poorer air replacement and greater likelihood of local pockets of smoke and gases large surfaces of partially burnt material or unburnt flammable liquids will result in continued formation of hazardous gases and vapors after the fire locations for atmospheric testing should include the four corners and center of each level in areas where low ventilation and gas accumulation are suspected additional ventilation and testing should be conducted 55535104 dewater in determining the number of hose lines to be used the firefighter should be guided by the extent and intensity of the fire every gallon of water released affects the submarines trim dewatering may be required simultaneously with firefighting 55535105 postfire investigation after fire overhaul the fire should be investigated to determine the point of origin combustibles involved path of fire spread ignition source and significant events in the growth and eventual extinguishment of the fire starting from the point of farthest fire spread burn patterns will usually extend back to the area of origin efforts should be directed toward recreating the conditions that caused the fire and identifying any changes in design or procedures that could have prevented the fire or lessened its spread and intensity these changes are very helpful to ship designers and operators photographs material samples metallurgical samples and failed equipment assist in reconstructing fire history if there is major fire which involves significant damage or loss of life navsea technical expertise team is available to investigate fires to develop lessons learned from ship design and material standpoint 5553511 additional considerations for large fires 55535111 large fires require overall coordination which can not be developed from routine drills because multiple fire teams will be involved central control is essential multiple hoses should normally work together on the same side of the fire attacking the fire from opposing directions can lead to situations where one manned hose forces heat and flames onto another therefore where ship configuration only allows multiple hose attack from opposing directions each manned hose should be assigned clear responsibilities which avoid this danger the scene leader must coordinate additional hoseline attacks from opposite directions fore and aft and above as fire spreads in the event of major fire all fuel or lube oil pumping and hydraulic system operations that do not affect critical functions or ship safety shall be secured large fires may require long hose lengths to reach the fire however firefighters should be aware that 112 inch hose with length longer than 200 feet has severe pressure loss 25 psi per 100 ft with flow of 95 gpm 55535112 smoke and heat from severe fire can cause mission interruption create large demand for breathing apparatus delay fire fighters in locating the fire and present life threatening environment as discussed in paragraph 555358 consideration must be given to ventilate the burning compartment using the ships ventilation system or by opening topside hatch in the burning compartment for the purpose of releasing heat and smoke trapped inside the ship when trapped smoke and heated gases have been removed the resultant temperature reduction and smoke removal may permit fire teams to advance toward the fire 55535113 if smoke or heat in spaces outside the burning compartment is impeding the attack on the fire then ventilating or venting of these spaces can improve the environment for fire fighterss9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0053c0045c0050c005455535114 intense heat makes fire fighting efforts extremely difficult and may drive personnel away from the fire area the following techniques are helpful in fighting larger fires in the event of lower level fires untenable conditions are first reached in upper levels casualty control efforts are more likely to succeed on lower levels because of the cooler temperatures and better visibility b crouching and duck walking or crawling low when approaching well developed fire may assist fire fighting personnel in maintaining visibility and reducing heat stress c the damage control party must be properly clothed for any fire beyond the incipient stage some personnel protection equipment will be required for fully developed fires the firefighters ensemble ffe provides superior protection to that of work clothing the ffe should be worn by the fire teams fighting large fire d have dressed out relief fire teams ready so that an aggressive attack can continue without pause for longer nozzle reach use the narrow angle fog pattern setting or deflected solid stream to continue any feasible attack f ensure casualty coordinator is aware of large water demands to assure an uninterrupted water supply as well as effects on ships trim 5553512 typical difficulties in firefighting 55535121 firefighter fatigue extended firefighting activity stresses firefighter physically and mentally nozzlemen and others in the fire area may have to be relieved frequently an exhausted firefighter is danger to his shipmates as well as to himself in training exercises heat stress must be considered personnel should not be fully outfitted in firefighters ensembles and breathing apparatus for periods longer than about 30 minutes before being relieved 55535122 loss of trim system firemain pressure the crew must determine the cause of pressure loss and then quickly restore pressure to the system in some cases realignment of valves may be sufficient in other cases depending on the problem and pressurization method more extensive system operations may be necessary the bcp operator should coordinate the operations keeping the scene leader the casualty coordinator and diving officer informed as applicable 55535123 space entry whether attacking from the doorway or entering the space remain low at all times to take advantage of the cooler air and greater visibility near the deck 55535124 communication members of the fire party give information to each other by normal voice communications voice amplifiers if available are provided to personnel in the fire party the scene leader uses the 4mc and soundpowered phones to pass information and requests to the casualty coordinator the casualty coordinator or the ood passes key information over the 1mc to keep all hands informed of the status of the firefighting effort and the ships atmosphere 555351241 fire team leader will communicate as necessary with the scene leader using best available means 555351242 in severe environment fire team members will be able to focus only on breathing survival and the immediate task before them while attacking severe fire or working under stress the fire team leader cannot use the available means of communication effectively under severe conditions the scene leader must initiate actions as necessary without depending on communication from the fire team if the scene leader needs information about the attack he should send messenger to the fire team 555351243 communication between damage control central the scene leader and nozzlemen is often disrupted where installed communication is taken out of service due to fire messengers should be useds9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0053c0045c0050c0055555351244 voice amplifier is device which attaches to firefighters oba mask and projects his voice allowing him to communicate

discusses special fire situations and hazards for variety of ship spaces and some useful techniques for firefighting 555362 electrical fires 5553621 general an energized electrical fire is class c fire see paragraph 5553164 the most effective tactic is to deenergize and handle the fire as class fire class c fire is attacked at prescribed distances using nonconductive agents such as co 2 or water fog when the fire is not deep seated clean agents that pose clean up problems such as co 2 are preferred initial attack should be with portable co 2 extinguisher although not as desirable freshwater seawater or afff if available can be used to safely fight class c fire provided fog pattern is maintained warning to avoid shock hazards do not use straight stream water pattern on an energized electric source maintain minimum varinozzle standoff distance of four feet when applying water fog to an energized electric source 55536211 electrical current will follow straight stream but will not be conducted between the droplets in narrow angle fog pattern narrow angle fog patterns may be safely directed against energized equipment or cables carrying up to 4160 volts if the nozzle is kept at least four feet from the energized source preset the varinozzle to narrow angle fog pattern before attacking the fire do not use straight stream because it provides an electrical path back to the nozzle and is therefore shock hazard 55536212 pkp should not be used in installations where relays and delicate electrical contacts are present where moisture is present pkp may combine with it to corrode or stain surfaces on which it settles it will leave residue that may be hard to clean up 55536213 for class c fires which generate high heat through plasma arc or fireballs and ignite nearby materials isolate the source components electrically while conducting an initial attack with portable extinguishers simultaneously rig hoselines and fight the fire with narrow angle fog pattern as soon as possible 55536214 in the event of class c electrical generator fire extinguishing agent may be applied with hand held equipment as soon as the generator is isolated from the switchboard and the prime mover is secured it is permissible to fight class c generator fire as soon as the generator is isolated and before it stops turning 5553622 procedure for fighting an electrical equipment fire this procedure applies to all energized electrical equipment including but not limited to switchboards automatic bus transfers abts manual bus transfers mbts panels cabinets and motor controllers 1 secure electrical power to the affected equipment in most cases burning material in the equipment will selfextinguish after power is secured 2 while power is being secured extinguish any fire that spreads to materials beyond the equipment electrical equipment fires generally present low risk of fire spread beyond the equipment use of co 2 fire extinguishers is the preferred method for attacking an electrical equipment fire or small class alpha fire in the vicinity of the electrical equipment while attacking an electrical fire keep the fire extinguisher outside the equipment do not make physical contact with any component on or within the equipment if necessary to bring the fire under control water fog may be used paragraph 5553621 allows the use of water fog either seawaters9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0054c0045c0050or fresh water while keeping the nozzle at least 4 feet away from the energized equipment preset fog pattern on the varinozzle before attacking the fire do not use navy all purpose nozzle fog applicator or straight stream pattern due to the electrical shock hazard 3 after power is secured stand by while the equipment cools if residual burning appears to continue in the equipment co 2 may be applied through vent louvers if applicable emergency access into the equipment is usually not warranted and puts personnel at risk of burn injury however such access may be necessary to extinguish fire that is sustained and threatens to spread beyond the equipment 4 when the area is cool enough to access without risk of burn injury enter in accordance with requirements of nstm chapter 300 for working on damaged equipment tag out and verify all circuits are deenergized determine the fire is out conduct overhaul to assure the fire is completely extinguished and affect repair the fire in the equipment cannot be deemed completely out until the equipment is accessed and visually inspected however the compartment may be desmoked prior to accessing the equipment if there are visible flames involving material outside the cabinet 55536221 emergency access in unusual emergency cases the man in charge at the scene may determine that the equipment needs to be accessed while still energized in order to secure power via internal fuses or to extinguish fire that is sustained and threatens to spread beyond the equipment typically the small amount of damage reduction gained by entry to extinguish the fire does not warrant the risk to personnel when entering an energized equipment the man in charge at the scene shall determine if it is necessary to remove the equipment access cover he shall then determine what appropriate action needs to be taken and inform the space supervisor or eoow after the action is taken commanding officers permission is not required when the man in charge judges that emergency action is needed the following procedure shall be followed 1 don rubber gloves and remove the equipment access cover insulated tools are not required but are recommended if readily available the investigator should not reach into or break the ªplaneº of the electrical equipment enclosure for equipment with possibly energized switches meters relays or other components mounted on the cover the ªplaneº should be adjusted to preclude entry into the area created by the arc of the cov er as it is swung open after the fire is extinguished and verified out the equipment should be promptly closed and personnel should use the safety precautions in nstm chapter 300 prior to commencing further investiga tion 2 while extinguishing the fire keep the fire extinguisher nozzle outside of the equipment enclosure do not make physical contact with any component on or inside the equipment 555363 deep fat fryer fire 5553631 fires in deep fat fryers generally result from overheating of cooking oils and fats and subsequent selfignition of the fat fires involving cooking oils and fats are class b fires most fires have occurred while the fryers were operating unattended either through failure of personnel to remain at the units when operating or through failure to properly secure the units after use factors contributing to the intensity and spread of the fires include delayed discovery of fire grease laden ducts and hoods and splashing and overflow of burning fat by straight stream nozzle pattern discharged directly onto the fat liquid surface 5553632 at the first sign of overheating white smoke shut off the fryer and place the cover securely on the fryer leave the cover on the fryer for at least five minutes this will allow the hot cooking oil to cool down enough to prevent it from igniting 5553633 the galley is provided with an aqueous potassium carbonate apc system figure 555321 in the event of fire in the fryer sound the alarm secure power to the fryer and actuate the apc system concurrently operate the range exhaust hood damper control to close the damper 5553634 backup methods for extinguishing deep fat fryer fires are used only in the event the apc system fails to operate or extinguish the fire two methods are available and should be used in order of priority listed method 1 may be successfully used without personnel protection if the fire is detected early and if the space is tenables9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0054c0045c0051warning unprotected personnel should stay at least four feet from the deep fat fryer when discharging agent to avoid personnel burns from the splatter of hot cooking oil method 2 requires personnel protection it may be used when the fire is confined to the fryer it is the preferred method where the fire has spread into the space in all cases for any of these methods to succeed the power to the fryer must be secured 55536341 method 1 one person deploys afff portable 212 gallon extinguisher to the galley warning do not direct afff stream directly into the cooking oil plunging afff into the cooking oil can result in immediate boiling of the afff violent boiling may result in hot cooking oil being thrown out of the fryer from distance of at least four feet to avoid hot splatter apply afff to the back wall of the fryer allowing afff to flow onto the burning cooking oil surface this technique does not disrupt the cooking oil lobbing the afff stream gently onto the cooking oil can also be effective but has some risk of plunging the afff into the cooking oil apply afff until the fire is out and foam layer is developed approximately 10 seconds the initial range of the afff extinguisher is 15 feet which decreases during discharge b while applying afff second person rigs 112 inch hose with varinozzle and brings to the scene as backup c look in and around the fryer to be sure the fire is out d if the cooking oil reignites again apply afff until the fire is out approximately 10 seconds check range exhaust hood and exhaust ductwork for signs of fire and initiate firefighting in these areas if necessary 55536342 method 2 called method 3 in nstm chapter 555 volume 1 for surface ships if portable afff extinguisher is not available or the fire has spread beyond the fryer and into the space the fire can be extinguished by personnel wearing protective clothing and breathing apparatus and using water from varinozzle set on narrow angle fog pattern apply narrow angle water fog on the burning cooking oil surface for approximately one minute sweeping gently from side to side to extinguish the fire cool the cooking oil and prevent reflash warning the cooking oil fire may have large flareup on the initial application of water fog this flareup lasts approximately three seconds followed by fire extinguishment an uncontrolled deep fat fryer fire can spread rapidly from the fryer into the range exhaust hood and exhaust ventilation ductwork as well as into the space an attack with only water fog should not be delayed in order to bring portable fire extinguishers to the scene 5553635 deep fat fryer fire produces large volumes of hot irritating smoke although the initial response can be made by unprotected personnel they may be forced to withdraw due to untenable conditions breathing protection such as obas or eabs should be used when available to replace initial response by unprotected personnel 555364 hull insulation fire 5553641 general fires involving hull insulation are dangerous becauses9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0054c0045c0052a the flammability of the material permits rapid flame spread up frame bays b large volumes of choking black smoke are generated c firefighting access is difficult to achieve because of concealed spaces next to the hull and outboard areas behind habitability bulkhead sheathing 5553642 insulating materials vinylnitrile rubber vinylnitrile rubber milp15280 is used throughout submarine interiors as thermal insulation on the hull and as an antisweat barrier on pipes ducts and other cold surfaces this insulation will burn vigorously and flame spread across the surface is rapid any oil film on the insulation or oil soaked into the insulation makes the fire problem worse insulation smoke is extremely dense and black is highly acidic and will interfere with vision and breathing by irritating the eyes mouth nose and throat the acidic residue will continue to damage electronic components after the fire is out b transmission loss treatment transmission loss treatment tlt is composite material consisting of fibrous glass felt vapor barrier compound and fibrous glass cloth it is used as hull insulation in the forward compartments of some submarines the glass fibers will not burn the phenolic resin binder will burn when it is exposed to heat source it will initially selfextinguish when the heat source is removed fire in confined space either burning the phenolic resin or some other material can cause the local temperature to rise and cause the tlt to continue burning even if the original heat source has been removed while it is burning or exposed to heat source the resin will give off toxic gases which will interfere with vision and breathing by irritating the eyes mouth nose and throat c polyimide and polyphosphazene polyimide and polyphosphazene foams have replaced vinylnitrile rubber and tlt insulation on later submarines of the ssbn 726 class and on the ssn 21 class they will burn but compared to vinylnitrile rubber and tlt their fire is less vigorous and they produce less smoke 5553643 fire prevention historically hot work has been the leading cause of ignition for hull insulation fires bnstm 074 volume 1 welding and allied processes describes safety precautions for hot work c good housekeeping will prevent the accumulation of trash and oil films which can potentially become ignition sources for an insulation fire industrial periods when good housekeeping is most difficult are precisely the times when the need is greatest 5553644 fire fighting initial response afff extinguishers or hosereels when available are used for initial attack because of their cooling capability and ability to penetrate spread and cover water fog may also be used for initial attack and is required if the fire is beyond the capacity of afff extinguishers co 2 and pkp extinguishers will not extinguish hull insulation fire once it is well established b fire attack immediate checks should be made for fire spread in concealed areas next to the hull and behind habitability bulkhead sheathing when the fire has first begun the fire may often be extinguished by removal of the ignition source particularly for insulation materials other than vinylnitrile rubber insulation once the hull insulation fire has become selfsustaining actions should be devoted to extinguishment water fog is the preferred extinguishing agent the fire will spread upward helped by chimney effect as additional personnel become available the scene leader must continue to investigate for multilevel fire fire teams with charged hoses must be dispatched to check for fire spread in concealed spaces the scene leader may also direct additional personnel to use damage control tools to remove surrounding insulation if sufficient fire teams are nots9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0054c0045c0053immediately available senior petty officers in an scba oba or eab may investigate if smoke and heat interfere with firefighting or ship control decision to ventilate before the fire is out may be appropriate 555365 flammable liquid fires 5553651 general flammable liquid fire is class b fire for burning characteristics of flammable liquids see paragraph 5553144 because of the cooling qualities of finely divided water particles water fog has limited ability to extinguish class b fire involving fuels with flashpoint above 140 c0095f such as diesel fuel hydraulic fluid or lube oil water fog will not extinguish fire involving fluids with flashpoint below 140 c0095f extinguishment occurs by cooling the flammable liquid below its flashpoint however water will wash away any afff film on the fuel surface and could increase the fire intensity 5553652 initial response for class b flammable liquid pool fires the initial response should be with one or more afff extinguishers single 212 gallon aqueous film forming foam afff fire extinguisher can extinguish up to 20 sq ft of fire but bilge obstructions and hull frames reduce its effectiveness bouncing afff off bulkheads and equipment is an effective method for spreading afff as layer over burning fuel avoid plunging the afff stream into the pool fire simultaneous application of afff from multiple extinguishers is more effective than series application b for class b running fuel 3dimensional fires or fires greater than 20 square feet the initial response should be with potassium bicarbonate pkp and afff extinguishers pkp knocks down the flames and afff seals horizontal fuel surfaces 5553653 fire attack the decision whether to switch from afffpkp extinguishers to water should be based on the current conditions and understanding of the limitations of each method for the ssn 21 class submarine afff is preferred over water for class b fires b when fighting class b pool fire with water apply continuous narrow angle fog pattern to the leading edge of the flames and sweep the water from side to side in continuous motion pushing the flames back across the fuel surface narrow angle fog increases the local water density at the fuel surface which increases its effectiveness wide angle fog does not provide sufficient water density to extinguish the class b fire if the water application is interrupted or not dense enough the fire will burn back across the fuel surface obstructions in the fuel such as hull frames or machinery will make extinguishment more difficult danger of reflash exists until all of the fuel is cooled below its flashpoint at nozzle pressure of at least 35 psig single hose should extinguish class b pool fire nozzle pressure less than 35 psig may require multiple hose lines to extinguish the fire c multiple water hoses working together will increase the total water density and extinguishing effectiveness however hoses should be advanced singly vice together as advancing hose lines together results in mutual interference second hose if employed should be brought up separately multiple hoses should normally work together on the same side of the fire attacking the fire from opposing directions is not recommended as this could result in water spray pushing burning fuel and hot gases onto the opposing hose team where ship configuration only allows multiple hose attack from opposing directions the scene leader should employ hoses at his discretion 555366 flammable gas fires 5553661 general gas fire is class b fire gas fire can immediately grow out of control and require evacuation common submarine flammable gases include acetylene and hydrogen see nstm chapters 550 and 670 for specific information on gases and paragraph 55531433 for characteristics of flammable gasess9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0054c0045c0054a securing the fuel source is the single most important step in controlling gas fire do not extinguish gas fire with fire extinguishing agents unless the leak is small and the source may be quickly secured if gas fire is extinguished without securing the source the accumulated unburned gases may reignite and explode causing greater damage than the unextinguished fire gas fire can be extinguished with potassium bicarbonate pkp dry chemical b after securing the fuel source extinguish residual fire nongas fire involving surrounding material with the appropriate agent c if the fuel source cannot be secured control adjoining fires with the appropriate agent exposed compressed gas cylinders or other hazardous materialssystems should be cooled with continuous film of water to prevent container or system rupture and fire involvement exposed weapons flammable gas cylinders flammable liquid containers oxygen cylinders or oxidizing agent containers should receive priority in cooling d if the compressed gas cylinder safety disk ruptures flame may shoot out 1012 feet if the cylinder wall ruptures the flame may become large fire ball in both cases if there is way to secure the source cool exposed materials or systems subject to ignition or failure with water fog until the fuel is consumed if flammable gas fire is in the weather pier side approach from upwind if possible f leaks may occur around cylinder valve if cylinder valve leak occurs and the flame is small the flame may be wipedoff with rag or glove dispose of the leaking cylinder immediately in accordance with nstm chapter 550 5553662 hydrogen free hydrogen is byproduct produced by the chemical action in either the leadacid main storage battery or the electrolytic oxygen generator limited amount of bottled hydrogen gas is maintained on board submarines and could become fire hazard if released or fire occurs where the bottles are stowed 55536621 hydrogen has very wide explosive range in air from 40 percent lel to 75 percent uel it has high ignition temperature 932 c0095f 500c0095c but its very low ignition energy 001 mj can result in ignition from nominally small heatproducing sources such as friction and static electricity see paragraph 55536115 55536622 hydrogen explosion could result in casualties to personnel flooding fire toxic gas generation forced abandonment of compartment and loss of ship 555367 compressed gases 5553671 heat effect on compressed gas cylinders and air flasks most compressed gas cylinders are provided with safety devices to relieve excess pressure however safety devices are generally ineffective when direct flame from fire impinges onto the cylinder direct flame impingement often results in local superheating of the cylinder surface resulting in point failure and cylinder rupture before the cylinder pressure raises sufficiently to cause safety device operation apply continuous film of water to the exposed cylinder area until the fire is extinguished and the cylinder temperature returns to normal if water does not flash into steam on contact with the surface the cylinder temperature is most likely below 220 c0095f and cooling is effective 55536711 since metals lose their strength at temperatures below flame temperatures metal exposed to direct flame impingement may fail at pressures far below the system design pressure and safety device relief pressure therefore cylinders connected to system which are being exposed to direct flame impingement should have all internal pressure relieved safely if possible however relief of combustible or toxic gases in safe manner may not be possible during fire 55536712 acetylene argon carbon dioxide compressed air nitrogen oxygen propane hydrogen and refrigerant gases are stowed onboard in cylinders which are protected by these safety devicess9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0054c0045c005555536713 escaping acetylene and hydrogen gases add fuel to fire and can cause explosions hydrogen has low autoignition temperature and can ignite from low energy sparks it burns with nearly invisible flame and is hazardous even if explosive mixtures do not form escaping oxygen gases increase the intensity of fire refrigerant r12 or r114 gases coming in contact with flames or hot metal form hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride both of which are highly corrosive 55536714 in the event of fire in the area of compressed gas cylinders flames and sparks should be kept away from cylinders and the cylinders should be kept cool with water fog 55536715 carbon dioxide argon and nitrogen gases can asphyxiate personnel in all instances compressed gas cylinder whose safety device requires relieving highpressure gas is potential danger to personnel 55536716 for additional information on general safety precautions for compressed gases see naval ships technical manual chapter 550 5553672 compressed gas cylinders without safety devices the accumulator air flasks for the ship service stern diving external and emergency flood control hydraulic systems and the reactor plant valve operating air flasks are not provided with safety devices for overpressure the flasks are normally connected to system relief valves however reduction of wall strength from localized elevated temperatures can result in wall rupture 55536721 aside from other effects fire in the vicinity of these air flasks can increase the pressure in the flasks due to heat for example at an initial pressure of 3000 psig if air temperature in the flask reaches 472 c0095f the pressure will rise to above 4500 psig system test pressure 55536722 to reduce the possibility of overpressurization of the flasks and therefore the loss of the user systems steps should be taken to cool down the flasks direct application of water fog to the flasks and piping aids in maintaining the temperature and pressure within limits if water does not flash into steam on contact with the flask the temperature is most likely below 220 c0095f 55536723 if the possibility exists that the flasks will be subjected to temperature that could raise the pressure high enough to rupture the flask or associated piping and the flasks cannot be cooled down steps can be taken to relieve the pressure for example the ship service hydraulic plant air flasks can be aligned to relief valve on the air pressure reducing manifold 5553673 compressed gas distribution piping extended high temperatures can cause joint failures in compressed air piping system silver brazed joints or failures in air and oxygen pipe walls an air line failure allows air to feed the fire and can be significant factor in the fire gaining intensity in some cases an air line failure can cause loss of control air for vital pneumatic services casualty drills should incorporate isolation of ruptured air lines and use of jumper hoses for feeding critical pneumatic demands 555368 explosives pyrotechnics and countermeasures 5553681 pyrotechnic and small arms ammunition lockers pyrotechnic devices and small arms ammunition are stored in separate lockers 55536811 all pyrotechnics devices are required to function normally after exposure to cycle of temperatures between 65 c0095f and 160 c0095f the effect of temperatures above 160 c0095f is uncertain however it must be assumed that any pyrotechnic devices subjected to high temperature or direct flame may ignite pyrotechnic devices that are at high temperature can be more sensitive to shock and may or may not have an abnormal shock sensitivity after cooling to ambient temperature 55536812 the pyrotechnic locker is equipped with thermometers which show the internal temperature of the locker these are mounted on the outside of the locker and provide warning of any dangerous temperature rise in the event of fire in or near the locker the locker can be flooded as described in paragraph 555327s9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0054c0045c005655536813 signals or markers which may have been heated to abnormal temperatures and subsequently immersed in water are in an indeterminate condition and must be handled with care pyrotechnic locker subjected to these conditions should remain sealed and flooded if feasible until the ship is surfaced the pyrotechnic devices should then be handled and disposed of in accordance with navsea op4 ammunition afloat 5553682 countermeasures locker the countermeasure locker is isolated from the pyrotechnic locker and is not floodable some countermeasure devices such as false target cans ftcs and nae beacons contain lithium hydride lih class d metal combustible if exposed lih may spontaneously ignite in air it is violently reactive with strong oxidizers on heating or in contact with water moisture or acids hydrogen gas and heat are evolved heating is often sufficient for ignition exposed lih can form airborne dust clouds which may explode on contact with flame heat oxidizing materials humid air or static electricity warning do not use water carbon dioxide pkp dry chemical or aqueous film forming foam to fight lithium hydride lih fires these agents will react violently with lih and may produce toxic gases for an exposure fire outside the locker apply water fog to cool the locker surface 55536821 burning countermeasure devices containing lih should be disposed of overboard an open metal container may be useful in moving the device wearing full protective clothing in some cases lithium hydride fires may be smothered by inverting metal can over them for fires near but not involving an exposed ftc or nae beacon the device should be removed from the area if possible if the device can not be removed use dry chemical to combat fires near but not involving exposed ftcs and nae beacons 55536822 lih is highly toxic exposure to even minute amount of dust will irritate mucous membranes of the eyes and upper respiratory tract lithium hydroxide formed from lithium hydride and water is very caustic chemically similar to lye 55536823 if personnel exposure is suspected as result of fire or accident involving countermeasures prompt medical attention is indicated 555369 torpedo weapons system 5553691 fire in or near the torpedo mk 48 mod 1 can seriously endanger the ship due to the presence of warhead explosives and torpedo propellants the mobile submarine simulator moss is also stowed in the torpedo room but is not considered fire hazard 5553692 the torpedo mk 48 mod 1 contains solid explosive material if completely enveloped in flame for 112 to 2 minutes the warhead will ignite and burn prolonged exposure to temperature in excess of 300 c0095f will result in violent explosion if the explosive warhead is replaced by the instrument exercise head it becomes nonexplosive 5553693 mk 48 torpedo fuel tank contains 700 lbs of otto fuel ii volatile liquid monopropellant when the weapon is in dry stowage the tank pressure is essentially atmospheric but the tank is not vented to the atmosphere the fuel tank will rupture when exposed to temperature in excess of 300 c0095f otto fuel ii is composed of nitrate ester in solution with desensitizing agent and stabilizer it is bright red free flowing oily liquid that is heavier than water it is insoluble in water detailed safety handling and cleanup instructions for otto fuel are contained in navsea s6340aamma010 otto ii fuel safety storage and handling instructions 5553694 because otto fuel is monopropellant which contains its own oxidizer combustion cannot be smothered the most efficient method of extinguishing an otto fuel ii fire is to cool the propellant below itss9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0054c0045c0057flashpoint of 265 c0095f 129c0095c this is best accomplished by the use of water fog or afff water and afff are both lighter than otto fuel ii and will form layer on the fuel surface and absorb the heat given off by the fire for very small otto fuel fires flames may be swept off the surface and extinguished with carbon dioxide fire extinguishers 5553695 otto fuel ii liquid and vapor are extremely toxic vapors should not be ventilated through the ventilation system otto fuel toxic effects may occur from inhalation of otto fuel ii vapors inhalation of combustion byproducts absorption from direct contact or ingestion the nitrate esters in the otto fuel are known for their acute effects including nausea turgidity swelling blood pressure changes headaches and dyspnea difficult breathing warning personnel shall not be exposed to otto fuel ii vapor concentration greater than 02 ppm 13 mgm3 injury or death could result warning the smoke from burning otto fuel must be considered as hazardous and toxic as otto fuel fumes 5553696 for otto fuel ii fires personnel without self contained breathing protection or eab masks should not enter smoky areas personnel without full protective clothing should not enter spaces containing spilled or burned otto fuel ii oxygen breathing apparatus and demand type eabs are used to fight otto fuel ii fires for nonburning otto fuel ii spills navsea s6340aamma010 otto fuel ii safety storage and handling instructions requires use of positive pressure type breathing equipment for spill clean up 5553697 fire team personnel should take extreme care not to expose skin surfaces fire team personnel clothing and equipment exposed to otto fuel ii should be considered contaminated until tested once the fire is extinguished the space should be emergency ventilated and decontamination should be conducted in accordance with the applicable reference manuals listed in table 555311 5553698 depending on the class of fire co 2 dry chemical aqueous film forming foam fire extinguishers or water should be used to combat fire in the torpedo room the fire is extinguished with the extinguishing agent at hand but the fire hose is rigged as soon as possible for torpedo room fires the prime consideration is to put out the fire while cooling the weapons if fire cannot be put out it is unlikely that the weapons or the ship will be saved the fuel source must be secured as soon as possible except for the weapons themselves the only other significant fuel source in the torpedo room is hydraulic fluid if hydraulic fluid is secured the capability to open the torpedo tube muzzle door is lost in other words torpedo cannot be jettisoned if hydraulic fluid to the torpedo room is secured however torpedo can still be tubeloaded manually the ventilation system should be secured immediately and the inlet damper to the battery compartment should be closed to prevent the spread of smoke to the fan room while battery ventilation is secured the hydrogen detector should be carefully monitored for indication of hydrogen buildup in the battery compartment battery compartment ventilation should be restored after the fire has been extinguished 5553699 fire near or in the weapon stowage bays requires immediate action in conjunction with extinguishing the fire the warhead and tankage sections of the mk 48 torpedoes should be cooled down as quickly as possible with water fog or afff and maintained below 250 c0095f the water fog should be sprayed over the complete length of the weapons and over both sides in sweeping motion the approximate temperature of the weapon can be determined by observing the effect of the water fog if the water does not flash into steam upon contact with the weapon the exterior temperature is below 220 c0095f 55536910 if fire should break out near or in torpedo tube that contains torpedo the tube should be immediately flooded and equalized and the muzzle door opened to maintain safe weapon condition if there appears to be chance of controlling the fire within few minutes and there is way of determining the temperature within the tube the weapon should be jettisoneds9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0054c0045c0049c00485553610 strategic weapons system 55536101 the ssbn officers guide and the strategic weapon system support systems manual for the applicable weapons type discuss strategic weapons system fires and action required to combat them including casualties that may require missile jettison 5553611 battery compartment casualties 55536111 general battery compartment well casualties include shortterm electrical short in the battery class fire involving materials in the battery compartment an uncontrolled battery discharge and hydrogen explosion see nstm chapter 223 volume 1 submarine storage batteries for more guidance for any battery casualty the steps listed below should be accomplished immediately if battery charge is in progress secure the charge b any personnel in the battery compartment should evacuate c isolate the battery compartment from the ventilation system and battery air agitation system d electrically isolate the battery warning to protect the operator from shock and to avoid battery short circuiting an insulated fire extinguisher should always be used in the battery compartment 55536112 electrical short shortterm electrical short can occur when tool is dropped on the battery circuit this results in local flaming caused by the short the flaming will usually selfextinguish when the metal tool vaporizes an insulated co 2 extinguisher should be used to extinguish residual burning warning never attempt to extinguish battery cable fire by pouring water onto the battery electrolytic currents will generate hydrogen and oxygen which may produce violent explosion salt water or impure fresh water introduced into the battery compartment may cause toxic gases to be generated 55536113 class fire in the battery compartment combustible material in the battery compartment consists primarily of bulkhead insulation and small amounts of other material such as wood cribbing or plastic tubing there is very low risk of class fire in the battery compartment the safest and most effective method available for fighting battery compartment fire is through oxygen starvation securing the battery compartment and stopping all ventilation within including the battery air agitation system will deprive the flames of oxygen attempts should be made to enter into the battery compartment to insert any activated fire extinguishers as this may result in spread of the fire and release of toxic gases into the forward compartment additionally opening the battery compartment hatch will allow oxygen to enter the compartment and sustain the fire the ssn 21 class has co 2 portable extinguisher connections installed in the battery compartment bulkhead for injecting co 2 into the battery compartment without opening the compartment door warning use co 2 for class or c fires only do not inject co 2 into nonburning battery compartment if the hydrogen concentration is above the alarm set point the static electric discharge created during co 2 discharge could ignite hydrogen concentration within the explosive ranges9086s3stm020ch555v2r5 c0051c0054c0045c0049c0049b entry into the battery compartment should be attempted only after the fire has been put out the compartment has cooled and has been thoroughly ventilated to remove toxic and explosive gases if battery compartment boundaries are tight there may be pressure buildup in the compartment this pressure buildup will require that ventilation exhaust be established prior to removing the cover on the battery inlet filter this will also minimize the spread of toxic and explosive gases in the ship the pressure buildup against dogged battery compartment access hatch will make entry into the compartment dangerous the ssn 21 class has battery compartment relief valve which discharges into the battery exhaust ventilation duct to prevent excessive pressure buildup emergency ventilation of the battery compartment with the blower will most rapidly and effectively remove toxic and explosive gases from the ship c during overhaul and certain other maintenance conditions it is not always possible to isolate the battery compartment fire protection for minor fire under those conditions must be provided by insulated co 2 fire extinguishers in order to avoid battery short circuiting and electrical shock to personnel two insulated plastisolcovered carbon dioxide extinguishers are required for use by fire watch personnel when hot work is performed on the boundary of the battery compartment or to protect against minor fire when conditions prohibit isolation of the compartment the plastisol covered extinguishers are to be used to attack small fire and should not be dropped into or left in the battery compartment unattended 55536114 uncontrolled battery discharge an uncontrolled battery discharge presents significant hazard to the ship uncontrolled battery discharges have been caused by flooding of the battery compartment and by large short between busses before the battery breaker they could also occur from battery derangement following collision or shock an uncontrolled current discharge is hazardous battery condition which threatens the safety of the submarine and crew b the symptoms likely to be observed in such an emergency include smoke and odor of burning rubber paint and plastic in the spaces above and adjacent to the battery compartment high battery discharge current and zero battery ground may be observed depending on the source and location of the short circuit c the intense heat from the grounded cells will start fires in the spaces above and adjacent to the battery compartment therefore immediate action must be taken to monitor temperatures on the deck above and bulkheads around the battery compartment and cool with water fog when required d once the discharge is recognized and opening the battery breaker does not secure the discharge it is unlikely that attempts to enter the battery compartment and open manual disconnects and disconnect bus bars will be possible specific damage control actions including ventilation considerations for an uncontrolled current discharge must be based on careful evaluation of the operating or in port situation 55536115 hydrogen explosion for prevention of hydrogen explosion see nstm chapter 223 volume 1 submarine storage batteries ignition of hydrogen enriched atmosphere results in an explosion which can cause structural deformation damage to ship systems and secondary fires in combustible material if the cause of hydrogen formation is not corrected hydrogen enriched atmosphere may reform and followon explosions can occur therefore efforts should be focused on preventing reformation of hydrogen enriched atmosphere for additional information and procedures concerning the battery see nstm chapter 223 volume 1 submarine storage batteries

protects the nitrile rubber base beneath it from ignition the coverply burns with low intensity and may extinguish itself if the source of the fire can be removed larger fire source would subject the coverply to more intense heat and would significantly reduce the fire resistance of this outer layer once exposed the rubber base material will readily ignite combustion of aa18 and ad79m sht base material is characterized as self sustaining vigorous deep seated burning at high surface temperature producing very heavy smoke and intense heat figure 555361 shows deep seated burning of small panel of ad79m sht around seven minutes after ignition the 6 foot wide 14 foot high panel in figure 555361 was ignited by small fuel pan shown after removal in the lower right hand corner of the photo flame spreading to the side edges and far beyond the top of the sht panel show that the fire would continue to spread vertically and horizontally across completely covered ship hull the flaming aa18 and ad79m materials will flake off to expose unburned material deeper in the tile for further burning flaming pieces of the base material will fall into the dry dock and support continued combustion of

with the nitrile or natural rubber base material of sht tiles the dura1 asht material will readily ignite if exposed to the sources of ignition described above dura1 however does not have protective coverply layer to delay ignition of the base material fire involving dura1 will rapidly grow and become self sustaining dura1 fire is characterized as high intensity with medium density smoke the material drips when it burns and will form pool of burning material in the dry dock this burning pool will make the fire larger by supporting continued combustion of the asht above it and spreading the fire to other materials c0053c0053c0053c0045c0051c0054c0046c0049c0050c0046c0050c0046c0051 c0032c0032c0070c0105c0114c0101 c0083c0112c0114c0101c0097c0100 fires involving sht and asht quickly spread vertically up the submarine hull as hot smoke rises with the fire plume to heat and support fire spread horizontal spread of the fire occurs when the flames meet an obstruction such as scaffolding the

organization and equipment is useless without trained personnel properly trained and drilled crew will minimize confusion during fires increase the probability of proper initial actions taken against fire and enhance the predictability of firefighting responses and tactics vital to the effort however is continuity of personnel that is people assigned to fire team should retain that position even if other shipboard duties change all members of fire team should be cross trained for at least one other position on the fire team in order to provide frequent rotation 555372 required features 5553721 effective fire drills do not happen automatically careless effort will result in useless drills which do not improve the crews capability or even bad drills which train poor habits each fire drill should include training elements which touch on the phases of firefighting outlined in section 35 these drills will ensure that personnel know how and when to secure the fryer and extinguish the fire as firefighting party improves realism can be incorporated time compression is the most important feature to incorporate fire can grow from tiny flicker to life threatening blaze in few minutes drills must be practiced at real time speed this creates two important conditions the urgency of the situation and the inevitable problems with donning personnel protection the effects of smoke must also be included including the use of blindfolds to simulate loss of visibility the loss of staging areas loss of equipment in lockers which can not be reached and the extra confusion caused by all the above cascading casualties are also common in fires as fire spreads or damages vital services realistic effective drills shall include these effects machinery space fires can grow out of control
