whether the longest economic expansi on in us history had come to an end the national bureau of economic research officially declared that the longest running expansion in the postwar peri od ended in ma rch 2001 the labor market situation deteriorated further between 2001 and 2002 with the unemployment rate averaging 58 in 2002 compared to 48 in 2001 nonfarm employment at private firms fell by 15 million between the 2 years one bright spot was that the number of workers separated in announced layoffs in 2002 147 million receded from the record high in 2001 of just under 20 million the federalstate unemployment co mpensation uc program provides financial cushion for involuntarily unemplo yed workers who recently held jobs and helps stabilize the economy during recessions typically in response to recessions the congress has enacted measures to suppl ement the regular uc program the 107th congress in march 2002 passed legislation that gave dditional weeks of jobless benefits to workers who exhausted their re gular benefits after the measure expired in december 2002 its extension was the first order of business in the 108th congress during several downturns in the busine ss cycle the congress also has passed legislation to directly create jobs so that people moved more quickly than they otherwise might have from unemployment rolls to employer payrolls at present variety of proposals are being advanced to spur economic growth and to create jobs given what is viewed as lackluster and jobless r ecovery the proposals include variety of measures such as providing tax relief to i ndividuals and providing states with financial assistance so that they do not enact procyclical legislation ie tax increases and spending cutbacks four direct approaches public works public service revenuesharing and employment tax credits were utilized to cr eate jobs in the public or private sectors during earlier recessionary periods the test major measure was the emergency jobs appropriations act of 1983 an amalga m of public works and public service job creation it provided about 9 billion to 77 programs administered by 18 federal departments and agencies about 78 b

went to 22 progra ms and activities that perform public service functions such as block grant programs ie the ma ternal and child care block services grant and the social services block grant and programs that provide income support and employmenttraining assistance the nation has had only one experience with countercyclical tax credit the new jobs tax credit and count ercyclical revenue

programs of the postworld war ii era the national bureau of economic research belatedly declared that the longest economic expansion in the postwar pe riod officially ended in march 20011 by years end the unemployment rate had ri sen to 58 from its monthly low in 2000 of 392 employment in the private nonfar m sector fell by 19 million jobs between december 2001 and the cyclical peak mo reover the number of workers involved in layoff actions that either took place or were announced in 2001 was the highest on record estimates ranged from about 175 million to just shy of 20 million3 the events of september 11 2001 further disrupted activity in some sectors of the economy most notably travelrelated terprises domestic air carriers and aircraft manufacturers quickly announced that they were laying off tens of thousands of employees hoteliers in new york c ity and elsewhere eg washington dc and vegas laid off or scaled back em ployees hours as result of reduced leisure and business travel the latter having fallen off before th attacks although persons whose work hours are shortened or who pend heavily on tips eg waitstaff and cabdrivers may not be unemployed their incomes and presumably their spending would nonetheless decrease the federalstate unemployment compen sation uc program which has been in place since 1935 provides financial cushion for involuntarily unemployed workers who recently held jobs and he lps stabilize the economy during recessions typically in response to recessions the congress has enacted measures to supplement the regular uc program as th

year of 2001 7 an example of an indirect job creation meas ure is personal income or payroll tax cut if the taxes of individuals are cut they ght spend the money that would otherwise have gone toward funding government activities producers in turn might hire more workers in response to taxcutinduced increase in consumer demand for goods and servicesyear its extension was the first order of business taken up by the newly installed 108th congress pl 10815 at the present time the administration and some members of congress are advancing variety of proposals to spur economic growth and to create jobs given what is viewed as lackluster and jobless recovery the unemployment rate moved erratically within narrow rang 55 and 60 during 2002 and averaged 58 for the year nonfarm payroll jobs dropped by 15 million between 2001 and 2002 in contrast the number of announ ced layoffs improved over 2001s total decreasing by about onequarter to 147 million6 the proposals include variety of measures such as providing tax relief to individuals and providing states with financial assistance so that they do not enact procyclical legislation ie tax increases and spending cutbacks during several earlier downturns in the business cycle the congress has passed legislation to directly create jobs so that people moved more quickly than they otherwise might have from unemployment rolls to employer payrolls this report presents brief comparison of the four direct approaches public works public service revenuesharing and employment tax credits that were utilized to create jobs in the public or private sectors dur ing recessionary periods measures that could indirectly create jobs are not discussed in this report7 it then describes the specific major countercyclical job creati on activities that were initiated during the postworld war ii period and includes di scussion of program evaluations the report will be update d if the congress pursues one of these strategies comparison of direct job creation approaches public works programs it has been argued that federal spending on public works jobs projects eg highways wate r and sewer facilities hospitals and libraries both creates worthwhile tangible outputs and teaches workers marketable skills if program funds mainly are devot ed to construction projects that require costly materials and equipment as well as highly skilled workers then public works projects might be considered fairly expensive way to create jobs alternatively if funds are devoted to more laborintensive endeavors such as those involved inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31138crs3 infrastructure maintenance and repair mo re jobs would be created per dollar of spending public works jobs programs often are sl ow to start which could cause them to increase the demand for labor when the ec onomy already is expanding and thereby drive up wages and the inflation rate th startup of public works program can be delayed because of lags between the appropriation of federal f unds and their allocation to state or local government s between the allocation of funds to jurisdictions and their awarding of contract s and between the awarding of contracts and the initiation of projects moreover fe deral funds might be substituted for state or local funds that would have been spen t on similar projects in the absence of the federal program practice that diminishes the actual number of new jobs generated by the federal expenditure public service programs countercyclical public service jobs programs typically have been quicker to startup than public works programs in addition relatively more federal expenditures on public service activities go toward wages as result more jobs can be created per dollar of spending on public service as compared to public works projects public service jobs programs also tend to help broader range of workers by employing more lower skilled and unemployed workers than public works programs it has been asserted that public service jobs programs impart few skills to participants and that the participants engage in makework projects in addition participants hired through public service jobs programs might be substituted for regular government workers thereby dampening the programs net jobcreating effect revenuesharing programs these federal grants can stabilize state and local governments budgets by giving th governments funds to avoid cutbacks in services or increases in taxes due to r ecessioninduced revenue shortfalls spending cuts or tax increases at the state or local level could exacerbate recessions effects and offset countercycli cal measures initiated at the federal level some observers think that revenuesha ring programs can produce jobs fairly quickly if the money is used for general purposes and if neither new regulations nor new administrative entities are required by attaching few strings to the ways in which federal funds may be spen t there is risk that states or localities might utilize the funds for purposes that create relativ ely few new jobs eg building up cash balances or using federal for statelocal f unds that otherwise would have been spent employment tax credits as in the case of the aforementioned job creation approaches some of the jobs created by employment tax credits likely would have been created in the absence of the program ie employers could claim credit for already anticipated hiring the availability of jobs tax credit during an economic recovery might accelerate the p ace of hiring rather than create additional jobs the failure of other direct job creation prog rams to end when an economic recovery begins means that private employers would have to compete with these programs for new workers which in turn could dr ive up wages and the inflation ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31138crs4 some analysts believe that an employment tax credit is superior to public service job creation because workers get jobs in the private sector under the tax credit approach where they may learn skills that subsequently are readily transferable to unsubsidized jobs at private firms other benefits claimed for the tax credit approach are that it neither requires new government program nor an administrative entity alternatively the speed with which tax credit generates employment depends on how and when individual employers respond to the subsidys availability although jobs tax credit lowers the cost of labor to firms it might not cause them to hire more workers during recession unless businesses think that there is sufficient demand to warrant increased production the relative change in input labor and capital prices might not entice them to expand employment much if at all moreover faced with only temporary subsidization of their labor costs firms might be unwilling to change their production tec hniques and shift their input mix toward greater use of the less expensive labor input countercyclical public works employment the public works acceleration act of 1962 pl 87658 created the accelerated public works apw program which was the first effort in the postwar period to create publicly funded jobs in construction and related private sector industries to combat rising national unemployment in addition to redevelopment areas designated under the ar ea redevelopment act localitie s eligible for assistance were those that the secretary of labor determined had experienced substantial unemployment ie jobless rate above 6 for at least 9 of the preceding 12 months the program was conducted thr ough existing federal agencies and was coordinated by the commerce department the apw program provided 852 million for such projects as waste treatment water and sewer facilities hospitals and health facilities and street construction and repair the apw program and subsequent counter cyclical public works measures have been criticized for their layed startup whic h means that many projects were not completed until well after r ecessions end some observers have suggested that if there were program already in place with prescribed triggers for its initiation the issue of timeliness woul d be resolved others have responded that even with an already existing program the time needed to plan obtain materials and hire workers as well as the time it takes to complete the projects themselves still would make public works programs procyclical rather th an countercyclical that is by increasing the demand for labor when the economy is expanding public works programs could drive up wages and conseque ntly the inflation rate the local public works capital deve lopment and investment act of 1976 title i of pl 94369 the public works employment act of 1976 and the public works employment act of 1977 pl 95 28 appropriated 6 billion for the local public works lpw program the economic development administration allocated funds to states based on thei r unemployment levels and rates and to substate areas based on more complicated formulahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31138crs5 there was criticism that lpw funds we re substituted for local funds which would have been spent on similar projects in the absence of the federal program analysts differing assumptions about the ex tent of this practice commonly referred to as fiscal substitution resulted in mark edly different estimates of the net number of jobs created by the program the net number of jobs attributable to any type of job creation measure will be smaller than the gross number to the extent that some of the subsidized jobs would have b een created even without the program given the nature of public works pr ograms the lpw program did not help unemployed workers across range of occ upations instead it largely provided jobs for already employed construction work ers who might otherwise have become unemployed for the few unemployed pe rsons who did get jobs on lpw projects the experience and skills acquired probably were minimal as the average length of employment was short the emergency jobs appropriations ac t of 1983 pl 988 was an amalgam of public works and public service job crea tion it provided roughly 9 billion to 77 programs administered by 18 federal departments and agen cies about 86 of the appropriations 78 billion we nt to 55 programs and activ ities that f und public works functions eg construction repair nd maintenance of build ings and facilities including roads libraries housing and school s the remainder went to 22 programs and activities that perform public service functions such as through the maternal and child care block services grant the social services block grant and community centers 620 million income support 400 million and employme nttraining assistance 230 million pl 988 was designed to deal with some of the criticisms leveled at earlier job creation efforts by appropriating additiona l funds to existing programs with projects already underway the congress expected that money would be spent and jobs would be created more quickly than in past j ob creation efforts an evaluation of the program showed this was not the case howev er in addition although the legislation required that funds be used as much as possible to create jobs for the unemployed relatively few jobs went to unemployed workers in response to this criticism program officials suggested that this might have occurred because unemployed workers did not have the skills needed for some projects or because contractors were trying to provide jobs for their existing workforces countercyclical public service employment the public employment program pep authorized by the emergency employment act of 1971 pl 9254 was the first sizeable 25 billion anti recessionary public service employment effo rt since the great depression it was temporary program that sought to provide public service jobs to unemployed and underemployed persons funds were allocated to units of gove rnment based on the relative severity of unemployment program funds were spen t quickly which meant that jobs were created at rapid rate the program was laborintensive with large share of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31138crs6 funds going toward wages however veral studies found that many of the jobs subsidized by the program would have exis ted in its absence and that the program creamed ie took the best qualif ied of the elig ible population although pep was countercyclical tool it also focused resources on those thought to be most in need the law calle d for targeting assistance to such groups as veterans young and older workers th economically disa dvantaged welfare recipients migrant workers nonenglish speakers and workers laid off due to cutbacks in the defense aerospace and construc tion industries in order to ensure that many different occupationa l groups benefitted from pep the legislation mandated that maximum annual salary of 12000 per employee could come from federal funds and excluding teaching positions ma ximum of onethird of the jobs created could be for professionals the emergency jobs and unemployme nt assistance act of 1974 pl 93567 amended the comprehensive employment and training act ceta to add title vi emergency job programs it was established to mitigate cyclical unemployment by funding temporary positions in federal state and local governments as well as in nonprofit organizations that pr ovided public services t itle vi f unds about 15 billion 19751982 were alloca ted to prime sponsors ba sed on measures of the relative severity of unemployment th program created many jobs quickly initially to be eligible for jobs subsidiz ed by title vi funds individuals had to have been unemployed for 30 days or 15 da ys in areas where the unemployment rate exceeded 7 in both the 1976 and 1 978 amendments to ceta the title vi eligibility criteria were tightened to targ et funds to lowincome unemployed persons eg the maximum annual federal wage subsidy per program participant was lowered to 10000 these changes were enacted to discourage what was perceived as widespread practice by state and local g overnments that reduced the net number of jobs created many state and local governments laid off current employees and then rehired them using title vi rather than st atelocal funds to pay them cetas public service program also was criticized for creating makework deadend jobs which some believed neither provided society with worthw hile output nor ceta workers with useful skills countercyclical revenuesharing grants the antirecession fiscal assistance arfa program title ii of pl 94369 the public works employment act of 1976 which was ame nded and extended by the tax simplification and ad justment act of 1977 title vi of pl 9530 operated from 1976 to late 1978 the legislation authorized appropriations of 125 billion and 225 billion respectively for total of 35 billion arfa funds were to be released only if the national unemployment rate exceeded 6 the allocation of funds to individual government s was determined by local unemployment rates over 45 and by their general revenue sharinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31138crs7 8 general revenue sharing was program established in the 1970s that provided largely unrestricted federal financial aid to states and localitiesallocations8 by law recipients of arfa gran ts were required to spend appropriate or obligate funds within 6 months of their receipt the use to which arfa funds could be put were largely unr estricted ie for the maintenance of basic services customar ily provided by government such as public welfare education and police protection the funds generally could be used for employment and the acquisition of normal supplie s or materials and for repairs but not for construction or renovation common criticism of the programs design was that it did not effectively target aid for countercyclical purposes so analysts thought arfa assisted local economies undergoing longrun secular declin rather than focusing on those with shortrun cyclical difficulties it also was argued that the unemployment rate is not good indicator of recessions impact on jurisdictions fina ncial condition the allocation of funds between state and cal governments was criticized as well because recessions reportedly cause less budgetary disruption to local than state governments as state revenue sources and expenditures are more sensitive to economic conditions some be lieved that state governme nts should have received more than onethird of the arfa funds in order for countercyclical grants to promote economic stabilization they must be spent rather than used to buildup stat or local government surpluses more particularly they must be additive rather than used in place of local funds that otherwise would have been spent thus revenuesharing programs can suffer from fiscal substitution just as public works nd public service job creation programs can it was suggested that fiscal substituti on in revenuesharing programs might be minimized by earmarking the activities for which jurisdictions could use the grants countercyclical employment subsidies the united states has had one experience with tax credit intended to promote private sector job growth as an antidot to recessioninduced unemployment the new jobs tax credit njtc was enact ed in 1977 title ii of pl 9530 tax reduction and simplification ac t of 1977 it ended in late 1978 the revenue loss to the government associated with the credit less the required reduction by firms deductions for wages and including carryovers for several years was estimated by the treasury departme nt to be 57 billion the njtc was general subsidy meant to increase employment among all workers it gave firms nonrefundable cred its against corporate or personal income tax liabilities and thus was only of value to forprofit employers the njtc was an incremental or marginal subsidy that is employers could claim credit only if their employment rose by given amount above specified threshold in this case the credit was qual to onehalf of the increase above 2 inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31138crs8 an employers federal unemployment ta x act wage base between the base and current year as marginal credit it tende d to favor growing laborintensive firms and to help reduce windfall ga ins ie paying employers for hiring that they would have undertaken in the absence of the program over time however it becomes increasingly difficult for firms to qualify for marginal credit the njtc was capped in three different ways firm could claim credit in excess of 1 100000 annually 2 25 of its unemployment insurance ui wages in the current year or 3 onehalf of the difference in the firms total wages for the year above 5 of the previous years to tal wages the reason for limiting the credit by relating it to the increase in total wages was to prevent employers from claiming credits by artificially increasing their ui wages eg making fulltime jobs into part time jobs or substituting lower paid for higher paid workers the reason for capping the credit at certain percentage of fi rms ui wages was to try to limit the amount that new expanding firms could claim some observers faulted the njtc for its complexity one survey found that relatively few employers knew about the credit and of those firms that were aware of the njtc relatively few made specific effort to increase employment because of its availability or thought th ey were eligible to claim it in contrast other analysts credited the njtc with high employer use
