fragmentation of political parties stemming more from personality tha n policy differences has produced the frequent changeovers moreover because th constitution mandates that the powerful military

in many other countries national consensus on the need for economic liberalizat ion and privatization has developed in recent years rendering stillused labels of left and right increasingly unhelpful if not meaningless comparable consensus exists on nationalism which has been strengthened by the european unions rejection of tur key for membership candidacy balkans conflicts in areas that were part of the turkishruled ottoman empire in the past the emergence2 of independent turkic sta tes from the ruins of the soviet union and the 15year kurdish insurgency within turkey nationalists gained

however the islamists retained mayoral posts in istanbul ankara an d other municipalities the nationalist dsp came in first and the even more nationalisti c mhp that had not even been represented in the previous parliament shocked itself and observers with second place showing the chp the party of mustafa kemal ataturk founder of the turkish republic failed to enter parliament for th first time ever the pro kurdish hadep while also not making mark nationally unprecedentedly won si x mayoral races in the southeast including the regional capital of diyarbakirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20253crs3 there are many reasons for the ch anges the turkish public may have had surfeit of the dyp and anap leaders rivalry and alleged corruption of the political machinations of the now former centerleft chp leader deniz baykal and of the equally manipulative behavior of the banned rp leader necmettin erbakan in other words voters punished those whom they felt put themselves and their quest for power before the good of th country voters rewarded dsp and mhp leaders who have reputations for honesty and are fiercely nationalistic in the emotional climate following the capture of ocalan n ensuing surge in domestic terrorism largely attributed to kurdish terrorists and th kosovo conflict dsp leader ecevit benefitt ed from his strong stand against the pkk and simply from being prime minister when oc alan was caught mhp leader bahceli profited from his efforts to redefine his ultraright party as centristmoderate since taking its helm in 1997 and from the publics nationalist tilt in addition mhps strong grass roots work especially among 5 million first time young voters and the central anatolian petit bourgeoisi paid off as did its antipkk stand and reputation for supporting families of soldiers who had been killed f ighting the pkk the victors also may have drawn support from protest voters of 1995 who had then supported islamists but now decided not t waste their votes on party that the military would not allow to participate in government again remaining political distinctions in the new parliament focus mostly on politica l islam and memories of street battles between left and right in the 1970s new government after the election prime minister bulent ecevit replaced his prior singlepart minority government with one of three parties which together have 352 out of 550 seats in parliament once they agreed to for m government dsp mhp and anap appeared to divide 36 ministerial portfolios easily this may be attributed to dspanap s success ful prior governmental collaboration in 199798 and to mhps preference fo r seemingly lesspowerful noncontroversial patronageladen portfolios the coalitio n partners agreed to request parliament to authorize thir d deputy prime minister for anap in addition to those from dsp and mhp and did so promptly yilmaz opted not t participate for the time being in order to appeal corruption charges to the supreme court among other portfolios dsp ret ained the foreign and education ministries as well as the stat ministry responsible for cyprus mhp received the defense ministry which ensures it seat on the national security council but is inco nsequential given the militarys dominan ce in that field mhp also holds portfolios that will enable it to serve it s constitu encies and ideology the ministries of agriculture industry and trade publi c works and transportation the state ministry respo nsible for the turkic republics and the turkish cooperation and development agency the equivalent of the us agency fo r international development which is vital to relations with the former soviet republics anap holds the interior ministry the lucrative ministry of energy and the state ministry responsible for relations with the european union primary actors prime minister bulent ecevit was born in istanbul in 1925 he became member of parliament as republican peoples party chp dep uty in 1959 and served

ecevit reentered the arena in 1987 when he took over s general chairman of the dsp from his wife rahsan who had founded the party an d remains its deputy chairman ecevit served as deputy prime minister from mid199 7 through 1998 in january 1999 he became prime min ister of dsp minority government that took the country to national ections intermittent reports suggest that the 74year old ecevit has health problems one possible successor is deputy prime ministe r husamettin ozkan who conducted much of the coalition negotiations ecevit had been considered reflexively leftist antiamerican in recent years however his appreciation for turkeys friendship with the remaining superpower has grown he supported th united states and nato during the kosovo conflict and has allowed us use of turkish bases for operation northern watch over iraq deputy prime minister devlet bahceli was born in 1948 i n osmaniye east of adana he is turkoman bahceli was founder of and activist in the ultranationalist idealist3 youth organizations in 1987 mhp founder and leader alparslan turkes appointe d bahceli secretary general of the party in the mid1990s the party began to adopt the appearance of moderation in 1994 bahceli was named deputy party chairman turkes died in 1997 bahceli won an ensuing power struggle with rkes tugrul reportedly because of his organizational skills and party activism he has worked to moderate th partys extremist image from that of the grey wolves thugs idealist militias to political player which strives for harmony some extremists were purged and other s reportedly left the party with tugrul after he lost the leadership bahceli leads the party collegially with coterie f professors mhps nationalism traditionally looks toward the turkic world seeking closer ties with central asia and with turks in bulgaria russia and china mhp views foreign policy through nationalist prism supporting ties wit h israel and the united states because they strengthen turks it is suspicious of ties with the eu that could harm turkeys sovereignty mesut yilmaz was born in 1947 in istanbul into family from the black sea region of rize in 1983 he was one of the founders of anap and was elected to parliament yilmaz headed ministries in anap governments led by the late turgut ozal in 1991 he was elected party chairman and served as prime minister until losing national election later that year in 1996 he briefly served as prime minister in failed coalition with his political archrival tansu ciller of the dyp in mid1997 yilmaz again became prim minister in november 1998 he resigned after vote of confidence prompted b corruption charges yilmaz who has reputation for being better at intraparty politic s than at governing may need to participate in this government to dampen internal part dissent generated by anaps declining share of the vo and perhaps to position the party for merger with dyp after the possible political demise of ciller program turkey faces many economic challenges after strong 83 annual growth rate in 1997 its economy was harmed in 1998 by the global financial crisis particularly i n russia key trading partner when growth slowed to 38 growth projections for 1999 have been revised downward 05 and the budget deficit estimate upward to 223 3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20253crs5 billion or about 7 of gross national product securing financing from the international monetary fund imf has become more urgent the government is set to continue the economic policies of its two immediate predecessors led by dsp and anap to figh t inflation which has come down from triple digits to about 5055 annually privatiz state enterprises and reform th banking and social security systems parliament already has passed law to create semiindependent supervisory panel for banks and budget for the remainder of the year priority may then be given to legislation to reform socia l security which pay s pensions at very young age adding egregiously to budget deficits and national debt and to permit international arbitration of business disputes in order to attract foreign investors especially for turkeys many energy projects the coalition partners have agreed not to revisit 1997 law requiring 8 years f compulsory secular education or prohibitions on women wearing head scarves in public institutions these agreements are viewed as mhp concessions to secularism because it has religio us constituency however mhp probably would prefer to avoid changes which might anger the mili tary the coalition protocol calls for repentance law to allow pkk guerrillas to gain some form of immunity by regretting their actions but dsp an d mhp disagree about its urgency and substance mhp seeks transpa rency in privatizations and limits on parliamentary immunity to fight corruption giv the publics concern about corruption and the imfs with transparency dsp and anap probably will agree prospects multiparty coalitions are inherently unstable and turkish governments rarely serve out their terms with over 350 seats in parliament the dspmhpanap governmen t could last longer than its recent predecessors turkey needs political stability in order to implement economic reforms and t he patriotism of dsp and mhp or their desire to stay in office may allow the government to survive yet historic differences and politica l ambitio ns could overtake their good intentions dsp and mhp adherents fought eac h other in the streets in the 1970s during coalition negotiations in may rahsan ecevi t publicly dredged up her memories of those years underlining the continuing distrust for mhp if dspanap connivance had deprived mhp of more powerful tfolios it might be resentful moreover after period of governing mhp may wish to try for first place in early elections should dyp chan ge leaders however it could be viewed as possible substitute for mhp in government re configured without elections limiting mhps room for maneuver dyp will not be potential governing partner as long as ciller is part leader given yilma zs antipathy her ineradicable reputation for corruption and probable enduring military opposition due to her role in bringing the islamists to power in 1996 moreover some political advisers recommen d against relegating both mhp and fp to the opposition simultaneously fearing collaboration of extremists parliament will select new president in may 2000 the coalition partners ma engage in serious horsetrading be fore that date yilmaz is presumed to have presidential ambitions while the intellectual ecevit ironically does not mee t constitutional requirements for the office because of his lack of university degree he may propose anothe r candidate mhps views on the presidential race are unknownhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20253crs6 see cr s report 97799 greece and turkey aegean issues background and recen t4 developments and crs issue brief 89140 cyprus status of negotiations usturkish relations president clinton has invited prime minister ecevit to visit the united states i n september there is long agenda of issues to engage the two leaders th administration would like to see turkey make substantive progres s in democratization and human rights particularly since turkey has not fulfilled prior promises th administration is likely to express appreciation for turkeys role in nato air strike s during the kosovo conflict its aid to kosovar albanian refugees and its participation in kosovo peacekeeping as well as for hosting operation northern watch usbritish enforced nofly zone over nor thern iraq the administration was heartened by turkeys cooperation with greece n humanitarian issues during the kosovo crisis and may try to use it as foundation for improving strained bilateral relations between the two nat members in the aegean sea and on cyprus ecevit however is more likely to mak e4 demands than conce ssions turkey recognizes the turkish republic of northern cyprus as an independent state and favors confederal solution for the island rather than th federal sol ution stipulated in resolutions it also insists that greece end its alleged support for the pkk accept dialogue on aegean issues and end obstruction f turkey s european union ambitions greece favors cyprus federation denie s supporting the pkk wa nts turkey to take aegean disputes to the international court of justice and may not concede much on the eu until turkey complies the administration seems certain to express continuing support for several f turkeys more elusive goals eu candidacy construction of an oil pipeline from baku azerbaijan to the port of ceyhan in turkey and transcaspian gas pipeline fro m turkmenistan to turkey turkey has labeled the two nergy projects its highest priorities despite the administrations backing because it views the pipel ines as good for turkey and for enhancing t he independence of the former soviet republics energy companies regard the pipelines as the most expensive routes for central asian energy exports and som doubt that they are commercially feasible furthermore turkey has been unable to attain eu candidacy partly because it has resisted eu demands to change its cyprus policy improve relations with greece and redress human right abuses should ocalan b executed turkisheu ties could worsen eu members condemn capital punishment and sympathize with turkeys kurds moreover us support for eu candidacy may mean less to ecevit who appears to regard eu membership as lower priority than forme r governments for his part ecevit may express concern over the us determination to replac saddam hussein he is not convinced that us policy toward iraq is realistic and i s worried about the possibility of pre cedentsetting kurdish state in northern iraq ecevit may convey similar thoughts to members of congress to whom he also may emphasize the cost turkey has incurred by maintai ning sanctions on iraq since the gulf war and the detrimental ffects that sanctions have had on iraqi civilians ecevit also may complain about what he considers congressional in terference in arms purchases and deliveries from the united states which arise from congress ional concerns about turkishgreek relations and turkeys violations of the human rights of kurdish civilians he may object to what turks consider interference in usturkish relations by ethnic lobbies
