case repair lecture given on 8 january 1963 thank you lecture two 8 jan ad 13 saint hill special briefing course this is about case repair now ive given you very pure rundown in the first lecture on the exact plot of what you can do with case with listing and opposing and so forth and if you were to do thatsucceed in doing that and so forthyou would get very miraculous gain on case this would be less mass as opposed to more mass now if you goof you will get more mass and things will become more solid and the first symptom of goofing is actually more mass more mass has shown up on the case than was there before and consequently more rs than was there before those are the things that you know you are going wrong with you know youre losing with the case if on tuesday you have more rock slams on the case than you had last wednesday lets say you went over the scientology list originally and it had rock slams on it but from some other sources1a or some of the other list headings that we had like what are you upset aboutand you did lot of that and you got lot of packages and then you go back to the scientology list and youll find out scientology and central orgs and things like that are now rock slamming the case is not improved up to point where it can rock slam the case actually has become massier and that is reflected in more rock slams than previously now you get these two symptoms of case worsening these casescase bettering case worsening you get these two aspects thenmore mass and more rock slamas being worsening symptom now along with this is your best indicator for visual inspection of the pc is tone of the skin pcs get discolored skin tones they go gray or green or yellow or black and this happens sufficiently rapidly to be noted in session actually you can list list wrong way to and sit right there and watch the mass close in on the pc and the pc gets blacker and blacker and blacker and at the end of the session the pc is more black than they were at the beginning of the session well something is very wrong 212 does not work that way or routine 2 does not work that way they should be lighter their skin tone should be better and actually its about thisyou should be able to tell halfway through session whether or not their skin tone is better than at the beginning of the session now you can also tell with the eyes and the eyes look like they have more sen on them halfway through session than at the beginning of the session i would check over what i was doing i couldnt necessarily abandon it because it merely means theyre running through sen period or something like this so the eye is not as reliable as skin tone skin toneinevitably invariable darkening or worseoff skin tone halfway through session than at the beginning of session shows that youre doing something very wrong so you should learn to spot pcs skin tone at the beginning of sessionat the beginning of auditing and get fixed idea of what it is so that you could use that as point of comparison beginning of the session take look at your pc pc light shade of yellow well at least at the end of the session they should be lighter shade of yellow not darker shade of yellow do you see that so remember to pick up point of reference by which you can compare what you are doing now the other symptom here is age and that is very easy to look at does the pc look older or younger and that is also progressively easy to compare it isnt whether the pc looks older at the end of an intensive than at the beginning of an intensive its not that gross its whether or not the pc looks older halfway through session see and its quite gross as yardstick you should be able to sit there and see the pc look slightly younger halfway through the session than at the beginning of the session if youre doing routine 2 right and the pc will look slightly older halfway through the session now this goes down to such thing and dont laugh now but it goes down to such thing as gray hair suzie used to be very amused at on this because my hair would turn gray and turn red and turn gray almost at will and this is quite easy to tell but you see that pcs hair is grayer at the end of an intensive than it was at the beginning of an intensive why something really went wrong now this also refers to mass now that is fairlythat is less grossage itself is very gross that has big differences that you can see but im just talking about thisits just little part of age see weight is another factor and that goesthats not quite as gross yardstickbut weight goes something on the order of two three sessions you should be able to markedly tell weight improvement now the pc actually should weigh less how much less can pc weigh well on some pcs who are obsessively thin and too light actually little more weight is an improvement but you have to use your head on that one but ordinarily why an increase of weight means an increase of mass now these are the things you tell by because the graph is not available to the auditor midway in the session and midway in the intensive and so forth so these are very precise mechanisms by which to tell improvement but im talking about the auditors mechanisms to tell improvement and they fall into just those categories others dont bother with any other categories you can usually look over charts you can usually look over the pcs auditor reports and find out if he made his goals well if the pc has consistently made his goals in the session why you can conceive the pc is getting better so forth those are indicators but the things i have just told you about such as skin tone and age theyre exclamation point see theyre right theyre deanon and mass to slightly lesser degree but very positively is an indicator now all of these things add up to an auditors observation of the pc now meter should behave better i dont say that metera meter has good way of behaving on pc im not trying to set that up as some hidden standard to you but when you ask the pc for withhold you get response when the pc has one you understand whereas last week when you asked them for withhold you couldnt tell in other words its simply matter of the meter doing better by the auditor this meter is easier to use thats all now the needles cleaner justits the meter is better for the auditor and its always for the auditor meter behaves better you dont have any meter trouble with this pc see you used to have meter trouble three sessions ago we had more meter trouble than we have now now height of tone arm or obsessive lowness of tone arm are alike indicators but in actual fact routine 2 doesnt give us perfect score on the tone arm the tone arm can almost be neglected were more interested in needle behavior than we are tone arm positions to show bettering in routine 2 this tone arm can actually consistently ride at 5 with the pc getting better and better and better thats interesting isnt it not even tone arm motion means anything in routine 2 so you list and get tone arm motion so you list and get tone arm motion there is adjudication can be made out of that but sometimes youll find an item that rock slams on the tone arm but that is so rare that were not particularly worried about it but if after while our emeter has not changed in its position we begin to worry about whats going on here you understand after while at the end of athe pc has consistently ridden at 6 and weve gotten three packages and its still at 6 well we conceive then that we must have been plucking things out of the air something here is not fundamental on this case we conceive this pc still must have the pt problem the pc has it isnt the pc isnt getting better yes the pc looks better the pc acts better the pc does better but he still must have some kind of present time problem here or that mass thats giving that 60 wouldnt be that visible you understand about that time we go back and review the living daylights out of the case what would we review wed look for wrong source on list that should be completed now the only one id worry about is the fellow that rode at 15 and we found two packages on the pc two packages thats four items and the pc still riding at 15 id sure review the living daylights out of that case and find out what earlier item because theres something here thats real weird and if i didnt find anything and the pc is feeling better and his skin tone was better and he looked younger id go on and find another package but i would treat the case with considerable huhu huhuhuhu you know and sooner or later this pcs going to go bzzzzt and go up through 7 and around down the line but if i didnt make it happen after while id start worrying you understand thats all the tone arm means that the tone arm doesnt pump madly up and down while youre listing thats nothing to worry about it remains motionless while youre listing thats nothing to worry about see we dont care what the tone arm does needle on the other hand when we are listing wrong way to the needle invariable is stiff and jerky and the longer we list the more jerky and active and rrrrrerr the needle gets and thats wrong way to or wrong source theres something really going on wrong here your needle behavior should soften up loosen up and eventually when the list is complete and for some little time after that you shouldnt just stop list the moment it gets clean by the way it should go about well i dont know as many as fifty items beyond that point list will go clean before the item will get on the list that will happen so just because the needle stopped going dirty and so forth is reason that the list is complete id let it sit there and flow for while not beating the pc up to point where the pc goes into super protest but id get as many items on the list as i could i would avoid short lists and after the list was complete avoid listing when is the list complete well when it can be nulled to one rsing item seen on the first nulling through that stays in and thats that and the pc is happy with it and knows its it thats how long the list is these lists that go to twentytwo pages twentyfive pages fortytwo pages are wrong source or wrong way to either one or the other they are just too long lists that run four pages should be quite adequate lists that runim talking now about your big double pages where you have yourlot of them my pages have aboutonly about twenty items on page i list five six of those pages thats plenty if it goes much beyond this theres something wrong the source is wrong or the list is wrong way to now dont go on listing forever on something and butchering up the pc your case repair should be done in time to avoid this sort of thing because youll waste more time on case running wrong on routine 2 than you will on scrapping the lot you can wastethe only time you really have long time of it is when youre doing something wrong and the funny part of it is the wronger you are the longer youll take the right way is fast the wrong way is long and slow 212 being done right just goes swish swish thud thud listlistlistlistlistlist listlistlistlist pow pow pow thing rock slams pow pow theres another rock slam listlistlistlistlist pow pow theres another rock slam listlistlistlistlistlist blang theres one isolated rock slam blang whole page without any rock slams on it pc says ive just run out you say all right lets take crack at it down the list pocketa pocketapocketapocketapocketa all those items that rock slammed when you wrote them down longer rock slam and you get to one toward the end of the list and it rock slams like crazy bangbangbangbangbangbangbang you say it again bangbang you didnt tiger drill it just bangbangbang bang and you take look at it and you say ill tell you what to do wrong at this time ill tell you what to do wrong you say well that item rsed to the pc and then call the next item you just about knock the pcs head off every time you finish nulling before you tell the pc anything after you know for sure tell him and then keep your attention on the pc dont do anything else to find out if its massier or less massy or what is going on but dont shift the pcs attention after youve told him the item dont theres the source of more arc breaks and upsets pc is going to arc break if its the wrong item so stand bystand by for boarders get your boarding nets out right there just prepare to say thats fine thank you very much he says well i dont know i guess its great big item and so forth i dont know what these lightning bolts are that are going yes it must be the item because of these light and so forth and you say well all right thats fine thats good thank you very much all right all right all right well just come to notice here this thing this list appears to to be just little bit strong do you mind if i prove the item out by listing bit further oh well yes as matter of fact every time you get oh yes yeah thats fine see its wrong item youre going to list further when it is the item pow pcs skull all over the ceiling do you know what i mean pc knows its his item all right now what are these various manifestations what do they amount to they amount to auditor observation of the pc and auditor observation of the meter if it is hard to do you are probably doing something wrong and if youre doing something wrong with routine 2 youre not going to put it right with auditing just make up your mind to that make it up now because there just isnt any auditing process run in present time that can overcome the strength and power of one of these items in routine 2 hes just not going to be able to make it you can smooth the pc out you can make it feel better you can groom up routine 2 with auditing and good auditingthere is substitute for good auditingbut something goes wrong with routine 2 it wont heal with auditing so you better have your routine 2 right so if your sessions are just going all wrong dont look at the auditing i dont care if you think the auditing was lousy dont look at the auditing look at the routine 2 so when do you repair case when it wont run right dont try todont try to make this case something new and strange and peculiar with auditing youre not going to do it why ill give you an example last night i patched up an incomplete list with auditing to make the pc feel betterdidnt know quitequite know what to do about this thing pc completely unwilling to go on listing on it and yet obviously its an incomplete list hehheh what do you know about that so i patched it all upi got allyou justvery rapid tiger drill it didnt take any time and so forth but i got the list question beautifully clean big beautiful flowing needle pc today arc broke didnt know about what just arc broke pc arc broke i said well obviously we didnt have the item on the list pc brightened up at once but last night was saying well its complete list and i cant think of any more you know pc brightened up right now do you get the difference there all right what is the commonest source of error in routine 2 wrong source is the commonest source and what is the commonest source of wrong source it is an incomplete list all right does that mean list you took from source it means the source list was incomplete always regard always regard any rock slamming item as having come from list there are prime movers unmoved you got that the big worry of the greek was how did god build the universe if nobody built god see well we havent got that thing in lists lists inevitably and invariable are built and even though theyve never been listed any item is viewed as having come from list you got it any item is viewed as having come from list and that gives us one of the most imponderable pieces of nonsense anybody ever heard of because you are inevitably and invariable starting case then from case that has somehow been started now do you see why you have trouble with the source but the three areas where the pc can be in trouble is in his life and livingness in his parts of existence or in his session well his session is part of scientology and his life and livingness is part of his life and his associations in present time and parts of existence are what he has considered existence to be composed of so they give you three different areas one is more backtrack than the others and thats the parts of existencethats more backtrack whats his life and livingness composed of in other words what is he associating with what does he connect with in present time what does he bang up against in his life and livingness present time this is different than when is he banging up against in session so youve got your present time of his life and livingness and youve got the present time of the session do you see and theres where you are at then of course youve got all the parts of existence and that goes back on the whole track now theres all of your zones that are immediately available theres present time life and livingness theres session connections and that goes out to organizations and books and auditors and all that sort of thing and then theres your third one of what is existence all composed of in his estimation for everybody now the one that is most intimate to the pc and will most prevent him is sort of tossup between one and two if he rock slams on auditors or an auditor but is every day being invalidated by his wife and rock slams on wife so in session he catches hell from the auditor and out of session he catches hell from the wife which hot brick are you going to be pickis going to be picked up first because oddly enough both hot bricks have to be theoretically picked up at once but thats impossible well lets at least let him get some help from the auditor now you see why the arbitrary stress on list one existed but see equally that somebody who rock slammed on three portions of list one was listing from wrong source somebody had three rock slams on list oneobviously hes listing from wrong source now to list one has also been adjoined parts of existence so if he had three rock slams on parts of existence and two rock slams on list one he now has two incomplete lists so your sources are being taken from two incomplete lists and those sources are not complete the odd part of it is is they might be mixed that is to say it might be two lists under the heading of what youre calling list one but in the pcs estimation they should be two they should be the technical aspects of scientology and the administrative or organizational aspects of scientology see he might have them subdivided in some fashion well how are you going to tell well this is the old greek problem of the prime mover unmoved all source itemyoure taking one source as an itemthat has to be regarded as having come from list that has to be regarded as having come from list see its list that never got written but its still regarded as having come from list so youre always starting from list that has never been written there is always list on the pc that has never been composed by the pc the auditors responsibility in this merely goes this far he makes sure that the list source question does not rock slam because if it rock slams that means its obviously part of list and he cant use it im talking now about doing pure routine 12routine 2 that is absolutely grooved in that youll never make mistake with see have trouble with lets saylets say offhand that youre going to pick up what does present time consist of youve got to test present time thats source isnt it present time actually belongs on the parts of existence list but if it doesnt rock slam youre all right you can represent present time therefore all lists start with represent your first list is always represent list but how do you find out what to represent well sometimes youre going to lay an egg on this youre going to say what does present time consist of and youre not going to get rock slamming list whereas as you say in present time do you have any problems and you do get rock slamming list now let give you real imponderable imponderable this is real interesting imponderable we saywere going to assess now those little zero ones and we find one of them slamming what does this mean the slamming one is part of an incomplete list and we dont have any way of knowing whether or not it is the final item on the list or not so we avoid it like plague or we run list how many list headings could there be then after while we check list and find out its slamming were wrong thats wrong got more slams than you started with you did something wrong you missed you always wind up with slams but they shouldnt be as frequent they should be getting less frequent do you see the problem so reasonable about slams you say ahathe way we were thinking before see im trying to make life comfortable and livable for you which i think youll have put your vote in forthose of you who arent rock slamming on yourselves will vote for this we find reasonable about slams like crazy so what do we do with it ho ho we get out of there man weve two things we could do theoretical one we could complete the list of what is listwhat is list heading but the best thing to do is to take something that is not in its immediate vicinity or instantly and immediately associated with what would you be reasonable about you wouldnt ask that question at all you dont dare pose it because you see you dont know that its the item on the last list all right lets supposing that you found out that this character slams like mad on scientology well obviously if he slams on scientology there is something wrong with the session there is something going to be wrong with this session obviously so therefore its very much in your interest to put together the session list but can you say at this stage of the game what does scientologywho or what does scientology consist of oh because youre doing represent on rock slamming item you see theres your enigma so what kind of question are you going to use to get scientology list from well you could ask this you could say what question if i ask it to you would cause you to answer it scientology that at least gives you an anatomy of how you would go about it you see youve got to work the problem out backwards youve got to have some other thing you just cant say what does scientology consist of now once in while youve got to check your source so you ask your source once in while and watch your meter and thats the best way to do it dont get so tr0ed that you ignore the meter see theres sense in saying who or what does present time consist of see with good tr0 you know good at all see who or what does present time consist of with your meter centered up there to see whether or not you get slam this thing starts to slam youre in trouble present time slams well ill tell you mistake you could make saying aha present time slams lets oppose it cut your throat man thats prime mover unmoved that youre looking for and it doesnt exist present time must be coming from list now you could chase this thing backwards of course and say what question would i have to ask you for you to answer present time to and get list on which present time would occur you may find yourself doing that some time or another because the pc keeps laying dead horses see but this is yourthis is the enigma present time began to slam youd better get out of there man youd just better just quit that right now because youre getting more rock slams than you had before didnt slam now it does slam equals wrong source bank must be beefing up see you can work your way through that one rather easily didnt slam now it does slam somethings wrong it isnt that the pc unsuppressed so what youve got to do is find negative question that will produce rock slamsa negative rock slam question that produces rock slamsthats the whole trick and that sometime or another is going to be found to be quite trick to you now you go back on the dynamics of existence of the pc and you find an arbitrarythis is case repair nowyou go back and you find an arbitrary assessment of the dynamics and somebody took whiffinpoof as parts of existence you see under living things there were whiffinpoofs aw more than that lets say the pc rock slammed on groups and the pc rock slammed on mankind youve had it two rses on that third type of list and youd better say what are the parts of existence and youd better complete that list and again its what question would i have to ask you for you to write all the dynamics down on and maybe the pc also slams on the second category which is session material and dynamic slams so you have to get the session straightened out before you can straighten out the parts of existence you might find yourself in some silly circumstances here of some kind or another but youd be able to work them out if you just realize that you had to have virgin negative slam item to proceed from which if it began to slam tells you that you are wrong in view of the fact youve got three zones from which these things could come there it is theres the present time life and livingness of the individual the session present time and sessions in general and scientology and all its ramifications and then theres parts of existence as whole which tends to give us bank and whole track youve got three sources to work on youve got positive and negative for these three sources and you should be able to turn yourself out quite bunch of packages if you found some raw meat out on the street that was in trouble all you would have to say to that person is present time present time and theyd say what well what about present time and you didnt get rock slam on it you see and youd say well i just wanted to know what present time consists of rock slam its okay and you write big cracking long list about what does present time consist of and you carry it out but when you null it you only get one rs and you get one and continue it until you only get one rs on nulling and just like i gave you before and you find out that package is terminal or oppterm list it both ways to find out if you get loose needle and what have you got you wind up with perfect package itll go whizz mass what happened where did it go whered they go actually the fellow will improve and get an awful lot of ideas and so forth even if you miss which is kind of wonderful but why miss why not get the full gain the first time im just talking what you do to raw meat person all right supposing present time consists of and consists of was brrrrrr youd say what did you just think of oh nothing what youre saying you say consists of brrrrrrrr youd better find some other question to ask present timewhat do you connect with present timewhat do you connect with rs there we go do you understand or you could go back and say what would be the list heading of list on which the word consists of would appear you might be able to actually to figure out some way to work it out youve got slamming item so you know youd have slamming list either way to youd wind up with complete list and thats what you want now thats raw meat now supposing somebody isabsolutely will not under any circumstances get an rs on parts of existence well youve still got the negative side to try what isnt part of existence supposing he just having an awful time oh heits nothing but dead horses and he doesnt get anyplace in session and hes crying all the time about it and hes chopchopping the auditor 100 percent and you havent even started anything so how could you have missed anything on him you know and its all this and that and hes had terrible bad history and he had some 8c run on him back in 1949 before it was invented and id assume about this time that he was rock slammer on list one see and that he isnt going to get anyplace until we do list one type of list now the job is how do we work out list one type of list heading that itself doesnt rock slam and thats going to change from pc to pc so i just hand it to you as problem now lets say he doesnt rock slam on that list oh well lets shift it slightly and ask the negative see what isnt part of the activity us guys are engaged in slam slam slam slam slams all the way down you find scientology isnt part of scientology now youve got your item whatever it was but its still the last item on that listthe last rsing item on the list these are your methods of introduction into cases now remember that case has got to be able to answer an auditing question for routine 2 to run on the interest is usually so great that even an untrained pc usually falls right into it and answers up very very well however sooner or later youre going to run into somebody who wont answer any questions at all and sooner or later i dont say under what conditions theyd be under or why because ive seen it run on now little kids and everything else and people who wanted nothing to do with processing and all that sort of thing ive seen all the stylized cases the types of cases that couldnt have been run on earlier processing running on this but i just say in fun lets say wesupposing we have this person and they cant give you list and they cant list anything and they cant do this and they cant do that i think theyd be boobyhatch types you know strictly boobyhatch or perhaps members of the government or something like that see you know utterly unreal dogs and youve still got all of youryouve still got all of your background music on your cch type processes and all that sort of thing youd be surprised what that stuff can do so youve still got case entrancesee were still talking about case entrancesyouve still got case entrance all right now how about case thats been run for long time with wrong sources wrong way to and every time anybody said this was the item fourfootthick block of concrete showed up and knocked out their front teeth is there any hope for this person its pretty sad actually the funny part of it is that even random slam taken amongst five slams and opposed just as list would have cured somebody from being so edgy in sessions as long as that list was complete see but it would have given them bit more mass and it would have made them unhappy but it might have made them auditable you understand were very far from invalidating what we have been doing how about this guy who already has six packages all right so hes got six packages fine probably doing better than he was everythings fine so hes got six packages nobodysim trying to show you now how you can undercut it and every place it went wrong it will wipe out with bzzz and thats simply find the first incomplete list you understand even though its suppositional list that appeared on the case now that could be 3d criss cross see what didnt he agree with or something see could have been could have been but its much more likely to be these arbitrary liststhe dynamics or list oneand you treat those as incomplete lists look them over so one of them had two slams on it must have been an incomplete list in other words just start from there get some kind of list question that itself doesnt rock slam test it and complete that thing now what do you have to do do you have to go back and null it all well usually if things that were marked in that rsed on it before so you only have to take thoseso you just add to it and null what youve added and then try to tiger drill alive afterwards what was there originally so you dont null all the way through everything and so forth but look its simpler test than that if while adding to it you get rock slam you have two choices that was either the item that just went by or youre getting more rock slams than you had before well one of the ways to test it very thoroughly is to keep on listing and lets list page on which we get two rock slams then we list the next page on which we get three didididididi something wrong its either wrong source or wrong way to got that well you again take grip on the situation and turn it around the other way and list it the other way and your needle goes loose so that meant it was just wrong way to and your source is probably all right but lets turn it around the other way and have the needle misbehave just as thoroughly brother thats really wrong source when it wont list right either way and your needle is just raising hell with you and it isnt cleaning up and so forth thats wrong source so in extremis youve even got test for wrong sourceis either way to it wont list you only have to list page or so to find that out you dont have to list forever to find this out all right now as we examine theas we examine the case then for case repair we want to get rid of all of the dust and nonsense all of the bric abrac all of the items that are solid and all of the bad auditing and all of the mid ruds and all of the thiss and all of the thats that has occurred on the case so far all weve got to do is to go back and find the earliest list and complete it that can be completed thats all we have to do and find the right item for that listfind the last single one rsing item oppose it and take off and go ahead and do package and youll find lot of bricabrac will drop off the case if that thing was really completed as package see both lists were nicely completed you find this bricabrac that the pc had been complaining about on some of that later stuff that came from that wrong source well lets say it was list one and theyd gotten lot solider stuff on opposing scientology and you went ahead and completed list one in the pcs own words and found something else and that was rock slamming and then you opposed that scientology and any list proceeding from scientology drops out they become null simple in other words it eradicates itself so if any of the pcs packages are wrong why bother to check up whether the packages are right or wrong just find your earliest listyour earliest incomplete list that can be completed and complete it and proceed right from there now youll find that lists have genus they generate from something and you only examine the generators of lists this is the easiest way to repair case you dont go over endless lists that have been listed on the pc you only look where the list came fromwhere did the item come from and youre usually examining and completing understood lists lists that have never been listed see like list one he never listed list one parts of existence he never listed the parts of existence he took canned package of dynamics dont you see so youve got to complete that dynamic list youve got to complete list one or youve got 3d criss cross list of some kind or another and he was busy listing what didnt he like gosh there are lot of rock slamming items and after that the pc got on it judges and the pc still talks about this one well if the pc still seems interested in this one is indicator whatsoever that it was right thats index because if its still slamming after all this time even though it was opposed at that time it must have been an item which was on an incomplete list so all youve got to do is complete the list from which judges came get it properly opposed and the package goes bzzz and youll never hear him open his yeep about judges again so where the pcs interest hangs up is sure index of an incomplete source list this is tricky thing you say to pcive told you all this trick now so it probably wont work on you very wellbut you say to pc now weve really found quite few items on you now from time to time which one are you still most interested in so we can do something about it well im still interested in goats we found goats on that list and i find them very fascinating and his eyes get somewhat lambent and the slits lengthen you know well you dont want to do anything about goats dont oppose goats god help you dont oppose goats ive already put this into great practice see lets find out what list goats appeared on it was an understood list or an actual list or otherwise but lets find out what that list was and if we possibly can complete that list to its proper item and oppose that proper item towith complete list that packages in the total knowingness of the pc and go bzzzz and then you say to the pc ah all right whathow do you feel about this goats what about it well how do you feel about goats well goats goats goats how do you feel about goats i suppose ive been one at one time or another hasnt everybody interest now lets say the item which we did find on the thing was milk pails you say how do you feel about milk pails hell say hahahaha yes yes sure gave hell during the war you just milked little bit of cognition on the milk pails see every time you mention the real item to him why hell give you cognition he wont discuss it with you he wont have an opinion about it but it still is not effective on him in other words thats an erasure its an erasure of interest he can always cognite on it he often had timea hard time remembering the right items but they always remember the wrong ones because brother theyre stuck there in pillars of stone now these are all indicators and indexes and so forth but you can use these various indicators ive just given you for all kinds of case repair now i want you to forgive for giving you process which could be done wrong or that could have limited application or could have this or have that but i wont forgive you if you think ive invalidated all of everything weve done because i actually have intentions of doing so and i dont want to and im certainly not invalidating what packages have been found on you packages that have been found on you did some good now if they stay erased when you complete list some place fine they wont beef up so thats dandy but theres one thing that you have taught is that we needed faster harder set of indicators better set of indexes to telegraph to the auditor this and that and we needed to reach just little deeper technically in order to get pure surefire gain out of these things all right ive been working for couple of weeks now watching you sweat around ive been working for couple of weeks improvement i recognized couple of weeks ago that you werent about to get some of these lists straightened out and i started to say all right then on all cases we have to cut to the ultimate and we have to get back to an ultimate foundation and begin from there and so forth or auditors are going to have hard time with it all right thats fine but this is gain now what you realize that you should be realizing here is youre actually simply opening up the present time problems knocking them out and knocking out the hidden standards because these things have been stopping clearing in some enormousmajority percentage of cases these are the important things that bar clearing these are the barriers and thats why ive been working on routine 2 stuff you actually probably could keep on getting packages if you could keep on getting sources you could probably go right on back down the track and youd finally hit the rock and opprock and thered be the guys goal all right fine theres easier ways to do it you can clear away the chaff from pt and untangle the gpm you can get back there and find the rock slamming goal and run it and life becomes much easier but of course remember that pieces of the gpm can still key in after you have found the goal and you can still bypass items you can still miss things you can still do this and still do that but if pt is cleaned up and if things are knocked out of present time consistently that are going to barrier the pc onto free needle and so on even with more routine 2 hes going to clear easily so long as youve got routine 2 you can always find an entrance point thats the purpose of routine 2 you havent got devils chance of finding the goals on lot of cases without clearing away those two things the chronic ptps and the hidden standards you havent got prayer and if you did find the goal you havent got prayer of running it because the ptp will clonkbang in on him and wipe it out now therefore weve got to keep wideopen track on the pc and therefore the use of routine 2 does not necessarily cease on having found the pcs goal you might run everything his goal influences in present time and package it up and the things his goal doesnt influence in present time and package that up and hes going fine and he seems to be getting free needle then all of sudden he hits some terminal like somebody did in perth the other day motion with exclamation points or something hangs up like mad cant quite see which way hes going whole thing caves in goal read disappears and now he doesnt know what is happening and so forth ah well you dont know that the pc simply hadnt caved in on brandnew present time problem and instead of spending hours and hours and hours of prepchecking youve got another weapon called routine 2 you just use routine 2 not with any difference at all you dont change routine 2 just because youre running it on somebody who is back down the line see on goal you just assume that somethings caved in on this pc in pt or something so you just what does present time consist of thats all see and youre off to the same races or what doesnt it consist of or what does auditing consist of or shes temple priestess and all of sudden by george by george theres only one way to get clear see and thats by jumping into the maw of the flames everything hangs up there are flames or something see the pcthe pc has perhaps missed an item in goals clearing now everything that applies to straightening up lists also applies to your routine 321 everything ive told you about it everything ive told you about having list complete applies to 321 you do list from goal youve got to get down to one rock slamming item now one of the hardest things you will use to get rock slamming item from is goals list let put this two cents worth in goals lists almost never run out of rock slams when they do fine but they behave just like any other list of items they dont behave any other way lets say you had lot of slams early on goals list and then had one slam late on the goals list thats still slamming see all right in that case you could take that last goal and oppose it because its just an item from list if you want to call it that the funny part of it is because the pc skips all over the place with goals list and can run all over the bank with goals list you get some very wonderful complications with these goals lists and probably the hardest list to straighten out for purpose of doing routine 2 with but not goals of course is goals list its the spottiest and the least satisfactory of them but you will still some day be prepared to find the earliest list done on the pc goals list which hasnow has only one rock slamming goal on the end of it and use that to oppose and the whole case blossoms now remember that rocket read is senior to rock slam and for your purposes you do everything with rocket read that youd do with rock slam except the rocket read is accepted above it lets say you have four rock slamming items on list when you start to null boy youre not about to have complete list so you complete the list and get it down to one rock slamming item and there it is beautiful single you go back and find out those four longer have rock slams on them youve now got your item this is fine it follows through all tests it doesnt generate lot more massit generates some pain sen or something like that but not lots more massand you go ahead and you oppose that properly and you get your list out and you find that item and it all blows up fine thats just routine 2 but what if you found four rocket reading items on the list you better complete the list to one rocket reading item this has already happened by the way and they had four rocket reading items on one list and i told the auditor to complete ita saint hiller just left here short time agoand i told the saint hiller to complete it he went ahead and completed it and he found one rocket reading item and the other rocket reads disappeared now thats perfectly valid for opposition its also valid for goals finding you can do lot with rocket reading item so you mark those down rather special in caps but remember that the fourthat more than one rocket read on listnow we get something complicated whereby you have three rock slams and two rocket reads on the same listwell whats perfectly answerable is the rocket read is senior but all those rock slams and earlier rocket reads have got to disappear before you accept that last rocket read you got it anyway theres your case repair factors now ive tried to give it to you in such way that you dont have to memorize 8645 bulletins but ill still write all those bulletins for you to memorize anyhow just so you cant miss it thenow to show you how you can make mistakes you can take perfectly elementary case sail down with enormous cockiness be just absolutely grooved in and you know youre just sailing youve got the first item and the pc is singing and everything is fine and then you get your opposition list and you get down the line on the opposition list pocketapocketa pocketapocketapocketa and there was one rock slam and there was two rock slams and there was three rock slams and that was the first page and on the second page there was one rock slam and there was two rock slams and there was three rock slams and there was four rock slams so on the third page theres one rock slam and two rock slams and three rock slams and four rock slams and five rock slams and on the fourth page you have rock slams the funny part of it is your needle because youve picked the case up to the stars by finding the right item doesnt cave in and neither does the pc the pc just becomes little doubtful or something like that and you say well its merely anxiety youre listing the list wrong way to the needle is so beautiful that you dont notice it you say well its better than ive ever seen needle on pc before well list it the other way to and the needle would still be looser youve got to watch it but this test of the frequency of rock slam i think you will find quite valid because it says the pcs bank is beefing up by reason of the listing of course we expect sometimes the list to go page page and half before the first rock slam occurs then we expect whole spate of rock slams thats quite normal but down on the last page we dont expect the rock slams to be more frequent than they were on the second or third page of the list that tells us weve got wrong way to now if our first line was so beautiful and came out so lovely we certainly arent dealing with wrong source were just dealing with wrong way to list you see everything checked out and there we were but if we still listed it the other way to and couldnt make sense out of it then we would decide that that list just before that we just did that we grabbed the item prematurely and the way to test that is to add to the list and see if some new rock slams came about we might find that that was the one that was wrong way to you see how we could straighten it out wed have to be pretty knuckleheaded to be wrong but be prepared to be wrong be prepared to be wrong dont be so persistently cockily right when you are so horribly devastatingly wrong and always straighten out routine 2 before you straighten out auditing spend ages straightening out routine 2 and briefly straightening out auditing if your auditing is perfect and you never have to straighten out auditing with auditing your routine 2 is perfect the auditing is very very rapid but the paramount importance is get the routine 2 done first all the cases that are here at this particular moment are easily straightenable just by the rule of finding the first understood listthe list that was never listed from which you took an item i mean just if we went back to that we didnt even have to go back to 3d criss cross or anything see i mean just if we did that we would be in clover we take list one whats the question that would complete list one we simply complete list one get all the rock slams off list one down to one rock slam oppose that then everything that has gone wrong earlier on the list fades out got that i think that takes care of most of the cases present you talk about case repair thats about all the case repair there is sometimes an item has been found as the single rock slamming item on list and its never been opposed youll find that kind of thing going on i know one case right now where that is true all kinds of assessments have been done since heres this bypassed item sitting back there see all right well i hope you have good luck in straightening these out i think youre getting to be much better auditors and i want to give you one small compliment you turned in whole bunch of papers on what you do with case repair and in the understandingin the complete understanding that you had at that timethe incomplete understanding which had been issued to you at that timethe case repairs which you advised were right on the button i had to then make up my mind and realize that you could learn even complicated procedure as you were handling and that you could repair case under the headings of that complicated procedure then i was very happy to know that and i got very proud of you and i even said it in bulletin short time ago so thank you very much
