gender disability and veteran status they further require some covered employers to take positive steps ie affirmative actions such as outreach recruitment or training to ensure individuals have equal opportunities for employment the antidiscrimination provision of eo 11246 applies to federal contractors and subcontractors as well as fede rally assisted construction c ontractors and subcontractors who conduct business with the government worth more than 10000 in one year in lighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20897crs2 1 the tiered process consists of one or more of the following compliance review heretofore the onesizefitsall approach an offsite review of records which is similar to the deskaudit phase of the compliance review compliance check which is an onsite visit to review the contractors books and records to determine the accuracy and completeness of previously submitted information proper maintenance of reco rds under the executive order andor that the contractor has develope d an aap consistent with ofccp re quirements and focused reviewof the temporary nature of the construction industrys work force the ofccp establishes the affirmative actions that approximate ly 100000 construction establishments must make in an effort to achieve agencyset placement goals for the protected classes nonconstruction service and supply employ ers with at least one federal contract of 50000 or more and at least 50 employees are required to devel op written affirmative action programs aaps the employer must analyze the use of minorities and women in its workforce by job class compared to the general availability of qualified or trainable minorities and women if the employer determines through this selfaudit that underutilization exists it must develop placemen t goals and make good faith efforts to achieve them the ofccp is not authorized to penalize contractors for failing to meet their goals regulations revised during the clinton administration eo 11246s regulations had not changed substantively for decades until august 1997 when the first of two final rules was issued based on comprehensive review by the clinton administration both th 1997 and 2000 revise d regulations cover nonconstruction contractors the first rule dealt with compliance monitoring by among other things instituting use of tiered compliance evaluation process1 and raising the contract threshold for mandatory preaward compliance evaluations from at least 1 million to at least 10 million it also addressed enforcement eg sp ecifying fixed term of at least six months or an indefinite period as the length of debarment and recordkeeping eg employers must retain records for two years if the firm has 150 or more employees or contract of at least 150000 otherwise one year the equal opportunity eo survey in november 2000 second final rule was published that focused mainly on aaps and codified the new eo survey with regard to aaps the rule cut the factors considered in the availability test for minorities and women from eight to two allowed contractors to conti nue using variety of methods to identify underutilization liminated some aap elements and required contractors to appoint company official w ith the authority to effec tively implement the program the eo survey was to query contract ors annually about their aap activities personnel actions eg hires and promotions and compen sation of fulltime employees aggregated by job group and minority or gender status its stated purposes were to enable the ofccp to better direct agency resources toward contractors most likely to be out of compliance to make efficient use of the tiere d compliance process and to encourage self awareness and selfevaluati on among contractors as means of increasing compliance the final rule 41 cfr part 60 subpart b s ection 218 also specified that each yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20897crs3 2 the april 2000 survey had to be completed and returned within 30 days the survey sent on december 30 2000 initially had 45day completion period from date of survey receipt but in response to contractors requests for extensions the bush administration lengthened the deadline to may 31 2001ofccp will designate substantial portion of all nonconstruction establishments to complete the eo survey which coul d only be changed under the following circumstances 1 the secretary must clearly demonstrate through statistical analyses of eo survey submissions that the data element in question is longer of value and 2 the secretary must follow notice and comment procedures reaction and background although womens and civil rights groups largely supported the revised regulati ons other parties did not the mandatory survey was particularly controvers ial comments were made about the agencys projection of the surveys hours burden on employers and the poten tial for disclosure to competitors or the public under the freedom of information ac t of contractorprovided information especially compensation data in december 1999 almost year before the second final rule was published the office of management and budget omb approved the ofccps proposal to require contractors to provide summary compensation information at an earlier phase of routine compliance evaluations ie at the opening deskaudit stage the agency in december 1998 had proposed that contractor s who were selected for revi ews supply salary data for individual employees which generated much opposition from the business community primarily due to confidentiality concerns the ofccp said early submission of compensation data would enable contract compliance officers to conduct more thorough initial checks and thereby more efficiently focus on specific problems in midfebruary 1999 after reviewing comments on the revise d compliance evaluation scheduling letter the agency asked omb to grant 90day extens ion of the status quo in order to address paperwork reduction act issues eg burden and confidentiality the ofccp and omb began circulating draft of the eo survey in september 1999 which reportedly was then being developed as an alternative to the agencys attempt to require detailed compensation data from contractors early in the compliance process these ofccp compensation initiatives were part of the clinton administrations heightened efforts to narrow the gender wage gap other elements of the equal pay initiative did not come to fruition eg 10 million in the fy2001 budget request for the equal employment opportunity commission eeo c to provide outreach training and technical assistance to employers carry out public service campaign about pay issues and conduct training on the equa l pay act for some 1000 eeoc employees the eo survey during the bush administration womens advocacy groups and some member s of congress expressed concern that the bush administration had not sent out the third round of the eo survey by spring 2001 because the completion date fo r the two prior rounds was may 312 just as thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20897crs4 3 httpwwwdolgovesaregscomplia nceofccpeosurveysfaqspolhtm 4 ofccp schedules 2000 compliance reviews

10000 contractors each year who we re randomly selected this compares favorably with the 7000 contractors to whom the survey initially was sent in april 2000 however the agency said at that time that it expected to eventually query about onehalf of the nonconstruction contract or population when the survey was sent in december 2000 it went to 49000 contractors proposed rule to eliminate the eo survey the agency hired abt associates in late 2002 to study and improve the equa l opportunity survey and the contractor selection methodology for compliance reviews3 ofccp director charles james stated that results of the study would provide st atistical basis on which to determine whether the eo survey can be utilized to better direct agency resources toward contractors that engage in discrimination4 as previously noted the regulation requires the use of statistical analyses of eo survey submissions to invalidate data element of the survey the regulation further requires notice nd comment procedures to be followed if changes to the survey are desired on january 20 2006 the ofccp issued pr oposed rule to eliminate the eo survey based upon the abt studys results that most of the 125 predictor variables of discrimination derived from the survey bore relation to findings of systemic discrimination in subsequent compliance reviews5 abt estimated that the predictive power of model containing four of th 22 variables associated with systemic discrimination determinations was somewhat better than chance6 it found however that many of the contractors that the fourvariabl model identified as likely to be engaged in discrimination were false positives ie compliance evaluations did not uncover systemic discrimination two of the four variables are available from the eeo1 forms that contractors must provide the ofccp model utilizing the two variables has slightly less but nonetheless acceptable predictive ability compared to model utilizing ll four variables7 the ofccp noted that it already utilizes the two variables to target its compliance activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20897crs5 8 71 federal register 3374 9 ibid 10 abt associates an evaluation of ofccps equal

creating and implementing the federal contractor selection system fcss which is based upon the identification of relationships between eeo1 workforce prof iles and findings of discrimination in 10 years of data from compliance evaluations8 the agency not only regarded the eo survey as duplicative but also less informative than data gathered from contractors at the initial stage of the tiered compliance evaluation process9 the agency and abt discussed an alternative approach to creating targeting model that would develop data elements similar to those collected through the eo survey from information contractors usually provide to ofccp personnel at the desk audit stage the consultant noted that t his approach has the advantage of collecting moreaccurate and morepertinent data than provided by the current eo survey related advantage is that ofccp would void the expense of the survey process10 these advantages presumably would apply as well to the agencys fcss discussed above the ofccp estimated that distribution collection nd processing of the eo survey cost the agency 356000 per year it s imilarly considered the survey to be burdensome to contractors eg 58 million per year11 ofccp also did not believe the eo survey increased contractors awareness of their equal opportunity performance nor encourag ed them to conduct selfevaluations to improve their compliance levels12 the agency has adopted other means of promoting contractor awareness eg compliance assi stance seminars and workshops materials on the ofccp webpage and telephoneemail help desk effective september 8 2006 the agency rescinded the eo survey13 it received total of 2736 comments 62 1707 of co mmenters supported eliminating the survey with about 1600 of these commenters havi ng submitted form letters 38 1029 of commenters opposed the surveys eliminati on with about 1000 of these commenters having submitted form letters14 the ofccp concluded that in light of the findings from the abt study and an earlier contractors analysis and careful review and consideration of the public comments and the development of other ofccp initiatives to accomplish the eo surveys objectivesthe eo survey has utility to ofccp or to contractors in fact valuable enforcement resources are misdirected through the use of the eo rvey and the burden to ofccp to collecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20897crs6 15 71 federal
