on the list of terrorist groups that are formally designated by the secretary of state pursuant to section 219 of the immigration and nationality act as amended under the antiterrorism and effec tive death penalty act of 1996 pl 104 132 these groups are often collectivel referred to as the fto list fto list designations which last for two years and must be renewed occur after an interagency process involving the departments of state justice homeland security and the treasury since the design ations can be challenged in court they require detailed administra tive record often based on classified information an organization that is placed on the fto lis t is subject to fi nancial and immigration sanctions potentially including the blocking of assets the prosecution of supporters who provide funds refusal of visas and deportations of members there have been number of designations and changes ce the list was established but it currently includes thirtysix organizations see appendix the fto list is often confused with some of the other terrorist lists that are maintained by the us government thes include the statesponsors of terrorism list which is pursuant to section 6j of the 1979 export administration act pl 9672 50 usc app 24056j the specia lly designated terrorists sdts list which is pursuant to the international emergency economic powers act pl 95 223 50 usc 1701 et

specially designated nationals and bloc ked persons sdn list master list that contains the other lists all of these are summarized and maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the treasur department lastly the terrorist exclusion list or tel which relates to immigration and is pursuant to section 411 of the usa patriot act of 2001 8 usc1182 is maintained by the st ate department like the fto list the tel includes the names of rrorist organizations but it has broader standard for inclusion is subject to less stringent administrative requirements and is not challengeable in court there is complicated interplay among all of these lists and it is important to distinguis h them from the betterknown fto list the fto list has been of considerable interest to congress and there are arguments in favor and against it it pub licly stigmatizes groups and provides clear focal point for interagency cooperation on terrorist sanctions however some argue that it is inflexible and misleading since groups that are not on the list are still often subject to us sanctions the report conc ludes with discussi on of potential policy options for congress including some of the recently proposed amendments to the legislation that establishes it it will be updated as events warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32120contents introduction 1 background 1 n t t h n l u s t r r r i s t l i s t

an overview of the nature and status of the designated foreign terro rist organizations list fto list as potential tool in overseeing the implementation and effects of us legislation designed as basis for imposing sanctions on terrorists the report centers on the list of terrorist groups that are formally design ated by the secretar of state pursuant to section 219 of the immigration and nationality act 8 usc 1101 et seq as amended under the antiterrorism and effec tive death penalty act of 1996 pl 104 132 these groups are often collectively re ferred to as the terrorist group list or fto list the focus here is on the operation and effectiveness of the fto list as us counterterrorism tool the first part of the report provides background on the process for designating group as well as the procedure used to remove group it describes the administration of the list and the role of the various executive agencies involved in maintaining it1 next follows section explaining the distinctions between the fto list and other terrorist lists that are maintained by the us government with an emphasis on both traci ng the complicated interplay among the numerous lists and untangling their confusin g acronyms the arguments in favor and against the fto list are then discussed w ith information about the practicalities of implementing it the report concludes with discussion of potential policy options for congress including some of the recently proposed amendments to the legislation that establishes it the potential issue for congress is to assess as part of its oversight responsibility the effectiveness of the ft list in confronting terrorist groups that are threat to the united states this report will be updated as events warrant background the 1996 antiterrorism and

the unclassified scriptions of designated foreign terrorist organizations are included in the state departments patterns of global terrorism 1101 et seq states that the secretary of state is authorized to designate an organization as foreign terrorist or ganization if three conditions are met 1 the organization is foreign 2 the organization engages in terrorist activity 3 the terrorist activity threatens the security of united states citizens or the national security of the united states2 if the secretary of state decides that an organization meets these conditions he or she may add it to the terrorist group list at any time by informing congress and publishing notice to that effect in the federal register designations last for two years at which time they ma be renewed groups can so be removed from the list at any time either by the secretary of state or by act of congress the criteria for removal by the secretary are general and are subject to interpretation the secretary of state may revoke designati on if he or she finds either that the circumstances that were the basis for the designation have chan ged or that the national security of the united states warrants revo cation of the designation3 designations normally occur after an involved interagenc process but the secretar of state makes the ultimate decision although the state department officially designates group and takes the lead there are number of agencies involved in administering the fto list before the determination the intelligence community is an important player because the designation is based upon evidence of group s terrorist activity this often involves classified information and entails assembling an administrative record that will potentially stand up in court the intelligence community also provides the information upon which decisions to renew an organizations designation are based4 the justice department weighs the legal evidence before the designation is approved and when renewal is being c onsidered the department of homeland security is also consulted before desi gnations are made after the designation the treasury depar tment may block fina ncial transactions involving an organizations assets and termine whether us banks are complying with the law the justice department determines whether or not to prosecute offenders who violate any as pect of the treasury depar tments sanctions judges from the department of justices executive office of immigration review decide immigration cases with appeals potentially going all the way to the attorney general variety of differe nt agencies in the department of homeland security are then involved in carrying out immigrati on sanctions including deportations thus from the perspective of the memb ers of group the legal consequences of being designated foreign terrorist orga nization are in two general areas financinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32120crs3 518 usc 2339b 6and there are many lists internationally for example the united nations maintains its own list of individuals and entities that ar sanctioned under resolutions 1267 1999 1333 2000 1390 2002 and 1455 2003 see the list at

economic sanctions regimes and includes those entities designated as ftos by th secretary of state additionally the entire list is published as appendix to chapter 5 of the cfr see 31 cfr ch v app

assistance act of 1961 pl 87195 22 usc 2371 9the fact that afghanistan was not on the list of state sponsors of terrorism before 911 is often cited as evidence of the negligence of pre911 counterterrorist policies of the us government the explanation was that the taliban national government was not recognized by the united states and so that stat could not be named state sponsorand immigration under the aedpa people who provide funds or other material support to designated fto are break ing the law and may be prosecuted5 this applies to both the members of group and to those who may be sympathizers if treasury imposes sanctions u s financial institutions ar required to block the funds of designated ftos and their agents and to report that blockage to the treasury department this can have important consequences for designated terrorist organizations ability to access its res ources as for immigration members of designated ftos can be denied visas or excluded from entering the united states andor they can be deported once they are in the country not the only us terrorist list the fto list is not the only socalled terrorist list that the us government keeps6 there are number of others and it is important to clarify the distinctions among them7 probably the best known is the state sponsors of terrorism list which is pursuant to section 6j of the export administration act of 1979 pl 9672 50 usc app 2405jas amended8 under the terms of the act the secretary of state provides congress with the list of countries that have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism there are currently seven states on the state sponsors of terrorism list cuba iran ira q libya north korea sudan and syria9 being on the list subjects country to range

form the current state of yemen and iraq which wa s removed from the list in1982 when it was allied with the united states and was returned to the list in 1990 after its invasion of kuwait10 this list differs from the fto list as it is directed specifically toward states not substate actors like the terrorist groups that the states allegedly support it also derives from diffe rent legislation11 at least three other important us terrorist lists are in use the specially designated terrorists sdts list was generated pursuant to the international emergency economic powers act pl 95223 50 usc 1701 et seq it was initiated under presidential executive order 12947 on 25 january 1995 and was specifically oriented toward persons individuals and entities who threaten to disrupt the middle east peace process later following the events of september 11 2001 the president invoked the same emergenc authorities in presidential executive order 13224 to block all propert and interests in propert of certain designated terrorists and individuals and tities materially supporting them12 this established another much longer list known as th specially designated global terrorists sdgts list there are currently over three hundred persons identified as sdgts these two lists are especially targeted toward blocking terrorist financing and they do not have an immigration element the treasury department maintains th socalled sdt and sdgt lists and unlike the fto list the secretary of the treasury takes the lead in adding individuals or organizations to the lists and then freezin g the assets of persons or entities that are on them the lists have grown to include more than 200 entities organizations andor individuals they derive from di fferent legislation and again are not the same as the designated fto list13 the sdt sdgt state sponsors and as of october 2002 fto lists were placed together in new larger roster called the specially designated nationals and blocked persons sdn list maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the treasury department14 although the individual lists retain separateness pursuant to their legislation this comprehensive sdn list presents in one place all of the terrorist entities that are economica lly sanctioned through having their assetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32120crs5 15again see the office of foreign ssets control web site

includes individuals and organizations that are sanctioned by having their assets blocked for narcotics trafficking and other activities there are thus fourteen different sanctions programs included in the sdn list not all of which pertain to terrorists the list is accessibl via the internet and is frequently updated to reflect the fluid nature of us economic sanctions15 there is also the socalled terrorist exclusion list or tel which is pursuant to section 411 of the usa patriot act of 2001 pl 10756 8 usc 1182 it authorizes the secret ary of state in consultation with or at the request of the attorney general to designate terrorist organizations strictly for immigration purposes individuals associated with or ganizations on the tel list are prevented from entering the united states andor ma be deported if they are already here16 it is worth noting that none of these immig ration sanctions has an effect on the behavior of us citizens the tel lis t expands the grounds for exclusion from the united states and has broa der standard and less detailed administrative procedure than does the fto list the state department maintains the tel list17 in sum with respect to sanctions against terrorists the executive branch maintains an intricate array of lists pursuant to various legislation and executive orders these lists do overlap however the executive branch implements sanctions against state sponsors of rrorism terrorist organizati ons and individual terrorists somewhat differently dependi ng upon which legislation applies what the purpose is and which list is being considered there are also international lists maintained by the united nations and the european uni on for example that are not considered here this report looks in detail only at the designated fto list and its sanctions which the state department takes the lead in administering and which names only specially designated terrorist organizati ons the fto list has unique importance not only because of the speci fic measures undertaken to thwart the activ ities of designated groups but also because of the sy mbolic public role it plays as tool of us counterterrorism policy

the arguments for nd against the use of lists is pillar pp 150 156 although it was published before september 11 2001 the book remains one of the best sources of information on this issue and wa s used extensively in the preparation of this continuedhistory of the fto list the first terrorist organizations were designated and put on the fto list in october 1997 about eighteen m onths after the passage of the aedpa there were thirty organizations on that initial list in october 1999 the first review and redesignation occurred of the 30 groups orig inally on the list 27 were redesignated three were allowed to lapse and one more group was added18 notably the group that was added to the fto list that year was qaeda which was designated foreign terrorist organization especially because of its involvement in the august 1998 bombings of the us embassies in nairobi kenya and dar salaam tanzania the first exercise of the secretary of states ability to add group outside the usual twoyear cycle occurred in 2000 when the islamic movement of uzbekistan was designated on its own then in the regular biennial review in 2001 the state department added tw new groups the real irish republican army rira and the united selfdefense forcesgroup of colo mbia auc and combined two other groups kahane chai and kach into one19 that brought the total to 28 ftos since that time the list has grown significantly there have been eight groups added to the fto list since october 5 2001 the alaqs martyrs brigade which is an armed wing of the fatah movement asbat ansar lebanesebased group associated with qaeda the communist pa rty of philippinesnew peoples army cppnpa maoist group jaishem ohammed jem an islamic extremist group based in pakistan jemaah islamiya ji southeast asian terrorist network

middle east there are 36 groups currently designated as foreign rrorist organizations see appendix advantages of the fto list there are advantages and disadvantages for the united states in using formal list as mechanism for counterterrorism purposes20 chief among the advantages ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32120crs7 20continued section 21pillar p 151 this is not however the typically preferred grounds for deportation other grounds are often easier to prove in deportation hearings and do not potentially require revealing sensitive intelligence sources and methods in hearing 22testimony of

httpwwwterrorismanswerscomresponsesmoney2htmlq7 and terrorist financing report of an independent task force spons ored by the council on foreign relations new york 2002 23it is worth noting however that from the perspective of the justice department the designated fto list is only one tool for cont rolling or deterring the behavior of terrorist organizations that threaten the united states members of organizations listed as designated ftos who engage in criminal behavior are also subject to prosecution under other criminal statutes and often prosecution for the other cr imes that terrorists typically engage in is more promising than relying upon the sanctions legislation see pillar p 151the fact that the fto list brings legal cl arity to efforts to identify and prosecute members of terrorist organizations nd those who support them having the designated fto list helps to target us counterterrorist sanc tions under the aedpa because there is ambiguity about whic h groups are included and which are not if group is on the fto list then the ae dpa sanctions apply if not they do not thus being added to the list can have ve ry substantial implications for both the organization and for us c ounterterrorist efforts in practical bureaucratic terms the fto list also provides lucidity in the often complicated interagency process of coordinating the actions of executive agencies by giving them central focal point upon which the efforts converge us counterterrorism is therefore potentially more effective state treasury justice homeland security and other agencies all recognize that groups on the list are subject to scrutiny and sanctions and th measures arguably make americans more secure from terrorist attacks for example by cutting down on terrorist organizations access to resources and preventing terrorist group members from entering the country specifically the depa rtments of homeland s ecurity and justice have used affiliation with an fto as grounds for deportation of aliens21 t h treasury department working with the interagency and international communities has used the fto list among the other us terrorist sanctions programs in its effort reportedly to block more than 125 billion in assets worldwide22 and of course the justice department has prosecuted individuals affiliated with ftos23 having focal point for agency coordination enhan ces the effectiveness of government implementation and may also serve as terrent to organizations that consider engaging in illegal behavior likewise the fto list is useful mechanism in dealing with other governments especially those that are coordinating count erterrorism efforts with the united states labeling and listing terrorist organizations also opposed by other states can be

symbolic impact the blueeyed emir is one example the angeles times september 20 2003 p a1 and continuedimportant source of convergence in bilatera l national relations there is sense of alliance against common enemy often important benefits are derived in counterterrorism or other asp ects of the bilateral relations hip as result moreover states that are actually or potentially s upporting organizations on the list can be left in doubt about us policy on the issue clearly labeling what the united states government considers foreign terrorist organization can have significant domestic and international foreign policy advantages it can be powerful diplomatic tool residing in the state departments offi ce of the coordinator for counterterrorism another important benefit is the attention that the fto list gives to the organizations that are on it drawing atten tion to terrorist groups aids in identifying them not only for states but for nongovernme ntal organizations and individuals and likewise the terrorist organizations are fully placed on notice that someone is watching what they do this can make it more difficult for them to operate the groups on the fto list are stigmatized many modern terrorist organizations have varied portfolio of activities some of which may be ostensibly legitimate some who may have previously viewed an organization primarily as charity or as public advocacy group ma reconsider supporting it publicizing which groups are formally designated has important legal implications since the law punishes those who wittingly support terrori st organizations ignorance of listed organizations activities is less defensible po tential donors may not necessarily be willing to contribute to an organization that is designated as terrorist especially if the gift may result in prosecution under u s law the moral relativity that some people claim dogs the terrorist label is removed at least as far as official us policy is concerned disadvantages of the fto list although it has important gal and symbolic significance some argue that having list is overly mechanistic restrictive and inflexible especially in an area of foreign policy that requires flexibility nonstate actors such as terrorist organizations are often able to change their names andor characteristics much more quickly than ponderous bureaucratic lists can reflect this is serious problem in an era when international terrorism is increasingly globalized in its reach and capabilities with borders becoming more permeable and less relevant in an age of internet links and open trade areas24 likewise such lists are not very effective in dealing with ad hoc activities engaged in by volunteers who may not have clear longterm relationship with an organization this has become particular worry with respect to qaeda for example25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32120crs9 25continued qaeda after the iraq conflict crs report for congress rs 21529may 23 2003 26groups or to use more specific legal language those who work for or on their behalf are owned or controlled by them provide material technological or financial support to them or are otherwise affiliated with them are candidates to be included on the list 27another significant differen ce between the fto and the sdgt list is that under the sanctions regime 1390 committee the us is obligated to designate terrorists and does so through eo 13224 the fto program remains unilateral the statement that group is on the list or off the list can be very misleading and its significance is often understood it is true that the fto list is generally considered the primary means of imposing sanctions against terrorist organizations however not being on th fto list does not necessarily mean that the us government has failed to recogniz that group is engaged in terrorism is threat and should be subject to sancti ons sometimes for various reasons groups26 are not on the fto list but are on the sdt or sdgt list they can also be on the terrorist exclusion list there may be co mpeting priorities in dealing with group such as desire to engage group in negotiations or to use the fto naming as leverage for another foreign policy aim without full ppreciation of the interplay among different sanctioning lists not to mention the interplay between competing foreign policy goals and all of the sanctioning lists stat ements about whether or not group is on particular list may ring hollow it is not necessarily the case that the fto list is the most effective or prosecutable mechanism to act against terrorist organizations if that is the aim sometimes it is easier to prosecute organizations or their associates by using the executive orders under ieepa for example it can be more difficult to prove that someone is materially suppor ting or working for or on behalf of an fto under aedpa than it is to prove that someone is violating the terms of executive order 13224 in that case it might be to the be nefit of us counterterrorism efforts to name group sdgt rather than an fto if group is then also put on the terrorism exclusion list the combined effects of the sanctions overall could be comparable to being formally named an fto27 of course the public attention and diplomatic leverage that goes along w ith being on the betterknown fto list is not equalled however the point is that in terms of the results with respect to fighting an organizations activities the us sanctions regime is far more complicated than either being on the list or off the list would imply competing foreign policy cerns often result in decisions to keep groups off the list this is not necessarily probl em as us foreign policy considers numerous competing priorities in an given situation the law authorizes but does not require the secretary of st ate to make any given designation if there are countervailing foreign policy priorities then his or her judgment prevails nonetheless inconsistencies of standards from the perspective strictly of terrorism can make the us government appear hypocritical especially in the eyes of those who see the fto list only in black and white terms and may not appreciate the existence of other terrorist lists stat ements about organizations that are not designated regularly appear in the pr ess journals and academic writing

october 8 1999 accessible at http wwwstategov sctrlsrptfto 30pillar pp 154155 there was also an unusual recent case involving the mek where the court held that the fto designation decisi on under the aedpa was obtained in violation of the constitution and that such designa tion could not be predicate for criminal prosecution see united stat of america v roya rahmani 2097supp2d 1045 cd cal 2002 example28 having such highprofile list can politicize and oversimplify what is actually complex web of legal sanctions th at may be in addition to or instead of those pursuant to the aedpa furthermore as noted above the fto list is subject to judici review thus on number of occasions groups have filed law suits to be removed from it for example the mujahedine khalq mek and the liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte or tamil tigers in 1999 both filed suits in the district of columbia arguing that they had been denied due pr ocess but they lost in court29 separate legal challenge was undertaken by the ltte and the turkish kurdistan workers party pkk which argued that the fto portion of the aedpa was unconstitutional the suit was brought by individuals and groups seeking to make contributions to the designated organizations they also lost their case however the ability to win in court has at times evidently been an element in the initial decision whether or not to designate group30 this may mean that the designation has more to do with the legalities of the evidence than with the pr otection of us national security from terrorist threat policy options for congress in the 108th congress number of amendments have been offered to change the aedpa legislation so as to improve the effectiveness and ease of implementation of the fto list some have proposed that the law should be changed so that the designation does not lapse if the secretary of state fails to renew it every two years it is significant bureaucratic burden to ensure that the designations are appropriately reviewed investigated the administrative record update d the appropriate agencies consulted and the public statement of renewal made every two years after the initial designation some might argue that th burden of proof should be placed on the terrorist organization and that the desi gnations should stand unless successful appeal is placed by the organization th requirement for renewal is one of the aspects that some believe make the fto list less desirable than the other sanctioning tools available under ieepa and the relevant executive orders on the other hand opponents may point out that the powers of the federal government under the patriot act are alread extensive and that placing the burden of proof on designated ftos essentially makes them guilty until they provehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32120crs11 themselves innocent the state sponsors of terrorism list has been largely static in part because states remain on the list til the secretary of state is able to attest to listed states having stopped being involve d in supporting terrorism it is always difficult to prove negative some might argue that the fto list is more flexible document with the current arrangement rega rding renewals and should be kept that way the fto list provides public venue for the state department periodically to reemphasize the importance us fore ign policy places upon countering these organizations another idea is to remove the requirement for judicial review of the fto list this would make it much harder for terrorist organizations to appeal their placement on the list the arguments for and against this suggestion are similar to those presented above since judici review is an important mechanism available for organizations whose members believe that they have been wrongly labeled and punished there is precedent for trying this suggestion the foreign narcotics kingpin designation act passed in d ecember 1999 originally contained judicial review provision this caused concern among some owners of private businesses who feared that they might somehow be added to the list for unwitting business relationships with narcotics traffickers shortly thereafter legislation was passed to remove the provision and judicial review was restored httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32120crs12 appendix designated foreign terrorist organizations abu nidal organization ano abu
