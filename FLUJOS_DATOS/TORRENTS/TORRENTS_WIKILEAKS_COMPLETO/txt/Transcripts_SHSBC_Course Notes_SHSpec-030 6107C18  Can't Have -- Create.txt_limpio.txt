6107c18 shspec30 cant have create in 1952 the philadelphia doctorate course and scientology 88008 were the basic texts on havingness havingness is dominant thing it is part of games conditions now we are back to games conditions and its relation to havingness in scientology 88008 we had the principle that the goal of processing is to remedy the scarcity and abundance of all things but all that we previously had to do this was creative processing and lot of people couldnt run it now we have come up with new way to do this and thus clear someone fast there is new datum on havingness its relation to create after you create something you may have it or not create doesnt necessarily mean that youll have all of auditing could be considered prehavingness hence the prehav scale the relationship between creating and havingness has to do with the fundamental formation of the reactive bank and is very important what person cant have he creates that is the law on which man operates it is the most fundamental law of the bank that has yet been discovered this is how the bank is formed eg whenever italy gets beaten they have renaissance or like when you abuse plant it blooms lrh wanted ship and couldnt buy one so he started to build one if rosebush cant have rose if you trim it off it creates roses if shipyard cant have ships it builds ships that wear out in twenty years so you cant have the ships either probably the government punishes everyone for producing in order to make them produce on reactive basis theres evidently some crossrelationship that goes further than the ow mechanism it was described in theory in scientology 88008 plus in the discussion of games conditions in the fundamentals of thought games conditions concern preventing people from having things things of all sorts are havingness the thetan is only unhappy when he cant have his idea of quality could be reformed if you deny him anything hell try to obtain it eg the prohibition now lrh knows how to make civilization decide what would be good things to have and create knuckleheaded bureaus to prevent each one of them the trouble with economics is that it tries to create demand with supply it should use scarcity how do you create creation run broad cant have the games condition can get so bad that if you insist on people having something they dont want it police action creates crime bbc creates rock and roll as long as you arent in games condition with the people around you as long as you dont run cant have or must have on them and still have control all will be smooth sailing its supposed to be good thing on this planet to run cant have eg with strictness but this is the way you create problems problems may appear to be dont haves but how did the pc get into the condition of dont have actually dont have is the last ditch of cant have because even with cant have you could materialize what you dont have maybe even build one but the way you got into dont have was the overtmotivator sequence first you run cant have on others then they dont have then you dont have so if the pc doesnt have anything it must be because he denied it if hes got low quality of something he gets it thus he cant have good one but nobody wants bad one so hes got bad one the test of his havingness is that he has it because nobody wants it if nobody wants it he can have it total lack of something doesnt mean that the thetan is without it itll still be obsessively created in his reactive bank the covert creativity of the bank is remedy of havingness thats all it is now say you run cant have on somebody on sex then you find people running cant have on you on the subject of sex and youre puzzled youll find 2d activities are impossible so youre likely to do flip to go off in some different direction and build up various sorts of 2d activities you could have when these also fail you end up with them hidden from yourself but still created in the bank so we get the downgrading quality the degrade is on the basis of what he can have common denominator of pcs at the bottom is the complaint of not being able to feel bit higher they complain of not feeling as much as theyd like about things thats cant have on feelings also the feelings degrade and go on down the tone scale serenity is impossible so the thetan becomes enthusiastic but thats an overt so he goes down to conservatism but thats for bank managers so he gets bored but people wont let you be bored so down to feelings but of course all these feelings are being mocked up at the back of the bank at the first st hill acc lrh talked about two routes experience and the auditing route used at that time they are now combined because the experiential factor is havingness experience is havingness so all experience can be restored beingness and doingness can be junior to havingness but cf p 42 at upper level strata beingness is higher than doingness which is higher than havingness so maybe lrh is talking about lower level stratum here but beingness and doingness operate on the same cant have mechanism when you hit bottom on your own beingness youll mock up some very desirable beingness and you will be that except that you are not really being that for instance kid isnt permitted to be pilot and fly airplanes so he mocks up being an ace aviator person may end up settling for lesser and lesser beingness finally he is not being much so he mocks up substitute reactive beingness little kids are not permitted to fly planes so what do they do they become aviators what confuses people is that while cant have produces create at reactive level all this can take place at an analytical level not all cant haves trigger the obsessive create but if you communicate the cant have in an unacceptable cant have way in good games condition the guy may well slip into the reactive create absence of arc is almost requisite for reactive creation by reason of cant have if you run strong cant have on war in the interests of peace war will result keeping the peace is not done by running cant have on war by propaganda etc for instance at the outset of world war ii information was given out about the war it was not considered ok to attack the enemy yet we did get ourselves into it when people run cant have on things that do exist we get delusory state christian science does this try running 8c on christian scientist the insistence of thetan on axiom 1 is fantastic on some people if you try to run think process they cant do it these people must have an ow games condition on thoughts because they cant have thought if someone withholds thought hes running games condition on you on the subject of you cant have it this will put him in condition where he has less of it if you can get off his withholds ie get him to give you the thought youve stopped him from playing that game condition and hell feel better but why does he have these discreditable things anyway because they are scarce if thought is scarce there has been cutdown of thought of activity so the person withholds telling you about actions agains the mores of society because such actions are scarce if you can get hold of one its his jewel scarcity he also holds onto it because he doesnt want you to have bad thoughts about him this is another games condition to handle this you could run cant have process on thoughts theoretically 1 what thought havent you permitted another to have 2 what thought hasnt another permitted you to have you could see another mechanism from another theoretical process you run think of say woman at first he gets generality or nothing then he thinks of specific departed women then dead women sick women funerals too you are making him examine the scarcity of women and it runs backwards to the point where he could think of present woman with perfect ease and get 3d picture of her whatever it is you find him inverted or nonexistent on you develop process by which you can discharge his propensity for using that item in games condition on others and they on him because you are running out stable data on this you add confusion problem or motion along with it for instance you could use when have you denied another woman when has another denied you woman what problem about women is not present now the not present now is because it is the notis version of problem confront this is murderous process because it unnotises everything involved games condition is unnatural since in such condition the person becomes convinced that there is only that game so they run the cant have and the more they do this the less they have of it eventually it disappears from view and they have gotten worse not better way back people wouldnt clear because they thought it meant losing their game when cleared they promptly went out and aberrated themselves again to have game they expressed it as i didnt want to be detached from existence what pinned it down was scarcity of games they thought being aberrated was the only game going the remedy of havingness of games is broadening the pcs view on the subject of games all you have to do is knock out his fixed attention on aberrated games so that he can look around at all the other games if you do this the pc will blow clear almost at once
