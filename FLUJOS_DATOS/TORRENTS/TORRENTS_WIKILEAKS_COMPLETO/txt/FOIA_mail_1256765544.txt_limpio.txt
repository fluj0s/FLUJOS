textplain charsetiso88591 i know i feel for you being in that position if its any consolation weve had it here for years very pointed commentary at all external seminars and elsewhere always coming back to the same theme since sonja retired i am lot more free to push my environmental interests without ongoing critique of my motives and supposed misguidedness ive signed my department up to 1010 campaign and have taskforce of staff and students involved in it every now and then people say to sotto voce with some bemusement and when sonja finds out how will you explain it to her graham original message from phil jones mailtopjonesueaacuk sent 28 october 2009 1639 to graham f haughton subject re dr sonja boehmerchristiansen dear graham thanks for the speedy reply just like you are we are trying here to do bits of research mostly related to the current set of contracts we have trying to respond to blogs is just not part of the deadlines we have entered into with the research councils the eu and defra you are probably aware of this but the journal sonja edits is at the very bottom of almost all climate scientists lists of journals to read it is the journal of choice of climate change skeptics and even here they dont seem to be bothering with journals at all recently i dont think there is anything more you can do i have vented my frustration and have had considered reply from you cheers phil at 1845 27102009 you wrote contentclass urncontentclassesmessage contenttype textplain charsetiso88591 dear phil sorry to hear this i dont see much of her these days but when i do see sonja next ill try and have quiet word with her about the way the affiliation to us is used but at the moment in fairness she is entitled to use it in the way she does fortunately i dont get to see many of these email exchanges but i do occasionally hear about them or see them and frankly am rarely convinced by what i read but as with all academics id want to protect another academics freedom to be contrary and critical even if i personally believe she is probably wrong i agree with you that itd be better for these exchanges to be conducted through the peer review process but these forms of ecommunication are now part of the public debate and its difficult to do much about it other than to defend your position in this and other fora or just ignore it as being in your words malicious i can understand your frustration and i am pretty sure id be feeling exactly the same in your shoes but i am not sure at the moment that i can do much more if you think i can and should do more then feel free to ring and i am happy to discuss the matter graham original message from phil jones mailtopjonesueaacuk sent 27 october 2009 1705 to graham f haughton subject dr sonja boehmerchristiansen dear professor haughton the email below was brought to my attention by the help desk of ukcp09 the new set of uk climate scenarios developed for defra it was sent by the person named in the header of this email i regard this email as very malicious dr boehmerchristiansen states that it is beyond her expertise to assess the claims made if this is the case then she shouldnt be sending malicious emails like this the two canadians she refers to have never developed treering chronology in their lives and mcintyre has stated several times on his blog site that he has aim to write up his results for publication in the peerreview literature im sure you will be of the same opinion as that science should be undertaken through the peerreview literature as it has been for over 300 years the peerreview system is the safeguard science has developed to stop bad science being published in case you want to read more about the subject my colleague keith briffa has just put this up on his web site httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffayamal2009 it has taken him some time partly as he has been off after serious operation in june he has had to return early to respond to this he has also had some difficulty contacting our russian colleagues the claims on the climate audit site are exaggerated but get taken completely out of context by the other blog sites that get referred to in dr boehmerchristiansens email i will draw your attention to two things 1 the yamal chronology is only used in 3 of the 12 millennial temperature reconstructions in ch 6 of the 2007 ipcc report 2 mcintyre was sent the data for yamal by our russian colleagues on feb 2 2004 i realize dr boehmerchristensen longer works for you but she is still using your affiliation best regards phil jones from sonja boehmerchristiansen sonjabchullacuk date 2 october 2009 180939 gmt0100 to stephanie ferguson stephaniefergusonukciporguk cc peiser benny bjpeiserljmuacuk patrick david henderson pdhenderson18googlemailcom christopher monckton moncktonmailcom subject re please take note of potetially serious allegations of scientific fraud by cru and met office dear stephanie i expect that great deal of ukcip work is based on the data provided by cru as does the work of the ipcc and of course uk climate policy some of this very fundamentally would now seem to be open to scientific challenge and may even face future legal enquiries it may be in the interest of ukcip to inform itself in good time and become little more uncertain about its policy advice perhaps you can comment on the following and pass the allegations made on to the relevant people it is beyond my expertise to assess the claims made but they would fit into my perception of the whole manmade global warming cum energy policy debate i know several of the people involved personally and have reason to doubt their sincerity and honour as scientists though i am also aware of their highly critical of ipcc science policy positions i could also let you have statements by steve mcintyre and ross mckitrick ross mckitrick currently teaches at westminister business school and who is fully informed about the relevant

httpjennifermarohasycomblog200909leadingukclimatescientists httpjennifermarohasycomblog200909leadingukclimatescientists mustexplainorresign most scientific sceptics have been dismissive of the various reconstructions of temperature which suggest 1998 is the warmest year of the past millennium our case has been significantly bolstered over the last week with statistician steve mcintyre finally getting access to data used by keith briffa tim osborn and phil jones to support the idea that there has been an unprecedented upswing in temperatures over the last hundred years the infamous hockey stick graph mr mcintyres analysis of the data which he had been asking for since 2003 suggests that scientists at the climate research unit of the united kingdoms bureau of meteorology have been using only small subset of the available data to make their claims that recent years have been the hottest of the last millennium when the entire data set is used mr mcintyre claims that the hockey stick shape disappears completely 1 mr mcintyre has previously showed problems with the mathematics behind the hockey stick but scientists at the climate research centre in particular dr briffa have continuously republished claiming the upswing in temperatures over the last 100 years is real and not an artifact of the methodology used as claimed by mr mcintyre however these same scientists have denied mr mcintyre access to all the data recently they were forced to make more data available to mr mcintyre after they published in the philosophical transactions of the royal society journal which unlike nature and science has strict policies on data archiving which it enforces this weeks claims by steve mcinyre that scientists associated with the uk meteorology bureau have been less than diligent are serious and suggest some of the most defended building blocks of the case for anthropogenic global warming are based on the indefensible when the methodology is laid bare this sorry saga also raises issues associated with how data is archived at the uk meteorological bureau with in complete data sets that spuriously support the case for global warming being promoted while complete data sets are kept hidden from the public including from scientific sceptics like steve mcintyre it is indeed time leading scientists at the climate research centre associated with the uk meteorological bureau explain how mr mcintyre is in error or resign 1 yamal divergence problem by steve mcintyre 27 september 2009 httpwwwclimateauditorgp7168 jennifer marohasy bsc phd b national review online 23 september 2009 httparticlenationalreviewcomqztbimtrlmdqxnzeymmrhzju3zmyzodi5mgy4zwi5owmby patrick j michaels imagine if there were reliable records of global surface temperature raucous policy debates such as capandtrade would have scientific basis gore would at this point be little more than historical footnote and president obama would not be spending this session talking up likely unattainable international climate deal in copenhagen in december steel yourself for the new reality because the data needed to verify the gloomanddoom warming forecasts have disappeared or so it seems apparently they were either lost or purged from some discarded computer only very few people know what really happened and they arent talking much and what little they are saying makes sense in the early 1980s with funding from the us department of energy scientists at the united kingdoms university of east anglia established the climate research unit cru to produce the worlds first comprehensive history of surface temperature its known in the trade as the jones and wigley record for its authors phil jones and tom wigley and it served as the primary reference standard for the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc until 2007 it was this record that prompted the ipcc to claim discernible human influence on global climate putting together such record isnt at all easy weather stations werent really designed to monitor global climate longstanding ones were usually established at points of commerce which tend to grow into cities that induce spurious warming trends in their records trees grow up around thermometers and lower the afternoon temperature further as documented by the university of colorados roger pielke sr many of the stations themselves are placed in locations such as in parking lots or near heat vents where artificially high temperatures are bound to be recorded so the weather data that go into the historical climate records that are required to verify models of global warming arent the original records at all jones and wigley however werent specific about what was done to which station in order to produce their record which according to the ipcc showed warming of 06 02c in the 20th century now begins the fun warwick hughes an australian scientist wondered where that came from so he politely wrote phil jones in early 2005 asking for the original data joness response to fellow scientist attempting to replicate his work was we have 25 years or so invested in the work why should i make the data available to you when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it reread that statement for it is breathtaking in its antiscientific thrust in fact the entire purpose of replication is to try and find something wrong the ultimate objective of science is to do things so well that indeed nothing is wrong then the story changed in june 2009 georgia techs peter webster told canadian researcher stephen mcintyre that he had requested raw data and jones freely gave it to him so mcintyre promptly filed freedom of information act request for the same data despite having been invited by the national academy of sciences to present his analyses of millennial temperatures mcintyre was told that he couldnt have the data because he wasnt an academic so his colleague ross mckitrick an economist at the university of guelph asked for the data he was turned down too faced with growing number of such requests jones refused them all saying that there were confidentiality agreements regarding the data between cru and nations that supplied the data mcintyres blog readers then requested those agreements country by country but only handful turned out to exist mainly from third world countries and written in very vague language its worth noting that mckitrick and i had published papers demonstrating that the quality of landbased records is so poor that the warming trend estimated since 1979 the first year for which we could compare those records to independent data from satellites may have been overestimated by 50 percent webster who received the cru data published studies linking changes in hurricane patterns to warming while others have found otherwise enter the dog that ate global warming roger pielke jr an esteemed professor of environmental studies at the university of colorado then requested the raw data from jones jones responded since the 1980s we have merged the data we have received into existing series or begun new ones so it is impossible to say if all stations within particular country or if all of an individual record should be freely available data storage availability in the 1980s meant that we were not able to keep the multiple sources for some sites only the station series after adjustment for homogeneity issues we therefore do not hold the original raw data but only the valueadded ie quality controlled and homogenized data the statement about data storage is balderdash they got the records from somewhere the files went onto computer all of the original data could easily fit on the 9inch tape drives common in the mid1980s i had all of the worlds surface barometric pressure data on one such tape in 1979 if we are to believe joness note to the younger pielke cru adjusted the original data and then lost or destroyed them over twenty years ago the letter to warwick hughes may have been an outright lie after all peter webster received some of the data this year so the question remains what was destroyed or lost when was it destroyed or lost and why all of this is much more than an academic spat it now appears likely that the us senate will drop capandtrade climate legislation from its docket this fall whereupon the obama environmental protection agency is going to step in and issue regulations on carbondioxide emissions unlike law which cant be challenged on scientific basis regulation can if there are data theres science us taxpayers deserve to know
