contain some significant differences the bulk of the house version is permanently funded while the senate version is considered discretionary spending opponents worried that enacting these bills could increase the rate at which the federal government acquires private lands increase pressure to expand development in the ocs or in the case of the house bill remove significant funding decisions from the annual appropriations process supporters believed that more dependable federal funding in larger amounts for diverse resource protection purposes was long overdue and argued that the revenues generated by depletion of one resource development of offshore oil and gas should be used to augment efforts to conserve other resources many programs that would have been funded in these bills were

related initiative in the 106th congress summary this report compares hr 701 as passed by the house and hr 701 as approved by the senate committee on energy and natural resources with current law these bills often referred to as the conservation and reinvestment act cara would have funded various resource acquisition and protection activities the two versions contain some significant differences both bills and numerous related bills originated in part from efforts to 1 provide higher and more certain funding for resource protection programs 2 fund the state grant portion or the entire lwcf each year and 3 dedicate large portion of offshore oil and gas revenues to resource protection support for this legislation spread as 1 the budget deficit was replaced with surplus 2 protecting natural resources became viewed as part of efforts to address sprawl 3 local pressure to secure federal funding for resource protection expanded and 4 efforts to increase funding to federal resource protection programs strengthened both bills addressed numerous topics the housepassed version provided just over 3 billion including interest to fund 9 program areas while senate committee version provided just under 3 billion to 15 program areas examples of activities that would have been funded under both bills include new programs for coastal areas to mitigate impacts associated with offshore energy development and for wildlife protection and restoration and an urban program to develop recreation facilities all funding would have come from outer continental shelf ocs oil and gas revenues which now fund the general functions of the federal government key feature of the house versio n was to bypass the annual appropriations proce ss for most programs while strongly supported by the bills advocates this feature was opposed by those who favored other priorities for federal spending wanted to limit overall federal spending or believed such funding should be sought through the annual appropriations process opposition was also raised by advocates of private property rights who feared that additional funding would accelerate public acquisition of private lands as well as some environmental interests who worried that support for more funding could increase pressure to expand ocs activities the clinton administrations lands legacy initiative which was first proposed in january 1999 is reviewed in an appendix to this report the administration had submitted this proposal with the fy2000 and fy2001 budgets and it became an alternative to cara for fy2001 after it became apparent the cara would not be enacted the administration never developed this initiative as freestanding legisl ation it is different from cara in many fundamental ways it is not multi year program it is not tied to ocs revenues it does not use permanent appropriations and the appropriations committees will have to agree on funding levels for each of these programs every year to track related

106th congress considered numerous omnibus bills to greatly expand federal financial support for various land and resource protection acquisition and restoration programs in recent congressional sessions legislation with multiple components and proposals for significant additional federal expenditures might have been less likely to receive serious considerati on because of the budget deficit and the difficulty of offsetting any new spending with reductions elsewhere but with the emergence of budget surplus endorsement at least in concept by broad political constituency and an apparent groundswell of grassroots support these proposals received greater congressional attention the house passed hr 701 on may 11 2000 after 2 days of debate during which it adopted 7 of the 24 amendments that it considered hr 701 was cosponsored by 315 members and passed the house by vote of 315102 passage was supported by majority of both republican and democratic members after completion of action in the house supporters of the legislation pressed the senate to act the senate energy and natural resources committee held hearing on several alternative proposals on may 24 it approved substitute version of hr 701 on july 25 by vote of 137 after several days of often contentious debate numerous amendments were proposed but none that were characterized as more than technical corrections were adopted the substitute version generally combined provisions in hr 701 as passed in the house with provisions in bill that had been introduced by the ranking minority member senator bingaman s 2181 the committee filed its report with minority views on september 14 2000 s report 106413 further action was taken coverage of report this report compares existing law with hr 701 as passed by the

detail on the housepassed version of hr 701 including all the amendments considered and adopted can be found in the june 12 version 4senator boxer stated at the may 24 2000 senate energy and natural resources committee hearing that she had introduced s 2567 because she believed it would be the fastest way to pass legislation and was concerned that the legislative calendar was growing short she also commented that she did not necessarily endorse all the provisions in hr 701s2567 the payment in lieu of taxes pilt program1 the scr version would also have funded additional programs to protect natural and cultural resources revenue from outer continental shelf ocs oil and gas activities in federal waters would have funded these programs funding requirements for both versions of hr 701 were estima ted to approach 3 billion and hr 701hp would have accrued additional interest as well the largest amount would have been spent in california 331 million under the house bill and 327 million under the senate bill2 other legislative proposals in the 106th congress several other closelyrelated bills are identified in this section but not discussed further in this report the first omnibus bill introduced in the 106th congress s 25 sponsored by senator landrieu would have funded 4 programs using percentages of total ocs revenues rather than specified dollar amounts3 subsequently senator landrieu introduced s 2123 which was identical to hr 701 as reported by the house resources committee senator boxers s 446 was identical to hr 798 sponsored by representative george miller provisions in these bills drew on many components of the clinton administration lands legacy initiative announced in january 1999 and discussed in the appendix however representative miller cosponsored and voted for hr 701 and senator boxer introduced subsequent bill s 2567 which was identical to hr 701hp4 another bill that was similar to the clinton administration proposal was s 2181 sponsore d by senator bingaman several elements of s 2181 were incorporated into the scr version of hr 701 two other bills more limited in the topics they would address hr 452 and s 532 also were introduced hr 452 sponsored by representative campbell would have only amended the lwcf this bill would have taken the lwcf offbudget and exempted this fund from any general budget limitation also it would have required that at least half the annual lwcf funding be provided to the states current law requires that at least 40 go to federal agencies s 532 was sponsored by senator feinstein she described s 532 as moderate alternative to s 446 which she supported it would have amended the lwcf act and the urban parks and recreation recove ry program uparr ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs3 5for more

fund current status and issues last updated on november 29 1999would have permanently appropriated the entire annual authorize d amount 900 million it also would have allocated 50 of this amount to federal agencies 40 to states and 10 to local governments through uparr this bill also would have amended uparr in several ways forces behind these proposals widespread interest in and support of aspects of cara may have reflected the confluence of several interrelated factors various interests and combinations of interests proposed changes in current laws and programs 1 to fully fund the lwcf 2 to address the increased backlog of pending federal land acquisitions that the lwcf addresses and expand the ways that lwcf funds can be spent 3 to increase overall resource protection funding 4 to fund state programs for species that are not hunted fished threatened or endangered 5 to reduce the chronic underfunding of federal land payment programs to local governments 6 to address resource management needs in coastal areas especially those affected by offshore energy development and 7 to allow states and counties to draw further on ocs revenues which grew during the 1990s both bills responded to each of these forces some times in different ways the clinton administration expressed support for the general concepts behind these legislative proposals through its lands legacy initiative this initiative was first proposed with the fy2000 budget and was resubmitted slightly altered with the fy200 1 submission as this initiative is component of the budget it must be reconsidered each year by the appropriate appropriations subco mmittees the fy 2001 proposal called for almost doubling of funding for the lands legacy initiative to 14 billion for more than 20 programs the house and senate versions of cara would have funded many of the programs in the initiative the initiative is reviewed in greater detail in the appendix5 overall support for cara was widespread and came out of large and diverse coalition of many interests members favoring the legislation frequently pointed out that more than 4500 groups from conservation organizations to governors and other public entities had expressed support for this legislation opponents countered that support shows the magnitude and diversity of the pork this legislation would fund as almost all of these groups would have directly benefitted if this legislation had been enacted while some probably wanted the overall legislation enacted most interests would have benefited from one or more titles or programs rather than the entire bill fully funding the lwcf growing number in congress have been advocating fully and predictably funding the lwcf6 under current law 900 million is authorized to be appropriated annually through fy2015 unappropriatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs4 balances are available to be appropriated in subsequent years appropriations during the 1990s have averaged less than one third of the authorized level since the fund started in 1965 its accumulated authorization is more than 237 billion through fy2000 however only 114 billion has been appropriated leaving cumulative balance of 123 billion that was authorized but not appropriated since the early 1980s ocs revenues have gone into the general treasury and funded other government functions the current lwcf provides money for five purposes one is the grant program for states for acquisition and development of recreation sites administered by the national park service and the others are for acquisitions for the national forest system the national wildlife refuge system the national park system and areas authorized for recreation by the secretary of the interior including lands managed by the bureau of land management the lack of funding for the state grant program starting in fy1995 led to hearings in the senate and house in 1997 as pressure has increased to fund the state grants it has also grown to fund two other federal programs the urban park and recreation recovery program and the historic preservation act programs the historic preservation act like the lwcf is funded with ocs revenues and has significant unappropriated balance backlog of pending land acquisitions and limits on spending lwcf funds fully funding the lwcf would allow federal agencies to address growing backlog of potential acquisitions resource protection advocates believe that the pressure to make additional acquisitions increases with growing population and expanding development so limited funding has contributed to the expanding gap between available funds and possible acquisitions proponents of these proposals have cited federal agency data that the estimated backlog for acquisition is more than 10 billion opponents counter that the federal government should not be acquiring more land that many of the places federal agencies are considering or already own do not have the values that warrant federal ownership or that more funds should be devoted to maintenance or better management of lands already in federal ownership rather than additional purchases the maintenance backlog has been estimated to be as high as more then 20 billion according to material submitted during the fy2001 appropriations process by the departments of the interior and agriculture while the size of the backlog may be in question all agree that it has been growing some would also like to give states and localities greater flexibility to use these funds to maintain and restore facilities increasing overall resource protection fund ing various organizations supporting conservation have initiated campaigns to increase resource protection funding for programs that have received little or funding in recent years these campaigns seek to increase funding for nongame species that are not threatened or endangered discussed below farmland and coastal resources among others these efforts have been pursued independently in appropriations and authorizing legislation and have met with little success in recent years especially when they have encountered arguments that the federal budget deficit needs to be reduced funding state programs for nongame species funds for game and fished species already are provided through matching grants to support state programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs5 7rrsf is funded without further appropriations to the extent of receipts but receipts are insufficient to fund the amounts in the formula thus annual

conserve species listed as threatened and endangered under the similar program exists to support state conservation efforts for the vast majority of species ie those which are not hunted fished threaten ed or endangered for at least 20 years congress has considered such support but lack of funding has always been the major obstacle recent efforts particularly lobbying effort called teaming with wildlife led by the international association of fish and wildlife agencies have focused on enacting tax on certain outdoor equipment to fund grants to states for conservation of nongame species congressional reluctance to create any new taxes has caused most of the wildlife interest groups to shift their efforts to seeking funding through these legislative proposals increasing federal payments to local governments local governments have complained that federal payment programs that compensate them for the presence of federal land are inadequate lands owned by the federal government cannot be taxed by state and local governments in some jurisdictions federal lands are significant fraction of total property and therefore local governments have claimed financial harm as result of their inability to collect property taxes on this portion of the land base the lands of all four major federal land managing agencies as well as of some smaller federal landowners are subject to one or more payment programs to provide some measure of federal government comp ensation to local governments for the presence of their lands two of these payment programs are not permanently appropriated the payments in lieu of taxes pilt affecting 11 categories of federally owned land though the program is administered entirel by the bureau of land management and b the refuge revenue sharing fund rrsf entirely for the national wildlife refuge system7 annual appropriations for both of these programs have fallen consistently below the amounts specified in the two laws formulas counties now receive about 41 of the formula amounts for pilt and about 60 for rrsf as result of these shortfalls local governments have repeatedly called on congress to fund these programs at the full authorization levels and these legislative proposals provide additional opportunities to make up this shortfall offshore energy development and coastal effects interests in some coastal states especially louisiana have increased the pressure to return portion of the money currently paid to the federal government by private companies who lease and develop oil and gas resources on the ocs to the affected states thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs6 8one exception is alaska where the state receives 90 with 10 deposited in the federal treasury the reclamation fund supports the bureau of reclamations water resources projects funds would be used to address the adverse onshore effects of these energy activities currently adjacent states and communities do not directly receive any revenue from offshore oil and gas activit ies in federal waters program of loans and grants to coastal states to help them address impacts from offshore and coastal energy activities was briefly implemented through the federal coastal zone management program during the energy crisis in the late 1970s however it was ended when that crisis had passed supporters of paymen t program associated with ocs oil and gas activities point out that in contrast revenue from onshore energy production on federal lands is shared with most states as follows 50 is allocated to the state in which the lease is located 40 is earmarked for the reclamation fund and 10 goes to the federal treasury8 in addition state and local governments currently receive shared revenues from many activities such as logging grazing and some mining on the forest service bureau of land management and fish and wildlife service lands the amount and percentage of the shares depends on the history of the land and the type of activities generating the revenues others may counter that some coastal states will have large influx of new federal funds and that provisions in bills are insufficient to insure that these funds are spent only for projects that are compatible with longterm management of coastal resources growing ocs revenues federal revenues derived from ocs energy activities averaged about 25 billion annually in the early 1990s then increased rapidly to record 48 billion in fy1997 and have been declining more recently currentl those portions of ocs revenues that are not spent on lwcf or the historic preservation fund are used for the general spending of the federal government to the extent that they would be redirected under these proposals they would longer be available to fund other federal programs advocates for these bills view the increase in ocs revenues through fy1997 combined with the change from federal budget deficit to surplus as an opportunity to dedicate more mone to the activities contained in these bills however ocs revenues subsequently declined to33 billion in fy1999 this decline reflected record low prices for oil affecting royalties and bonus bids for newlyleased tracts during the 19971999 period three questions about these proposals if enacted would arise if ocs revenues decline substantially 1 how would program funding be reduced 2 could other sources of funding to offset such reductions be located and 3 could pressures to expand offshore leasing to increase revenues result and if so could they be contained future ocs revenue levels are as uncertain as the future price of crude oil as the rapid changes in retail prices during the past 6 months graphically demonstrate department of the interior projections made internally to support its fy2001 budget submission are based on much lower price scenario than the 30 per barrel world market price prevailing at the start of 2000 might suggest for fy2000 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs7 9personal communication with mineral management service budget staff february 22 2000department not states revenues totaled almost 45 billion earlier it had estimated the total would be 355 billion in subsequent years steadily declining revenues are forecast reflecting lower prices and gradual depletion of ocs hydrocarbon fields fy2002 is estimated to yield 333 billion and this figure will fall to 201 billion in fy20109 the current runup in prices may alter this picture drastically analysts do not agree on whether the current increase in wellhead prices could delay that decline in revenues once it begins and how fast or how far revenues will fall in the future further any shifts in energy policy in the future could alter these estimates total ocs revenues may give an inaccur ate impression of the amounts that would have been available to fund these proposals both bills limited the source of revenues to fund these proposals to specified portions of the ocs that are currently producing in order to discourage expanding ocs activities to fund these programs many of the fields which woul d have been sources of revenue to fund this suite of programs have been in production for decades and the amounts extracted from some of these fields may start to decline over time revenues generated from the segment of the ocs that would have funded these programs may become declining portion of the total revenue generated from all ocs production estimates was released on what portion would have been available to fund cara especially in the out years of the program funding the proposals both bills would have used revenues from offshore oil and gas fields under federal waters to fund the proposals section 312 of hr 701hp and 101 of hr 701scr would have defined qualified revenues to include all ocs revenues royalty rental and bonus revenues from oil and gas leases where the center of the lease lies within 200 miles of states coastline these provisions would have excluded monies paid to states that are derived from leases of deposits that lie in both state and federal lands offshore the law that governs how these deposits would have been treated is in 8g of the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla section 5 of hr 701hp and 2 of hr 701scr would have established the conservation and reinvestment act fund cara fund under the house bill the cara fund would have received maximum of 2825 billion annually from qualifying ocs revenues and previously undispersed funds to be distributed in specified amounts among 7 programs the senate version would have allocated 299 billion annually from qualified ocs revenues to 15 specified program areas section 5c of hr 701hp and 2e of hr 701scr would have required that funding be reduced propor tionately for each program if less than the authorized amount is deposited into the fund section 5e of hr 701hp would have required that any necessary ocs royalty refunds be paid proportionately from the fund the senate bill did not address this topic under the house bill the cara fund would have also generated additional revenue through interest earned as described in 5d so that the total

crippen director of cbo october 14 1999 available to the fund was actually estimated to be slightly more than 3 billion annually interest would have been earned by depositing ocs revenues into the fund during fiscal year investing them appropriately and paying them out the following year interest income up to 200 million annually would have been dedicated to funding two federal programs that make payments to local governments the payment in lieu of taxes program pilt and the refuge revenue sharing fund rrsf and interest earne d on revenues dedicated to title iii on wildlife would have gone to implement the north american wetlands conservation act10 potential major impediment to these proposals was how they would have been treated under the budget caps if congress had been required to offset these funds with savings elsewhere enactment would have been more difficult as those who support the programs that would have been reduced might oppose this legislation since most of the current ocs revenues are available to fund any federal government activity opposition to these bills from those with concerns about the overall budget was also anticipated the congressional budget office informed resources committee chair don young in letter that it believed that the office of management and budget which would make the final determination would not choose to adjust the caps require an offset if hr 701 were enacted because creating new direct spending authority does not constitute change in budgetary concepts or definitions11 hr 701 would have still been subject to enforcement provisions of the budget act by creating new mandatory spending however the rule house res 497 for house consideration of hr 701 waived these procedural safeguards where the funds would have gone funds would have been distributed among the recipient programs based on amounts and formulas in existing law or as specified in each bill table 1 on the next page shows how the funds would have been distributed by activity and table 2 on the following page shows the total funding that was forecast to be distributed by state both versions of hr 701 would have provided about the same total amount of money however the pattern of distribution among programs would have varied because the program funding levels under the 2 bills were different for most programs as shown in table 1 the largest difference was that hr 701hp would have provided 1 billion for coastal assistance while hr 701scr would have provided 805 million for different mix of coastal and marine programs the other major difference is that hr 701scr would have funded programs that were not included in hr 701hp and some of the programs in both bills would have received more funding under the house version

proposals encompassed in these bills federal budget implications propert rights and federal ownership ocs leasing moratoria and federal land payments each of these issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs11 12this subsection floor amendment offered by representative shadegg passed the house by 216208 on roll call vote 163 on may 10 is described below emphasizing how they were addressed in the bills the views of major interests also are identified federal budget implications both bills appear to guarantee the availability and predictability of funding without further appropriations for all the programs funded by the cara fund however much of this guarantee is contradicted by restrictions contained in provisions in both bills designed to protect social security and medicare as well as assist in debt reduction b provisions in hr 701hp to augment congressional control over the federal portion of lwcf and c 2f of hr 701scr affecting not only the federal portion of the lwcf but the entire cara fund this feature of permanent appropriation is already enjoyed by some existing natural resou rce programs eg sport fish and game restoration acquisition of migratory bird habitat reforestation and some soil conservation programs however its use is not widespread providing funds without further appropriation enables programs to avoid the annual appropriations process to accomplish this legislation typically contains the phrase without further appropriation or similar phrase thereby making available annually whatever is specified in the legislation creating the fund traditionally appropriations and budget committees as well as members who strongly support congressional oversight of all spending have strongly opposed this approach to funding moreover procedural hurdles to passage of such proposals can be formidable in addition both bills contain provisions which would have amended lwcf leaving major portions intact both bills also contained sunset provisions so that funding would have ceased in fy2016 unless congress acted to extend the programs debt reduction social security and medicare two provisions addressing these topics are in hr 701hp and similar provisions are found in hr701scr as well see discussion below section 5g of hr701hp contained provision precluding the transfer of funds to the cara fund in any fiscal year unless number of conditions are met12 the director of the congressional budget office cbo would have been required to certify that enough onbudget surplus had been reserve d to cause elimination of the publicly held federal debt by 2013 and that there was not an onbudget deficit for that year onbudget refers to federal budget totals excluding the financial operations of social security and the postal service in addition the social security and medicare hospital insurance hi trustees would have been required to certify that outlays from their respective trust funds would not exceed their revenues during the five years following each year of transfer since the most recent trustees reports for the two programs issued in march 2000 projected that outlays will exceed the revenues in both programs at some point during the next 20 years it is possible that this provision would have precluded the transfer of funds to the cara fund during the latter part of the period in which it would have been in effect httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs12 however if the term revenues as used in the bill referred only to the tax receipts of both programs and excludes the interest credited to the trust funds semi annually the trustees reports suggested that outlays from the social security disability insurance di trust fund would exceed its revenues somewhat earlier in or around fy 2007 for the hi trust fund the same was projected to occur in fy 2009 and for the socia l security old age and survivors insurance oasi trust fund it would happen sometime between 2015 and 2020 thus for hr 701hp at least in principle congress would not have decided annually whether the carasupported programs would be funded in competition with all other discretionary spending rather other discretionary spending would have first become law in appropriations bills and the results would have then been measured against the goals in 5g for reducing the debt and protecting social security and medicare if the goals would have been met the cara programs would have been funded automatically however the portion of cara allowed to federal lwcf would have continued to require action in annual appropriations bills based on current projections for the social security and medicare trust funds and barring major changes in economic conditions or enactment of legislation inhibiting achieving the goals of 5g it appears that the cara programs initially would have been funded as proposed but would have approached being at risk in roughly decade depending on the meaning of the term revenues in the bill new title viii of hr 701hp was added pursuant to motion to recommit with instructions by representative defazio and adopted by recorded vote of 4133 just before final passage this title would have provided that funds can be expend ed under the act if doing so would diminish social security or medicare benefit obligations representative defazio characterized his motion as an effort to strengthen the shadegg amendment as passed by the house there are explicit provisions in the bill that would have altered social security or medicare benefits and none of the expenditures authorized under the bill would have interacted with the benefit calculations or administration of the social security or medicare program as now provided under the social security act as result cara expenditures would have been unlikely to be affected by this title in hr701scr 8 required the director of cbo to report on specific aspects of progress to eliminate public debt by 2013 and on whether an onbudget surplus exists for the current fiscal year b the social security trustees to report on the relation of social security revenues and outlays for the succeeding 5 years and c the medicare trustees to report on the relation of medicare revenues and outlays for the succeeding 5 years nothing in the section required any action that would depe nd on these reports so the reports would have had direct effect on cara spending at the same time 9 of this bill had the same language concerning diminution of the benefit obligations of the social security and medicare trust funds that was found in hr 701hp as noted above this wording left cara funding unaffected however 9 also provided that cara would not have been funded in years in which there is not an onbudget surplus section 8 implied that this determination would have been made by the director of cbo but the two sections were not explicitly linked decision by the budget committees or appropriations committees could have been sufficient to determine the status of the surplus regardless of who would have made the determination as noted above for somewhathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs13 13personal communication with deborah reis budget analyst congressional budget office may 9 2000 14the new 5g the social security and medicare provisions affects funding not only for this portion of the bill but for the entire bill for more on the effects of 5g see debt reduction social security and medicare above with the addition of 5g other factors besides budget and appropriations committee procedures could have limited funding not only continuedsimilar language cara funding could ultimately could have taken back seat to all other federal funding if the senate committee bill had become law is funding permanent or not both bills attempted to provide control of spending for federal land acquisitions under lwcf via the money transferred from cara however the attempts to do so had broader consequences how likely is it that the specified amount would have actually been available and how did that likelihood compare to the current situation in the house version the control would have resulted in cbo scoring three programs federal lwcf and the pilt and rrsf addons as discretionary and therefore their funding would have faced many of the same hurdles it does now all of the remaining programs in the bill would have been funded without further appropriation in the senate version the control would have cast the entire bill as discretionary spending even though the phrase without further appropriation was found throughout the bill as discretionary spending they would have all required action in annual appropriations bills first the house and then the senate bills are discussed below the house bill federal lwcf pilt and rrsf under current procedures each approp riations subcommittee is allocated fixed amount for spending under 302b of the budget act therefore to the extent that the interior appropriatio ns subcommittees now allocate less spending to lwcf more is available for any other program within their jurisdiction the fact that lwcf funds nominally come from ocs revenues is irrelevant to 302b also at least since the early 1980s the reports accompanying the appropriations acts have usually placed earmarks on the great majority of money spent for federal land acquisition under the lwcf while agencies are not necessarily bound by report language that is not incorporated into the funding law they may be constrained politically in what parcels they purchase if hr701hp had become law many external factors eg deficits or surpluses the state of the economy tax cuts interest rates changes in federal land acquisition policy etc could have affected whether congress would have actually appropriated funds for federal land acquisition but 205 of hr 701hp was particularly important to federal lwcf this section required annual approval by congress for all federal land acquisition under cara therefore federal lwcf funding would have been treated as it is now it would have been considered discretionary spending unlike the other programs funded by cara13 and might have been scored under the interior subcommittees annual overall spending ceiling the 302b allocation under the budget act it would have continued to be subject to annual appropriations as it is under current law14 historically there have been very substantial variations in fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs14 14continued for federal lwcf but for the entire bill 15if ocs revenues would have been insufficient for full funding of the bill the bill required all cara programs to be reduced proportionately in such case congress would have to appropriate the full but reduced amount for federal lwcf before the rest of the bill could have been funded also proportionately reducedtherefore for federal lwcf the chief budgetary differences between hr 701hp and current law and practice would have been the following annual appropriations under hr 701hp would have been limited to 450 million from cara and could have been less potentially another 450 million could have been added via cara to current lwcf federal acquisition see the section below titled dual funding for federal lwcf under hr 701hp whether congress would have actually chosen to spend more than the cara portion is debatable under hr 701hp both the agency totals and the earmark s would have been in the appropriations bill itself and hence clearly in law while agencies currently may be politically constrained from moving funding from one project to another when projects are earmarked only in appropriations reports their freedom to do so would have been eliminated if the earmarks were enacted in law for the provisions on payments in lieu of taxes pilt and the refuge revenue sharing fund rrsf cbo similarly scored the cara match provided in 5d as discretionary spending since funding would have been contingent on congressional action ie providing at least certain minimum amount in annual appropriations bills hrept 106499 part i p 5153 for fy2002 cbo estimated 53 million in cara funds would have been available for these two funds the amount was scored as discretionary spending and was therefore subject to the 302b allocations an appreciable change in certainty in the funding of these two programs would therefore have been unlikely the senate provisions all funding affected while the funds for federal land acquisition would have been available without further appropriation under hr 701scr 207b further provided that money shall be obligated or expended for federal land acquisition purposes under this section unless approved in an act making appropriations therefore the funding for federal lwcf would have been considered discretionary and any spending of these cara funds would have coun ted against the interior appropriations subcommittees 302b allocations as in the house version moreover the senate committees 2f required that cara funds for any other programs in the bill be transferred unless congress makes the full 450 million available for federal land acquisition in that year15 all funding in the bill would have been considered discretionary and all of it subject to 302b allocations since congress would have had to act to enable the funds to be spent the practical effect would have been that each of the programs contained in hr 701scr was hardly different from an ordinary authorization while supporters of the various programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs15 16for funding history of the lwcf see crs report 97792 land and water conservation fund current status and issues 17current provisions of lwcf make it clear that 900 million goes from ocs revenues to the fund but are somewhat vague about how much is authorized to be taken from it 18additional discretionary spending would have been provided for payments from interest on cara funds for pilt and for rrsf see funding for county payments belowsought assured funding for the various aspects of the bill it would appear that hr 701scr did not achieve that goal for any of the titles at the same time the control congress would have retained over spending in these programs is somewhat complex once 450 million would have been appropriated for federal land acquisition all of the remaining programs would have been fully funded however congress could have picked and chosen among them to favor funding some progr ams over others via restrictions and amendments in appropriations bills it is unclear what advantage these changes would have offered over simple authorization of each of these programs clearly supporters of all other aspects of this bill sought to ensure that the federal lwcf program was fully funded probably result ing in substantial pressure on congress to do so all funding for the entire bill would have risen or fallen on whether congress appropriated the full 450 million in light of the constraints on allocations under the budget act it is unclear whether the pressure to do so would have been sufficient dual funding for lwcf under hr 701 hp as approved by the house the lwcf provisions might appear to have provided potentially less money for federal land acquisition current law allows annual appropriations up to 900 million per year plus any backlog of authorized but unappropriated funds but cara provided an appropriation of only 450 million for federal land acquisition yet closer analysis reveals that more money in theory might have been spent section 202 of h r 701hp amended 2c of the lwcf to provide 450 million annually for federal acquisition from the cara fund these funds would have been subject to annual appropriations16 in addit ion 203 of this bill amended 3 of the lwcf to provide up to 900 million under existing law17 subject to annual appropriations it continued with reference to amounts transferred from cara in its analysis hrept 106499 part i p 5051 the congressional budget office cbo scored these amounts as two separate items in other words it scored the 900 million from lwcf and 900 million from cara for total of 18 billionboth Â½ federal and Â½ state of the total 450 million for states would have been available without further appropriation while the remaining 135 billion was scored as discretionary spending potentially 900 million of it available for federal land acquisition and 450 million for state lwcf programs18 if past appropriations for federal land acquisition is any guide it is highly doubtful that interior appropriations subcommittees would have chosen to allocate so large fraction of their 302b allocations to federal land acquisitions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs16 19 it is not likely that exemption from regulation under the clean water act or the clean air act for example was intended but just how broadly the language would have been interpreted is unclearthis bill also added new controls limiting how any federal funds whether through cara or the lwcf as amended by car could have been spent and increased the role of congress in making these decisions these controls are discussed in the section titled property rights below and in the discussion on permanency of appropriations above hr701scr had somewhat different language in its 202b it did not appropriate an additional 900 million and instead made the 900 million in the fund from cara plus 2 other relatively minor sources available for expenditure thus 900 million would have been available but subject to 2f see discussion above of this 450 million would have been available for federal land acquisition much has been made of the backlog of over 12 billion in authorized but unappropriated funds for lwcf neither bill stated whether funds to address this backlog could or could not be appropriated in future interior appropriations bills property rights advocates of private property owners rights raised concerns that the availability of additional funds would have increased pressure to acquire more federal land and that further acquisition would have been likely to center on areas where federal ownership is already concentrated section 10 of hr 701hp and 6 of hr 701scr both state that property may not be taken without compensation and that land uses on private land may not be regulated by federal agencies prior to acquisition unless authorized by congress the bills used somewhat different language to make these statements the house resources committee report stated that regulation of private property must be specifically authorized by congress19 hr 701hp contained several provisions in title ii that may have responded to concerns about federal land acquisition and property rights one change made as technical correction prior to house floor consideration and mentioned above would have retained the requirement that the federal portion of the lwcf be subject to annual appropriations the senate version also required an annual appropriation for the federal portion of lwcf for specified acquisitions but the language in 2f could have placed considerable pressure on congress to complete this task quickly as money would have been released to the other cara fund programs until full funding was provided current law and other changes in the various bills include under current law each agency transmits list of proposed acquisitions in its budget justifi cation the acquisitions directed in the congressional earmarks may or may not closely resemble agency priorities under 205 of hr 701hp and 206 of hr 701scr the secretaries of agriculture andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs17 interior would have been required to submit joint priority list and congress could have changed this list in the appropriations bill section 205 of hr 701hp and 207 of hr 701scr required that property be acquired from willing sellers or be specifically approved by congress current law does not prohibit use of federal lwcf funds in condemnation actions though reportedly this practice is very rare section 205 of hr 701hp and 207 of hr 401scr using different legislative language directed the two secretaries in preparing their lists of proposed acquisitions to identify opportunities for consolidating holdings identify opportunities for land excha nges and permanent easements as alternatives to acquisitions the house version established acquisition priorities based on several specified considerations while the senate version relied on best professional judgement section 205 of hr 701hp required both secretaries to submit list of lands eligible for disposal in appropriate land management plans when they submit their acquisition priorities to congress the list of disposable lands would have to be updated as land management plans are updated this provision offered by representative doolittle as an amendment during committee markup would have provided an annual opportunity to partially offset higher rate of acquisition by requiring that federal agencies produce list of lands under their control for which there is demonstrated compelling program need that could be traded or sold hr 701scr did not have similar provision hr 701hp contained numerous other provisions that laid out in considerable detail the procedures envir onmental analyses public participation specified notifications and other processes that federal agencies would have followed when they were using cara funds to acquire land nonetheless these provisions did not assuage property rights advocates who continued to voice their concerns in sum hr 701hp offered package of protections to property owners that exceed those available in current law and the house version was somewhat stronger than the senate version these protections might have been offset by authorizing more funds for federal acquisitions under the lwcf but funding levels would still have been controlled through the appropriations process in both bills nonetheless hr 701hp and hr 701scr were opposed by several groups concerned over possible increases in federal land acquisition and property rights issues ocs leasing and moratoria some environmental interests feare d that this legislation would provide incentives to expand ocs activit ies much of the ocs total acreage is currently subject to ban on new leasing and production because of concerns that sensitive marine and coastal environments could be damaged by ocsrelated activities with these bans in place leases currently can be offered only in the central and western gulf of mexico and few areas off alaska three separate restrictions on leasing in environmentally sensitive areas currently existhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs18 20preleasing involves all the planning activities and analysis that are conducted prior to offering tracts for lease these activities can take several years and are such large commitment of resources that some believe that it would be difficult as practical matter to halt the lease process by the time that the sale is scheduled or to halt development after the sale this has been central issue in numerous court cases and administrative appeals under the coastal zone management acts federal consistency provision which requires that all federal actions in or affecting the coastal zone be consistent with states program 21analogous situations have occurred in rural communities that are dependent on mining or timber activitieslegislative moratoria starting in fy1982 congress has included language in each annual interior appropriations bill prohibiting the expenditure of funds for preleasing or leasing activity in designated environmentally sensitive areas20 in general congress has expanded the size of areas affected by this language from year to year administrative directive in 1990 president bush barred the executive branch from conducting leasing or preleasing work on lands under legislative moratoria until 2000 in 1998 president clinton extended that ban until 2012 interior department 5year leasing plan the minerals management service designates all tracts that may be offered for lease in 5 year plans each plan includes schedule of major steps leading up to each anticipated lease and description of areas proposed for leasing the current plan runs through 2002 the process of developing the 5 year plan while not an actual ban is used to decide where leasing will occur hr 701hp addressed the moratorium issue in 312 by defining qualified outer conti nental shelf revenues so as to exclude revenues from tracts in areas subject to moratorium on january 1 1999 unless the lease was issued before the moratorium was established and was in production on january 1 1999 the senate version was nearly the same but the deadlines are one year later in 2000 central concern was that these bills might undermine support for offshore moratoria by creating constituency that desired or became accustomed to receiving ocs moneys were the ocs revenue stream to decline to the point that the authorized activities could not have been fully funded those accustomed to receiving funding might have sought replenishment by supporting leasing of tracts that had been offlimits to development supporters of the underfunded programs and projects could come together as new proleasing constituencies21 some held that the three approaches to moratoria already provided ample protection against leasing environmentally sensitive tracts it was also asserted that producers interest in ocs tracts is limited to those that can be economically develop ed for wouldbe producers environmental opposition is an economic drawback as well as political and public relations liability others countered that the moratoria while occurring in three places would be only temporary having nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs19 22the fy2000 appropriation was 135 million full funding for pilt would have required 3037 million in fy1999 the most recent year for which an estimate is available 23total annual and permanent appropriations under existing law for rrsf were 165 million in fy2000 full funding for rrsf would have required 279 million in fy2000 the most recent year for which an estimate is available 24cbo hrept 106499 part i p 50 estimates that about 53 million is the amount that would be available in fy2002 for discretionary spending for these two programs combinedpermanent basis in law and new administration or congressional makeup could lead to change funding for county payments section 5d of hr 701hp provided that pilt matching funds from cara would be available if the annual appropriation for pilt under the regular appropriations bill exceeded 100 million22 thus if congress appropriated 99 million for pilt cara funds would have been spent if it appropriated 135 million for pilt then an additional 135 million would have been spent from cara for pilt matching for rrsf cara matching funds would be available only if funds from other sources exceeded 15 million23 if the total from the other sources were 15 million cara would have provided an additional 15 million in matching money however the cara addon could not have brought the total spending on either program above the authorization level for that program these levels were 301 million for pilt and 28 million for rrsf in fy1999 if the cara addon would have provided more funding than authorized under either rrsf or pilt for that year the excess funds would have been available first for the other program rrsf or pilt and second for other cara programs the entire 200 million available under 5d was not likely to be sufficient to provide for the full payment for these two programs in the future if amounts made available in annual appropriations bills remained at current levels24 this insufficiency would have been exacerbated because pilt requires annual adjustments in its formula to compensate for inflation table 3 shows the result that would have occurred in fy1999 the most recent fiscal year for which full data are available for both programs had 5d of hr 701hp been in effect as shown in the table rrsf would have been funded at 100 of the formula and pilt would have been funded at 848 of its formula because of the fundin g mechanism found in the house bill both the amount appropriated in the annual appropriations bill plus the cara addon would have been counted as discretionary spending under the budget act and both would therefore have been scored under the 302b allocations for the interior appropriations subcommittees thus as practical matter it is unclear whether cara would have resulted in any additional spending for pilt or rrsf as the program was proposed in hr 701hp hr 701scr in 2b15 and 2c and d would have appropriated such sums as may be necessary to fund the pilt program to the full authorized amount it contained funds for rrsf see table 3 for the effects if hr 701scr had been law in fy1999 it should be noted that rrsf is under the jurisdiction of ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs20 different senate committee and the omission may well reflect desire to avoid jurisdictional dispute rather than an oppositi on to full funding of the much smaller rrsf if so the rrsf provisions of the house might have prevailed if the bill had reached conference this funding would have been considered discretionary due to 2f of the senate bill therefore the actual appropriation would have been subject to many of the same constraints it now is table

amoun t authorized in the formula the additional 5328000 was therefore made available to the pilt portion of the cara fund match b cara provide direct match of 125 million since this results in 250 million still less than the full authorized amount in the formula then the surplus of 5328000 from rrsf would have been transferred to pilt the total 255328000 would have left pilt funded at 848 of the authorized amount for fy1999 rather than at 410 as actually occurred c since the funds would be discretionary both for the annual appropriation and the cara addon availability of the entire amount would have depended on action by congress each year d in this version the entire authorized level for pilt would have been funded by cara but these funds would have been subject to appropriation per

through its lands legacy initiative first announced in january 1999 it then included these proposals in its fy2000 and fy2001 budget submissions from the first year to the second the programs included in this initiative changed somewhat and the total amount requested increased some of these proposals would have required authorization as well as appropriations but draft legislative language accompanied the proposals either year in fy2000 the initiative was not directly linked to the cara proposals but in fy2001 it replaced cara after it became clear that cara legislation would not be enacted fy2000 the clinton administration sought increases for more than 20 line items in the budgets of three departments the funding would have provided more than 1 billion divided among the department of the interior doi579 million the department of agriculture usda268 million and the department of commerces national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 183 million this would have been total increase of 540 million from fy1999 funding for these programs congress rejected many of these proposals and partially funded most others in total it provided 727 million for these programs an increase of 268 million from fy1999 the house and senate interior appropriations committees both opposed the initiative the house listed several troubling aspects of the proposal in the committee report drafted but not filed noting that most of the funds would not go to federal agencies that large federal maintenance backlog would not be addressed and that some funds would be spent on purposes that are not related to the lwcf activities of the federal agencies the senate appropriations committee commented in its report s rept 10699 that funding the proposals would change the purposes of the lwcf in many ways the committee stated that minority of the lwcf funding would be spent for purposes currently funded through it and called for authorizing these changes before funds were appropriated the report also stated that the committee supported many existing programs that the administration proposed increased funding for but at lower funding levels while the normal appropriations process did not result in substantial funding for the clinton administration proposal s negotiations on the consolidated appropriations for fy2000 hr 3194 which combined five appropriations bills that were not enacted individually resulted in providing an additional 1975 million to implement aspects of the lands legacy initiative in separate subtitle vi of the interior appropriations most of these funds were for land acquisition the forest service located in the agriculture department but funded in the interior appropriations received 81 million of which 61 million was allocated to the baca ranch acquisition and 5 million to the forest legacy progra m agencies in the department of the interior received the remaining 1165 million with 20 million earmarked to the lwcf state grant program 5 million for maintenan ce in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs51 national park system 10 million for restoring the elwha river ecosystem up to 35 million for state grants for land acquisition in florida up to 195 million to acquire mineral rights in the grand staircaseescalante national monument up to 5 million to protect the california desert and up to 2 million to protect the rhode island national wildlife refuge complex the legislation also requires that expenditures of the remaining unearm arked funds 15 million for the forest service and at least 20 million for the department of the interior agencies must be approved by the house and senate appropriations committees before they could occur the list of proposals was submitted in december and the funds were released in early 2000 the state grant program under the lwcf received 40 million for fy2000 from the regular appropriation and the title vi appropriation combined plus 1 million for program administration this program had not been funded since fy1995 and states and localities had been actively seeking these funds on february 14 the administration announced the distribution of funds the press release noted that states must match these funds and that they could be used to acquire land or easements but did not mention that they also could be used for development california received the most money almost 32 million the next highest state was texas with slightly less than 1 million wyoming received the least 341000 fy2001 the administration slightly revised the components of its initiative in fy2001 replacing three programs with three others it sought an overall increase of 673 million to 14 billion added programs included coastal impact assistance fund the pacific salmon recovery fund and grants to states for nongame wildlife all programs that would have been funded through various cara proposals the proposal would have provided 735 million to doi 429 million to noaa and 236 million to usda as in fy2000 authorizing legislation was included with the package more specifically the lands legacy initiative as proposed in fy2001 would fund federal land acquisition through the lwcf including lands in southern californi the new jerseynew york watershed florida everglades civil war battlefields the lewis and clark trail lower mississippi river delta the northern forest and the chesapeake bay watershed the cost would be 450 million an increase of 25 million provide grants to states and localities to acquire land through the stateside grant program under the lwcf funding for development projects would be limited the cost would be 150 million an increase of 109 million provide matching grants to states through the department of the interior to develop open space and smart growth management strategies the cost would be 50 million this proposal went unfunded last year initiate new revolving loan fund at the department of agriculture to support acquisition of land and easements in rural areas based on smart growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs52 principles the cost would be 6 million this program was not authorized last year expand funding for other programs including the cooperative endangered species conservation fund the forest legacy progra m urban and community forestry program grants the north american wetlands conservation fund and state nongame wildlife grants the cost would be 295 million increase of 196 million provide matching grants and technical assistance for the restoration of parks in economicallydistressed urban areas under the urban parks and recreation recovery program the cost would be 20 million an increase of 18 million increase funding for the marine sanctuaries program to strengthen protection at the 12 designated sites the cost would be 35 million an increase of 10 million from fy2000 increase funding through matching grants for state coastal zone management programs help states and communities address the significant and costly impacts of growing population polluted runoff and deteriorating coastal habitats the cost would be 157 million an increase of 95 million improve management at the 25 sites in the estuarine research reserve system the cost would be 20 million an increase of 8 million expand noaa program to prote ct coral reefs from pollution and other human impacts restore injured reefs and develop coral nursery the cost would be 15 million an increase of 9 million enact new coastal impact assistance program to fund efforts to minimize environmental risks from coastal development the cost would be 100 million increase support for the pacific coastal salmon recovery fund which helps states local government and tribes undertake fishery recovery activities the cost would be 100 million an increase of 42 million congress initia lly responded through the regular appropriations process by providing much less funding than the clinton administration had requested in the interior and commerce appropriations funding bills for example the administration requested 450 million for federal land acquisition under the lwcf but the house provided 184 million and the senate appropriations commit tee provided 180 million for table comparing the fy2000 request the fy2000 appropriation and the fy2001 request by program see crs report rs20471 the administrations lands legacy initiative in the fy2001 budget proposal fact sheet as congress was finishing its actions on the fy2001 interior appropriations however congressional appropriators and the administration reached an agreement to fund the lands legacy initiative for 6 years through the annual appropriations process members of congress described this agreement as shorter and less expensive alternative to cara the interior appropriations conference committee added new title viii on land conservation with two parts one part of this title provides 686 million for lands legacy programs in fy2001 in addition to what is already provided in the normal agency appropriations for these programs making the total appropriation for these programs 12 billion the amount is divided as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30444crs53 540 million for federal and state lwcf 300 million for state and other conservation programs 160 million for urban and historic preservation programs 150 million for public land maintenance and facility rehabilitation and 50 million for the paymentinlieuoftaxes program an additional 400 million to fund noaa programs in fy2001 only is provided through commerce appropriations and discussed below the second part proposes to fund these programs increasing the total amount by 200 million annually for the next 5 years interior and commerce programs could receive total of up to 12 billion over the 6 years however all funds each year will have to be provided through the annual appropriations process none of the funding is mandatory as supporters of cara had sought to protect these funds from being used for other purposes the legislation uses what proponents characterize as fencing structure to separate these funds from other interior appropriations and to separate each of the five categories listed above from each other this fencing structure applies only to the first 16 billion and would not apply to any increases in future years also any funds not appropriated in one year could be appropriated in subsequent year the fy2001 commerce appropriations do not contain any provisions that are comparable to this second part the agreement however called for an additional 400 million to be provided for coastal and marine programs in fy2001 in the commerce appropriations the language in title ix of pl 106554 actually provides 420 million the fy2001 funding would be divided as follows 150 million for coastal impact assistance 135 million for ocean coastal and conservation programs all earmarked and 135 million for national oceanic and atmospheric administration programs noaa is to submit spending plan for these funds to the appropriations committees by february 28 2001
