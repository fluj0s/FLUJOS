part ii french implementation and african reactions ref paris 1501 classified by political ministercounselor kathleen allegrone 14 b d 1 c summary frances new africa policy has received mixed reviews from africans uncertain as france moves away from the franceafrique model some africans seem to accept the outlines of the new policy some have expressed misgivings about replacing the familiar with the unknown and some have pushed back with the french having to make their own adjustments in both tone and substance meanwhile the french continue to refine their policy and to implement it with few notable stumbles along the way such as the bockel case involving gabon they have tried to give fresh impetus to difficult relations with countries such as angola rwanda djibouti and madagascar with mixed results in broader terms the french are also working to put in place revamped structures particularly their military presence in africa part iii septel to reflect the new policy end summary 2 c reftel describes franceafrique the model that dominated frances africa policy for most of the 20th century believing that globalization the fading of colonial and postcolonial sensibilities and economic and political realities called for new model president nicolas sarkozy initiated change soon after taking office in may 2007 he announced new policy based on transparency accountability armslength dealings calculation of interests and dialogue among equals he sought to strip relations of what he viewed as sentimental and historical relics of the colonial era which had stifled relations and fostered an unhealthy cycle of dependency and paternalism both sides would henceforth conduct relations crisply efficiently and openly this cable discusses african reactions to sarkozys policy and french steps to implement it part iii septel focuses on structural changes the french are making as part of the new policy centered on frances military presence in africa preelection image problems 3 c sarkozys new africa policy may have been disquieting change in course for africans yet not surprise to them many africans were wary of sarkozy before he took office as interior minister job he held twice under president chirac sarkozy was well known for his nononsense lawandorder views at interior sarkozy made remarks that raised flags about his sensitivity toward frances minorities particularly those with origins in africa either the maghreb or subsaharan africa in june 2005 after the killing of young boy in troubled paris suburb with high number of minorities sarkozy said he would clean the area out with karcher referring to german highpressure waterhose cleaner at the time of the november 2005 riots in france sarkozy described the rioters as voyous thugs and racaille scum rabble the latter term generating strong critical responses from frances minorities and from others worried about their interior ministers and possible next presidents views on ethnic issues immigration and africa 4 c sarkozy compounded these concerns during visit to mali and benin in may 2006 as interior minister shortly before the trip he had proposed changes in frances immigration laws which became the focal point of his visits and prompted demonstrations against him in both countries malians and beninois perceived as antiafrican his proposals for tightening the system then in place during the trip sarkozy contrasted his vision of relations with africa with that of chirac and defended his immigration bill as harbinger of new relationship with africa cleaned up simplified and balanced away from the slag of the past in benin on may 19 2006 he stated we must get rid of this network from another time these officious emissaries who have mandate other than the one they invent for paris 00001568 002 of 007 themselves the normal functioning of institutions should prevail over the officious networks that have produced so much that is bad africans criticized the substance of his immigration proposals while the french press noted archly that sarkozy was obviously campaigning for the presidency and saying things normally within the french presidents proper domain 5 c immigration remains an important subtheme to sarkozys africa policy and is one of the hottest of hotbutton issues in france advocates of stricter controls fear the prospect of floods of eastern europeans and migrants from all corners of africa the arab world and the mediterranean entering france and then benefiting from its generous social programs and taking jobs without assimilating and becoming french subsaharan africans are visible and to some french an unwelcome presence in frances urban areas with much social commentary from left and right on their longterm effect and their ability to integrate and assimilate some wonder whether french national sports team can really be french with so many players of arab or african origin notwithstanding the recent successes of french teams of diverse origins 6 c upon becoming president sarkozy installed close associate brice hortefeux as minister of immigration integration national identity and codevelopment ministry that had never previously existed combining issues relating to immigration integration and especially national identity into single executive body raised eyebrows among some observers who believed that creating such ministry not only indicated the priority sarkozy placed on these matters but also carried overtones of the appeal sarkozy made to rightwing nationalist voters ie pens national front camp during the final stages of his campaign duel with socialist segolene royal 7 c sarkozy and hortefeux have emphasized the benefits that reformed immigration policy would provide africans the french have concluded agreements with several african countries establishing new procedures one such agreement is with gabon concluded on july 5 2007 during visit by hortefeux the accord 1 facilitates travel between the two countries by business persons professionals family members and those with medical needs 2 enlarges employment possibilities for gabonese in certain professions desiring to establish themselves in france 3 extends residency permits for french in gabon to five years 4 prescribes procedures for treating clandestine entrants and 5 increases bilateral cooperation in countering fraudulent documents the agreement which on its face provides advantages to both sides nonetheless became part of francegabon spat that included other issues as described later in this message 8 c some africans have disapproved of another part of sarkozys immigration policy the program to test dna to verify kinship as basis for immigration legislation for such program was initiated when sarkozy was at interior and has since been enacted after overcoming legal and political obstacles african reaction has been negative with one article from mali in october 2007 capturing africans dismay we have known since the second world war after the success of our ancestors the senegalese riflemen in the liberation of france from the hands of nazi germany that our compatriots along with so many other africans have longer been welcome on the banks of the seine but to go so far as to examine the blood of people to control the migratory flow represents an unqualified case of cynicism and lowers france to the level of nations where racism gains more and more ground 9 c the dna testing program appears to be going forward in june 2008 hortefeux announced during visit to cape verde that france would begin its first pilot program there in september cape verde is one of nine countries with angola bangladesh cameroon dominican republic ghana guinea madagascar and pakistan where france plans to start paris 00001568 003 of 007 the program in the september 2008 timeframe cape verde authorities reportedly responded that they took note of this demarche of consultation but chose not to comment on this unilateral french decision hortefeux said that our new immigration policy is understood and shared by our african friends dakar july 2007 10 c with his stints at interior his provocative remarks and the outline of this new immigration policy as backdrops sarkozy went to dakar in july 2007 he had just won favorable reviews for organizing an international conference on darfur in june one of his first acts as president which ostensibly demonstrated his interest in africa on july 26 at the university of dakar he delivered the first of three speeches outlining frances new africa policy he did so carrying fair amount of baggage certain to face skeptical if not hostile audience consistent with his aggressive image he gave hardhitting speech which as noted reftel was written by special advisor henri guaino and not cleared through normal mfa and presidency channels the dakar speech is worth examining because it was the public introduction to africans on their turf of both sarkozy as president and of the policies he planned to pursue that the speech was not vetted by gof staff perhaps lends it an air of authenticity that would have been absent had it been sanitized 11 c in the dakar speech sarkozy said i did not come to erase the past which cant be erased i did not come to deny either the faults or the crimes for there were faults and crime i have come to propose to the youth of africa not to have you forget this tearing apart and this suffering which cannot be forgotten but to have you overcome and surpass them africa bears its share of responsibility for its own unhappiness people have been killing each other in africa at least as much as they have in europe europeans came to africa as conquerors they took the land and your ancestors they banned the gods the languages the beliefs the customs of your fathers they told your fathers what they should think what they should believe what they should do they cut your fathers from their past they stripped them of their souls and roots they disenchanted africa 12 c sarkozy said that the colonist took but i want to say with respect that he also gave he constructed bridges roads hospitals dispensaries schools he rendered virgin land fertile he gave his effort his work his knowledge i want to say here that not all the colonists were thieves not all the colonists were exploiters colonization is not responsible for all of africas current difficulties it is not responsible for the bloody wars africans carry out with each other it is not responsible for the genocides it is not responsible for the dictators it is not responsible for fanaticism it is not responsible for the corruption for the lies it is not responsible for the waste and pollution the problem of africa and permit as friend of africa to say it is there the challenge for africa is to enter more into history it is to draw from within itself the energy the strength the desire the willpower to listen to and to espouse its own history the problem of africa is to stop always repeating to stop always trotting out to free itself from the myth of the eternal return to understand that the golden age which africa never stops longing for will never come back because it never existed 13 c many african critics viewed the speech as condescending and paternalistic two aspects of franceafrique sarkozy said he wanted to banish prominent africans faulted sarkozys ideas including thenau commission chairperson konare who said this speech was not the kind of speech we were hoping for it reminded us of another age especially his comment about peasants konare was referring to passage that critics found paris 00001568 004 of 007 especially demeaning the drama of africa is that the african man has not entered enough into history the african peasant for millennia lives with the seasons where the ideal life is to be in harmony with nature and he knows only the eternal recycling of time marked by the rhythm of repetition without end of the same gestures and the same words in this imagination where everything always recycles there is place for either human adventure or for the idea of progress 14 c south africa president mbeki one of the few african leaders to react favorably reportedly wrote to sarkozy what you have said in dakar mr president indicates to that we are fortunate to count on you as citizen of africa as partner in the protracted struggle to achieve the renaissance of africa within the context of european renaissance and the rest of the world perhaps not coincidentally sarkozy chose cape town as the site for the third speech in his africa policy series to the dismay of francophone africa identified south africa as strategic partner and upon frances assuming the eu presidency in july 2008 sponsored as one of the presidencys initial acts the first eusouth africa summit in bordeaux on july 25 as presidential advisor romain serman has observed one of sarkozys operating principles is reward the good punish the bad reining him in and slowing him down 15 c after dakar sarkozy went to gabon where elder statesman and franceafrique supporter president bongo received him with full honors sarkozy reportedly hesitated before going visiting franceafrique stronghold site of french military base and source of valuable commerce especially petroleum could smack of the oldstyle courting and role playing he claimed he wanted to forego in the end he relented omar bongo is the dean of african heads of state and in africa being the dean that counts bongo offered full pomp and circumstance with festive crowds chanting vive france vive sarkozy vive lamitie francogabonaise and banners proclaiming this friendship prominently displayed to some observers the message was clear you say that franceafrique is thing of the past but if africans really are equal partners we have some say in the matter as well and we say that franceafrique is not in all respects so bad sarkozy reportedly did not expect that kind of visit or that bongo would offer different reality 16 c sarkozy has in other ways shown himself to be out of step with his bedside manner needing finetuning presidential advisor remi marechaux says that when sarkozy is confident on substance or at ease with an interlocutor he speaks freely without relying on briefing material this occasionally causes problems when he strays from official policy with others then steering the discussion back on course when he is less familiar with an issue or with an interlocutor he will read talking points verbatim with little attempt to disguise what he is doing sometimes thumbing through briefing books looking for information while his interlocutor is speaking 17 c sarkozy does not like to waste time and likes to get to the point perhaps to excess when president obiang of equatorial guinea met with sarkozy in november 2007 support staff on both sides were tardy in settling into place sarkozy did not wait and launched into his talking points as the staff filed into the meeting sarkozy engaged in small talk and the meeting was over in minutes to the bewilderment of his visitors our contacts at the presidency indicate sarkozy has since made an effort to be more diplomatic but one wonders whether he would ever dare to treat western head of state in such cursory manner under any circumstances 18 c flush with his early success at helping liberate bulgarian medical workers long detained in libya on dubious paris 00001568 005 of 007 charges sarkozy decided to intervene personally in chad after the zoes ark effort to smuggle supposed darfur orphans to france was discovered and the perpetrators detained sarkozy went to chad early in november 2007 and negotiated the release of some of the detainees after returning to paris he thought of going there again to free those still in custody but decided against it he was advised not to make second trip as france could not afford having him set precedent by personally rushing off and responding to and managing relatively lowlevel crisis chad president deby doubt appreciated the visit sarkozy did make which probably increased chads leverage as sarkozy had put his own prestige in play bongo up bockel down franceafrique still kicking 19 c jeanmarie bockel became state secretary for cooperation and francophonie reporting to the foreign minister when sarkozy took office bockel socialist is veteran politician and mulhouses mayor since 1989 and was commerce minister 19841986 on january 15 2008 he gave an interview to paris daily monde stating boldly and perhaps rashly that i want to sign the death certificate of franceafrique asked why it seemed that not much had changed despite sarkozys promise of new africa policy bockel said franceafrique is moribund its not question of morale but helping with development for because of the faulty governance in certain countries our policy of cooperation despite its many forms doesnt allow for progress commensurate with our effort 20 c continuing bockel said that ineffectiveness prevailed because bad governance the wastage of public finds the carelessness of certain administrative and political structures the predation of certain leaders everybody knows these factors or supposes them in total of usd 100 billion annually in aid for africa usd 30 billion evaporates certain countries have important petroleum resources but their populations dont benefit is it legitimate that our aid is distributed to countries that waste their own resources we must reexamine conditionalities to evaluate the effectiveness of our aid 21 c bockels comments did not sit well with some africans notably gabon president bongo slowmoving french judicial investigation of the holdings in france of certain african leaders among them bongo was in progress even before sarkozy went there in july 2007 the investigation reportedly indicated that bongo owned or was involved in the ownership of 33 properties in france including paris mansion valued at 18 million euro currently about usd 2715 million the french press picked up this case and did some investigating and reporting of its own the gabonese took umbrage with their mfa stating its intention to reflect on the course of francogabonese relations and mentioning cabal and plot against gabon and its president 22 c relations took turn for the worse when early in march 2008 france expelled two gabonese for apparent visaresidency problems gabon immediately responded noting that there are many french in gabon in irregular situations they can be taken to the border if during police controls they dont justify their presence with proper documentation gabon then raised the reciprocity provisions of the immigration accord signed the previous july 7 above the noise level mostly on gabons side increased 23 c and then the noise suddenly stopped after the march 18 announcement that bockel would longer be secretary of state for cooperation and francophonie to be replaced by alain joyandet although officially denied it was commonly accepted that bockel had to go in order to make peace with figures such as bongo media reports on the french holdings of african leaders also seemed to disappear at that time and so did the investigations for his part paris 00001568 006 of 007 bockel issued regrets about anything i said statement as he trundled off to his new job as secretary of state for veterans affairs 24 c the bockel case is significant because it shows that killing franceafrique is easier said than done that franceafrique has life of its own with vested interests on the african side that the french perhaps underestimated when deciding on the new policy that african leaders can manipulate franceafrique for their own ends as well as the french can or could that clever skillful leader like bongo can fight far above gabons weight and humble french politician of bockels stature and that france should take care in not trifling with africans which is what sarkozy said in dakar that france would longer do bold talk of signing franceafriques death certificate ended with bockels departure and has not resurfaced bongo made his point wins losses draws and 25 c sarkozy indicated that implementation of his new policy would take place on clean slate that he would not be prisoner of the past or the problems that existed prior to his presidency bongo partly refuted that notion the sarkozy government has tried to improve problematic relations from earlier times with only limited success angola relations were long frozen because of the falcone affair the complex arms trafficking case that dates to the mitterrand and chirac eras french commercial activities in angola after the scandal broke have continued without much hindrance but political relations have been very limited frustrated that the falcone issue continued to influence relations and with an eye toward expanding business with resourcerich angola sarkozy broke the ice with short meeting with president dos santos during the september 2007 unga and followed up with visit to angola on may 23 2008 one shared issue of concern is the trial in france of some 42 defendants including highprofile figures such as jeanchristophe mitterrand president mitterrands and former mr africa at the presidency and what that trial may reveal in terms of angolan culpability in the affair angolans now appear ready to handle whatever dirty laundry the trial brings to light although still at an early stage sarkozys outreach to angola seems promising and should be considered win for both sides rwanda relations precarious even before the 1994 genocide collapsed in november 2006 when thenanti terrorism judge bruguiere issued an investigative report that implicated president kagame and other senior rwandans in the events of 1994 the rwandans immediately broke relations with france the french have since tried to improve relations arguing that neither side should hold the other hostage over events dating to 1994 and before they stress that frances judiciary ie judge such as bruguiere enjoys an independence that renders it immune from internal gof attempts to influence it seeking reconciliation foreign minister kouchner met with president kagame on january 26 2008 in kigali despite french optimism that the two sides can compartmentalize the genocide issue rwanda is not amenable to doing so landing another hammer blow with the august 2008 report accusing french officials at the highest levels of complicity in the genocide with relations getting worse and not better rwanda must be considered loss djibouti the borrel affair involving the 1995 death of french judge bernard borrel who was working on assignment in djibouti when he committed suicide or was killed continues to cloud relations both sides long considered his death suicide but mrs borrel was convinced he was murdered for having found evidence of djiboutian wrongdoing she filed several legal proceedings in france one resulted in the march 2007 conviction in absentia of two senior djiboutian figures for witness tampering paris 00001568 007 of 007 djibouti contd despite periodic upheavals the two sides managed to isolate the case until the convictions which took place few weeks before sarkozys inauguration soon after becoming president sarkozy met with mrs borrel and the gof abruptly shifted position saying that borrels death was not suicide but the result of foul play it is not clear if the shift stemmed from new evaluation of the evidence or from sarkozys desire to ally himself with mrs borrel whom the french public and media have viewed sympathetically djiboutians protested countering that borrel if not suicide died because of involvement in pedophile ring relations seemed destined to deteriorate but then france provided important help to djibouti during its june 2008 border dispute with eritrea frances military base in djibouti so far has not been bargaining chip in the borrel case relations with djibouti while delicate seem to be holding in place with both sides enjoying draw that said the borrel issue remains unresolved and its unfolding will likely continue to affect relations madagascar to these wins losses and draws one must add an abject surrender sarkozys agreeing to madagascar president ravalomananas recent request that thenambassador to madagascar gildas lidec be replaced after some six months at post ravalomanana reportedly thought that lidec was unlucky citing negative developments in other countries that coincided with lidecs postings one of frances most experienced diplomats lidec had been ambassador in japan cambodia car drc and cote divoire before madagascar where he announced his departure at this years july 14 fete when asked most gof contacts shake their heads and sigh making muted comments about sarkozys bending backward too far to placate ravalomanana and ending veteran public servants honorable career by humiliating him whether lidecs dismissal represents oneoff or signals newfound intention on sarkozys part to please african leaders remains to be seen one year later 26 c over year into sarkozys fiveyear term his africa policy has yielded positive results for both french and africans but has not been the cleansweeping out with the old in with the new success he was first seeking in our view he underestimated the scope of the challenge and overestimated his abilities as relative outsider bringing his fabled dynamism to the task he was tonedeaf to some of the dynamics developed over decades of franceafrique and his pace and rhythm let alone his policies did not accord with that of many african counterparts in saying openly that he wanted to end franceafrique sarkozy inadvertently gave it new spark of life as bockel learned the hard way 27 c nonetheless the energy that sarkozy is imparting stands in favorable contrast to the stagnation characterizing africa policy during chiracs final years sarkozys main shortcoming concerning africa may be that in his haste to end an admittedly shopworn policy he launched himself into doing so without having completely integrated the lessons that were to be learned from it 28 c part iii the final segment of this series septel will explore other aspects of frances implementation of its new africa policy focusing on its military posture in that
