member states to consider creating special force for peacekeeping operationsina january 1995 report he proposed that the consider establishing strategicreserve rapid reaction force rrf perh aps of battalionsized units to deploy when emergency needs for peacekeeping troops aris they would be stationed in their home countries but would be trained to the standards use the same operating procedures and equipment participate in regular joint exercises and otherwise be maintained at high state of readiness in order to respond quickly to call fortheir deployment although proposals for force dedicated to peace operations were made by former presidents bush and reagan and by presidential candidate william jclinton the clinton administration backed away from the concept in its may 1994 presidential decision directive 25 pdd25 the administration stated that theunited states does not support standing u n army the c linton administration supported however the establishment of the standby forces system through which member states formally commit i ndividuals and units to be provided within specified period of request for p eacekeeping assistance in order to enable the to structure peacekeeping forces mo re effectively the united states has not earmarked troops in advance for the sy stem but has provided list of specific military capabilities that could be made available for peacekeeping operations the secretarygenerals rrf proposal raises many concerns among member states particularly whether it is politically desirable and financiallyfeasible february 1995 consensus statem ent of the security council on the secretarygenerals report did not specifi cally mention the rapid reaction force proposal it stressed the importance of improving the capacity of the for rapiddeployment and reinforcement of operations and stated that the first priorityshould be the further enhancement of the existing standby arrangements there are many factors and problems to be considered in creating an effective oncall rapid reaction force among these are how to provide effective command and control intelligence collection and processing and adequate costeffective logistics support for the united states there are broad strategicbudgetary political and military implications as well the clinton administration has opposed the idea of rrf because it would reduce the flexibility of us strategic planning and could compromise the united states ability to respond toother crises the united states might be called upon to bear significant part of the cost of maintaining rrf which could be high but must be weighed against savings that might accrue from have force to deploy before conflict escalates and becomes more costly to contain among the domestic political considerations ofestablishing an rrf is the possible re duction of congressional and other domestic input into the decisionmaking process on peacekeeping operations among theissues for the us military is whether the would rely on the united statesunique lift capabilities to deploy the rrfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95787abstract this report completed in june 1995 discusses the content and context of the

has provoked renewed scrutiny of cap abilities to promote global peace and security in the early 1990s similar proposals for creating forcededicated to peace operations were made by president george bush formerpresident ronald reagan and pres idential candidate william clinton 1 the concept of special force appealed to us policymakers at that time as means toshare the burden with other nations for dealing with conflicts and promoting international stability as questions were raised about the united nations ability toserve us interests in conducting peacekeeping operations the clinton administration backed away from the concept in its may 1994 presidentialdecision directive 25 pdd25 the admini stration stated that the united states does not support standing army nor will we earmark specific us military units for participation in operations nevertheless members of congress have raised questions about the proposal this report was written to provide background on the proposal and

past two years there have been number of significant delays in placing forces in the field after the council had set up or expanded the mandate and size of an operation for example on feb 5 1993 the security council in sres806 1993increased the mandate of the iraqkuwait observer mission unikom and expandedthe size of the operation to include three infa ntry battalions one infantry battalion was not fully deployed until january 1994 nearly year laterthe proposal history context content and rationale2 in report issued in early january 1995 secretarygeneral boutros boutrosghali invited international attenti on to the idea of creating rapid reaction force that would be on call to the united nations3 in single short paragraph the secretarygeneral proposed that the united nations consider establishing strategicreserve rapid reaction force of units perhaps of battalion size to deploy whenemergency needs for peacekeeping troops arise they would be contributed by anunspecified number of countries and would be trained to the same standards use the same operating procedures be equipped with integrated communications equipmentand participate in joint exercises at regular intervals they would be stationed in their home countries but maintained at hi gh state of readiness secretarygeneral boutrosghali recognized that rapid reaction force would be complicated andexpensive arrangement but argued that the time had come to undertake it 4 secretarygeneral boutrosghali stated that he had concluded that the united nations does need to give serious thought to the idea after his problems in mounting an expanded assistance mission in rwanda mandated by the security councilin may 1994 none of the 19 governments that had agreed to have troops available on standby basis see next section agreed to contribute forces for rwanda 5 in proposing the rapid reaction force boutrosghali specifically stated that it would be used for peacekeeping missions the term peacekeeping is sometimes used as generic term for many types of peace operations with wide range of risk but for the united nations it has come to acquire specific meaning as

parties concerned to create and maintain conditions conducive to political settlement by the partiesin conflict these are generally viewed as relatively safe operations in contrast to peace enforcement operations which take place in situations where not all parties have agreed to presence see ppendix i for definitions of peacekeeping and other types of peace operations the c linton administration views the secretary generals terminology and intent as limiting the use of the proposed rapid reactionforce to the traditional peacekeeping operations from the context of the proposal in the secretarygenerals report other states may interpret the proposeduses of the force differently the january 1995 document is the first major report in which secretarygeneral boutrosghali has supported rapid reac tion force by name in two proposals contained in his june 1992 report an ag enda for peace he recommended security council action that might have resulted in rapid reaction forcetype capability 6 first in an effort to secure the ready availability of armed forces on call boutrosghali recommended that the security counc il initiate the negotiations called for in article 43 of the charter to make special agreements with member states to provide the security council with armed forces assistance and facilities on apermanent basis such agreements would enable the council to take military action under chapter vii article 42 of the charter to maintain or restore internationalpeace and security 7 boutrosghali expected these forces would respond to outright aggression imminent or actual but predicte d they were not likely to be available for some time to come his second proposal sought to respond to the more likely situation in which ceasefire had been agreed to but not complied with this case might require alarger force which he called peace enfor cement unit peu to assist or replace those engaged in monitoring the ceasefire secretarygeneral boutrosghalirecommended that the security council consider the use of such peaceenforcementunits in clearly defined circumstances and with their terms of reference specified inadvance peus available on call woul d consist of volunteer troops from member states who would be more heavily armed than peacekeeping forces and would needextensive preparatory training within their national forces deployment andoperation would be under the authority of the security council and under thecommand of the secretarygeneral while these proposals have been discusse d they have not mustered sufficient support for security council implementation instead the secretarygeneral hasfocused on the implementation of thir d proposal of his 1992 agenda for peace standby forces system httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95787crs4 8prepared by nina m serafino specia list in international security affairscurrent standby forces system8 the united nations is in the process of obtaining commitments from member states for individuals and units that they could make available for peacekeepingin short period of time developed si nce early 1993 by special planning team the standby forces system is intended to enab the united nations to design coherent forces for full peacekeeping operation which can number into the tens ofthousands participating states are expect ed to provide promised individuals and units within seven days to four weeks of request depending on their function units would be deployed for sixmont h period and individuals for one year member states would be able to decide on case by case basis whether to deploy these troops when requested as of early may 1995 41 countries had expressed their willingness to participate in standby arrangements with the united nations and two of them have entered into formal agreements at ast two countries the united states and germany have publicly announced they w ill not earmark troops in advance under the standby system initiative the total number of troops promised to the systemformally or informally may reach some 75000 when agreements are completedthose offered cover broad range of military specialties on jan 5 1995 jordanbecame the first country to sign formal standby arrangement agreement with theunited nations in its memorandum of understanding jordan pledged to earmark civilian and military specialists and civ ilian police to serve in united nations peacekeeping operations on may 9 1995 denmark became the second country toconclude memorandum of understanding pledging to provide military personnel and resources to assist the united nations in its planning under the standby arrangements system data base the united states has provided list of specific militarycapabilities that could be made available for peacekeeping operations theseinclude 1 strategic airlif t and sealift 2 logistics including logistics headquarters support 3 strategic communications medical engineer information intelligence and civil affairs and psychological operati ons support 4 contracting and contract management services and 5 personnel support for headquarters stafffunctions although the united states declined to formally commit troops to the standby forces system it endorsed the concept as it was being developed presidentialdecision directive 25 pdd25 of may 3 1994 which sets forth the clintonadministrations peace operations policy recommended that to eliminate lengthypotentially disastrous delays after mission has been authorized the united nationsestablish data base of specific pot entially available forces or capabilities that nations could provide for the full range of peacekeeping and humanitarianoperations pdd25 was issued mont h before the standby arrangements team presented its proposal to member states httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95787crs5 9prepared by marjorie ann browne sp ecialist in international relationsaccording to us officials the clinton administration has encouraged other countries to indicate available forces for inclusion in the data base with one caveatthe clinton administration cautions nations with which the united states has mutualsecurity agreements that any commitments they make to the united nations should not impair their ability to fulfill those agreements pdd25 also called for other arrangement s to speed the deployment of troops us and personnel are currently working on one recommendation thedevelopment of prenegotiated commercial contracts for logistics support and modestairlift capability for new missions in pre liminary planning stages are arrangements for trained civilian reserve corps to assi st in the administration management and execution of peace operations and professional peace operations training program another pdd25 recommendation was the establishment of rapidly deployable headquarters team the secretarygenerals proposal for standby rapid reaction force would seem to differ in two respects from the current standby arrangements system the first difference concerns the discretion that member states would have to deploytroops on casebycase basis participati on in the current system is voluntary with member states able to refuse to deploy for ces if they choose in his january report however secretarygeneral boutrosghali stat ed that the value of this arrangement the rapid reaction force would of course depend on how far the security councilcould be sure that the force would actually be available in an emergency thisseems to express an intent to make participation in rapid reaction forcemandatory with member states agreeing to relinquish their right to refuse to deploy if their forces are called upon the sec ond difference concerns size and purpose of the arrangement while the standby system provides data base for full range of peace operations the rapid reaction standby arrangement is intended to provide asmaller number of forces for immediate deployment for peacekeeping operations issues for the united nations9 the concept of standby rapid r eaction force regardless of how it might be translated into reality would rais number of concerns among member states the concept would be addressed by more than just the 15 members of theun security council because decisions about funding both rapid reaction force and the possible secretariat infrastructure accompanying it would be considered by the general assembly political acceptability for member states the fundamental issue falls under the rubric of article 2 paragraph 7 article 2 7 of the charter on nonintervention of theorganization in the internal or domestic jurisdiction of individual member states most governments do not view the united nations as separate independent andinterventionist world government but as t ool to protect their territorial integrityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95787crs6 10the following is based on review of the press release coverage of that debateand national sovereignty from intervention the question is whether member states want the security council body of 15 members to have automatic access towhat might be perceived as readymade army that might be used to intervene intheir affairs initial response of the security council on feb 22 1995 the president of the security council read statement setting forth the councils consensus views at the end of the first stage of its consideration of the secretarygenerals report the council did not refer to the rapidreaction force proposal but indicated that it shared the secretarygenerals concern on the availability of troops and equipment for peacekeeping operations it alsoreiterated the importance of improving the capacity of the united nations for rapiddeployment and reinforcement of operations the first priority in improving the capacity of rapid deployment the council stated should be the furtherenhancement of the existing standby arrangements on jan 1819 1995 42 members participated in security council discussion on the secretarygenerals report 10 representatives from 20 of those nations made some comment or reference to the rapid reaction force proposal the following comments illustrate the concerns that some members have withgranting the security council carte blanche authority over such an enterprise the indonesian representative for example speaking on behalf of the nonalignedmovement said that the idea required greater clarity concerning the scope andcircumstances under which rapid reaction force would be deployed theproposal he went on needed very careful sc rutiny of its cost implications and even more of the modality of its establishment and use of the need for consent before sucha force might be deployed and of its co mmand and control structure the russian delegate stated that the idea of such force would require very careful examination of number of issues in connection with the charter the honduran representative speaking on behalf of the central american countries noted that the central american countries favored creation of rapid reaction force and called for further clarification of the circumstances in whichsuch force would be deployed he continued the councils decisionmaking process should be as transparent as possible offering more opportunities for countries affected by the decisions to present their positions before the start of formalconsultations the brazil delegate doubted that agreement could easily be reached on the rapid reaction force nd would not favor creating one before its financial and other implications were thoroughly considered on the other hand the netherlands representative embraced the proposal mentioning that their foreign minister had ar gued in favor of such force with an all volunteer professional brigade at th service of the security council which could be rapidly deployed in crisis situation the latvian delegate welcomed theproposal observing that latvia estonia and lithuania were setting up jointpeacekeeping force called the baltbat he anticipated that baltbat couldbecome part of the rapid reaction forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95787crs7 11letter dated july 21 1994 from the secretarygeneral addressed to the president of the general assembly united nations document a48973 p 2 12statement by secretarygeneral boutros boutrosghali general assembly proceedings for wednesday oct 12 1994 28th meeting united nations document a49pv28 p 20financing questions two major financing questions are rais ed by the rapid reaction force proposal one is whether member states c ould reasonably be expected to pay for maintaining and deploying rapid reaction force the second is how it would befinanced current funding difficulties the united nations already has difficulties collecting funds from members for peacek eeping operations currently most peacekeeping operations are funded through special assessed accounts set up by the general assembly although payment of peacekeeping assessments is legal obligation under article 17 of the charte r members continue to pay late after 30 days of receipt of the bill or not at all at the end of 1994 105 members owed nearly 1282 billion in outstanding contributions to unpeacekeeping accounts for calendar year 1994 and prior years assessments this arrearage has affected the secretarygenerals ability to mount and conduct operations during july 1994 for example the cash flow situation for thepeacekeeping operations accounts was low enough to compel secretarygeneralboutrosghali to take number of em ergency measures to reduce or delay expenditure in the peacekeeping operations these included instructing all peace keeping missions to reduce expenditures to the maximum extent possible andpostponing all but the most urgent procur ement and all but the most essential recruitment 11 at that time secretarygeneral boutrosghali also halted reimbursements to troopcontributing countries major part of the budget for each operation is used to reimburse troop contributing countries as of aug 31 1994 the united nations owed about 1billion to some 70 states for their troop nd equipment contributions to peacekeeping missions 12 many of these countries cannot continue to fund their peacekeeping operations assessments and pay their soldiers participating in peacekeepingoperations for an unlimited time period without reimbursement thus when thesecretarygeneral seeks forces for another operation or to expand or provide forrotation for an already established operation he finds some countries reluctant torespond affirmatively potential source of funding especially for startup or expansion purposes is the peacekeeping reserve fund which was set up in december 1992 with an initialtarget of 150 million the fund received 651 million but between november1993 and october 1994 made loans to four peacekeeping operations totaling 649million this has reduced the funds balance to 204353httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95787crs8 13prepared by steven r bowman analyst in national defensecertain other peace and security actions authorized by the council such as monitoring sanctions and enforcing fly z ones are financed by the member states taking part in the action at cost to the united nations the united states has been an active participant in these peace support operations but their cost has had negative impact on the united states political willingness to support peaceoperations financing rapid reaction force any decision on fi nancing would include response to the question who will pay for what one approach might be to dividefunding responsibilities for rapid reaction force between troop contributinggovernments and the collective membership this option would make thedetermining factor the status of units assigne d to the force when units are stationed in their home country then their government might be financially responsible fortheir salaries and upkeep when they have been deployed and are in the service of the united nations then the might be financially responsible for them that would still leave open questions about w ho would fund activities such as joint training exercises and the purchase of equipment such as integratedcommunications equipment considerations for force design13 the secretarygeneral pointed to two problems in the current design of peacekeeping forces that arguably could be overcome by the creation of an oncall rapid reaction force lack of inter operability and the slowness of deployments because peacekeeping forces are draw n from over 30 countries they often lack interoperability ie the ability to provide mutual support and act effectivelytogether interoperability and response time problems might be substantiallyreduced if as envisioned by the secretar ygeneral peacekeeping forces regularly trained together used the same equipment and were available for immediatedeployment such rapid reaction force could reduce the tactical and operationallevel difficulties in command coordination and communication that have faced commanders in the past there are however many problems unique to designingpeacekeeping forces that lead some to argue that predesignated rapid reactionforce might be more efficient than the current system one problem common to all military ope rations but more troublesome in the case of peace operations is determining th size and composition of military force needed to fulfill the missions it is to perf orm and the objectives it is to achieve in the case of the secretarygenerals pr oposal both the size and the missions are unclear the secretarygeneral has stated that the force would be used when there was an emergency need for peacekeeping but has not specified total size for the rapid reaction peacekeeping force he suggested only that it might comprisebattalionsized units from number of count ries which could mean anywhere fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95787crs9 14the size of battalion usually varies be tween 400 to 1000 troops depending on the country and the battalions specialty as of jan 31 1995 23 countries contributed over 1000 troops to operations and nine mo re contributed between 4001000 most proposals currently advocated tend to focus on force of about 10000 troops size that isgenerally thought to reflect more what is po litically attainable than what may be needed operationally 15by way of comparison over 36000 troops are currently deployed in the former yugoslavia in addition to 4000 personnel in italy providing air support and 17 naval vessels in the adriatic 16the former yugoslavia and somalia stand out as examples where humanitarianpeacekeeping operations began with limited objectives and incrementally became involved in peace enforcement combat ope rations this led to mismatch of mandates and available forces and significant tensions among and associatedcommandersunder 10000 to over 20000 troops14 whether that would be adequate would depend on what type of peace mission was envisioned design problems created by the nature of peacekeeping operations for peacekeeping operations situation where stable truce is in place and troops are deployed to prevent or contain an inadvertent outbreak of hostilities or to oversee the fulfillment of peace settlemen t mission objectives are likely to be fairly clear as is the composition of the force required lightly armed welldisciplined infantry units generally suffice in more complicated peace enforcement situations that are still politically and militarily volatile the number and complexityof the tasks required multiplies significantly see appendix i this in turn increasespersonnel and equipment requirements if only initial peacekeeping deployments or the simplest of peacekeeping operations were undertaken with the proposed rapidreaction force then force of 10000 to 20000 could be adequate but for more ambitious operations significantly greater numbers would probably be required 15 on paper peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations present very different missions and objectives but in prac tice this distinction is not as clear most military analysts emphasize that peacekeeping and peace enforcement should not beconsidered as adjacent points on sliding scale of escalation but rather as whollydifferent operations requiring very different force design from the outset yet what start out as peacekeeping operations do escalate often because international anddomestic political considerations have resulted in overl optimistic initial assessments of situation to which forces are deployed 16 further the security councils multiple mandates authorizing recent peace operations and thepoliticalmilitary realities encountered by forces on the ground have served toblur the distinction these factors have so metimes led to inadequate or inappropriate force composition for assigned missions nd objectives and could well continue to present problems for an on call force other military factors in designing force package for any peace operation including the nature of potentially hostile forces weather terrain and localinfrastructure present significant challenge s to those creating rapid reaction forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95787crs10 17dennehy capt edward et blue helmet combat force harvard university john f kennedy school of govern ment policy analysis paper 9301design before knowing its destination or mission some including natos former supreme commander general john galvin have argued against designatedstandby force on the grounds that forces must be customtailored to particularoperation most military analysts judge it less risky for both personnel and thesuccess of the mission to provide appropriate forces at the outset rather than have to augment restructure or replace the intervention force at later date 17 several other reservations and criticisms are expressed concerning the use of predesignated standby forces rather th an continuing with an improving ad hoc system these are described below interoperability although some interoperability problems would undoubtedly be solved by an oncall rapid reaction force others may not proponents of standby force emphasize the desirability of st andardized equipment within forces particularly in the area of communications the creati on of rapid reaction force would facilitate standardization identical equipment is not so important as compatibility ofequipment and related fuels and ammunition and procedures and trainingalthough there is little question that incomp atible equipment or donated equipment unfamiliar to participating troops has created difficulties at the tactical andoperational levels analysts do not agree on whether aside from communicationreforms currently under way standardized equipment procurement couldrealistically be achieved political considerations the united nations has traditionally designed its forces to ensure participation by units from many nations as means of maintaining credible internationalmandate it most likely would also give great weight to political considerations inthe composition of rapid reaction force yet critics of operations believe that the united nations desire for broad participation in its forces has hinderedoperational effectiveness and there may be added drawbacks to the effectiveness of an oncall force for instance regiona l and cultural sensitivities as well as political factors could preclude participation by some national units in certain operations affordability many member states may not be able to afford to retain units intended primarily for peacekeeping for one in longterm operations us forces have ageneral rule of thumb that for every unit deployed there is second unit preparingfor deployment and third returning nd refurbishing although the ratio would vary from nation to nation and would depend on the number and length ofdeployments commitment of one unit to rapid reaction force might actually meana commitment of two or more unitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95787crs11 18diehl

national defensethough now often volunteered for ope rations some national contingents are never adequately equipped when they arrive because some nations cannotafford to adequately equip their own forces some analysts suggest that only thosenations able to field competently led and adequately equipped units be permitted toparticipate in rapid reaction force the drawback to this approach aside fromnarrowing international representation is that it would increase the burden on arelative handful of members prim arily the security council permanent five and the nations of western europe who can field such forces significant net gain the numerous difficulties in designing rapid reaction force cause some analysts to question whether the interopera bility advantages of such force would offset disadvantages and whether such force would be significant improvement over the standby forces system that is cu rrently being developed critics argue that the benefits of rapidreaction standby for ce are gained primarily at the tactical and operational level and are actually marginal to the overall success of peaceoperation regardless of its mission 18 they find that slow response disparate units and incompatible equipment have never been at the heart of operationsfailure but that failures have rather stemmed from other factors some also question whether significant time would actually be saved by having rapid reaction force on call analysts ve pointed out that while straightforward peacekeeping missions are the easiest to respond to quickly fewer troops lessequipment they are most often the missions in which response in matter of oneor two days is not critical that offer th opportunity for significant advance planning and present little problem in raising troops if truce or peace settlement isunderway small initial presence has generally been adequate until the main body of troops has arrived 19 on the other hand while rapid insertion of forces to enforce peace could be very desirable at times the heavier ground combat contingents required for this type of operation take the greatest time to tailor andtransport in addition these are precisely the operations that many nations would not choose to have an oncall rapid reaction force perform considerations for force operations command and control20 rapid reaction force rrf matter how constituted would require effective command and control to achieve its peacekeeping objectives having agood command and control system would become more critical for those crises thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95787crs12 21for background information see crs report 94487 military command control and communications basic facts and selected issues of c3were timesensitive or militarily risky there are number of possible solutions each with pros and cons in regard to potential military effectiveness and politicalacceptability although possible the idea of commanding with an internationalcommittee group of military officers from different countries would most likely be rejected in favor of the more prove n concept of unified command under single individual especially when the likelihood of combat requires capability formaking hard and rapid decisions si ngle commander for multinational forces is recommended under current us joint doctrin who that commander should be will likely be the most contentious part of the command and control debate leadership three possible options for providing the rrf commander are the rrf commander could be professional soldier appointed indefinitely on fulltime basis by the security council andor secretarygeneral to serveat their pleasure advantages are that the individual selected could mold his staff and rrf training to his standards provide institutional stability andcontinuity and become true peacekeeping professional ready for immediatedeployment disadvantages are that he could become captive to the bureaucracy and politics and become rem oved from his military roots for such reasons at given time of crisis he might not enjoy the confidence of the rrf contributing states the parties to the regional conflict or the uscongress the rrf commander could be appointed on rotating basis perhapsannually from among qualified officers belonging to forces of the troopcontributing states such an arrangement could ensure some continuity ofleadership without as much politi cal baggage this arrangement would likely seem fair and workable to most but as in any lottery the wrongcrisis could occur on the wrong officers watch the rrf commander could be selected from qualified pool at the time ofcrisis this could ensure designation of commander all parties would haveconfidence in barring political obstructiveness for other reasons thiscommander might not be as immediately available or prepared for his role asthe permanent or rotating commander but measures such as briefings andtraining could be instituted by the united nations and contributing states tokeep all potential candidates adequately prepared selection of the commander is important but provides only part of the command and control system two other important components of that system arecommunications and the commanders staff 21 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95787crs13 communications the successful rrf commander must have reliable communications he must have equipmen t with global capabilities in order to talk with headquarters selected supporting nations and any external intelligencesources he is authorized he should pr ovide or otherwise ensure communications downward to all his major subordinate headquarters he will desire the capabilityto access regional communications systems or provide nets that allow him to talk with key regional actors including the major nonun protagonists there are several possible sources of communications for the rrf commander the united nations could purchase and mainta in mobile set of communications for deploying with the rrf one or more nations could provide tailoredcommunications companies or battalions as their contribution to the rrf in thecase of ad hoc selections of commanders the nation supplying the rrf commander might also provide some or all of his communications in many cases however the most desirable and responsive communications components would be beyond thecapabilities of most nations to provide on short notice some capabilities might resideonly with nato or the united states in the end some combination of all these sources might be required artful desi gn and engineering would be required to ensure flexible and interoperable system at reasonable cost the united states might consider earmarking communications units as politically less costly thancombat unit contributions staff the rrf commander would require substantial competent staff to assist him in meeting his many and diverse responsibilities for peacekeeping aswith other elements of command and control there is range of sources for such staff at the highcompetence highcost end the united nations could maintain complete fulltime staff ready to go at the lowcost riskier end an ad hoc staff could be formed from among the participating countries totally ad hoc staff would likely be unacceptable however since some advance staff planning would berequired prior to deployment of the rapid reaction force some planning can ofcourse be done by the current military staff but most of that staff would have to remain in place to handle unlevel responsibilities once the rapid reaction forcedeployed it is likely therefore that at least cadre staff should be maintained fulltime and fleshed out by various means at the time of crisis the military side of standing staff could be relatively lean as its functions are fairly standard and augmentation could be made easily with officers familiar tothe rrf commander or volunteered from the forces of the contributing nationscertain cells or elements could be plugged in when specific requirements weredefined eg for fire support intelligence exploitation airspace managementlogistics management etc the cadre st aff would handle the standard functions of administration intelligence operations to include planning and training andlogistics the civilian side of standing staff might demand more resources than the military since certain unique talents w ould be required

influenc ing the rrf commander and the secretary general in ways opposed to the wishes of the us congress or the cadre could remain professional and apolitical staff composed in large part of loaned militarypersonnel could be perceived as less thr eatening than staff of permanent employees and would probably be less costly intelligence22 the establishment of rapid reac tion force would not necessarily require drastic revisions of current arrangements and practices regarding intelligencerather continuation or slight upgrading of current efforts to improve information and intelligence collection and processing would probably be adequate both the bush and clinton administra tions have sought to provide better intelligence to peacekeeping operations and improve intelligence gathering and processing capabilities in support of those ope rations one of the widely recognized shortcomings of operations has been th lack of adequate basic information and intelligence such as maps and data on the disposition of potentially hostile forcesas occurred in cambodia where more extensive information and intelligence has been available such as in somalia its utility may have been lessened by lack ofprecision or it may not have been transmitted in timely manner to the forcecommanders who needed it 23 currently information and intelligence for peacekeeping operations is processed at

soma lia but was left behind unprotected when the forces pulled out earlier this year 24 senator olympia j snowe has introduced legislation s 420 that would bar the provision to the united nations of anyintelligence information involving sensitive sources and methods of intelligencegathering moreover it is recognized that countries that cooperate with the united states on one peacekeeping operation may oppos us interests on other occasions these factors would not change were rapid reaction force established unless it were composed of us forces only or of forces from countries with

25prepared by james p wootten specialist in national defense gathering capability for rapid reaction for ce might that capability be used someday against us interests some suggest that consideration might be given to establishing satellites to give the organization an independent collection capability such system would however be costly and would probably not provide the capabilities of usreconnaissance systems some might argue that the us role as the main provider of intelligence to operations may give it leverage over the use of rapid reaction force in addition tothe united states security council veto it is impossible however to predict theextent to which the united nations will be dependent on ussupplied intelligence in the future or the extent to which th absence of ussupplied intelligence would hinder peacekeeping operation in some areas other countries have betterinformation and us assistance may not be required logistics25 some argue that the absence of adequa logistics support has presented serious problems for peacekeeping and observe r operations whether the creation of rapid reaction force would significantly alleviate logistics difficulties in carryingout future peacekeeping missions or be less expensive than the way it was done in the past remains to be seen the term logistics applies to just bout everything needed to arm equip and sustain force to perform its mission this includes weapons and ammunitionclothing and equipment transport rations communications equipment spare parts and maintenance medical care and medical supplies and whatever air and sealift is needed to move the force to where it is need ed it takes about four to six logistics personnel to support each combat soldier on the modern battlefield the same orsomewhat lower ratios would probably be needed for peace operations includingpeacekeeping depending on the type and mission of the deployment having standby ra pid reaction force might offer many advantages by facilitating high degree of advance planning acquisition and prepositioning ofsome of the support needed for typical operation particularly if permanentlogistics office were established at the united nations there is also considerableadvantage in knowing the actual makeup of preplanned force and the equipmentit is likely to need especia lly if time is of the essence in getting the force in place knowing in advance that unit was likel to be part of peacekeeping operation would allow unit personnel to become familiar with the kinds of equipment andvehicles they will be working with even if there is not enough equipment to actually issue on permanent basis support personnel would have time to learn how tomaintain equipment and order repair parts through common supply system there would also be logistics disadvant ages associated with having standby force military planners in every country have penchant for planning for every eventuality rather than risk being criticized for forgetting something once thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95787crs17 26prepared by nina m serafino specia list in international security affairsoperation is under way the result might be costly overstocking and wastage supplies and materiel some effort and ma terial would also be wasted on units that would never be called upon either because th ey were not needed or their government reneged on its commitment once an emergency arose supplies might also beprepositioned in the wrong place and not be available when the force deploys other logistics problems arise from the major differences in the status of training and the quality and sophistication of equipment belonging to each unitbecause of these differences support can not always be tailored to accommodate allforces logistics support however must be reasonably compatible with the needs of the entire military force or commanders can expect breakdowns in performance or efficiency some analysts argue that united nations logistics capabilities can be improved even if rapid reaction force is not creat ed more efficient military planning cell within headquarters which would include expanded logistics planning mightbe created efforts to arrange logistics contracts with private contractors might beintensified considerations for the united states strategic budgetary and political considerations26 for the united states secretarygeneral boutrosghalis proposal presents many practical and political problems th clinton administration opposes the idea of rapid reaction standby force for the sa reasons that it has declined formally to commit units to the standby forces system described earlier it would reduce the flexibility of us strategic planning in an apr 14 1994 statement us ambassador to the united nations karl f inderfurth indicated that formalcommitment to the standby forces system wa s impractical given us bilateral and multilateral security obligations worldwid such commitment might reduce us ability to respond to other crises by tying up us forces or eliminating the us capacity to withdraw its troops from lesser priority peacekeeping operation to acrisis of higher priority to us interest s in some circumstances this lack of flexibility might lessen the deterrent effect of us force some claim however that standby rapi d reaction force would in effect give the united nations saber to rattle provide greater deterrent to third worldconflicts and thus serve us strategic intere sts it might also give teeth to other actions taken to stem conflicts such as sanctions even before such force was deployed in such case standby for ce would provide greater force multiplier than current arrangements for multilateral peacekeeping operations on the otherhand the existence of committed standby force might tempt the securitycouncil and others to resort to its use mo re quickly in cases where other measures might be more appropriate httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95787crs18 questions can be raised about the poten tial effect of standby rapid reaction force on the development of regional conf lict resolution and peacekeeping initiatives the charter states that the settlement of disputes should be dealt with where appropriate at the regional level the existence of standby rapid reaction forcemight provide an inducement for secu rity council to preempt regional efforts because it had more efficient means to deal with problems thus debilitating regionalefforts and organizations on the other hand the security council might offer to use rapid reaction force to back regional efforts thus strengthening them because of the uncertainty of the cost of such force budgetary considerations are matter of extreme concern the actual co st to the united states of rapid reaction force would depend of course on the forces structure its uses and how funding responsibilities would be divided be tween contributing countries and the collective membership some argue that the cost to individual nations ofmaintaining few thousand men and their equipment exclusively for peacekeeping would be high while that cost might be absorbable for the united states and other industrialized countries it could be taxing if not exorbitant for developingcountries thus as mentioned earlier th united states and other wealthy countries might find themselves called upon to underwrite the cost of the standby units offered by others nevertheless us officials and othe r opponents concede proponents point that the capacity to deploy peacekeeping tr oops more quickly could prevent the escalation of conflicts in some cases which could make it not only desirable forhumanitarian reasons but also costeffective some argue that many lives might havebeen saved if peacekeeping forces had gone in sooner in rwanda and initially ingreater force in somalia although others doubt that greater speed or numbers wouldhave significantly altered the course of events there are domestic political implications for the united states as well although the united states maintains the power in the security council to veto or alter proposed peacekeeping operations us commitment to rapid reactionforce might well reduce congressional and other domestic input into the decisionmaking process on peacekeeping operations although perhaps not problematic ifthe use of the rapid reaction force were confined to simpler peacekeeping operations commitments to borderline cases might raise controversy this could become greater problem if the united states needed to draw on reserve units to fulfill its peacekeeping co mmitments the us military maintains high proportion of the military personnel who perform support functions in thereserve forces these are the very sp ecialties that the united states typically provides the united nations for peacekeeping operations thus there may becircumstances in which it would be necessary to draw on reserves to fulfill uspeacekeeping commitments

sealift27 because the united states stands alone in terms of being able to move troops and equipment in emergency situations it is likely that theunited states would be asked to perform the bulk of the airlift mission and possibly the sealift mission as well the united states has provided such support for nato allies on many occasions and has provided aircraft support for virtually every pastand ongoing peacekeeping operation without major adverse incident orcriticism other nations have large commercial maritime assets but none has theability to move entire military units together with their weapons and equipment likethe united states with its standing fleet of fast sealift ships with rollonrolloff capability moving large military force and its quipment under short notice is complex and costly operation especially when the force must deploy quickly this isespecially true when moving combat for ce into hostile environment and by every measure the task becomes more difficult and costly as the force gets larger and the expected level of combat intensity increases it would not be difficult to move the rapid reaction force suggested by secretary general boutrosghali if it were limited to the more traditional type of peacekeeping mission however air and sealifting large multinational combat force into actively hostile conditions may beunacceptably risky under present circumstances us forces considerations 28 the united states would face number of issues in deciding what types of military forces to commit to rapid reaction force and how to structure its forces to accommodate that commitment an importantdecision would be whether troops committed to the rapid reaction force would also perform other missions or whether speci dedicated peacekeeping units would be formed whose primary mission would be to train for and perform peacekeeping operations boutrosghalis proposal that th troops train together might indicate his preference for dedicated units curre nt us peacekeeping policy as stated in pdd25 explicitly excludes the possibility of creating dedicated peacekeeping units current debate over the effects of peace operations on military skills on career potential and on recruitment and rete ntion will be relevant to that decision critical factor in maintaining war figh ting skills is continual training with the increase in peace operations in the early 1990s some military analysts claimed that peace operations did not require war fighting skills and took away from the timenecessary for practicing such skills thus threatening the readiness of the fightingforce analysts now concede that thes missions provide troops with the opportunity to perform and refine some skills that would be employed during warhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95787crs20 maneuvering skills running observations pos ts and checkpoints employing cordon and searches and disarming potential combatants illustrate some of the techniquesthat soldiers have had an opportunity to us in real world situations in somalia for example cordon and search techniques were used for the first time sincevietnam nonetheless these same observers argue that many critical combat skillsare not used during peace operations such as the use of heavy weapons systems one particular problem for some units is that the effective operation of weapons systems particularly marksmanship skills deteriorates substantially withoutcontinued training while sustainment tr aining can be undertaken after troops are deployed on peacekeeping mission live fire training may be offensive to hostcountry or to other multilateral forces opponents to peace operations claim that in such cases training would be terminat ed further lessening opportunities for troops to exercise weapons skills another problem would be maintaining military staff and unit operations skills in troop movement troop maneuvering duri ng peace operations is generally limited to squads or platoons in the event of major regional contingency conflict of the size of the korean vietnam or pers ian gulf wars the movements of us troops are likely to be at battalion level or above staffs must therefore be able to move battalionsize or larger units as well as integrate other elements of militarypower such as the use of aircraft na val gunfire and art illery peace operations usually do not provide an opportunity to exercise these skills in addition peace operations require specialized training that can take time from combat and other military training need for additional peace operations skills have been identified which may place greater training requirements on forces deployedfor peacekeeping operations these include commander training in conflictnegotiation and mediation staff training to emphasize cooperation with diversemilitaries and organizations and training for all military personnel in basicunderstanding of the customs cultures religious practices politics and historicalbackground of the country or countries invol ved additional training therefore may be required depending on the specific n eeds of the mission military planners generally regard four to six weeks of such specialized training as necessary to prepare troops for peace operations the problems of maintaining certain combat skills during peace operations particularly in peacekeeping operations and the requirements for additional trainingmay argue for the creation of dedicated its for rapid reaction force the utility and costeffectiveness of dedicated units would depend to some extent on the typeof forces committed and the number and length of deployments another problem for creating dedicated peacekeeping units may be difficulties in attracting and retaining military personnel there are already many questionsabout the effect of peace operations on m ilitary officers career advancement and on the retention of troops and these factors would have to be taken
