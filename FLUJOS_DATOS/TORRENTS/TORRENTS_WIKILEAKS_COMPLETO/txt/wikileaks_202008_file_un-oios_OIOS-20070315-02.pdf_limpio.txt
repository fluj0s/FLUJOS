oios conducted an audit of unhcr operations in liberia the audit covered activities with total expenditure of us 332 mil lion in 2005 draft of the report was shared with the director of the bureau for africa and the representative in january 2007 on which comments were received in february 2007 the representation has accepted most of the recommendations and is in the process of implementi ng them overall assessment for the period covered internal controls over majo r expenditure categories were not in place to provide management with assurance that project obje ctives were achieved as result oios assessed the internal controls as below average th weaknesses identified taken together or individually significantly impaired the overall sy stem of internal control oios is pleased to note that positive action has been taken in 2006 to improve systems and procedures and further measures are envisaged to address the weakn esses identified during the audit the implementation of the recommendations outlined in t he report will further strengthen internal controls programme management in 2005 us 24 million was spent on 500 quickimp act community empowerment projects ceps oios assessed that the ceps could have been better managed as complete and comprehensive information was not readily available to monitor their implementation there were detailed budgets versus actual expenditures or evidence that proper procurement procedures had been complied with there were also status reports on ceps to allow an assessment of the effectiveness of the projects oi was pleased to note that efforts were made in 2006 to monitor the activities more closely unhcrs partners were delegated the responsibility of paying travel grants of us 37 million to internally displaced persons even though seriou s concerns were raised by unhcrs programme unit about nrcs financial management of the payment of grants of us 24 million the activity was continually delegated to them without any positive action to resolve the discrepancies found or to ensure internal cont rols were strengthened also us 300000 was paid via gtz manager but recorded as an activ ity directly implemented by unhcr this meant that clear lines of authority over these payments had not been established project financial monitoring of partners was assess ed as weak in 2005 but notable improvements were made in 2006 including the creat ion of national project control assistants post considering the number of partne rs and the resources allocated to subproject financial monitoring higherrisk areas like cash g rant payments and ceps should be focused on to make more effective use of resources the representation informed oios that cash payments had significantly reduced in 2006 and 2007 due to the conclusion of the idp return phase qualified audit opinion on the financial informat ion presented in the spmr had been expressed for many of the major partners including lush nrc gtz and ccc the external auditor also reported that lush had fraudulently ch arged us 100000 against project 04sbwafem133 and further us 233000 could t supported the representation informed oios that an indepth review has been cond ucted and lushs new management has sought funding to complete the projects the re presentation confirmed that these were completed to an acceptable standard supply management oios noted that improvements were required to suppl management systems and procedures oios is pleased to note that improvements were impl emented in the latter part of 2006 the internal controls over the procurement and paym ent of fuel costing us 1 million including vat during the period from 1 january 20 05 to april 2005 were weak in some cases there were purchase orders for fuel or rec eiving reports confirming that the fuel had been received to support some of the payments mad only photocopies or carbon copies of invoices were attached it was clear that the appro ving officer was aware of the lack of original documents but still approved payment this was not sound management practice improved controls were established from may 2005 when the fu was procured via unmil gtz was responsible for most of the logistical acti vities in liberia and overall oios assessed that they had established proper internal controls to manage the activities effectively administration oios questioned the continuation of separate work shop managed by unv and staffed by nonunhcr personnel project staff for administrat ion vehicles the representation was of the opinion that the arrangement should be continue d but had not yet conducted reliable costbenefit study this would be particularly pert inent considering the funding arrangement with gtz and that their regional structure will be based liberia economies of scale may be achieved with the transfer of the administrations fleet maintenance to gtz financial management needed improvement controls t record cash transfers to the field offices amounting to us 700000 between january 2 005 and august 2006 were unsatisfactory and large outstanding receivables h ad not been cleared some going back to 2003 further guidance and support was required by the representation to sub and field offices the representation is clearing receivables march 2007 table of contents chapter paragraphs i introduction 1 4 ii audit objectives 5 iii

78 i introduction 1 from 30 october to 17 november 2006 oios conducted an audit of unhcrs operations in liberia the audit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing oios reviewed the activities of the unhcr representation in liberia and its suboff ices so in voinjama and saclepea and of six of its implementing partners 2 oios previous audit of unhcr in liberia was conduc ted in 2004 that review focused on 2003 and part of the 2004 project activi ties covering expenditure of us 16 million project development and implementa tion had been hindered by the security situation and as the country had just emerged from war many systems and procedures were only being reestablished oios found that there wa s financial monitoring of partners that supply systems and procedures required to be signif icantly strengthened and that administrative issues such as the reimbursement of duty on fuel and solar deductions for staff provided accommodation by unhcr needed to be addressed 3 following the voluntary disarmament and demobilizat ion of excombatants by unmil in october 2004 unhcr started organized volu ntary repatriation of liberian refugees by november 2006 with the assistance of unhcr 314000 internally displaced persons and 81000 liberian refugees returned to th eir places of origin unhcrs programme in liberia was characterized by the 4rs repatriati on reintegration rehabilitation and reconstruction this included the provision of tran sport and basic household items the reconstruction of sanitation and health facilities wells and shelters as well as selfreliance activities additionally at the beginning of 2006 unhcr took the lead in protection emergency shelter and camp coordination under the c luster approach 4 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the audited activitie s during the exit conference held on 16 november 2006 draft of the report was shared wi th the director of the bureau for africa and the representative in january 2007 on which co mments were received in february 2007 the representation has accepted most of the recomme ndations made and are in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to evaluate t he adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subproject agreements iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on 2005 programme activities unde r project 05ablbrrp373 2 with expenditure of us 29 million our review centrated on the activities implemented by deutsche gesellschaft fur technische zusammenarb eit gtz expenditure of us 4 million norwegian refugee council nrc ex penditure of us 32 million concerned christian community ccc expenditure f us 1 million africa humanitarian action aha expenditure of us 06 million afri can concern international aci expenditure of us 09 million and liberian refugee repatriation and resettlement commission lrrrc expenditure of us 06 million we also reviewed activities directly implemented by unhcr with expenditure of u s 6 million 7 the audit reviewed the administration of monrovia nd sos voinjama and saclepea with administrative budgets of us 42 million for 2005 and assets with an acquisition value of us 167 million and current value of us 68 million the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in liberia was 206 this includ ed staff on regular posts united nations volunteers project staff personnel hired under service agreements and staff on mission 8 the audit activities included review and assessme nt of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations programme issues 9 the project description of the letter of instructio n for 05ablbrrp373 did not provide sufficient details on the programme impleme ntation including the accelerated idp return disbursement of us 37 million dollars as travel grants and an emphasis on community empowerment projects consequently oios was unable to match the 2005 project objectives with the results cited in the 20 05 country report or assess the overall effectiveness of programme execution the representation explained that the constraints they had been working under during this period had an effect by delaying the updating of programme instruments community empowerment projects 10 the implementation of community empowerment project s ceps was delegated to number of partners the established criteria for th ceps aimed at empowering returnees and receiving communities through participatory proce ss to gain control of resources and make fair decisions over the use of these resources eac h cep had financial ceiling of us 5000 although several exceptions after individual consid eration had been made 11 oios had concerns with the representations managem ent of ceps there was lack of complete and comprehensive information available to monitor and control these project activities for example the representation did not budget separately for ceps nor did it have consolidated financial data on cep implementation it was only after lengthy exercise that oios was able to establish that the amount disburse d was about us 24 million the reintegration section was able to provide details f all the approved ceps from 2004 to 2006 which according to the database was 1500 th ey did not however record on the database the budgeted amount against actual expendi ture per cep to enable progress to be monitored additionally it was not possible for oi to correlate the information recorded in 3 the database to the lois to ensure the project obje ctives were achieved also in oios opinion significant part of the us 24 million w as for procurement assurance could be obtained that goods were procured competitively and in compliance with wellestablished procurement procedures 12 lack of information hindered oios ability to ass ess the effectiveness of cep implementation for instance the spmrs submitted b partners did not disclose cep expenditure separately and the level of informatio n provided in partners narrative spmrs was limited it was unclear therefore whether they had been completed to an acceptable level and their envisaged impact on the community had bee n achieved in oios opinion some of the ceps warranted extensive monitoring and require d considerable cooperation and coordination among different functional units in th representation to ensure they were successfully implemented this was not done for ex ample the effectiveness of the ceps relating to farming projects accounting for about 25 per cent of the 2005 ceps could only be known if the community was able to independently co ntinue the agricultural activities beyond the initial assistance there were records or i ndication that this had been the case and hence it is unlikely that it was sufficiently monit ored 13 oios appreciated the positive steps taken by the re presentation to almost half the number of partners it was working with nonetheless more tangible action should have been taken to ensure all ceps initiated by partners work ing with unhcr in 2005 but discontinued with in 2006 had been completed for example for the former partner denl in november 2006 oios was provided with list of ongoing ceps in nimba county that included four denl 2005 projects as these had not been satisfactorily completed oios was of the opinion that they should have been conti nually monitored to ensure they achieved the expected outcome and if not that unhcr was ap propriately compensated the representation assured oios that the community serv ices section had monitored denl activities satisfactory performance had been rep orted 14 additionally liberians united to serve humanity l ush had been delegated the responsibility for ceps in 2004 but these had not been completed the external audit firm contracted locally had stated that us 100000 repo rted as expenditure by lush against the project 04sbwafem133 was fraudulent in additi on an amount of us 223000 reported against the same project and 04ablbrrp201 could not be substantiated the auditors had also pointed out that lush used the 05ablbrr p373 funding of us 200000 to complete unfinished 2004 activities oios could not find evidence that this issue had been systematically followed up on file the representation assured oios that they had raise d this issue with lush in 2005 and subsequently various l etters had been addressed to them and various meetings held the representation stated th projects had been completed to the specifications quality acceptable to unhcr and co nfirmed that projects planned for 2005 had been implemented lush owes unhcr us 97843 re sulting from shelter kits not procured unspent balances and unsubstantiated exp enditures lush had taken legal action against the identified perpetrators upon unhcrs ad vice the trial is still in progress 15 for the cep construction activities the community the implementing partner and unhcr should have signed the project document indic ating that they had been satisfactorily completed none of these documents could be present ed to oios raising concern that the projects had not been properly completed to the sat isfaction of all the parties involved the representation informed oios that the cep completio n report had now been signed by three community representatives and one implementing part ner staffmember and addressed to 4 unhcr number of implementing partners ie aci zoa refugee care had systematically undertaken this procedure while othe rs had failed to do so 16 oios appreciates that an extended rainy season ine xperienced implementing staff and the delayed identification of the projects were som of the factors that reduced the implementation rate nonetheless these factors sho uld have been documented by the representation and partners in their various report s in order to present fair picture of the implementation status and to provide justification for failing to achieve project objectives oios accepts that this may be labour intensive ex ercise but it is good practice recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia should in futur budget community empowerment projects separately to ensure that actual expenditure against the budgets can be monitored t he representation should also considerably strengthen the monitoring of and reporting on community empowerment projects to ensure they achieve the objectives established rec 01 17 the representation stated that it has taken measure s to improve the monitoring of ceps from 2006 such projects had longer been bu dgeted solely under sector h but rather under the relevant sector eg water or sanitation the representation also referred to the data being stored in compendium of ceps oios accept s that steps have been taken to improve the monitoring of ceps nonetheless the 200 6 budgeting practice did not readily provide comprehensive information about cep budgets as the ceps were usually budgeted under other contracts oios would advice that to adequately manage these activities complete and comprehensive information should be re adily available and monitored centrally b travel grants 18 in 2005 unhcr assisted over 260000 idps to resett in their communities of origin travel grant was paid the amount was dep endent on the distance to the final destination the representation paid about us 37 million in travel grants to idps of this nrc was responsible for the disbursement of us 24 million in order to establish an eligibility list the representation used wfps idp registrationration card details 19 oios review of the payment of travel grants reveal ed an unusual practice whereby the representation initially delegated this respons ibility to gtz project manager oios noted that over us 300000 had been recorded as pa id to idps between january and march 2005 via gtz employee it was not specified in th subproject agreement with gtz and was accounted for and reported by unhcr as an activ ity that they had directly implemented such practice was not correct and did not establi sh clear lines of accountability the representation stated that they resorted to this pr ocedure because due to security risks in the first quarter of 2005 other ngos were reluctant to execute the travel grant payments the representation further explained that it had to res ort to this approach as the unhcrbmz gtz grant agreement framework did not allow such ad ditional activities to be covered under the gtz subproject oios is aware of the unhcrbmzgtz agreement and t he constraints it may impose this does not negate th representation from ensuring that proper procedure was established such transactions should have been outlined in formal document and signed by unhcr and the gtz employee this would have ensured transparency the proper accounting treatment of hcr funds and clear lines of 5 accountability 20 for the payment of travel grants the beneficiary l ist was provided by wfp in data file the file was updated by unhcr to record the p ayment to be paid and then transferred to implementing partners to effect payment due to nu merous reasons not all of the beneficiaries collected their travel grants at desi gnated dates consequently the amount recorded as to be paid did not match the actual amount paid as result there was assurance that every incoming beneficiary data file from wfp had matching outgoing file and b the beneficiary details remained the same and were free of unauthorized modifications throughout their movement from wfp to implementing partners through unhcr the process was further complicated as wfp provided some beneficiary lists directly to the partners nrc and ccc without involv ing unhcr this increased the risk of making incorrect payments 21 overall internal controls were assessed as weak th ere were procedures established to ensure that the amounts withdrawn from the bank agreed with the actual payments made as evidenced by beneficiary signatures taking into ac count the redeposit of unpaid amounts there was evidence that the number of beneficiar ies paid was matched or reconciled to the cancelled ration cards or to the new resettlement c ards provided in exchange for the cancelled ration card the representation did not consistent ly request the partners responsible for the payments nrc arc and ccc to report on the amount s paid to beneficiaries by destination in each camp and the total amount paid furthermor the payment lists were not countersigned by other representatives claimed to b present during the payment exercises such as the camp manager to obtain third party conf irmation of the correctness of the payments the representation pointed out that this matter alo ng with other observations on nrcs practices of the payment and recording of tra vel grants were provided to nrc and icf in august 2005 with request for improvement oios takes note that request was made as far back as 2005 but positive action to strengt hen internal controls was not established 22 the monitoring practices for the payment of travel grants by unhcr programme could have been more effective as early as march 2 005 the programme unit was concerned with nrcs poor financial management of unhcr funds and had uncovered some discrepancies between nrcs accounting records and the spmrs submitted to unhcr in august 2005 the programme unit found that of the u s 900000 reported by nrc as paid to idps only us 436000 could be substantiated despi this appropriate action was not taken with nrc to resolve the discrepancies or to ensure internal controls were strengthened the representation continued to delegate this responsib ility to nrc making further payments of us 15 million similarly in october 2005 the r epresentation found variance of us 57000 when cccs distribution list was compared to the payments made the representation asked ccc to explain these discrepan cies within three days which they did in november 2006 more than year later follow up action had been taken by the representation to verify the correctness of cccs p artial explanation for the differences and the us 12000 that remained unexplained the representation stated that there had been very few international organisations which could b held accountable in the handling of such activities constant follow up and verification had led to the discovery of discrepancies 23 due to the number of deficiencies in accounting for travel grants to the idps oios was unable to obtain reasonable assurance that the travel grants paid were made to the targeted beneficiaries 6 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia should ensure t hat internal controls over the payment of travel grants are sign ificantly improved this includes the controls established by implementing partners and those of unhcrs programme unit consi dering the gravity of the findings with regard to the norwegia n refugee council serious consideration should be given as t whether they have the competence to perform this activity on beh alf of unhcr rec 02 24 the representation has sent memorandum to unhcr f ield and suboffices to ensure that unhcr staff evidence the travel grant p ayments to returnees furthermore the representation is contemplating involving other imp lementing partners in paying the travel grant to returnees that fit in to their administrat ive areas of responsibility oios takes note that the representation has instructed field office s to strengthen internal controls over the payment of travel advances and that they will explo re the possibility of contracting more partners to delegate this activity to oios will cl ose the recommendation on confirmation that internal controls have been significantly strengthe ned to provide assurance to unhcr management that travel grants are provided to the i ntended beneficiaries c project monitoring 25 financial monitoring of 2005 subprojects was weak mainly because the staff member responsible was utilized for other functions for 2 006 improvements were evident and the project monitoring reviews were properly documented oios appreciated the work done by the representation to strengthen project monitoring including the addition of gl4 project control assistant post and the reduction of the num ber of partners the representation however should establish procedures to ensure corre ctive action has been taken on all major weaknesses identified during project monitoring to strengthen internal controls and improve procedures 26 in 2005 only one staff member at the p3 level w as assigned projectcontrol responsibilities considering the number of partner s and the volume of activities oios can see that this was considerable task for one perso n oios suggested that in order to accomplish the function more effectively project f inancial monitoring is focused on higher risk areas for example there should have been f ocus on partners field activities due to the substantial cash amounts transferred to field offic to meet local operating expenditure 27 also considering the volume of activities directly implemented by unhcr an independent review of the effectiveness of these pr ojects would have been beneficial and could have resulted in improving systems and proced ures for example the payment of travel grants to the idps and returnees was not well manag ed or properly controlled if the assigned project control officer had effectively reviewed th is it would have been likely that management would have been alerted to the weaknesse s and gaps in internal controls 28 oios recommended that the representation should tinue further improving the project monitoring function project control and mo nitoring of implementing partners activities should be better planned and more focuse d to provide assurance to the representative and programme managers that partners activities are wellmanaged and 7 implemented in accordance with the terms of the sub project agreement or if not the problems have been identified and corrective action has been taken the representation elaborated that the project control officer who ar rived in january 2006 has put in place measures to further enhance the financial recording and reporting of implementing partners in 2006 his focus was on identification of gaps in financial management and verification and closure of 2005 projects other focus areas during the second half of 2006 were nonfood item inventory and training of unhcr staff the wor kplan for 2007 includes following up on the audit observations and recommendations oios would suggest that focus could also be made on directly implemented activities and the hig herrisk areas such as travel grants recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia should continue to enhance its project monitoring activities and also place mo re focus on directly implemented activities and higher risk act ivities such as the payment of travel grants an independent review by the project control officer will ensure there are weaknesses or gaps in internal controls rec 03 29 oios is pleased to note the action taken to improve project monitoring oios will close the recommendation upon confirmation that fur ther improvements have been made with more focus on higherrisk areas 30 the quality of the narrative spmrs provided by part ners should be improved oios noted that the narrative spmrs from most of the imp lementing partners did not clearly outline the achievements of planned activities rea sons for delays and explanations for non achievement of project objectives it was difficul t to assess the overall impact of the sub projects recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia should ensure t hat the narrative reports submitted by the partners reflect the actual project status and achievements whether positive or negati ve rec 04 31 the representation agreed that the quality of narra tive reports had been wanting in some aspects the representation elaborated that th programme management decentralization process initiated in late 2006 wou ld devolve more authority to suboffices which would be able to better monitor activities of partners partners are currently required to submit their activity progress reports to office s on weekly basis while financial reports are required on monthly basis oios will keep the recommendation open pending confirmation that system has been implemented to ensure partners provide clear report of the activities undertaken together with the level f achievement of subproject objectives b review of implementing partners 32 for the six partners reviewed reasonable assurance could be obtained that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements with the exception of nrc and ccc oio s assessed that the internal controls for most of the partners should be improved for xample although the bulk of the expenditure reported by lrrrc was for incentive pay ments to government staff the quality of records was assessed as poor in the case of gt z out of expenditure of us 31 million 8 us 24 million related to salaries travel costs nd overheads and the disparity between budget and actual expenditure was very apparent f or example gtz under community services reported expenditure of us 2700 while t he salaries and related costs of implementing this activity was us 41000 africa humanitarian action 33 aha managed 2 health centres and 17 health clinics in three counties and was allocated budget of us 585000 in 2005 the expe nditure reported was mainly for the salaries of health workers us 325000 and for th procurement of medical equipment and drugs us 109000 unfortunately due to time cons traints and the distances involved oios was unable to visit the health centres or clinics oios assessed that the books of account and the internal controls established were generally sa tisfactory with the exception of the procurement of drugs where there was evidence of competitive bidding it transpired however that liberian government agency held mo nopoly over most drugs sold and therefore there was not true competitive market 34 oios found that under the 2005 subproject unhcr w as charged us 15000 for drugs procured through ahas headquarters the dru gs were never received the amount there should be refunded to unhcr recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia should recover from africa humanitarian action an amount of us 15000 that wa s charged to unhcr in the 2005 spmr for drugs that were never re ceived rec 05 35 the representation informed oios that the aha offic has confirmed in writing that the cost of undelivered medicines will be reimburse d to unhcr oios is pleased to note that recovery will be made the recommendation remain s open pending confirmation that us 15000 has been refunded to unhcr b norwegian refugee council 36 nrcs books of account were not kept to an acceptab standard the accounting records could not be reconciled to the spmr the p ayment of travel grants of us 24 million from the reported expenditure of us 32 llion constituted the most important activity unfortunately due to the relocation of the country director and most of the other staff involved in travel grant payments oios was u nable to obtain complete explanation of the issue oios therefore was unable to provide ass urance that unhcrs funds were properly accounted for moreover nrc commingled fu nds from the unhcr specific bank account with their own funds leaving clear audit trail 9 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia considering th serious weaknesses identified during the audit should moni tor closely the activities of the norwegian refugee council this should include regular visits to review their accounting and other records to assess whether internal controls and procedures have impro ved and to obtain assurance that unhcr funds were correctly di sbursed rec 06 37 the representation explained that on various occasi ons highlevel discussions took place with the country director and the senior staf f in an effort to improve their financial management and internal control mechanisms however due to the frequent turnover of expatriate staff especially in administration and f inance the internal control system was weak and therefore exposed them to the mismanagemen t of funds the lack of banking network had compounded the problem leaving nrc to hand carry huge sums of money to all locations outside monrovia some improvements were exhibited in areas of internal control focusing on accountability and delineation of respo nsibilities and the maintenance of separate files for unhcr project payments in 2007 the payment slip is being redesigned to accommodate unhcr involvement in authenticating tra vel grant payment oios takes note that efforts have been made to improve nrcs intern controls and its accountability of unhcr funds oios will keep the recommendation ope n pending confirmation including copies of monitoring reports that nrcs accounting and internal controls have been improved and unhcr management provided assurance th at they can now rely on nrc to implement unhcrs activities in accordance with the subproject agreement c african concern international 38 oios was able to match the expenditure of us 8880 00 reported in the spmr to the accounting records oios noted however that 57 per cent of the expenditure which was reported under sector p agency operational suppor t appeared excessive as compared to the standard benchmark of 15 per cent some of the expenses should have been allocated to the substantive sectors to reflect the actual cost of the work done 39 oios noted that the staffing list provided with the final 2005 spmr did not provide accurate information on salaries paid reconciliati on of the staffing list to payroll documentation revealed that salaries were paid to n onlisted staff in some cases changes in salary rates were not reflected in the staffing tab in addition some of the staff members were paid endofcontract pay in december 2005 w hich was not included in the subproject agreement these payments totalled us 18000 and should be recovered recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia should review t he salaries paid by african concern international and recover ny nonbudgeted payments also the endofcontract pa made to several staff totalling us 18000 in december 2005 should be recovered rec 07 40 the representation stated that lump sum allocatio n was provided to all implementing partners under salary related costs to enable them to cover medical insurance 10 income tax and national security contributions out of this allotment aci had erroneously paid an amount as retrenchment benefit to their sta ff the representation has requested aci to replace the us18000 swiftly oios will keep the recommendation open pending confirmation that us 18000 has been recovered fro m the partner d audit certificates 41 the representation had contacted local audit firm to audit the subprojects of implementing partners for 2004 and 2005 the audit ors had completed most of the audit work though there were delays and some of the repo rts had still not been received oios noted that the audit firm had expressed qualified opinion on many of the major implementing partners including lush nrc gtz and ccc the qualified opinion pertaining to gtz and ccc was due to the weaknesses noted in the distribution of travel grants to idps for nrc in addition to the weaknes s in the distribution of travel grants the auditors noted that verification of the expendit ure of us 379000 provided under 04sbwafem133 was possible as the accounting rec ords were not available for review recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia should ensure t hat the adverse comments made by the external auditors on t he accounts of the norwegian refugee council have been addressed nd documentation to support the charges made in the 20 04 subproject of us 379000 have been presented and verified as bona fide project expenditure rec 08 42 the representation has advised nrc to present perti nent documents to support the expenditure of us 397000 for verification in resp onse to the external auditors observations oios takes note of the action taken and will keep the recommendation open pending confirmation that the representation is satisfied t hat the expenditure reported was bona fide unhcr subproject costs c supply management 43 in 2005 the total value of internationally procure d nonfood items vehicles and office equipment was over us 55 million during 2005 in general improvements in supply management were required oios was pleased to note that during 2006 there was considerable improvement in 2006 the total value of internationally procured items was us 32 million the bulk of local procurement was for fuel and valued at over us 1 million per year local procurement of fuel from mobil 44 oios reviewed the procurement of 4 million litres f fuel costing about us 3 million from unmil for the period from may 2005 to august 2 006 oios was able to obtain reasonable assurance satisfactory internal controls and procedures had been established to match the quantity ordered received and paid for prior to this period the controls established were weak as outlined in the following paragraphs 45 previously the administration unit was responsible for the local procurement of fuel from mobil oil fuel costing us 835000 had been expensed between january and june 11 2005 for both programme and administration pur chase orders had been established for this procurement with mobil delivering the fuel ba sed on simple request letter from the administration unit 46 our review of the transactions with mobil oil indic ated that satisfactory internal controls were not in place before the representatio n made payments to the suppliers some of the payment vouchers did not have authenticating documents like invoices or confirmation of deliveries for example the payment of us 121 000 to mobil oil in june 2005 vouchers 6p2025 26 and 27 refer were checked by the sen ior administration officer and authorized by the deputy representative oios established that the documentation was incomplete invoices totalling us 22800 were missing it was clear when the payment was approved that the approving officer was aware of the lack of docu ments but still made decision to initiate the payment subsequent to our audit the represent ation retrieved the required documents for another payment of us 21000 only photocopies of invoices instead of the originals supported the payment in different case there was confirmation that fuel costing us 37800 was delivered similarly carbon copies of i nvoices aggregating to us 7650 supported another payment to mobil in april 2005 v oucher 6p2023 refers oios would caution management against approving payments witho ut original and complete supporting documentation as they could be held accountable fo r any losses or unsubstantiated amounts relating to these transactions oios recommended th at sound management practices be adopted in response the representation referred to the im provements already made in 2006 47 oios attempted to reconcile the quantity of fuel or dered received and paid for however this was not possible due to the poor docum entation available and inadequate records maintained large difference of 22000 l itres costing about us 20000 was found between fuel received and fuel issued during januar and may 2005 explanation could be given for this variance in oios view poor intern controls exacerbated by the absence of division of responsibilities regarding procurement and access to physical stock in the representation led to the situation where amounts could not be reconciled assurance could not be obtained that all fuel paid for had been rec eived recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia in order to ob tain reasonable assurance over the transactions with mob il oil should reconcile the quantity ordered received and paid f or the representation should also ensure that only authent ic original documents such as invoices and receiving reports ar attached to the payment vouchers rec 09 48 the representation informed oios that the quantitie s ordered received and paid for had been reconciled also the original invoices had been received from voinjama oios takes note of the action taken and will close the recommendation on receipt of copy of the documents supporting the reconciliation of purchase orders receipts and payments 49 the representation paid us 248000 on duty for the fuel procured for the period from january 2004 to june 2005 the amount had bee n shown as receivable in the account vf 316 the representation however considering th financial constraints of the new government is not hopeful of recovery if this is the case and in the representation and bureaus view the matter has been properly pursued with the government appropriate action 12 should be taken in conjunction with the division of financial and administration management recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia should coordina and seek advice from the division of financial and admi nistration management on how to deal with the receivable of us 248000 relating to possible vat reimbursements for which r ecovery is doubtful an appropriate provision in the accounts should be made rec 10 50 the representation reiterated that several attempts has been made to recover the outstanding amount the representation in consultat ion with dfam continues to follow up this issue oios will close the recommendation on confirmation that either the amounts have been reimbursed or if this is deemed not possible that action has been taken to clearmake provision against the recorded receivable of us 24 8000 b unpaid invoices 51 oios noted that invoices totalling us 10000 rela ting to procurement transactions in 2004 and 2005 by the representation such as travel stationery and maintenance were received for payment only in the second half of 200 6 in oios opinion such delays in presenting invoices for payment if goods and servi ces have been received is not acceptable although these were not paid at the time of audit oios was unable to obtain reasonable assurance that they related to bona fide unhcr expe nses and whether or not they should be settled recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia should carefull review the invoices and other supporting documents to ensu re these relate to services and goods actually received als considering the delay in the submission of the invoices assura nce should be obtained that they are genuine have not been paid earlier and are based on established obligations rec 11 52 the representation stated that the above mentioned invoices were still pending and investigation was underway to confirm goods and ser vices had actually been received and had not yet been paid for before any further action can be taken the representation provided assurances that internal controls had been strength ened oios is pleased to note the positive action taken and will keep the recommendation open pending confirmation that an indepth review has been conducted to establish whether the invoices should be paid c vehicle workshop activities administration 53 the representation still maintained workshop head ed by an international unv with nonunhcr personnel employed under service agreemen ts to maintain administration vehicles while the programme vehicles are service d at the gtz managed workshops the decision to operate an independent garage was based on the view that gtz was too 13 expensive oios recommended in 2004 that if gtz pr oved to be too expensive it would be better to procure such services rather than to run workshop directly the situation however remained the same and there was evidence that costbenefit study had been completed or market survey conducted to ensure efficiencies we re gained by this approach 54 oios noted that between 1 january 2005 and 31 augus t 2006 the representation had spent about us 192000 for the maintenance of admi nistration vehicles account 462 cumulative expenditure of us 297000 from january 2004 the representation paid about us 25000 as rent for the monrovia workshop in ddition personnel costs and other overheads such as security and utilities were paid 55 the spare parts used in the workshop were procured locally and were several times more expensive than internationally procured ones in 2005 all spare parts were procured locally while in 2006 oios noted that there was consignment of imported spare parts and stock system was being established oios is plea sed to report on the improvements made but the cost effectiveness of establishing separa workshop and hiring project staff under service agreements is questionable and needs to be reviewed 56 oios visit to the workshop noted that over 60 per cent of the space was occupied by scrap and unroadworthy vehicles most of the vehic did not have number plates and had been deposited there number of years ago the representation commented that in may 2006 the process of submitting g45s for unroadwor thyvandalized vehicles to lamb had started the representation expected that by mid 20 07 the disposal of vehicles beyond repair would be finalized 57 oios also noted that administration vehicles from f ield offices were driven to the unhcr garage in monrovia for major repairs this h appened despite the availability of gtz workshop facilities in the area of operations in oios opinion the servicing of these vehicles by gtz would considerably improve operatio nal efficiency and would result in better utilization of the sunk costs and would res ult in some savings to unhcr furthermore with gtz poised to become regional p layer for fleet management activities from 2007 the usefulness of maintaining separate establishment for administration vehicles has become moot recommendations head2right the unhcr representation in liberia should entrust the repairs and maintenance of the administration vehicles to g tz as this would ensure better utilisation of unhcr resources and it should discontinue the running of its own workshop unless it is proven to be economically viable rec 12 head2right the unhcr representation in liberia should disconti nue hiring additional staff under service agreements this is not legal basis in unhcr for hiring of nonunhcr personnel r ec 13 58 the representation did not agree with the recommend ation 12 to discontinue its own vehicle workshop in monrovia they were of the opinion that as the bulk of the expenditure related to spare parts if this was egated to gtz or service provider it may result in higher costs oios takes note of the representations concerns ho wever since gtz 14 is already procuring spare parts on behalf of unhcr there should be economies of scale if further procurement is delegated to them as well s reduction in unhcr staffing costs oios will keep the recommendation open until cost benefit study has been conducted 59 the representation also stated that gtz does not ve facilities in the field to provide major repair services for light vehicles oios takes note of this but understands that gtz i s responsible for unhcrs programme vehicles whether in the field or in monrovia similar arrangement should be established for admin istration vehicles 60 the representation had taken note of the recommenda tion 13 to discontinue hiring additional staff under service agreements oios will keep the recommendation open until appropriate action has been taken to ensure personn hired by unhcr are provided with an employment contract that is in accordance with unhc rs rules d vehicle workshop activities gtz 61 oios visited gtzs workshop in monrovia voinjama nd saclepea gtz is using standalone databases in these locations to record w orkshop activities at the yearend the databases from different locations are consolidated in monrovia mainly for country level reporting purposes systems used included the proc urement receipt and use of spare parts receipt and distribution of fuel in 2006 gtz als put to use another database to improve planning management monitoring and reporting for fleet utilization this is currently operational in monrovia in general oios was sati sfied that gtz had established appropriate controls and procedures for the various workshop activities 62 in oios view gtz has the necessary infrastructure s ystems and details to provide critical reports relating to fleet management to et the information requirements of unhcr oios noted during the audit that the representation was still in the process of establishing the necessary reports and key performance indicators k pis for the various repairs and maintenance activities for their monitoring require ments oios recommended that the representation decide on the reports required from gtz in order to monitor fleet management activities oios also recommended that t he representation work closely with gtz to establish kpis for the various repairs and m aintenance activities the representation informed oios that the types of reports required fr om gtz to monitor the overall performance of the logistics operation in the liber ia had been communicated to gtz in october 2006 the first of the requesedt reports d been received in january 2007 discussions about kpis had been initiated with gtz oios is pleased to note the action taken 63 gtz spent over us 160000 in 2005 on local procure ment of spare parts in 2006 this had reached about us 300000 gtz explained that it was necessary to procure locally due to the delay in receiving them internationally the local spare parts were ten times more expensive than those procured internationally oios highlighted the need for proper planning to ensure the timely ordering and receipt of spare parts 15 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia should focus on better planning to source the required spare parts from th international market in order to keep local procurement to mini mum considering the price differential rec 14 64 the representation explained that there was lead time six months in most international procurement processes for spares and tyres which had led to the need to locally procure vehicle spare parts tangible and current example is the 2006 third quarter procurement of toyota and truck spare parts and var ious size tyres that would probably not even arrive in the first quarter of 2007 oios followed up this issue with sms and was told that the normal leadtime for spare parts after the requisition has been sent to sms is 14 weeks oios is of the opinion that with proper fo rward planning most of the spare parts could be procured cost effectively without adversel affecting operations oios will keep the recommendation open pending confirmation that longe rterm plans for spare parts procurement to be established warehousing 65 the value of the major nfis such as kitchen sets sleeping mats and blankets kept in warehouses in liberia at the time of audit was abou t us 14 million oios visited the gtz managed warehouses in monrovia saclepea and voinja ma manual system of record keeping was in place with information consolidated by gtz in monrovia oios assessed the procedures for receipt issuance and physical verif ication of stock items as satisfactory damaged items however although identified in all w arehouses had still been included in the stock records oios advised that the representatio n decide what action to take with the damaged items and instruct gtz to take them out of its inventory 66 oios observed in the warehouse in monrovia that alm ost half of the warehouse space had been taken up for over year by nfis like kitc hen sets blankets plastic buckets and used clothing donated by unmil the representation shoul d exhaust these goods in the next distribution cycles and reduce procurement accordin gly the representation commented that this stock is not available for general distributio n but has been allocated as an emergency stock for which its use had to be decided upon in c lose coordination with partners oios found that in the warehouse in monrovia medical sup plies including drugs valued at us 22000 were not stored under correct conditions these items had been in the warehouse for over month and the risk of deterioration and damage was high the representation informed oios that these items would be dispatched to various distribution points in the course of february 2007 f aircraft agreement with wfp 67 following interagency consultations it was decided that wfp would take responsibility for air operations this decision wa s applied in liberia in 2004 for the second half of 2005 unhcr paid us 980000 to wfp under technical service agreement for the provision of air transportation services in the region oios review of the payment vouchers disclosed that critical details such as pa ssenger manifests and the nature of the trips official or private were missing the representation explained that preflight manife sts were received one or two days before the flight oios takes note of this but these were not 16 the final manifests and the numbers did not match t he total number of passengers in the flight utilisation report upon enquiry oios was informed that wfps office in abidjan managed the aircraft and unhcr had little say in the entire operation 68 obtaining appropriate information from wfp or secur ing seat in the aircraft was reported as difficult furthermore unhcr passenge rs had priority with all these operational difficulties unhcr terminated the tech nical service agreement at the end of 2006 due to the missing information oios was not able to obtain assurance that the amounts paid to wfp were justified d administration 69 in the areas of administration and finance the unh cr offices in liberia generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures however some of the financial controls needed improvement cash in transit 70 due to the lack of banking infrastructure outside of monrovia cash had to be hand carried to field locations by staff members oios appreciated the difficulties and was pleased to note that losses had been reported or unnecessary risks taken by staff members 71 oios noted that cash transfers were not correctly r ecorded in the suboffices accounting records while the recording of the cas h transfers between the representation and the suboffices was satisfactory the recording of the us 700000 transfers between january 2004 and august 2006 from the representation to th field offices was deficient instead of recording it as an operational advance it was reco rded through vf 121 cash in transit moreover there was significant delay sometimes months in the recording of funds transferred by the representation to the field offi ces similarly there were delays in the reporting recording of the field offices transac tions the effects of these delays resulted in the accumulation of outstanding amounts in vf 121 nd the understatement of expenditure according to the findings of the then finance offic er from the representation about us 80000 pertaining to 2005 was recorded against the 2006 budget with several long pending items still in suspense and cash in transit accounts there is assurance that the expenditure recording for the past years was comple the representation explained that effective january 2007 cash transferred to field cations is recorded as an operational advance under vf369 also request had been sent t dfam to request the creation of petty cash books for two large field offices zwedru and h arper 72 considering the volume of cash transfers from the r epresentation to the field offices and highrisks involved in these transactions clos er monitoring of the recording and clearance of these transactions was warranted the finance of ficer based in the representation only visited the field offices to resolve many of the ac counting issues just prior to her reassignment this was insufficient and considera ble part of the exercise was left unresolved in oios opinion frequent visits to ov ersee the financial matters of the field offices would have been beneficial to provide guida nce and support to the offices as well as to properly monitor activities 73 with the arrival of the incumbent adminfinance off icer in the representation significant efforts have been made to clearreconci these outstanding balances 17 nevertheless considerable work is still to be done monitoring of receivables vf accounts 74 oios reviewed the reports of the receivable account s and found that there were large amounts outstanding sometimes dating back to 2003 oios also found that many transactions were incorrectly recorded for example vf 364 r eceivable account had credit balance of us 784000 which was substantially due to incorre ctly recorded adjustments of us 720000 made in may and july 2005 similarly bout 35 cases were found where travel advances vf 369 had negative balances indicating either excess recovery or more likely erroneous recording oios also noted that 28 cases of travel advances made during 2005 were not cleared this trend continued in the firs t half of 2006 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in liberia should undertak thorough review of all receivable accounts and all pending items in cash in transit and ensure that they are satisfacto rily clearedreconciled the representation should seek the advice of the division of financial and administration manage ment on the accounting for the transfer of funds to the field ffices and their expenditure recording rec 15 75 the representation informed oios that every effort had been made to clear all outstanding receivables the representation pointed out that more than 50 per cent of the amounts under accounts receivable were cleared by c losure of accounts in december 2006 the task is expected to be finalized mid 2007 oios appreciates the efforts made and will close the recommendation once we have been informed that the task to clear receivables has been completed and proper accounting for the transf er of funds has been implemented b human resources management 76 oios assessed that the human resources rules and pr ocedures were generally in place and operating effectively during the period reviewe d however oios noted that pars for 2005 had not been prepared in timely manner and i n november 2006 some 46 per cent of the pars were still outstanding c medevac 77 there were over 20 medevac cases in 2005 and 2006 though these cases were mostly processed in accordance with the established guidelines the documentation quality needs to be improved for example the control she et for medical evacuation was not available in most cases and there were separate files for medevac cases also most of the 2006 travel claims relating to medevac remained unsettled our review identified potential recoveries of dsa payments and the repres entation is followingup on this issue the representation agreed that the quality of medev ac documentation should be reviewed 18 vi acknowledgement 78 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistanc and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of unhcr and implementing par tners
