6809c27 class viii tape 4 standard tech defined and this the last time i looked was the twenty seventh thank you very much thank you very polite of you the last time i looked this was the twenty seventh of september ad eighteen and this is lecture what number four what do you know lecture four the reason im numbering these is so that nobody can come along and cut them all out probably the expect it some years from now that somebody will have figured it all out it would be much better if we had the lectures on case supervision taken out because if auditors are allowed insufficient latitude for their own imagination it cramps self determinism ruins cases but it cramps self determinism and you can expect sometime in the future that the thing is not well it actually isnt good thing the case supervisor he actually has to have latitude when were getting you see and the auditor should have tremendous latitude because itll give him too many case gains and stuff like that you know qual income is down ever since we started this standard tech qual income has gone out the bottom so the best thing to do is to subtract lecture three seven and nine dont you see from the lectures you know many ways of subtracting them such as simply tearing them up but somebody would at least know something was missing now we have something of that order coming up on your bulletins the truth of the matter is is im going over bulletins at this particular time so that all bulletins as you see then as of this moment are in actual fact being edited down into standard tech package but that doesnt change anything and if anything is in any way changed it will be to the basis of bringing it to an earlier standardization and it will simply be correction of some out line we apparently have forty or fifty bulletins in the line up which have been written by other people than myself and these occasionally contain errors the bulletins which youve got are not in this category i am sure but to give you some sort of an idea of it we in actual fact had there have been two changes in the standard processes both changes to the original i didnt theyd been changed one of those are the commands of arc straightwire which are being issued to you directly and immediately and the original commands of arc straightwire are those commands which crack neurotic cases and somebody with some enthusiasm along the line someplace cut off the last half of the command in each case but thats real case cracker the way it is originally recall something that is really real to you is the proper command and its never been otherwise but people with enthusiasms edit this material and every time it has been edited the material and workability has to marked degree been lost all of the listing tapes although there were lots of tapes called listing tapes on the saint hill course all of the key listing tapes and the key listing bulletins were removed from the saint hill course during the last two or three years and thats why you guys dont know nothing about listing you come to here i wouldnt give you penny for what you know about listing thats fact if you cant ratta tat tat ratta tat tat off the laws of listing popety popety pop and know that those are the laws those are the laws there arent any other laws there are exception to these laws these are the laws of listing those are the laws of listing that is how it is done it isnt done any other way there are exceptions of any kind whatsoever any list is listed that way do i make my point so dont ask any more questions about listing or ill bite your heads off anyhow asking whether or not the lists of four are done in this way now there is thing which isnt list which is actually repetitive process its whats been overrun it doesnt go to an item youre asking in actual fact the pc what has been overrun and you rehab each read you get its repetitive process you write it down so you know what youre rehabbing but as far as listing and nulling is concerned its nonnulled item as far as listing and nulling is concerned there are variables and its the one thing that the bulk of you who are studying this course dont know you dont know that youre dealing with an invariable science it has variabilities it is absolutely clank you have to begin by finding this out if you dont find this out you will never make class viii auditor its marvelous discovery you are in the process of discovering scientology thats right now lets take it up from the beginning what does the word scientology mean if there seems to be little bitterness in that scio is the word for truth and scio turns in to scien in that form which means truth and ology is the study of truth study of now if youre studying truth how the hell can there be variable truth by definition is what is there is direct relationship to the amount of variable in persons life and complications which are untruths and his state of case wag lies by the words and music lying is way of life how are you today i feel fine you look great mabel what pretty hat you have ive always liked it you listen to some of these birds theyre so bad off because theyve just been done in but they arent havent been done in they have been doing something in dont you see that is level of truth so that an ot comes up the line toward truth and the more truths there is in him the higher his case level by direct proportion so fellow comes in hes lying in his teeth lie lie lie alters alter alter vary vary vary quibble quibble quibble nya nya nya booboo dee dee boo boo you have direct immediate index of his case level hes nuts and this goes down and expresses itself as delusion the delusion of insanity the delusion of hop head the delusion of callagan or robinson oh my god the scientologists are all after pffft my contempt these characters we werent after them they practically had to take taxi cabs airbuses helicopters walk through mud struggle through storm anything else to get on our track we didnt even hear of them we didnt even know anything about them we couldnt have cared less if we had we arent in any line of country they have anything to do with the guy who is stuck on the track someplace the martians are after him fighting shadows fighting things that havent anything to do with him wars world wars whereby the germans says the english are horrible and the english say the germans are horrible and the germans say the english are trying to conquer the world and the english say the germans are trying to conquer the world and germans say the english are slaughtering babies and the english say the germans are slaughtering babies the amount of truth there is in connection with any war man has ever fought is undiscoverable with the worlds most powerful microscope so in the gravest insanities you get the greatest untruth so the road is road of truth at seven there was step known as the incredibles as you go up the line you discover the incredibles things that happened to the individual which are true but not believable the incredibles that is one of the points of auditing stripping out the incredibles off the time track now you know how much youd be believed if you walked into the barber shop and says well i put ten cents down on sky rover in the third race and he paid off two million to one and i made couple of hundred thousand dollars and my wife thought of the idea in dream and so thats why i did it you know only it happens to be true but you cant believe it because the odds are too great against it see i had trouble with this when i was kid i was everyplace and anyplace and into anything and all over the planet at the time when people were not traveling all over the planet and i eventually got to point where i couldnt talk about my adventures i actually hit level of untruth of minimizing what i had done and been thats the reduction of incredibles there are various ways by which something can be or seem untrue various ways so anyway scientology is well named it is the road to truth it is study of the truth and total truth is total power and when the guy hasnt got any lies left in him hes ot and all the mechanics of ot work out too so the subject is very very well named and thats what scientology means its the study of truth to which could be added the technology of achieving truth and i have list here whereby several students dont know what standard tech is dont know what the word standard means havent any idea now if somebody doesnt know that there is subject called scientology which is main line subject which has certain number of hair line processes which make up direct route he needs an academy course he shouldnt be here those are brutal words science is body of truths technology is body of truths now somebody who cant confront action or something like that thinks truth would be datum of some kind or another well truth can also be an action and the road through all of the untruths of person from all the way south to all the way north has been mapped it exists it has been on chart for years there have been bulletins which announced its processes the doingness of those processes are exact precise there arent two ways to do them there is one way to do them and that is what you are here learning and if you cant learn that basic fundamental you might as well quit now you are not learning this wide subject of philosophy youre not learning every students got chance to think his own opinion right now youre not learning that right now youre learning the technical application of exactly how it is done exactly to whom it is done exactly and precisely the steps and actions taken to an exact precise results and thats what youre learning and you havent anything to do with how many needles sit on the head of an angel now case supervision you were given some folders to case supervise then doing case supervision of them you decided what was wrong with the pc which is direct violation of the auditors code evaluative case supervision will be your downfall it comes to this he couldnt or didnt make this grade your job is to make sure he made the grade now whats wrong with the pc is he hasnt made that grade the major gains of the pc are always the next grade you wont ever get any gains on pc compared to making the grade all your job is is to start the pc in at the beginning of the assembly line and make sure that hes correctly run to the end of the assembly line and thats your whole job and when you do case supervision dont ever let hear you say again to the end of your career an evaluative statement about pc because you dont know you do certain basic standard actions basic action standard action and the case falls apart you have to know your stable data boy you have to know your stable data so you can mutter it in your sleep you look into one of these folders if you know your business you instantly will look at list the list was complete the pc was given his item the question read to begin with didnt dead horse you have to know data like this dead horse question didnt read to begin with dont list question unless it reads question didnt read dont list it question read item found on the list pfff its either incomplete or it needs to be extended it needs to be extended or the items been suppressed you find theres little list four things which you do with list very standard elementary elementary now lets go into the definition of the word standard i want to put you in good frame of mind now im not mad at you at all theres animosity standard the word standard as taken from rodells synonym finder the word standard and it says here it is universal accepted common normal of recognized excellence or authority final definitive authoritative conclusive reliable preferred classic timeless accepted orthodox staple official cathedral doctrinal ultimate canonical and authentic thats the word the synonyms of the word standard and now we have the oxford illustrated dictionary and we will read here the definition of the word standard i want to call to your attention that my messenger looked these up for the word standard standard its distinctive flag its banner with royal arms its flag of cavalry regiment its rallying principle one of the meanings of standard is carrying banner forward now its weight or measure to which others conform or by which the accuracy of others is judged its legal proportion of weight as in fine metal and alloy in gold and silver coin its degree of excellence which is the meaning which we have required for particular purpose its thing recognized as model for imitation recognized as possessing the merit of authority degrees of proficiency class studying to reach this lets take another dictionary and this is the universal english dictionary were getting up in weight here my messenger had hard time lifting these off to look them up for you actually our sea org messengers are very proud of themselves theyre moving up toward ten thousand word vocabulary which is exactly twenty times that of the average college student do you know the average college student knows five hundred words its true once more its banner standard banner hearing royal or national arms flown only by the sovereign flag of the cavalry regiment etcetera etcetera of gold style mode type accepted recognized by convention within community at given time as criterion of what is best in speech behavior conduct action face morality to which we add technology what is the best and now we will pick up bigger dictionary this is websters third international dictionary it is couple of volumes because they couldnt get all the words into one and its in india paper in microscopic print and my messenger has very good eyesight to find it at all standard its rallying place flag to mark rallying place pole or spear bearing some conspicuous object man we havent even gotten down to anything else definite level or degree of quality that is proper and adequate for specific purpose the word standard the word standard it means definite level or degree of quality that is proper and adequate for specific purposes and that one you can star rate got it and now we will look up the word technology i dont want anybody with any misunderstoods here i havent looked these up my messenger looked these up for technology is scientific study of practical arts its practical arts collectively terminology of particular art or subject technique is manner of execution or performance manner of execution or performance im gonna get this big dictionary up here and it says here technique is systematic and special method employed in carrying out some particular operation skill in practical acquaintance with the methods of some particular art specialized procedure operation and the like thats technique now technology science of the mechanical industrial arts contrasted with the fine arts technologist as student is one who is versed in technology and lets get this big one back here i dont know whether i can find it on this page or not its so microscopic there is technique techno technology is the terminology of particular subject its the technical language its the science of application of knowledge to practical purpose applied science the science of the application of knowledge to practical purpose applied science have you got it now theres animosity connected with this at all this is perfectly friendly but scientology has very definite body of technical application which is the only body of technical application in all of the data of scientology there are not two ways to do anything in scientology in 1966 this was totally summated and it is time that auditors ceased to be airyfairy about it going up the line right now we have the fact that scientology applied as you are being trained to apply it produces 100 result and applied with the airyfairy i dont know what were doing duh duh duh duh i have lots of opinions on this subject i think id better case supervise i think this guy must have missed withholds after they got five items reading on the list and it was four pages long he threw the cans at the auditor obviously he has missed withholds scientology misapplied applied contrary to standard tech produces back fires that are not the pcs fault standard tech is entirely under the control of the case supervisor and the auditor the preclear the preot is entirely under the control of the case supervisor and the auditor just so you know that well the preclear doesnt have missed withholds which is why the session failed bes entirely under the control of the case supervisor and the auditor and if he didnt make it it is the fault of the case supervisor and the fault of the auditor nobody elses there is escape safety valve if he went out and got drunk and fell on his head between sessions why the hell didnt you audit him fast enough so he didnt have chance its time we took responsibility for the guy in the chair because properly case supervised you get one zero zero per centium one hundred cases out of one hundred cases if you dont get it youre flubbing the old timer he got pretty good dianetic auditing and so forth they got about 50 they got about 50 improvement as technology advanced and as it was expertly applied the percentage advanced 22 1 2 of all cases will get well if you pat them on the head if you show them green door if you put an ice cream cone in their hand if you give them sugar pills if you simply give them advice 22 1 2 of all the people that come in the line up will get well so the zero percentage is 22 1 2 you gonna get 22 1 2 anyhow right wrong upside down or backwards youre gonna get twenty two and half so you get one of these 22 1 2 you run squirrel process and he says he got well so you think that squirrel process must have been bah nonsense now you can push this up the line and you want to know where the psychiatrist is and so forth he doesnt even get one percent hes doing 22 1 2 percent damage thats how you measure it and auditors very bad auditor you get less than 22 1 2 percent he expect that in any event now the skill and the excellence of the technology and excellence of its application the standardness of it will push the percentage up and through the years it went to higher percentages and higher percentages and higher percentages and you as class viii are looking at the per centium of one zero zero per centium any thing that falls below 100 percent is because somebody goofed boy the case supervisor or the auditor somebody goofed now it may take you two or three sessions it may take you repair before you can execute the final action you may have been fed bum datum by the auditor and then as case supervisor called for wrong action and then youll find this out fast enough because the guy didnt come out of it so then youve got to go back and find out what it is you send the preclear to the examiner you get him run on seven button assessment the seven different types of things you can get him run on general assessment form green form an l4a various things for various purposes you find out you put it to rights and then you get your 100 it isnt 100 percent one session but if you go for two or three goofed up sessions followed by four or five repairs which are goofed up repairs of goofed up sessions and then you repair the repair of the repair and so forth youre not going to get your 100 percent but out of the cases which pass beneath your nose you had better you had better better better get one zero zero because the technology is there with which to achieve it and if you dont know its there well put you in an academy someplace to learn some of your basics because the road is very simple road and the most difficulty you are having right at this moment is asking these marvelously complicated questions of yourselves you see table sitting in the middle of the room i am telling you it is table it is sitting in the middle of the room and you say lets see should it go to the antique side how far is it how long has it been sitting there what are the ramifications and complications in the material of the table is the table really substantial if an elephant sat down on the table would it stand up im just trying to tell you for god sakes theres table sitting in the middle of the room there is table sitting in the middle of the room and that is the total isness of it i tell you that you do the ruds to fn therefore you start in with an arc break you got present time problem you check for missed withhold and so somewhere along there shes gonna fn if you know anything about your trs at all you really cant miss so it fns your rudiments are now done so the pc is set up to be audited now you audit what the main body of the session was supposed to be which is some major action you complete the major action to fn and maybe one two three major actions you complete them all and you end off the session on an fn and if your trs are very good hell come back into the next session still with an fn if you cannot get an fn on your rudiments you of course do gf green form and you get an fn on that and that is setting the case up and looking at your folders youve been trying to get case gains out of green forms well sure somebody feels better on green form youre trying to get case gains trying to solve cases what the hell are you trying to solve cases for theyre problem theyre problem to cs theyre not problem to an auditor you do the usual and the case solves itself its too easy it is too simple and your complex figurefigurefigurefigurefigure oh my god figurefigurefigurefigurefigure is just all over your god damned plate and youre sitting there saying i wonder what the pcs thinking next and so forth and waffwaffwaff and doo doo doo thhthhhthh relax you start in with oh i wonder whats this look at this christ look whats happened oh my god id better do something about this youve got cs right in front of you perhaps your cs and it says pcpow pcpow pcpowpowpowpowpow you do it and if your cs knows his business or if youre the cs you already knew the ta was at six and half and you simply took it down thats all now what why would the ta be at six and half you go back to the folder youll find out fast enough the guy went through five blow downs on listing one of the 5a processes and the auditor gave him the last blowing down item powers supposed to be listed to the first blow down if you list it to more than one blow down youre gonna be in trouble there and the pc after the session might feel great for an hour he might feel great for two hours but sometime between then and the next two or three days he is going to feel like hell you violate the rules of standard tech and the pc feels like hell you follow the rules of standard tech and the pc feels good and thats all there is to it some day if you get through this course alive someday you will look back on your beginning think as completely ridiculous you will be sitting there knocking cases off left and right pongety pongety pongety pongety bung bang hundred percent hundred percent plongetybing plongetybing plongetybing god damn that auditor he slipped in that session ill write your cs repair this wong wong bong bong and there she goes hundred percent hundred percent pocketa pocketa pocketa and you look back at your earlier auditing career i draw curtain over your thoughts but did you ever see somebody walk on stage and play pianer some fellow walks on stage and he plays the piano mario fenninger walks in shoots his cuffs sits down bowwow you know that piano really goes boy that piano really goes now you can say it looks very simple to mario fenninger thats right he knows hes supposed to strike certain keys and he gets certain results there isnt any other airyfairy think about it only he knows where the keys are bettern any body else and thats class viii auditor same piano and you see some academy auditor he comes in and wonder where c is and where where wheres the lid to this thing you know lid well i got the lid open now lets see what are these black and white things ill look it up in the instruction book over here black and white things keys those are keys very good now you expect him to play moonlight sonata huh its piano but it isnt any where near as difficult as piano to learn how to play the biggest hump is learning that its very simple action its not careless action terribly simple you go out and you see an expert marksman and he throws the rifle up to his shoulder booms bulls eye bulls eye you say gee thats easy and you go out and you look for where the trigger is and you look where the bolt is where the magazine is and you look down there to see if its loaded and you take it up and this damn straps getting in your road somehow or another my god youre so damned introverted looking at the weapon you never get chance to look at the target and the reason most auditors never see whats going on in the pc is the auditor doesnt really even know how to handle an emeter he sits down i wonder if ive got the sensitivity right ive got to ive got to write this down never mastered the art of handling the tone arm of the meter with his theme while hes writing down the auditors report and lets see what do i say next same thing he just doesnt know his tools well enough you take somebody walks in with camera got camera bes ruddy amateur if hes ruddy amateur if he looks at this camera and he takes good look at it and he says wheres the lens where do i put the film in what is this whats this glass in front oh thats the lens yes and i wonder what all these rings are well ill look it up in the instruction book here oh that is the lens now lets see how do i get this camera open to get some film in it and so on finally opens it up finally gets some film in it loaded some how or another then hes going around wheres the trigger wheres the trigger lets see wheres the trigger now im going to take picture and god damn hes so involved in trying to handle this piece of stuff that he is completely unfamiliar with that honest to pete the pictures he takes are complete stinking disgrace he thinks hes doing good to be able to point it horizontal now we take some guy hes got piece of camera hes familiar with cameras he can take this thing and he flips the back of it open he throws the film in while talking to you about something or other sets it up and so forth now he looks around and theres the picture he hasnt got any attention on that camera boy theres the picture so so here powie he can see over there because his attention isnt introverted here standard tech then requires that one know his tools know the laws of the game know the correct action so instinctively and so instantaneously that he never has to think thing to do it his attentions on the pc pc gives indicator sixteen the auditor does what hes supposed to do just think well what do you know pcs talking about an arc break but it isnt reading now he knows his technology sufficiently well and he knows the pc talking about an arc break that isnt reading its missed withhold arc breaks that dont read are missed withhold standard datum you dont say i think you know actually ron said something about when the thing didnt read nuts see its bonkers what whats all this think and cross think and wonder and so forth if you hold up your hand and turn your hand over palm up and then turn your hand over palm down do you know what youd had to do as thetan if you could think of the number of channels and muscles and nerve centers and things and this and so on which it took to turn your hand right side up and upside down you would go practically bonkers and i assure you you wouldnt be able to do it you ask somebody who is ballerina you can actually throw off ballerina who is not quite on the ball not quite she puts good show on and so on but shes not quite there if you say how do you balance on your toe how do you balance on your toe now if shes on the ball shed look at you and say why you balance on your toe of course you idiot the great dancer is totally simple you ask some artist how should you paint this picture what should you do well if hes sort of only painting reactively and he doesnt know his business hes knocked into cocked hat instantly hes knocked right off of it but if he really knows his business he just says ho hum and goes on with his work why why do you put green like that why do you put stripe of green like that and so forth and hed look at you and say what looks better now you ask some flooky mug maybe an art teacher some place and you say now why do you put green across the picture well this gives the collateral effect to extensive distance and balances the color combination because in actual fact the color wheel if you see it over here has complimentary color you see its green and if you dont put green there then youll get concavity of the lumbosis the maddest thing i ever saw in my life i gave lecture to short story class one time been giving lot of lectures to writers classes and things like this in universities and places and i walked up on the rostrum and there were all the assembled students and lying on the rostrum was one of my current magazine stories lying open to my story which was the lead story of the magazine and the instructor had taken every single one of the sentences of the opening of the story and deep into the body of the story and had marked each one of them for shadowing suspense element you know and all according to technology which i knew but i hadnt thought of for years and i was fascinated i looked at this and just for moment wondered how it would be to be all thumbs so youd have to while you were writing story say we had better foreshadow some action now if scientologys definition is the road to truth then what are the progressive grade processes they are those barriers in that order which keep person from going forward to an ultimate truth so if you looked at normal pc you might see something on the order of where he is parked in diddywadiddy you ever hear of diddywadiddy thats actually ten miles on the other side of hell and thats where the people in hell go on their night out but anyway hes over here in diddywadiddy now hes going to walk all the way the whole route see now these grades are the gates across the road one nobody knew the road they didnt know he was down there they didnt know any of the gates across the road and standard tech simply takes this fellow and it walks him right straight up the lines through these exact gates and if you walk him through any other gates youre just detouring there arent any other barriers on the track these are the shut gates on his road up the line and they are the grade processes and it isnt just an illusion it is the fact and because it is fact if you know your job expertly you simply go along and open these gates for him shove him through go to the next gate open it and shove him through and open the next gate and shove him through now theres eight thousand seven hundred and fifty billion other things you could do with the case none of which would put him any further along the road hes supposed to travel but boy would they be interesting and any time else in mans history all theyve done is they did find out there might be somebody in diddywadiddy and they just sent him little closer to hell didnt even have the dream that there might be road out so how far up the line do you have to come to grasp this thing called standard tech there is guy theres dream of road out there is road theres complete ocean of wrongnesses but what has been isolated are the exact barriers to the exact road that takes him out and he goes right up the line brrrrrrrmm now along with that is the communication of the technology and the training technology of the person to teach him to do that these are fantastic wins they are so airyfairy and so starryeyed and so far beyond anything man ever envisioned there all by itself its little bit hard to grasp but you just accept it its road out theres dream to get out theres road out therere just exactly so many gates across the road standard tech one right after the other opens the gate and standard tech when the guy has gone over in the left field right field off the road into the telegraph pole something like that also gives you the technology of taking him out and putting him back on the road and there arent eight ways to do it and it doesnt require any opinions lets say weve got concrete path that goes from to b and we start walking down this concrete path and all of sudden somebody rushes up and says actually youre supposed to walk over there in the gravel along the side of the edge of the mole you know and you swim for little bit and thats really how you get up to b what kind of jackass is it that would walk over to the mole and jump in well hed have to be somebody who didnt have any idea there was any any concrete walk there well the first thing you learn about standard tech is one there is walk there now one of the ways you learn this is subjectively now i dont want to invalidate anybodys case i dont want to invalidate anybodys reviews but this pile of crap ive got sitting here is how not to do it now also theres an infinity of ways not to do it you can always have an infinity of wrongnesses around one rightness and the rightnesses are very few so if you learn the rightnesses well then the wrongnesses to hell with it do you follow you can get an infinity of ways to do something wrong well work it out for yourself start counting up the number of ways to sink rowboat those are all wrongnesses now the ways to row rowboat if it is rowboat not sculling boat you can stand up and row it you can sit down and row it you can row it with two men you can row it with one man but the right way to row rowboat is to put the oars into the water and apply some energy to the handles pick the oars out of the water and replace them into the position where they can be reinserted into the water to apply some energy now somebody comes along and he says to you yes well how do you row rowboat well theres several ways you can row rowboat thats for sure you can stand up and face the bow you can sit down and face the stern you can stand up and face the stern you can put man on the right oar and man on the left oar you can have two sets of oars sounds like lot of variables but let point out that the oars on the right side and the oars on the left side of the boat are doing exactly the same thing matter what arrangement is made if youve got trireme bireme it doesnt matter if youve got life boat if youve got little fishing dory youre doing the same thing in each particular case now if you lose sight of the fact that the oar is supposed to go into the water and push the water back if you lose sight of that you may have great deal of theory and great many questions but the boat wont go anywhere thats normally what happens to science somebody finds out about rowing boat and then for years and years and years guys add to it and eventually the rowing of the boat longer functions and the boats dont row any more and they have to invent an entirely new technology of getting through water you think im kidding the movies the movies show us in biremes old menowar with double oar banks of greek times shows us shows us all of these oars going while somebody is going bong bong on drums or something at the back of the boat in order to keep all the oars in turn if you take life boat out and every rower on the starboard side fails to exactly follow the motions of the aftermost starboard rower whos called the stroke oar and if the port aftermost rower who is the port stroke does not follow exactly the motions of the other stroke the boat looks like centipede with busted legs man has actually pretty well forgotten how to row boats mass rowing of boats big boats because they let the coxswain count and you hear all your demonstration when your coxswain count the stroke the coxswain cant count the stroke strokes are counted by the stroke oar there wouldnt be any reason to hammer drum because nobodys following drum theyre following stroke oar so why why would anybody pound the drum just for one oarsman you could sit down along side of this oarsman and say ok stroke stroke theres reason to waste your lungs as matter of fact the entire rowing of the boat is going to be completely ruined it looks like some wildly galloping centipede going along now i know very well that they did it properly in greek and roman times because they speak of the white wings out of the galleys the white wings of the galleys now youd immediately in sail period and so on youd think they meant think they meant canvas or sails or something they didnt they meant those double banks of oars because it looks just like it just looks like big bird flying at you the oars are flapping see on both sides you see them go up and down looks like flying bird that is sitting down in the water they never rowed that evenly by calling stroke or with drums and the other day i was looking through book as to how you rowed life boat and it said the coxswain called the stroke he doesnt if he does nobody can row the boat so look if this fundamental piece of technology can be wrecked by the simple action of making the wrong person count cadence or rhythm do you see that workable piece of technology is very easily unsettled and upset so the thing that keeps standard tech standard is following standard tech not anybody elses advice so somebody comes along and he says we got brand new process which is riddlediddledepoggledings and so on and weve got this brand new meter which we attach to the toes of the pc and it makes him wiggle his ears well ill probably still be around youd better send it to for check up to make sure this case ill tell you something absolutely ghastly in eighteen solid years of research i kept the door wide open to any research suggestion of any kind whatsoever and from the moment i wrote the last sentence of dianetics the modern science of mental health right on up the line i would have been only too glad to have accepted workable action but every time i did it got us in trouble it might have stayed with it short period of time it might have appeared workable short period of time but in the final analysis it got us in trouble i know how little things can change and what you havent watched is that scientology and dianetics were developed grade by grade 1950 running of engrams running of engrams fascinating just before the running of engrams there was straightwire then engram running developed heavily secondaries secondaries were developed in their proper position and place the whole subject evolved along this particular line and do you know why and what was the clue and why these became the grades and why these are run in that sequence its because theyre the collection of those things which if violated prevent any advance of the case if one of those things are out then the case never goes ot simple and its in that sequence and the width of the road is about one onethousandth of one micrometer the variability is zero the wins are one zero zero theres brand new approach youre looking at new world now somewhere up the line you get to start auditing this and when you start auditing this youre gonna get so damned dizzy and powerhappy somebodyll probably have to shoot you down with shot gun because guy just goes completely wild normally speaking he goes wild on this he he does exactly right he does exactly what hes supposed to do the pc all of sudden goes zzzooooooommmm just like hes supposed to do and he all of sudden realizes he can do it and you cant speak to him for days and then the mistake he makes is he now thinks he can case supervise also this is another field its based on the same principles but you have to know if you have to know it well to audit it you have to know it ten times as well to case supervise it now i i know i caught that that thered been one or two people in this class who were case supervisors at saint hill and so forth and you can put it down to my charity that you havent been ground up for hamburger because what i see here wow i taught you better than this there was thing called standard tech there has been thing called standard tech since 1966 but nobodys caught the brass ring so im putting that brass ring firmly in your paw im not trying to make you guilty im merely trying to give you one hundred percent win one hundred percent if you get less than hundred percent you goofed if you get less than one hundred percent as case supervisor you goofed less than hundred percent as an auditor you goofed some of the goofs are beyond your control and sometimes you hit real goof that you cant do anything about at all and those are the goofs which you shouldnt goof on you told the auditor to do so and so and so and so and the auditor did something else he just got letter from yongobongo and yongobongo he said when i was studying yogi i found out that if the preclear sat in an ibis position he really decided hed try that see and he didnt follow your cs exactly and youve got loused up case and then because its going to be day or two between sessions he goes and walks under street car and that cuts your percentage doesnt it cases that are well audited dont go to ethics cases that are badly audited wind up in ethics all too often now when youre dealing purity when youre dealing with purity of technology the weapon in your hands has such velocity that it isnt the airyfairy days where you couldnt cut below the reality of the pc and louse him up there were years past where the technology as it went along did not plow under and overthrow the reality level of the pc well youre not dealing with it now youre dealing with the pure dynamite now an explosives expert has often been known to carry nitro glycerin in flask in his hip pocket all he had to do was back up suddenly into something and he would have fragmented all over the landscape ive seen dynamite men sit on boxes of fuses smoking and yet heres this guy who is the nitro glycerin soup expert the soup expert and somebody else even looks like hes going to touch bottle of soup and he practically throttles him you walk in toward the dynamite powder house with cigarette in your hands and the guy who is smoking his pipe on the box gets up and kicks you the hell out of the yard in other words he knows enough about it so he can ride it close to the edge and hes also smart enough to know youd better not let anybody else do you see youre dealing actually with terrifically powerful technology used right it just shoots guy to the moon goofed up pooey and goofed up cases are too many now it takes supervisor who knows his business you can run engrams on somebody you can do this with somebody you can do that with somebody you can run various processes you can run if you can get an idea of of highway running through the middle of lot of blackness and lot of little pathways and all that sort of thing you can run any of those little pathways you can run any of those open fields you can do anything out there that you want to you can goof around and flubbledubble and bobblefobble and and so forth pc isnt getting anyplace you cant do him any damage to amount to anything but you get on the main highway it is such straight highway the actions in opening the gates are so positive that when you goof that up the pc will goof up do you follow now if theres big question in your mind as to whether or not scientology works you shouldnt be studying class viii because one is expected to be sufficiently expert auditor to produce some result such as touch assist he should be able to do that and achieve some result but if one has got big questions about this and that please recognize them for what they are theyre just confusion blowing off there is just about as much question in running rehab or the mechanisms of rehab there isnt any questions concerning it there are questions with regard to listing there arent any you list and you list it as long as it contains an item on it and two on the list you extend the list and give the pc the item and what the hell i mean this is something like saying box of matches on the table is either full of matches or its not full of matches if it is not full of matches and the matches are dumped along side of it and if the object is to restore it you pick up the matches put them in the box and put the box together again and you have box of matches i mean its open and shut data like that i mean it isnt any wibblewobblewooble it its just truth see so you start watching for these simplicities but what does it take to be totally simple it takes total knowledge of the lot save such familiarity that you never even have to think to do it now how often would you have to field strip rifle so that you could pick it up put the cartridge into it and fire it without even thinking well theres rifle clank boom poom how often would you have had to have field stripped that rifle probably dozens of times back in the days when medicine was medicine and not parke and davis and other drug companies pushing their stock up medical doctor used to have to identify all of the bones of the human skeleton blindfolded by touch alone interesting exercise well what would be the point of such an exercise well its kind of pointless you very seldom operate in the dark but it sure as the devil gives you familiarity you know what bone is where when youve done something like that now therere various actions and exercises which you can do and you can action them and exercise them but if you have any comm lag if there is any comm lag between your think and the datum youre trying to get you dont know standard tech well enough to do it if there s any comm lag in you instantly thinking of the law of listing that you need to apply at that instant if you had to think of it as law of listing as something that came off of bulletin you havent got it yet you understand you have to its total its total you own it you do it and so forth you look at the list and it isnt i wonder where all of it you look at this list you say that list isnt correct you just look at it as i would with any of these oh i could do this at random list just incorrect yes good yes yes didnt find any correct list well anyhow imagine case supervisor now who would have to have his whole bulletin file along side of him to have reference to go over and find any of the errors which had been made in the session in order to order them corrected in case the trouble i have in case supervision is trying to read the auditors writing its that degree of simplicity i know my data but you say well of course you know the data you wrote the data naturally you know the data you developed the data well listen god damn it ive developed more data than you ever heard of you know ive just developed data by the wow the total notes of dianetics and scientology the total tapes of dianetics and scientology are an ocean of data tremendous fantastic scope how is it that i know these central data so well when i started doing cchs when i started doing model session i set myself up just like you and i drilled it till i knew it cold i could write down the laws of listing again after lapse of several years even though the bulletin that recorded them originally had been removed from the lines and i wrote them from memory and i think it took something on the order of about fifteen twenty minutes the slowdown was alex sabirskys ability to keep up with my writing now i know more phenomena than you can count which are contrary to those laws of listing which seem to be this which off woff phenomena than that or is it the other way and so forth how is it that i would know those laws of listing well i had to keep check on things that didnt have variables i eventually isolated those things and theyre the things with variables so i had to write all those things down i had to know those i had to read them back i had to remember these things i had to know em you think youre studying this subject why hell ive studied ninety five times the subject you ever studied alright then how is it that out of this whole body of stuff i can pick so neatly this and that and so as to do case supervision about as fast as i can read it it is knowing my data knowing which datum is the datum which applies at this particular point and what datum has been violated and otherwise and youve got the same data ive got in your study packs simple as that i dont do these folders from crystal balls boy i do these just these folders against the most concise series of data you ever heard of srrrrrpboom we cracked case today down the middle down the middle crosswise and diagonally it was just about hed given us bad time we keep cracking em knowing the data knowing the exact basic rules and laws now theres something funny about all this i know lot of other subjects in which such data occurs i can give you the datum of freudian analysis im very good swami i can read minds so as to tear your skull off good at it dont ever do these things still know the data in connection with it why then out of this tremendous body of information are we stressing just these data ive got us the widest possible selection its the evaluation of importance knowing which point is valuable and what is trash it is knowing where the main line lies and where it doesnt i wouldnt give you spit for any datum in freudian analysis i wouldnt give you dog spit for it in fact freud and broyer probably should have been stood up against the nearest brick wall and shot unpleasantly with dull bullets youve always heard be polite on that subject im taking down my hair im talking to class viii student what lot of crap you know who they really were they were some guys who had found out how you could take the work of charcot and mesmer and persuade people to do things against their will under paindrug hypnotism and there isnt an analyst on the planet who ever does anything else in the its method of shaking people down and bending their will brayer and freud in 1891 were agents of kaiser wilhelm hogensoloven and they were dedicated to making politicallyminded changes for him bunch of crap complete swindle just hypnotist so he invents the libidodibido theory and he goes pooglypoods and ids and greek mythology and bah therere certain principles involved in any savage and primitive think that you can use certain principles involved theres certain magical principles theres opening up somebodys memory making him forcing him or persuading him to remember something painful and so forth these are known to every medicine man every swami there is how is it they knew it and never used it huh right now right now the beautiful technology heh of these characters is turned against scientology because the politicians you hear crying out against them have wives who have been violated by psychoanalysis they are under the influence there are thousands of zones where data could lie therere billions of zones where that you could consider truth theres whole universe out here full of crap and bucks and i show you one little narrow line that goes straight through it like shock and few gates which if you open them exactly correctly somebody goes out like he is on rocket ride so if you ever mention to again question about something over in left field ill have you spanked this is lousiest thing what the hell is anybody doing wandering around over here in left field heres the main road lets get on it lets find out what the principles on it are i didnt mean to curse you that mildly heres the main highway now knock off the mucking about and get on it there arent any questions about it it just is and its certain series of actions that you do and they wind up at the other end in total result so do it boom thats all there is to it and as far as case supervision your main trouble will be trying to convince the auditors auditing for you that theyd better damn well do what you say on case supervision folder and not some other crappy thing and then you will have to convince them because of your ferocity on this whole subject you will have to convince them that theyd better damn well speak the truth by making false report far worse than just goof these problems are ahead of you the first thing you must learn is that there is road you can learn it subjectively easy enough or i could turn lose division five on you left right and center clean up all the flubs and bubs and so forth and send you flying with the greatest of ease if anything wrong with your case or bogged down youd wonder where the hell you what what you ever thought was gain before this well im not going to do that im going to let you get win on each other in the org student course we could make make your cases zongobingo so fast itd make your head swim but then weve got all the wins we want you can have it too and you can also be the effect end of the goofs so anyway that is everything i have to say to you this evening and i hope something i have said will assist you on your road to truth thank you
