patterson for reasons 14 bd 1 snf summary xxxxxxxxxxxx who has been designated by high commissioner for refugees antonio guterres as xxxxxxxxxxxx in pakistan met with the ambassador and deputy chief of mission on december 13 to discuss the us governments position on the possible movement of baloch leader brahmdagh bugti from afghanistan to country of asylum he requested us intervention with pakistani authorities if unhcr agrees to facilitate this movement xxxxxxxxxxxx brahmdaghs uncle reportedly told xxxxxxxxxxxx that the government of ireland has agreed to offer asylum to bugti although unhcr has not yet confirmed this offer at the request of unhcr the ambassador agreed to engage president zardari and have the embassy follow up with interservices intelligence isi to ensure that the gop would not act against such transfer or negatively respond to unhcrs potential involvement in subsequent conversation however dgi isi pasha registered to cos the pakistan militarys opposition to allowing bugti to obtain refugee status while getting bugti out of afghanistan is still good idea we do not believe unhcr should be involved end summary 2 c xxxxxxxxxxxx met recently with xxxxxxxxxxxx who sought unhcr support in facilitating the movement out of afghanistan of brahmdagh bugti nawab akbar khan bugtis grandson and head of the baloch republican party xxxxxxxxxxxx reportedly told xxxxxxxxxxxx that the government of ireland was willing to receive brahmdagh bugti who had to get out of afghanistan and would not be safe returning to pakistan xxxxxxxxxxxx also contended that the usg would be supportive of this transfer note xxxxxxxxxxxx has met with embassy poloffs several times to float the idea of moving bugti sharing with us that irelands deputy prime minister is willing to help bugti gain asylum there end note 3 c xxxxxxxxxxxx sought meeting on december 13 with the ambassador to discuss the usg position on the potential transfer of bugti although unhcr has yet to verify irelands willingness to receive him or to make determination as to whether bugti is eligible for refugee status the british government has previously refused to consider asylum for bugti according to xxxxxxxxxxxx while unhcr believes that moving bugti from afghanistan and from close proximity to and influence in baloch insurgent activity in pakistan would be in the pakistani governments interest high commissioner guterres is concerned that unhcrs potential involvement in this transfer could have negative impact on unhcrs humanitarian access operations and security in pakistan unhcr is seeking assurances that the pakistani government will not act against such transfer or penalize unhcrs potential involvement in it xxxxxxxxxxxx told the ambassador that his meeting with xxxxxxxxxxxx and all unhcrs interaction with baloch leaders have been carefully monitored by pakistani intelligence 4 c unhcr will hold an inhouse meeting to be attended by xxxxxxxxxxxx to discuss more generally what to do with regard to the baloch in afghanistan besides bugti there are few hundred baloch in kandahar largely from dera bugti xxxxxxxxxxxx explained he said that recognizing these baloch as refugees would be well received by the pakistani baloch community which believes unhcr has been insufficiently supportive of them despite baloch assistance in facilitating the release of kidnapped unhcr quetta suboffice head john solecki but would not be wellreceived by the government of pakistan islamabad 00003037 002 of 002 5 c the ambassador told xxxxxxxxxxxx that the usg would be supportive of moving bugti out of the region but said that unhcr would need to confirm first irelands willingness to grant him asylum she and xxxxxxxxxxxx both expressed concern about the possible implications of xxxxxxxxxxxxs stipulation that bugti would need to be able to freely travel outside his country of asylum the ambassador agreed to engage president zardari and have the embassy follow up with interservices intelligence isi to ensure that the gop would not act against transfer of bugti out of afghanistan or negatively respond to unhcrs potential involvement 6 snf in subsequent conversation dg isi pasha told cos that he believed bugti should return to pakistan to stand trial for his crimes while declaring that the decision belonged ultimately to the ministry of foreign affairs he made clear that the pakistan military would not favor allowing bugti to be accorded refugee status it was also clear from pashas comments that efforts on the part of agencies to effect bugti being provided with asylum in europe would color the pakistan militarys perception of those agencies and would affect their working relationships 7 snf comment on the basis of pashas remarks we are advising xxxxxxxxxxxx that it would be better for unhcr not to pursue this initiative with bugti end comment patterson
