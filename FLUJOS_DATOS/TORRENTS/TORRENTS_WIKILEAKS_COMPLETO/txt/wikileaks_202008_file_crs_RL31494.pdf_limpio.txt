capital punishment during the 200102 term in atkins v virginia which many consider the most significant case of the term the court decided on june 20 2002 that executing the mentally retarded violates the eighth amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment three cases involve d issues concerning the constitutional standards for effective assistance of c ounsel in death penalty cases on march 27 2002 in mickens v taylor the court addressed what defendant must show in order to demonstrate sixth amendment violation where the trial court fails to inquire into potential conf lict of interest about whic h it knew or reasonably should have known the majority held that fendant in such circ umstances must meet the test of cuyler v sullivan which requires showing an actual conflict of interest which adversely affected his repres entation on may 28 2002 the court in bell v cone voted 81 to uphold the death sent ence of tennessee man whose lawyer presented mitigation case in the penalty phase and offered closing argument in response to the prosecutions request for death the majority held that there was not an entire failure by counsel this cas is noteworthy because of its relationship to another performance case where the attorney for the defense in cockrell v burdine dozed off as many as 10 times during the trial for as long as 10 minutes the court refused to reinstate the death sentence by denying certiorari by declining to intervene in case that focused national attention on the quality of legal representation for death pena lty defendants the courts action did not establish precedent that would apply to capital cases where there continue to be concerns regarding chronic complaints of inadequa and ineffective assistanceofcounsel while the court may have found sleep ing lawyer troubling it declined to reconsider the larger issue in cockrell what constitutes ineffectiveassistanceof counsel in death penalty cases on june 24 2002 in ring v arizona the court decided in the often criticized practice of having judge rather than jury decide the critical sentencing issues in death penalty case that judge could not make findings that would increase defendants sentence to the maximum since that was comparable to an additional conviction this decision should be submitted to jury and would require proof be yond reasonable doubt in order to justify the death penalty finally on june 28 2002 the court in united states v bass ruled against black defendants effort to seek discovery regarding his claim that blacks were charged with capital offenses more than

20 2002 the court rendered its opinion in the case of atkins v virginia5 which presented the issue of whet her capital punishment for individuals of limited measured intelligence violates the constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment the court began its analysis by looking to the judgment of the legislatures that have addressed the suitability of executing the mentally retarded and then it considered the reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with these judgments the court in penry v lynaugh6 decided that it is not categorically unconstitutional to execute mentally retarded person found guilty of capital murder the court upheld executing the retarded capital offender saying that only two states with the death penalty barred it whic h was too few to demonstrate national consensus against the practice7 since then 16 more states have passed laws so that 18 of the 38 states with the death penalty plus th federal government have laws against capital punishment for

punishment for mentally retarded criminal9 noting that the ruling amounted to rela tively quick reversal of the courts 1989 decision in penry v lynaugh 10 in which the court found that national consensus existed against executing the retarded justice stevens said much has changed since then11 he pointed out that capital puni shment laws in 16 states and at the federal level have been amended to bar execution of the retarded adding to the two states that had banned it before penry12 it is not so much the number of these states that is significant but the consistency of the direction of change13 said justice stevens justice stevens also asserted that because of their diminished culpability executing the retarded serves neither of the states purposes of capital punishment particularly retri bution or deterrence14 they are also less able to assist in their own defense exposing them to sp ecial risk of wrongful execution15 justice scalia in dissent described the majority opi nion as an assumption of power that ignored the will of the public and lawmakers in the 20 states that still permit the execution of reta rded condemned prisoners16 he predicted that the decision will turn capital trials into game in which defendants will routinely feign retardation17 justice scalia was joined in dissent by chief justice william rehnquist and justice clarence thomas the courts decision in atkins v virginia is historic because it represents the first dramatic shift for the court in almost twentyfive years during which time it has endorsed capital punishment now citing growing na tional and international consensus against the practice the court he ld that death is not suitable punishment for mentally retarded criminal18 the court said that its decision was based upon an independent evaluation of the issues presented in the case which provided it with reason to disagree with the judgment of the legislatures that have recently addressed the propriety of pplying the death penalty to mentally retarded offendershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31494crs4 19122 sct 1237 2002 20id at 1239 21446 us 335 1980 22435 us 475 1978 23122 sct at 1243 24id 25id 26450 us 261 1981 27122

the court in mickens v taylor19 in 5 to 4 decision addressed what defendant must show in order to monstrate sixth amendment violation where the trial court fails to inquire into poten tial conflict of interest about which it knew or reasona bly should have known20 the majority held that defendant in such circumstances must meet the test of cuyler v sullivan21 which requires showing an actual conflict of interest which adversely affected his representation mickens lead counsel at his capital trial had previously represented the victim whom mickens was charged with murdering the lawyers representation of the victim occurred about ten days befo re the victims death and involved one 15 to 30 minute meeting the judge who had appointed the lawyer to represent the victim also appointed the same lawyer to represent mickens counsel never revealed the prior representation and the judge di d not inquire about potential conflict the court examined its previous conflict of interest cases in holloway v arkansas22 the court applied an automatic reve rsal rule where the defense counsel was forced to represent code fendants over timely objection in cuyler v sullivan however the court declined to apply an automatic reversal rule where there was objection to multiple representation instead requiring the defendant to show that conflict of interest actua lly affected the adequacy of his representation23 sullivan also required trial court to inquire into potential conflict when the trial court knows or reasonabl should know that particular conflict exists24 the court emphasized that particular conflict is not vague unspecified possibility of conflict25 in wood v georgia26 the record raised the possibility of conflict sufficient to require an inquiry from the tr ial court and the s upreme court remanded the case for determination of whether the conflict of interest that this record strongly suggests actually existed27 the court rejected mickens argument that the remand instruction in wood established that trial judge s failure to inquire into potential conflict relieved the defendant of the burden of showing an adverse effect28 the court stated that woods remand instruction was shorthand for the sullivanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31494crs5 29id at 1243 30id at 1244 31122 sct 1843 2002 32466 us 668 1984 33466 us 648 1984 34243 f3d 961 979 6th cir 2001 in strickland which was decided the same day as cronic the court announced twopart test for ev aluating claims that defendants counsel performed so incompetently in his or her re presentation of defendant that the defendants sentence or conviction should be reversed the court reasoned that there would be sufficient indication that counsels assi stance was defective enough to undermine confidence in proceedings result if the defenda nt proved two things first that counsels representation fell below an objective standa rd of reasonableness 466 us at 688 and second that there is reasonable probability that but for counsels unprofessional errors the result of the proceeding would have been different id at 694 without proof of both ie deficient performance and prejudice to the defense the court concluded it could not be said that the sentence or conviction resu lted from breakdown in the adversary process that rendered the result of the proceeding unreliable id at 687 and the sentence or conviction should stand in cronic the court considered whether the cour t of appeals was correct in reversing defendants conviction under the sixth amendment wit hout inquiring into counsels actual continuedtest29 the court also found mickens argu ment made little policy sense because the trial courts awareness of potential conflict does not make an adverse effect more likely or otherwise render the verdict unreliable because trial judges failure to inquire does not make it more difficult fo r reviewing court to assess conflict and effect and because automatic reversal is not an appropriate means of enforcing sullivans mandate to inquire30 on may 28 2002 in bell v cone31 the court voted 81 to uphold the death sentence of respondent gary cone whose lawyer presented witnesses in the penalty phase made closing argument and was late r found to have been mentally ill during the trial gary cone was convicted in 1982 of brut ally murdering an elderly couple which was the culmination of twoday crime ra mpage on the basis of the testimony taken during cones postconvi ction hearing it appeared that his trial lawyers were not prepared for the sentencing phase of th trial his lead attorney john dice did not seek out witnesses to provide mitigating testimony and never presented mitigating evidence during that phase he also waived closing argument after the state completed its case john dice was ter diagnosed with mental illness and he committed suicide approx imately six months after c ones postconviction hearing the 6th us circuit court of appeals found that the denial of effective counsel was so complete that it did not fall under the usual test for ineffectiveness used by the state court strickland v washington32but under us v cronic 33 applying cronic

rejected the texas depart ment of criminal justices request for certiorari with one sentence order 42the court has ruled that defendants whose wyers represent them incompetently can get their convictions overturned but set formid able barrier the defense must prove not only that the trial lawyers performance fell be low minimum standards but also that the deficiencies had likely impact on the verdict under this standard the court and lower courts have upheld convictions in which the defense lawyer was drunk or mentally ill finding lack of proof that the verdict was affected see bell v

upon the competency standards for lawyers42 on june 24 2002 the supreme court in 72 decision in the case of ring v arizona43 held that juries rather than judges must decide critical sentencing issues in death penalty cases the court also held that sentence imposed as result of judges decision regarding mitigating or aggravating circumstances violates defendants constitutional right to trial by jury in arizona and eight other states judges decide after jury has determined guilt in 1990 the supreme court held in walton v arizona44 that the arizona sentencing law which provided that judge not jury was the ultimate finder of fact with respect to the existence of aggravating circumstanceswas constitutional later however the court held in apprendi v new jersey45 that judge could not make findings that would increase defendants sentence to the maximum since that was comparable to an additional convicti on the court said that such decision should be submitted to jury and requi re proof beyond reasonable doubt the decision in ring v arizona applied apprendi in which the court held that any fact other than prior conviction that incr eases the maximum penalty for crime must be submitted to jury and proven beyond reasonable doubt46 this therefore extends the apprendi application to capita l defendants and ensures that those facing the death penalty will have critical sentencing decisions made by unanimous jury of their peers lastly on june 28 2002 the court in per curiam opinion ruled in united states v bass47 that the government can seek the death penalty for the

bass try to force the prosecutors to turn over information about how they handled death cases when the government refused to reveal information regarding its capital charging practices the district court and the sixth circuit threw out the death penalty option in bass case the court ordered that it be reinst ated overruling the court of appeals for the sixth circuit the court held that bass had not made sufficient showing of disparate effect or impact on blacks of th governments decisions to make capital charges to entitle him to discovery on the issue overview currently eighteen states plus the fe deral government forbid the execution of the mentally retarded48 mental health experts have pointed out that the characteristics of the mentally retarded suggest willingness to please which leads them to confesssometimes falselyto capital crimes the courts decision in atkins v virginia reflects what the court views as the national consensus that it is violation of the ban on crue l and unusual punishment to execute death row inmates who have mental retardation the court appeared to recognize the n eed for better legal counsel in capital cases which could have led to reexaminati on of this oftencriticized practice in the death penalty cases however the courts decisions in mickens v taylor and bell v cone indicate its willingness to continue to adjudge claims of denial of effective assistance of counsel under strict standards some states have taken steps to address the problem despite the fact that the cour ts current majority interprets the sixth amendment right to counsel narrowly by tting the bare minimum standards if the court eventually acts to address this issue it will probably be by narrow margin or it will leave this issue to be decided by the lower courts and the political process the court has also acted to ensure at least in limited circumstances that juries should make informed decisions between d eath sentences and the alternative of life without parole in its 72 decision in ring v arizona the court has ended the practice of having judge rather than jury decide the critical issues which would justify the death penalty the court held that allowing the judge to decide these issues rather than the jury violates the defendants constitutional right to trial by jury the issue at this stage would appear to be whether the defendants in states with judge sentencing will have their sentences reduced to life sentences or will they receive new sentencing trials with new jury based on its decision in united states v armstrong the court held in united states v bass that defendant who seeks discove ry on claim that the government sought the death penalty against him because of his race must show some evidence of both discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent
