our extradition treaty obligations although some countries will extradite in the absence of an applicable treaty as matter of comity the united states ordinarily will not g22g155g142g138g157g162g561g5g155g146g150g142g156g561 extradition is generally limited to crimes identified in the treaty early treaties often recite list of the specific extraditable crimes while many of our existing extradition treaties continue to list specific extraditable offenses the more recent ones feature dual criminality approach and simply make all felonies extraditable subject to other limitations found elsewhere in their various provisions g18g152g149g146g157g146g140g138g149g561g17g143g143g142g151g156g142g156g561 in addition to an explicit list of crimes for which extradition may be granted most modern extradition treaties also identify various classes of offenses for which extradition may or must be denied common among these are provisions excluding political offenses the political offense exception has proven troublesome the exception is and has been common feature of extradition treaties for almost century and half in its traditional form the exception is expressed in deceptively simple terms american courts require that fugitive seeking to avoid extradition demonstrate that the alleged crimes were committed in the course of and incidental to violent political disturbance such as war revolution or rebellion contemporary treaties often seek to avoid misunderstandings in number of ways they expressly exclude terrorist offenses or other violent crimes from the definition of political crimes for purposes of the treaty they explicitly extend the political exception to those whose prosecution is politically or discriminatorily motivated andor they limit the reach of their political exception clauses to conform to their obligations under multinational agreements g5g138g153g146g157g138g149g561g17g143g143g142g151g156g142g156g561 number of nations have abolished or abandoned capital punishment as sentencing alternative several of these have preserved the right to deny extradition in capital cases either absolutely or in absence of assurances that the fugitive will not be executed if surrendered g25g138g151g157g561g152g143g561g6g158g138g149g561g5g155g146g150g146g151g138g149g146g157g162g561 dual criminality exists when the two parties to an extradition treaty each punish particular form of misconduct subject to varying interpretations the united states favors the view that treaties should be construed to honor an extradition request if possible thus dual criminality does not require that the name by which the crime is described in the two countries shall be same nor that the scope of the liability shall be coextensive or in other respects the same in the two countries it is enough if the particular act charged is criminal in both jurisdictions when foreign country seeks to extradite fugitive from the united states dual criminality may be satisfied by reference to either federal or state law our treaty partners do not always construe dual criminality

equivalents for attempt conspiracy rico cce and crimes with promin ent federal jurisdictional elements many modern extradition treaties contain provisions addressing the problem of jurisdictional elements andor making extraditable attempt or conspiracy to commit an extraditable offense some include special provisions for tax and customs offenses as well g7g161g157g155g138g157g142g155g155g146g157g152g155g146g138g149g146g157g162g561 as general rule crimes are defined by the laws of the place where they are committed there have always been exceptions to this general rule under which nation was understood to have authority to outlaw and punish conduct occurring out side the confines of its own territory in the past our extradition treaties applied to crimes committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the country seeking extradition largely as consequence of terrorism and drug trafficking however the united states now claims more sweeping extraterritorial application for our criminal laws than recognized either in our more historic treaties or by many of todays governments here our success in eliminating extradition impediments by negotiating new treaty provisions has been mixed more than few call for extradition regardless of where the offense was committed yet perhaps an equal number of contemporary treaties permit or require denial of an extradition request that falls within an area where the countries hold conflicting views on extraterritorial jurisdiction g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g146g157g162g561 the right of country to refuse to extradite ones own nationals is probably the greatest single obstacle to extradition the united states has long objected to the impediment and recent treaties indicate that its hold may not be as formidable as was once the case growing number go so far as to declare that extradition shall not be refused on the ground that the fugitive is citizen or national of the requested state another form limits the nationality exemption to nonviolent crimes third allows conflicting obligation under multinational agreement to wash the exemption away even where the exemption is preserved contemporary treaties more regularly refer to the obligation to consider prosecution at home of those nationals whose extradition has been refused g6g152g158g139g149g142g561g12g142g152g153g138g155g141g162g561 depending on the treaty extradition may also be denied on the basis of number of procedural considerations double punishment andor double jeopardy also know as non bis in idem clauses are among these the more historic clauses are likely to bar extradition for second prosecution of the same acts or the same event rather than the more narrowly drawn same offenses the new model limits the exemption to fugitives who have been convicted or acquitted of the same offense and specifically denies the exemption where an initial prosecution has simply been abandoned g14g138g153g156g142g561g152g143g561g22g146g150g142g561 lapse of time or statute of limitation clauses are prevalent as well many states preclude extradition if prosecution for the offense charged or enforcement of the penalty has become barred by lapse of time under the applicable law under some treaties the applicable law is that of

treaties extradition is precluded if either states statute of limitations has run when treaty provides for timebar only under the law of the requesting state or only under the law of the requested state united states courts have generally held that timebar of the state not mentioned does not bar extradition if the treaty contains reference to the effect of lapse of time neither states statute of limitations will be applied left unsaid is the fact that some treaties declare in uncertain terms that the passage of time is bar to extradition in cases governed by american law and in instances of american prosecution following extradition applicable statutes of limitation and due process determine whether preindictment delays bar prosecution and speedy trial provisions govern whether postindictment delays preclude prosecution g7g161g157g155g138g141g146g157g146g152g151g561g143g155g152g150g561g157g145g142g561g23g151g146g157g142g141g561g21g157g138g157g142g156g561 foreign country usually begins the extradition process with request submitted to the state department sometimes including the documentation required by the treaty the secretary of state at his or her discretion forwards the matter to the department of justice to begin the procedure for the arrest of the fugitive the united states attorneys manual encapsulates the justice departments participation thereafter in these words oia office of international affairs reviews requests for sufficiency and forw ards appropriate ones to the district where the fugitive is found the assistant united states attorney assigned to the case obtains warrant and the fugitive is arrested and brought before the magistrate judge or the district judge the government opposes bond in extradition cases hearing under 18 usc 3184 is scheduled to determine whether the fugitive is extraditable if the court finds the fugitive to be extraditable it enters an order of extraditability and certifies the record to the secretary of state who decides whether to surrender the fugitive to the requesting government in some cases fugitive may waive the hearing process oia notifies the foreign government and arranges for the transfer of the fugitive to the agents appointed by the requesting country to receive him or her although the order following the extradition hearing is not appealable by either the fugitive or the government the fugitive may petition for writ of habeas corpus as soon as the order is issued the district courts decision on the writ is subject to appeal and extradition may be stayed if the court so orders g10g142g138g155g146g151g144g561 the precise menu for an extradition hearing is dictated by the applicable extradition treaty but common check list for hearing conducted in this country would include determinations that 1 there exists valid extradition treaty between the united states and the requesting state 2 the relator is the person sought 3 the offense charged is extraditable 4 the offense charged satisfies the requirement of double criminality 5 there is probable cause to believe the relator committed the offense charged 6 the documents required are presented in accordance with united states law subject to any specific treaty requirements translated and duly authenticated and 7 other treaty requirements and statutory procedures are followed an extradition hearing is not however in the nature of final trial by which the prisoner could be convicted or acquitted of the crime charged against him instead it is essentially preliminary examination to determine whether case is made out which will justify the holding of the accused and his surrender to the demanding nation the judicial officer who conducts an extradition

task of determining if there is probable cause to hold defendant to answer for the commission of an offense the purpose of the hearing is in part to determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the individual committed an offense covered by the extradition treaty the individual may offer evidence to contradict or undermine the existence of probable cause but affirmative defenses that might be available at trial are irrelevant the rules of criminal procedure and evidence that would apply at trial have application hearsay is not only admissible but may be relied upon exclusively the miranda rule has application initiation of extradition may be delayed without regard for the sixth amendment right to speedy trial or the fifth amendment right of due process nor does the sixth amendment right to the assistance of counsel apply due process however will bar extradition of informants whom the government promised confidentiality and then provided the evidence necessary to establish probable cause for extradition moreover extradition will ordinarily be certified without examining the requesting countrys criminal justice system or taking into account the possibility that the extraditee will be mistreated if returned g20g142g159g146g142g160g561 if at the conclusion of the extradition hearing the court concludes there is some obstacle to extradition and refuses to certify the case the requesting governments recourse to an unfavorable disposition is to bring new complaint before different judge or magistrate process it may reiterate apparently endlessly if the court concludes there is such obstacle to extradition and certifies to the secretary of state that the case satisfies the legal requirements for extradition the fugitive has right of appeal but may be entitled to limited review under habeas corpus g7g161g157g155g138g141g146g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g157g145g142g561g23g151g146g157g142g141g561g21g157g138g157g142g156g561 the laws of the country of refuge and the applicable extradition treaty govern extradition back to the united states of fugitive located overseas the request for extradition comes from the department of state whether extradition is sought for trial in federal or state court or for execution of criminal sentence under federal or state law the justice departments office of international affairs must approve requests for extradition of fugitives from federal charges or convictions and may be asked to review requests from state prosecutors before they are considered by the state department the first step is to determine whether the fugi tive is extraditable the justice departments checklist for determining extraditability begins w ith an identification of the country in which the fugitive has taken refuge if we have extradition treaty with the country of refuge extradition is not likely option when there is treaty extradition is only an option if the treaty permits extradition common impediments include citizenship dual criminality statutes of limitation and capital punishment many treaties permit country to refuse to extradite its citizens even in the case of dual citizenship whether the crime of conviction or the crime charged is an extraditable offense will depend upon the nature of the crime and where it was committed if the applicable treaty lists extraditable offenses the crime must be on the list if the applicable treaty insists only upon dual criminality the underlying misconduct must be crime under the laws of both the united states and the country of refuge

extradition if the offense was committed within the geographical confines of the united states timing also matters the speedy trial features of us law require good faith effort to bring to trial fugitive who is within the governments reach furthermore the lapse of time or speedy trial component of the applicable extradition treaty may preclude extradition if prosecution would be barred by statute of limitations in the country of refuge some treaties prohibit extradition for capital offenses more often they permit it but only with the assurance that sentence of death will not be executed prosecutors may request provisional arrest of fugitive without waiting for the final preparation of the documentation required for formal extradition request if there is risk of flight and if the treaty permits it the justice department encourages judicious use of provisional arrest because of the pressures that attend it if the justice department approves the application for extradition the request and documentation are forwarded to the state department translated if necessary and with state department approval forwarded thr ough diplomatic channels to the country from whom extradition is being sought the treaty issue most likely to arise after extradition and the fugitives return to this country is whether the fugitive was surrendered subject to any limitations such as those posed by the doctrine of specialty g21g153g142g140g146g138g149g157g162g561 under the doctrine of specialty sometimes called speciality person who has been brought within the jurisdiction of the court by virtue of proceedings under an extradition treaty can only be tried for one of the offences described in that treaty and for the offence with which he is charged in the proceedings for his extradition until reasonable time and opportunity have been given him after his release or trial upon such charge to return to the country from whose asylum he had been forcibly taken under those proceedings the limitation expressly included in many treaties however is designed to preclude prosecution for different substantive offenses and does not bar prosecution for different or additional counts of the same offense and some courts have held that an offense whose prosecution would be barred by the doctrine may nevertheless be considered for purposes of the federal sentencing guidelines or for purposes of criminal forfeiture at least where an applicable treaty addresses the question the rule is bar to prosecution for crimes committed after the individual is extradited the doctrine may be of limited advantage to given defendant because the circuits are divided over whether defendant has standing to claim its benefits regardless of their view of fugitive standing they agree that the surrendering state may subsequently consent to trial for crimes other than those for which extradition was had

allow fugitive to consent to extradition without the benefit of an extradition hearing g11g150g150g146g144g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 whether by process similar to deportation or by simple expulsion the united states has had some success encouraging other countries to surrender fugitives other than their own nationals without requiring recourse to extradition ordi narily american immigration procedures on the other hand have been less accommodating and have been called into play only when extradition has been found wanting they tend to be time consuming and usually can only be used in lieu of extradition when the fugitive is an alien moreover they frequently require the united states to deposit the alien in country other than one that seeks his or her extradition yet in few instances where an alien has been naturalized by deception or where the procedures available against alien terrorists come into play denaturalization or deportation may be considered an attractive alternative or supplement to extradition proceedings g11g155g155g142g144g158g149g138g155g561g20g142g151g141g146g157g146g152g151g550g3g139g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 american use of irregular rendition is familiar alternative to extradition an alternative of last resort it involves kidnapping or deceit and generally has been reserved for terrorists drug traffickers and the like kidnapping defendant overseas and returning him to the united states for trial does not deprive american courts of jurisdiction unless an applicable extradition treaty explicitly calls for that result the individuals involved in the abduction however may face foreign prosecution or at least be the subject of foreign extradition request moreover the effort may strain diplomatic relations with the country from which the fugitive is lured or abducted g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g18g155g152g156g142g140g158g157g146g152g151g561 final alternative when extradition for trial in the ited states is not available is trial within the country of refuge the alternative exists primarily when extradition has been refused in because of the fugitives nationality andor where the crime occurred under circumstances that permit prosecution by either country for the same misconduct the alternative can be cumbersome and expensive and may be contrary to us policy objectives
