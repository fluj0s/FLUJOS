american national government government and finance division bill heniff jr analyst in american national government government and finance division paygo rules for budget enforcement in the house and senate summary one of the most contentious issues in budget procedure in recent years has involved proposed changes in the senates payasyougo paygo rule and efforts to establish similar rule in the house the senates paygo rule was established in 1993 and has been modified several times it is scheduled to expire on september 30 2008 efforts are expected to be made in the senate during the 2007 session to modify the paygo rule once again the houses paygo rule was established as part of the standing rules on january 5 2007 it does not have an expiration date but the house rules must be adopted at the beginning of each congress the senates paygo rule currently prohibits the consideration of revenue or direct spending legislation that would cause or increase an onbudget deficit in excess of the level set forth in the most recently adopted budget resolution for any one of three applicable time periods 1 the first fiscal year covered by the budget resolution 2 the first five fiscal years covered by the budget resolution and 3 the next five fiscal years after that revenue reductions direct spending increases or combination of the two are allowed only so long as they are completely offset by revenue increases direct spending reductions or both in its current form however the rule does not apply to revenue reductions or direct spending increases assumed in the budget resolution and accommodated under paygo scorecard point of order raised under the rule may be waived by an affirmative vote of 60 senators the rule is scheduled to expire at the end of fy2008 following the establishment of the paygo rule in 1993 the senate has modified the rule several times for different reasons including establishing and extending an expiration date expanding the rules application to curtail potential evasion allowing onbudget surpluses to be used to cover revenue reductions and direct spending increases and providing for exemptions to the rule the houses paygo rule requires that legislation affecting direct spending or revenues not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus over sixyear period including the current year the upcoming fiscal year and the four following fiscal years as well as an 11year period the previouslycited period and the ensuing five fiscal years unlike the senate paygo rule the house paygo rule does not provide an exemption for direct spending or revenue changes assumed in the budget resolution neither the senates nor the houses paygo rule addresses increases or decreases in revenues or direct spending that are reflected in the calculations of the budget baseline the rules apply only to the effects of legislation that is pending therefore revenue decreases or spending increases that stem from existing law are not constrained by the rule this report will be updated as developments warrant contents background 1 different formulations of the paygo rule in the senate 3 selected issues regarding paygo rules 7

senates paygo rule 5 paygo rules for budget enforcement in the house and senate one of the most contentious issues in budget procedure in recent years has involved proposed changes in the senates paygo rule which dates to 1993 and deals with the enforcement of revenue and direct spending legislation and efforts to establish similar rule in the house the controversy over this matter was so great that it led to an impasse between the house and senate regarding the fy2005 budget resolution in 2005 and 2006 during house and senate consideration of the budget resolutions for fy2006 and fy2007 respectively proposals regarding paygo rules once again raised controversy in the two chambers in 2007 at the beginning of the 110th congress the house adopted paygo rule the senate is expected to consider during the 2007 session proposals to modify its paygo rule background the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 pl 93344 88 stat 297339 established the congressional budget process under which the house and senate develop an overall budgetary plan in the form of an annual budget resolution the policies established each year in the budget resolution regarding revenues discretionary spending controlled in annual appropriations acts direct spending controlled in substantive law and the debt limit are enforced largely through such means as points of order eg against legislation that would cause spending to exceed the total limits established in the budget resolution or applicable committee spending allocations and reconciliation procedures1 pursuant to elastic clause authority under the 1974 act the house and senate sometimes include special procedural features in the budget resolution2 the senates payasyougo paygo rule was established in 1993 under such authority on temporary basis as part of the fy1994 budget resolution3 the rule 1 for more information on the congressional budget process see crs report 98721 an introduction to the federal budget process by robert keith and allen schick and crs report rl30297 congressional budget resolutions selected statistics and information guide by bill heniff jr 2 the socalled elastic clause set forth in section 301b4 of the act authorizes the budget resolution to set forth such other matters and require such other procedures relating to the budget as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this act 3 see section 12 of the conference report to accompany hconres 64 hrept 10348 mar 31 1993 pp 2627 legislative text and p 47 joint explanatory statement crs2 has been modified and extended several times4 in its current form it is scheduled to expire at the end of fy2008 ie on september 30 2008 the current text of the senates paygo rule is provided in appendix prior to the 110th congress several efforts were made to establish paygo rule in the house as well but such rule was not adopted in 2007 at the beginning of the 110th congress the house adopted paygo rule as part of its customary package of rules changes the text of the houses paygo rule is provided in appendix b as formulated in the senate the paygo rule generally has prohibited the consideration of any revenue or direct spending legislation that would cause or increase an onbudget deficit for any one of three applicable time periods 1 the first fiscal year covered by the budget resolution 2 the first five fiscal years covered by the budget resolution and 3 the next five fiscal years after that the budget resolution encompasses onbudget revenues and spending only it excludes the budgetary transactions of the offbudget social security trust funds and postal service fund revenue reductions direct spending increases or combination of the two are allowed only so long as they are completely offset by revenue increases direct spending reductions or both in its current form however the senates paygo rule does not apply to revenue reductions or direct spending increases that are assumed in the budget resolution and accommodated under paygo scorecard maintained by the senate budget committee any senator may raise point of order against legislation violating the rule but the rule may be waived upon the affirmative vote of threefifths of the membership 60 senators if seats are vacant neither the senates nor the houses paygo rule address increases or decreases in revenues or direct spending that are reflected in the calculations of the budget baseline the rules apply only to the effects of legislation that is pending therefore revenue decreases or spending increases that stem from existing law are not constrained by the rule for many years the senates paygo rule complemented statutory paygo requirement established by the budget enforcement act of 1990 as an amendment to underlying law the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 which was first effective for fy1992 under the statutory paygo requirement the net budgetary impact of revenue and direct spending legislation in current and future fiscal years was recorded on rolling paygo scorecard if the director of the office of management and budget determined at the end of each congressional session that revenue and direct spending legislation enacted for the immediate fiscal year yielded net cost when added to any existing balance already recorded on the paygo scorecard then acrosstheboard cuts in nonexempt direct spending programs would 4 for information on the legislative history and implementation of the rule see crs report rl31943 budget enforcement procedures senates payasyougo paygo rule by bill heniff jr crs3 occur automatically to eliminate the net cost thereby reducing the balance to zero under procedure known as sequestration5 the statutory paygo requirement was extended twice but effectively was terminated at the end of the 2002 session when the outyear balances on the paygo scorecard through fy2006 were set to zero6 sequester of direct spending programs ever occurred while the statutory paygo requirement was in effect this is attributable in the earlier years to effective compliance and in the later years to statutory intervention in the process using directed scorekeeping provisions and other techniques7 the paygo rules of the two chambers differ from the expired statutory paygo requirement in that they apply during the consideration of legislation rather than after the session has ended both mechanisms however adopted longterm approach to enforcement the paygo rules by virtue of their multiyear time frame and the statutory paygo requirement by virtue of recording futureyear costs on the rolling scorecard different formulations of the paygo rule in the senate following the establishment of the paygo rule in 1993 the senate has modified it several times the changes in the rule have occurred for several reasons including the establishment and extension of an expiration date expanding the rules application to annual appropriations acts in an effort to curtail potential evasion allowing onbudget surpluses to be used to cover revenue reductions and direct spending increases and providing for exemptions to the rule these different formulations which are summarized in table 1 at the end of this section have varied in their effects on the stringency of the rule the original rule section 12c of the fy1994 budget resolution hconres 64 was intended to prevent the deficit reduction expected to be achieved in subsequent reconciliation bill from being used to offset the costs of any new direct spending or revenue legislation8 specifically it prohibited the consideration of any direct spending and revenue legislation that would increase the deficit in the fy1994 budget resolution for any fiscal year through fy1998 or would increase the deficit for any other fiscal year through fy2003 in this initial form the senates paygo rule had expiration date 5 for additional information on this topic see crs report rl31137

omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 was estimated at the time as reducing the deficit by about 500 billion over fy1994 fy1998 crs4 the following year in 1994 the senate modified the paygo rule to require direct spending and revenue legislation to be deficit neutral for any one of the three time periods contained in the current paygo rule 1 the first fiscal year covered by the most recently adopted budget resolution 2 the first five fiscal years covered by the budget resolution and 3 the next five fiscal years after that9 in addition the modification provided that direct spending and revenue legislation would violate the rule only if it increased the deficit individually and also increased the deficit when combined with any legislation enacted since the enactment of the previous years reconciliation legislation ie the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 this modification to the rule basically permitted the use of any deficit reduction provided in other legislation to be used as an offset for any subsequent deficit increasing legislation the 1994 modification also added an expiration date of september 30 1998 in 1995 the senate reaffirmed the existing paygo rule and extended its expiration date to september 30 200210 after decades of onbudget deficits the federal government recorded small onbudget surplus for fy1999 at that time baseline budget projections showed on budget surpluses increasing each year well into the future11 in 1999 reflecting the change in the federal governments budget outlook the senate modified the paygo rule to allow onbudget surpluses to be used to offset tax reductions or spending increases12 specifically the modified rule prohibited the consideration of any direct spending and revenue legislation that would cause or increase an onbudget deficit for any one of the three existing applicable time periods the modification retained the existing expiration date of september 30 2002 in 2002 the rule was allowed to expire on september 3013 two weeks later however on october 16 2002 the senate restored and extended the paygo rule through april 15 200314 the basic formulation of the rule was retained with one 9 see section

recently adopted budget resolution is exempt from point of order even though it might be projected to cause or increase an onbudget deficit16 the modification also eliminated the application of the rule to annual appropriations acts which were subject to limits established in the budget resolution for fy2004 reconciliation legislation considered later in 2003 s 1054 and hr 2 for example although projected at the time to increase the deficit did not violate the rule because it was consistent with the reconciliation instructions contained in title ii of the budget resolution hconres 95 108th congress and accommodated under the paygo scorecard in the 109th congress revenuereducing reconciliation bill provided for under the fy2006 budget resolution was considered in the senate initially at level about 10 billion below the level of the reconciliation directives although measure reducing revenues by 70 billion over five years was contemplated by the budget resolution the paygo scorecard only accommodated deficit impact of about 60 billion at the time of initial senate action on the measure subsequent changes in the paygo scorecard allowed the senate to consider conference agreement on the measure that increased the revenue reductions to the full 70 billion allowed under the reconciliation directives17 the paygo scorecard maintained by the senate budget committee has taken different forms in its initial presentation as part of the joint explanatory statement accompanying the budget resolution in the statement accompanying the fy2004 budget resolution the scorecard provided balances for each fiscal year covering fy2003fy2013 ie the current fiscal year plus 10year horizon as well as fiveyear total 679563 billion for fy2004fy2008 and 10year total 1691168 billion for fy2004fy201318 in the statement accompanying the fy2006 budget resolution the scorecard provided separate balances for the current year and the budget year 16849 billion for fy2006 but not for the other years of the 10year horizon instead fiveyear total 75580 billion for fy2006fy2010 and 10year total 274999 billion for fy2006fy2015 were provided19 the initial paygo scorecard balances were adjusted periodically to reflect legislative action20 16 the joint explanatory statement in the conference report to accompany the fy2004 budget resolution indicated that the budget resolution assumed direct spending increases and revenue reductions totaling 1755957 billion over the period fy2003fy2013 see hrept 10871 apr 10 2003 pp 122123 17 for more information see crs report rl33132 budget

feb 3 2006 available on the committees web site at crs7 selected issues regarding paygo rules proposals regarding the establishment and modification of internal paygo rules in the house and senate raise several issues including the appropriate coverage of the rule and the provision for exemptions and the period for which the rule should be in effect among others several selected issues are discussed briefly below coverage and exemptions with regard to the appropriate coverage of the paygo rule and exemptions to it attention has focused on whether it should apply to direct spending legislation but not revenue legislation and whether the exemption for initiatives assumed in the budget resolution should be retained those who advocate the broadest coverage of the rule point to the need to reduce the deficit which climbed to record level in nominal terms 4127 billion in fy2004 but declined to 2476 billion in fy2006 recent baseline deficit projections issued by the congressional budget office show surplus of between 159 billion to 249 billion for fy2012fy2017 but the assumption that certain policy alternatives not included in the baseline ie extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and other expiring provisions indexation of the alternative minimum tax for inflation and increases in discretion spending at the growth rate of the overall economy would be pursued would change the estimates of surpluses for these years to significant persistent deficits21 in order to grapple effectively with deficit reduction challenges they argue the house and senate must ensure that their budget enforcement tools encompass the entire budget and that portion of it escapes discipline further advocates of broadened approach cite the effectiveness of the senates paygo rule as well as the statutory paygo requirement during the early and mid 1990s before budget surpluses emerged during this period these two enforcement mechanisms applied to both revenue and direct spending legislation an amendment offered by senator russell feingold to the fy2006 budget resolution in march 2005 embodied this approach his amendment would have restored the senates paygo rule to its earlier form under which it applied equally to revenue legislation and direct spending legislation and did not exempt legislation assumed in the budget resolution senator lincoln chafee speaking in support of the feingold amendment stated paygo is not perfect congress has found and will continue to find if it is included in this budget ways to get around it but despite its flaws it does have proven track record it tests policies of both parties in the same way pay for your priorities or find 60 senators willing to override the rule this is the way 20 continued httpwwwsenategovbudgetrepublicananalysis2006bb012006pdf 21 information on policy alternatives not included in the cbo baseline is presented in congressional budget office the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 2008 to 2017 jan 24 2007 table 15 pp 1617 crs8 it should be at time when our budget is awash in red ink it only makes sense to bring discipline and accountability back to the budget process if new tax cuts or entitlement spending is so important shouldnt we be able to find way to address the costs including paygo in the budget made sense in the 1990s when the stock market was at historic highs and unemployment at historic lows and it makes sense today22 those who point to need for more narrow application of the paygo rule argue mainly that it should not apply to revenue legislation either by restricting its application solely to direct spending legislation or as the current senate rule provides by exempting legislation assumed in the budget resolution key element in sustaining economic growth and achieving longerterm budgetary goals they assert is extending the various tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 that are scheduled to expire over the next several years and possibly reducing revenues further in other ways paygo rule applicable to revenue legislation generally and that does not automatically exempt taxcut legislation assumed in the budget resolution could significantly impede this effort especially in light of the rules 60vote threshold for waiver during consideration of the fy2006 budget resolution senator charles grassley chairman of the senate finance committee spoke in opposition to the feingold amendment he expressed his view that returning to broadened application of the paygo rule would work to the disadvantage of those favoring continued tax relief compared to those favoring continued entitlement growth because most of the tax relief requires legislative action to be extended whereas most entitlement spending increases automatically under existing law further chairman grassley discounted the need to broaden the application of the rule because of the finance committees current practice of requiring revenue neutrality except for bipartisan tax relief two kinds of tax relief bills have come out of the finance committee in the last 4 years one set of bills contained widely applicable tax relief those bills if you take them together and they were done under reconciliation were bipartisanthose bills enacted in 2001 and 2003 did not contain offsets the second category of bills our committee works on would cover all other bills coming as part of our committee business those bills dealt with specific categories of tax relief i will give some examples charitable giving tax bill the bill to deal with exports in manufacturing bill to deal with the armed forces tax relief for our folks in iraq putting their lives on the line there are many other examples of tax relief fully offset by our committee in few rare cases such as the energy tax relief for example bills were partially offset by and large then the senate finance committee when dealing with tax policy has produced revenueneutral bills the exceptions occurred when there was bipartisan support for widely applicable tax relief23 22 see the remarks of senator lincoln chafee in the congressional record daily ed mar 16 2005 pp s2803s2804 23 see the remarks of senator charles grassley in the congressional record daily ed mar continued crs9 duration the points of order set forth in 1974 in the congressional budget act were established on permanent basis many of the budget enforcement mechanisms established in the ensuing decades either on statutory basis such as deficit targets discretionary spending limits the paygo requirement and the presidents line item veto authority or as rulemaking provisions of the house and senate such as changes in the house rules pursuant to the republicans contract with america and various elastic clause procedures included in annual budget resolutions were made effective on temporary basis the trend toward adopting temporary rather than permanent budget enforcement procedures is attributable to many different factors but is explained mainly by changing budget policy and political environment in which future outcomes are difficult to predict periods of economic growth may be brief or sustained but they inevitably are followed by periods of economic downturn which may be shallow or deep shaped by swings in the economic pendulum changing demographic trends and other factors recent budgets have presented policymakers with drastically varying issues ranging from large deficits at times to large surpluses at other times periods of divided government are followed by periods in which one party dominates the leadership of the federal government at times party leadership is strongly united and at other times it is marked by factional strife as consequence at any given time in recent decades it has been difficult for congressional leaders to determine what budgetary challenges it will face few years hence and how much in the way of political resources it will have to marshal against them legislative compromises in this type of environment tend to favor shorter term deals budget enforcement procedures as an integral component of shorter term compromises on budget policy matters therefore often include expiration dates just as budget policies can be revisited in the future the procedural mechanisms needed to enforce them can be renegotiated at that later time the senates paygo rule has fit squarely into this pattern being revised and extended over the years through changing policy and political environment proposals to extend the senates paygo rule have assumed the need to retain an expiration date rather than to extend it on permanent basis as to the appropriate length of an extension range of options is available first any modification to the rule could be made without changing the current expiration date which is the end of fy2008 thus without any extension the rule would remain in effect only for the upcoming fy2008 budget cycle second if the paygo rule is regarded as companion enforcement procedure to the threeyear discretionary spending limits that the senate has included in recent budget resolutions then comparable expiration dates might be appropriate24 in this 23 continued 16 2005 pp s2798s2799 24 see for example the senates discretionary spending limits for fy2006fy2008 that were included in section 404 of the fy2006 budget resolution in the conference report to continued crs10 session such time frame would cover fy2008fy2010 under provision in the fy2006 budget resolution section 403 many current requirements pertaining to supermajority enforcement were extended through fy2010 third as proposed in the feingold amendment to the fy2006 budget resolution the expiration date could be made consistent with the fiveyear time frame of the budget resolution itself in this session such time frame would encompass fy2008fy2012 finally much longer time frame could be incorporated into any revision of the senates paygo rule consistent with any other longerterm procedures that are finally adopted for example the fy2006 budget resolution included in section 407 new point of order to constrain legislation increasing direct spending over the long term from fy2016 through fy2055 other issues some of the other issues pertain to the relationship to other budget enforcement procedures and whether the rule may lead to distortions in budget policy various budget enforcement procedures each established to deal with particular concern could unnecessarily complicate the legislative process and the formulation of legislation if they are not well integrated consider for example some of the major budget enforcement procedures that would might apply during senate consideration of legislative proposal to increase direct spending spending increases above the ceilings established in the current budget resolution for the current fiscal year the upcoming fiscal year and fiveyear period or longer might be subject to point of order under section 311 of the congressional budget act of 1974 spending increases in excess of the committee of jurisdictions spending allocations made under the current budget resolution for the same time periods might be subject to point of order under section 302 of the 1974 act if considered as part of reconciliation bill spending increases for years beyond the time frame of the reconciliation instructions might be subject to point of order as extraneous matter under section 313 the byrd rule of the 1974 act in the senate if not assumed in the current budget resolution spending increases not fully offset over the first fiscal year the first five fiscal years and the next five fiscal years after that might be subject to point of order under the current paygo rule 24 continued accompany hconres 95 hrept 10962 apr 28 2005 on pp 2223 legislative text and pp 8083 joint explanatory statement crs11 in the house spending increases not fully offset over the sixyear and 11year periods beginning with the current fiscal year might be subject to point of order under the new paygo rule and in the senate under section 407 of the fy2006 budget resolution legislation containing net spending increases that exceed 5 billion during any of four 10year periods beginning with fy2016 might be subject to point of order under that section each of the different procedures identified above serves distinct purpose judged to be necessary and valid by the house and senate the cumulative effect of the various procedures however might be to require proposal increasing direct spending to adhere to mix of deficitneutrality and fixedlimit requirements over several different time periods involving the current fiscal year the upcoming fiscal year the first five fiscal years the next five fiscal years and four 10year periods beginning with fy2016 in view of the complexity in the interaction of the procedural requirements and the potential complication of legislation as result modifications to the paygo rules and other existing budget enforcement procedures and the addition of new enforcement procedures must be carefully evaluated in order to ensure that the complexity and complications are warranted another concern commonly expressed when budget enforcement procedures are proposed or modified is whether the change will promote distortions in policy in order to evade control in the case of the paygo rule some argue that excluding revenue legislation but not direct spending legislation from its discipline will encourage members to pursue policy initiatives and expansions through the tax side rather than the spending side of the budget many policies that can be advanced through the spending of federal funds may also be advanced by granting credits deductions exemptions and the like under tax laws for example home ownership is promoted by the federal government through various means including both spending for loan subsidies and the individual income tax deduction for home mortgage interest recent trends in the use of advance appropriations may be cited as an example by those who express this concern as stricter controls were exerted on increases in discretionary spending in annual appropriations acts the use of advance appropriations which effectively bypass the annual limits escalated sharply to curb this practice the house and senate responded by including limits on advance appropriations in budget resolutions enforceable by point of order in each chamber the increased use of staggered effective dates and sunset dates in recent years in tax legislation which has increased its complexity also may be cited as an undesired consequence of the need to fashion legislation to meet budget enforcement requirements crs12 action in the 108th congress during the first session of the 108th congress the senate accepted modification of its paygo rule recommended by the senate budget committee in the fy2004 budget resolution changing it to what is now its current form in the second session the senate adopted floor amendment to restore the paygo rule to its earlier form but the effort ultimately failed as the two chambers failed to reach final agreement on the fy2005 budget resolution efforts to establish paygo rule in the house during action on the budget resolution failed in each session first session in 2003 as the first session began the senate faced the prospect of considering the fy2004 budget resolution and adopting it by the statutory deadline of april 15 the senates paygo rule which was slated to expire on the same day april 15 was expected to become an the issue in the context of consideration of the budget resolution on march 14 the senate budget committee reported sconres 23 the budget resolution without written report25 the budget resolution as reported included revenue levels for fy2003fy2013 that assumed revenue reductions to accommodate certain tax proposals such as president george w bushs tax relief proposals and the permanent extension of certain tax provisions enacted in 2001 in addition it included spending levels that assumed direct spending increases including new medicare prescription drug benefit for the same period the reported budget resolution also modified and extended the senates paygo rule to what is now its current form exempting from the rule legislation implementing those revenue and direct spending assumptions after six days of consideration the senate agreed to sconres 23 as amended on march 26 by vote of 5644 while the senate considered and agreed to several amendments to sconres 23 none were related to the paygo provision on march 17 the house budget committee reported budget resolution for fy2004 hconres 95 containing revenue and spending levels that assumed tax cuts and mix of direct spending increases and reductions the reported budget resolution did not include paygo provision the house agreed to hconres 95 on march 21 by vote of 215212 after rejecting several amendments one of the rejected amendments offered by representative baron hill would have among other things established paygo rule in the house

proposed paygo rules the house adopted one at the opening of the congress the senate is expected to consider proposals to modify its current paygo rule during the 2007 session first session on january 5 2007 the house of representatives adopted hres 6 measure setting forth its rules for the 110th congress section 405 of the measure added new rule known as the houses payasyougo paygo rule as clause 10 of rule xxi the new rule was key element of the house democratic leaderships legislative agenda for the first 100 hours of the 110th congress the houses paygo rule requires that legislation affecting direct spending or revenues not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus over sixyear period including the current year the upcoming fiscal year and the four following fiscal years as well as an 11year period the previouslycited period and the ensuing five fiscal years the rule is enforced on the basis of estimates made by the house budget committee relative to the baseline projections made by the congressional budget office under established procedures the senate has modified its paygo rule several times over the years and efforts are expected to be made in 2007 to return the rule to an earlier more stringent form the restoring fiscal discipline act of 2007 s 10 introduced by senate majority leader harry reid on the first day of the session january 4 would in part establish senate paygo rule through september 30 201253 the paygo rule proposed in s 10 differs from the current paygo rule in several respects most notably the rule would bar the consideration of any direct spending or revenue measure that would increase or cause an onbudget deficit and would not exempt any direct spending or revenue changes assumed in the budget resolution 52 the house included
