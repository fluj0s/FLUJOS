1061021 was landmark legislation that allowed banking securities and insurance companies to operate in affiliation with each other under the organizational form of financial holding companies fhcs glba also permitted fhcs like financial subsidiaries of banks fss to engage in variety of activities not previously allowed to banks or companies owning banks2 under glba the federal reserve fed and the treasury department which contains the office of the comptroller of the currency occ have authority to issue regulations expanding activities for fhcs and fss respectively in glba 103 requires that the fed find that new activities for fhcs are financial in nature incidental to financial activity or both complementary to financial activity and not posing substantial risk to safety and soundness 121 repeats the standard for the occ governing fss congress crafted glba as compromise to allow financial affiliations while avoiding general mixing of banking with commerce it specifically excluded bank fss from underwriting insurance and from real estate investment and development except as may already have been authorized by other law 3 g18g155g152g153g152g156g142g141g561g4g155g152g148g142g155g138g144g142g561g138g151g141g561g15g138g151g138g144g142g150g142g151g157g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 in december 2000 the fed and the treasury released proposal to allow banking companies into new real estate businesses under 103 and 121 4 their proposal would allow fhcs and fss to enter real estate brokerage and property management if these activities could be considered financial in nature or incidental to financial activity not the less exacting complementary test brokerage includes acting as an intermedia ry between parties to real estate transaction listing and advertising real estate soliciting sales negotiating terms and handling closings it is not purchase or sale of property as an owner and it requires state licensing and regulation property management includes soliciting tenants negotiating leases servicing rents maintaining security deposits making operating payments and overseeing upkeep managers thus need not be owners and banking firms could not become owners of real estate through this proposal the fed and the occ historically disallowed real estate brokerage and property management activities for their regulated institutions the office of thrift supervision also within the treasury does allow subsidiaries of federal savings associations to provide real estate brokerage and property management services about half the states seem to allow these activities for the 1 113 stat 13381481 2 fhcs hold controlling stock interests in separately incorporated or chartered businesses such as banks mortgage companies stockbrokers and dealers etc the federal reserve supervises all fhcs which are not federally insured fss are businesses that banks themselves own the bank regulators supervise fss which while not necessarily federally insured are owned directly by insured banks these structural differences are important because glba allows more latitude for uninsured fhcs to operate in nont raditional lines of business fhcs are considered less likely than banks and bank subsidiaries to cause difficulties for th federal support mechanisms for banks especially deposit insurance funds should they encounter losses 3 113 stat 1373 12 usc 24a 4 board of governors of the federal reserve system and department of the treasury bank holding companies and

charter and regulate however actual practice of bank realty powers appears very rare5 conversely real estate brokers and managers cannot offer essential banking servicesaccepting deposits and making commercial loansand are not seeking to become banklike they do not want to form financial holding companies or obtain bank charters and especially seek to avoid becoming regulated by the fed or other banking agency bankers american bankers association financial services roundtable and new york clearing house association requested this authority in their view it would allow financial institutions to offer fuller range of financial service using many skills that banks already have they argue that these activities are financial in nature and would lower the costs of realty transactions other supporters are the americas community bankers consumer bankers association independent community bankers of america realty alliance and real estate services providers council the national association of realtors nar opposes the proposal arguing that law including glba authorizes banking firms to provide real estate brokerage and property management which it argues are nonfinancial in nature from its perspective the proposal would create anticompetitive and anticonsumer concentrations of power dominating the realty industry and increasing costs to consumers other opposing entities are the building owners and managers association consumers union institute of real estate management international council of shopping centers national affordable housing management association and national association of homebuilders

investment thus its intent may have been to restrain new realty powers of bankers 2 real estate brokerage and property management are commercial activities their necessary handson sales skills are far different from lending when bankers sponsored real estate investment trusts in the 1970s most collapsed with large losses 3 real estate brokerage and property management involve negotiation of realty transactions that role has been forbidden to fhc s as finders fhc finders may not engage in any activity requiring registration or licensing as realty agent or broker 4 one study states that the real estate industry is highly competitive and efficient much more productive than financial services generally 7 if so bankers would presumably bring almost net benefit to real estate brokerage and property management 5 entry of deeppocket banking companies which benefit from federal assistance including deposit insurance might drive out brokers and property managers which typically operate on much smaller scale 6 competition for lending could decline if buyers believe that onestop realty transacting and financing would ease credit approval mortgage nders not involved with the brokerage part of realty transactions might lose business

december 5 interpretive letters citing 12 usc 29 that allows banks to invest in bank premises among the justifications for approval of the wind project was that 12 usc 29 provides that national banks
