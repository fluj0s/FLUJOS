conclusion principal cause the loss of well banjar panji 1 brantas block onshore east java indonesia on or abouts the 2nd june 2006 due to an internal blow out incident while under the operational management of the blocks operator lapindo brantas inc can be directly and immediately prior to its loss attributed to the decis ion to remove the drill string from the well bore beginning at midnight on the 28 may 2006 while the well was in an unstable condition requiring curing of lost circulation experienced at 1300 hrs on the 27 may 2006 while drilling 12 14 hole at depth of 9297 ft rtkb this action was incompetent and in contravention of good well control practice good oilfield practices continuing to pull pipe from the hole even as the well was taking losses is regarded as reckless and negligent in my opinion it is my opinion that had the drill string not been pulled out of the hole at such premature moment in accordance with compe tent well control practice the security and integrity of the well would have been safe guarded 12 conclusion contributing factors there were during the planning contracting engineering design programming and preparation phases for the well and in other phases of its execution contributing factors which in part or as whole if carried out differently would in all probability have avoided the catastrophe of the internal blowout incident occurring the main contributing factors were i the probable weakening or fracturing of formations on and in the vicinity of the 17 12 hole during cementing of the 13 38 casing at 3595 ft rtkb between 29 and 30 april 2006 the lack of remedial action following losses while cementing was neglectful and in contravention of good oilfield practices and bpmigas recommended practice 401 5 ii the fracturing of formations in the vicinity of 4241 ft rtkb during kick control activities on 28 may 2006 iii drilling ahead past 8500 ft in the neglect of well control constraints and partners medco warnings with the 13 38 casing set shallower than programmed and further casing having been set prior to entering the kujung reservoir target formation this action could be regarded as reckless iv the omission of t he 1134 casing liner programmed to be set at 6537 ft rtkb had this casing been set the sloughing clays below the 13 38 casing seat would all have been covered and well control measures more easily applied v the decision in the idpm drilling program to set 958 casing inside the kujung carbonate this was technical error due to lack of competence or experience with drilling abnormally

during the planning and preparation phase 211 pore and formation strength pressure analysis the drilling program for banjar panji 1 was prepared as part of an integrated drilling project management

closest relevant well since it had penetrated the early miocene carbonate s iv primary objective kujung formation of banjar panji 1 was not adequately carried out and used in the well programming for banjar panji 1 in abnormal pressured formation drilling of which this well is classic case similar to hthp wells the analysis of both pore pressure and formation strength capacity is critical although pore pressure and formation strength analysis is routinely carried out when planning any well additional analysis and effort is required in abnormally pressured wells since there is often the presence of formation pressures which are close to formation strength capacity and there are present so called pressure transition zones where abnormal pressures xist above lower pressured zones once the high pressure zone has been traversed this gives rise to delicate and critical well control issues while drilling and requires careful planning for choosing casing setting depths porong1 evaluated the kujung formation with an fmt run discovering formation pore pressure of 6999 psig at 8572 ft rtkb 8535 ft ss with fluid gradient of 0394 psift to resolve this fluid type using this as regional pressure in the kujung this would give pore pressure of 6936 psig at 8376 ft ss top miocene carbonate s iv in banjar panji1 or 0824psift 1585 lbgal equivalent gradient this pore pressure is neither mentioned in section 43 of the drilling program nor represented on the pore pressure analysis chart of section 35 of the drilling program note this pore pressure is very close to the formation strength capacity at these depths there was lack of detailed technical analysis of pore pressures formation strength capacities and temperature as represen ted in the drilling program appropriate in the preparation for designing and engineering an abnormally pressured well as this 212 9 58 casing setting depth the decision to set the 9 58 casing shoe inside the kujung carbonate was technical erro

pressured formations in this case the early mioc ene unconformity at time should these potential reservoir pressures have client directors of medco well blow out assessment well banjar panji 1 east

lukman mahfoedz been risked to be exposed to open formations above the transition zone furthermore since pressure reversal is to be expected within the porous and permeable reservoir zone it is unsafe to enter this zone with high density mud used to control abnormal pressures in the transition zone it is imperative that the well be consolidated at this stage in order to permit safer and more flexible drilling conditions over the reser voir section the appropriate casing setting depth for this hole section prior to entering the primary objective kujung carbonate should have been the transition zone prior to and as close to the top miocene carbonate s iv as possible all efforts should have been focused on means for operationally determining this casing setting point although the drilling program identified the potential drilling hazards and drew significant attention to these as critical issues the programme was however flawed in the conclusions drawn and decisions made on this issue the seeds of misconstruing the physical constraints in the well and decision making based on this misunderstanding were probably sown from this stage onwards thus influencing decisionmaking during the execution of the well see section 22 and making it likely that the well would fail at some point as early abnormally pressured and hthp wells have failed in the past with various operators

consolidate the hole reasoning or discussion was transmitted by report or otherwise as to the reasons for the decision elimination of the 11 34 liner prognosed to be set at 6537 ft rtkb to cover over pore pressure transition was discussed in technical meeting of 28 april 2007 sic and noted in memorandum summary of meeting for banjar panji dated jakarta may 01 2006 the note states lapindos team informed that the kick tolerance calculations number allows drilling upto 8500 ft and proposed to eliminate casing 11 34 medcos team agreed that proposal with reason as informed by lapindo brantass geologist there is weak zone or reactively shale that creates loss circulation or caving problem in the interval 3500 8500 in case encounter caving indication the drilling will be stoppedand set 11 34 prior continues to drill deeper however after this date and with the setting of 13 38 casing shallower than prognosed the 11 34 liner appears to have been forgotten abou t since in all discussion in memos and correspondence following this phase only the 9 58 casing is discussed and referred to although there may not have been any clay sections that reacted with oil based drilling fluids the extensive open hole section and penetration of the kujung which could have produced brine similar to or the same as that in porong 1 could have been envisaged as lithologicalfluids risk to the open

involves robust discussion and sometimes argument amongst drilling personnel geologists and geophysicists partners and petroleum engineers about the merits of calling halt where everyone agrees they are in the well and consolidating the well at given point with reference to the drilling program this communication does not seem to have taken place in the drilling of ban jar panji1 except in the latter stages of drilling 12 14 hole for 958 casing it is thus unclear who was making casing setting depth decisions for what reason changes were made to the drilling program and were these changes authorised by the oper ator and if so by who neglecting to set the 11 34 liner or even the 9 58 casing as it became later and leaving the hole open from the depth where 13 38 casing had been set shallower than programmed to drill on towards and penetrate the abnormally pressured reservoir section see section 222 could be regarded as reckless given the potential constraints for handling kicks

principal cause of the loss of the well which later occurred during attempted well killing operations at depth of 4241 ft rtkb on 28 may 200 6 for if pipe had not been removed from the hole to shallower depth the well would more easily have been controlled and the opportunity for further remedial operations would have continued to be in place such as curing lost circulation zones squeeze ce

pipe with the well unstable in the condition at which decision was made to remove pipe at 8700 ft rtkb the act of pulling pipe or the speed at which it was pulled caused pressure drop to swab the well

at 4241 ft andor during running and cementing of 13 38 casing on the daily drilling report of 28 may 2006 it was noted that the maximum allowable pump pressure or maximum allowable annulus surface pressure was 300 psi the mud weight in use at that time was 147 ppg according to the swaco mud report during the well kick encountered on 28 may with shutin drillpipe pressure recorded of 350 psi at 4241 ft this is an additional 00825 psift or 159 ppg making total equivalent pressure on the well bore of 163 ppg the casing annulus pressure was recorded as 450 psi making an additional 0106 psift or 2 ppg but we cannot deduce the pressure at bottom hole from this reading since the fluids content in the annulus are unknown the leakofftest at commencement of drilling 12 14 hole below the 13 38 casing was measured as 164 ppg the pressures exerted on the wellbore at this depth when taking account of dynamic pressure losses while circulating were thus probably sufficient to fracture the formation further data pump pressure charts mud records etc and analysis required to confirm with certainty the evidence suggests since the swaco mud report notes continuing losses that the wellbore

reported total losses of 795 bbls during these casing and cementing operations with such heavy losses the operator made investigation whatsoever to ascertain the cause of the losses or whether the 13 38 cementing had been successful this was in contravention of good oilfield practice and bpmigas recommended practice for safe conduct of onshore and offshore drilling operations article 401 clause 5 the 1338 cementation should have been subject to further testing andor evaluation to ascertain whether there was acceptable cement placement and isolation behind casing and if not squeezed to ensure this conformity and isolation when the well later kicked on the 28 may fractured r weakened formations in such scenario in the vicinity would have provided the path for the escape of higher pressured fluids arriving at these depths as result of percolation or entrainment from swabbing up the wellbore from the early miocene carbo nate to the same formations at this depth or other faults or formations deeper in the well and thence the flows observed to surface not recognising the implications of the 13 38 casing operation fluid losses to the formation was technical error and lack of competence it was certainly lack of good judgment for if it had been recognised that formation strength had been compromised to less than 164 ppg from these depths or deeper then decisions to continue drilling deeper than 8500 ft missing out the 11 34 casing or when considering the setting depth of the 9 58 casing would possibly have been made in different light furthermore the indication of such
