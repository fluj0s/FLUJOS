modernization background and issues for congress1 introduction recent military operations pa rticularly those in af ghanistan and iraq have brought to the fore number of outstanding questions concerning helicopters in the us armed forces including deployabi lity safety survivab ility affordability and operational effectiveness these concerns are especially releva nt and made more complicated in an age of military tran sformation the global war on terrorism and increasing pressure to rein in f unding for the military all of which provide contradictory pressures with regard to dods large and often complicated military helicopter modernization efforts in ddition military helicopter s operational roles and missions may also be challenged by the emergence of number of significant factors including the increased use and capabilities of unmanned platforms2 the perception of increased vulnerability in combat situations and the increased effectiveness of fixedwing aircraft equipped with preci sion munitions in the close air support cas role3 yet emerging demands of homeland defense and stability operations may increase he licopter applications the department of defense dod fiel ds 10 different ty pes of helicopters which are largely of 1960s and 1970s desig n this inventory num bers approximately 5500 rotarywing aircraft not including an additional 144 belonging to the coasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32447crs2 4 the us coast guard operates approximately 144 helicopters this figure fluctuates operationally due to maintenance schedules major missions performed by these aircraft include searchrescue law enforcement environmental response ice operations and air interdiction the majority of the coast guar ds helicopters 94 total inventory are hh65 dolphin short range recovery aircraft the hh65 is built by the french company aerospatiale and are based at coast guard air stations in michigan hawaii puerto rico new jersey texas california florida alabama louisiana oregon washington and georgia the coast guard also operates 42 hh60 jayhawk medium range recovery helicopters the jayhawk is built by sikorsky and based in alabama alaska california florida massachusetts north carolina and oregon the mh68a stingray is the coast guards short range armed interdiction helicopter built by the italian company augusta the coast guards eight stingray helicopters are based in jacksonville florida for more information on the coast guard its missions nd its fixed and rotary wing aircraft see httpwwwuscgmiluscgshtm the coast guard is planning to modernize 207 of its aircraft including its helicopter fleet through its deepwater program for more information about the deepwater program and the specific mix of manned and unmanned air vehicles to be proc ured see crs report rs21019 coast guard deepwater program background and issues for congress additionally number of agencies involved in homeland security and border security such as immigration and customs enforcement and customs and border protection operate ol der military utility and observation helicopters eg oh6a uh1h hh60j or civilian helicopters eg eurocopter as350b1 hughes 500 bell jetranger md500e nd md600n some of these helicopters are armed and most are equipped with forwardlooking infra red sensors and search lights see david hughes homefront security aviation week space technology mar 15 2004 for more information 5 see httpglobalsecurityorgmilitarysystemsaircrafth60varhtm many of these types and variants have already been retired from th fleet or are in the process of being either renamed or replaced to reflect ne w mission functions andor capabilities 6 note that light medium and heavy rotorcraft will often overlap with regard to maximum gross weights as some variants of the same type may cross into another weight rangeguard 4 and ranges from simple utility platforms such as the ubiquitous uh1 huey to highlyadvanced multimission platforms such as the air forces mh 53j pave low special operations helicopter and the stilldevelopmental mv22b osprey tiltrotor aircraft also there are large and potentially confusing number of types and variants of the same basic helicopter pl atform for example dod has so far acquired seven differe nt types of the h60 black hawk design the ch60 eh60 hh60 mh60 sh60 uh60 and the vh60 these design types have in turn multiple variants5 helicopter cl assifications rotarywing aircraft are described and cl assified in number of different ways the most general method is according to gross weight although it should be noted that there has yet to be universal agreement with regard to the specific thresholds nevertheless for the purpose of this report light will generally refer to those rotarywing aircraft weighing less than 12000 lbs medium or mediumlift are those weighing between 12000 and 45000 lbs and heavy or heavylift are those which weigh more6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32447crs3 7 these capabilities and therefore classifications will frequently overlap as certain missions such as troop transport cargo tran sport and medicalevacuation or medevac do not necessarily require special modifications be madea more specific method of classification involves the specific lettering used to identify different types of helicopters which are based on that platforms primary mission capability7 central to this classification system is the letter h for helicopter which is immediately followed by number indicating specific design eg h1 h60 etc the one signifi cant exception is the tiltrotor v22 osprey which can be more accurately described as hybrid aircraft such as the av8 harrier jump jet with vertical takeoff and landing vtol capability next in importance is singleletter prefix which indicates particular mission capability or missionset for that helicopter design th prefixes and their meaning have included the following attack c cargo electronic h hospitalmedevacsearch and rescue m multipurpose observation r reconnaissance s antisurfaceantisubmarine u utility and v vipstaff singleletter suffixes are th added after the design numbers to differentiate between variants ofte n indicating improve d standards andor configurations of equipm ent andor armaments helicopters in the us armed forces the army has six different types of helicopters in service its central platform is the mediumlift h60 black hawk wh ich serves primarily as troop utility transport in the air assault role complementing it are the slightly smaller h1 huey and the much larger heavylift ch 47 chinooks the active army has two attacktype helicopters the first being the lighter reconnaissanceattack oh58 kiowa and the second being the ah64 apach attack

aged to re quire rebuilding more involved modernization approach upgrades often do not address reliability and readiness challenges that can plague aging helicopt ers stripping and rebuilding the airframe while adding new engines transmissions and rotor assemblies is more cost effective in the long run in many instances in other cases the need to replace legacy helicopters with new models justifies the time and expense of research and development and procurement programs however as in the case of the recent comanche cancellation new procurement programs can sometimes become too expensive for the benefits offered this section describes ongoing service pl ans to modernize specific aircraft the following text focuses on the key issues for each modernization program those

billion over more than 20 years with only two prototypes to show for the effort this report has therefore included the armys new army aviation modernization plan which plans for the comanche cancellati on and the subsequent use of comanche funds11 the army also has number of ongoing modernization prog rams which apply to almost every platform in the avia tion fleet although funding

rotorcraft overview world military and civil aircraft briefing teal group inc july 2003 p8generally at issue is whether these pl anned expenditures are appropriate and acceptable in light of current and proj ected federal and dod budget constraints second dod is facing what many both in dod and in congress have called budgetary train wreck caused by too many programs vying for already scarce funds108 review of dods most recent estima tes indicates that current aviation acquisition programs total 563 billion in past current and anticipated costs109 additional budgetary complications co mpeting in general with helicopter modernization are the mounting costs of the conflicts in afghanis tan and iraq which the administration estimates w ill require at least another 25 billion in supplemental costs110 the anticipated cost of helicopter mode rnization especially in light of the budget pressures described bove generate number of stions that may arise in the course of congressional oversight for example can and should the current plans be modified to reduce costs are there cases where helicopter modernization can be postponed the services and their proponents are likely to argue that modernization cant be postponed they would likely not that military helicopt er deliveries were cut almost in half during the 1990s111 and that many 1970s er helicopters face block obsolescence without modernization can modernization methods that incur more costs in the near term such as the design and manufacture of new helicopters be replaced by modernization approaches that incur lower near term costs upgrades and service life extension programs sleps are two potential examples can the services more aggressively pursue technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles uavs that may and some argue may not be cheaper than manned helicopter for example some questions could be raised about the cost effectiveness of the proposed armed r econnaissance helicopter program some could contend that the army already has existing platforms or programs which when augmented by technologies from the cancelled comanche program would probably permit them to satisfy the ar med reconnaissance helicopters missions three examples include the block iii ah64 apache the additional reconnaissance cap abilities in the fire scout unmanned aerial rotorcraft and the extendedrange multipurpose uavs although the latter itself might facehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32447crs25 112 emily hsu fcs to retain initial comanche capabilities inside the army online mar 29 2004 113 email communication from navy office of gislative affairs 558 naval aviation programs to crs may 6 2004 114 one immediate problem is that terminating the comanche program will incur cancellation fees which could reduce the amount of anticipated savings 115 letter from joshua b bolten director offi ce of management and budget to honorable j dennis hastert speaker of the house of representatives mar 5 2004scrutiny as new uav program among the many that have been facing pressure to consolidate112 another question is how much more reduction in force structure or consolidation in terms of the number of diffe rent aircraft types can be pursued as cost saving measure through consolida ting its helicopter fleet from seven to only two types of helicopters the navy hopes to realize operations and maintenance savings estimated at 18 to 20 b illion over twenty year period113 if inventory numbers fall as part of this consolida tion however does spending on readiness have to increase to maintain the same capability if so how much would that defray om savings could the army field an all black hawk force if so what would be the savings over heterogeneous force another issue is how the approxima tely 146 billion in procurement funds resulting from the comanche cancellation should be invested the army has produced plan for spending that 146 b illion on modernizing most of the other helicopters in its fleet and initiating new helicopter programs such as the luh and the armed reconnaissance he licopter yet some questi on whether the funds made available from the comanche cancellation are sufficient to adequately subsidize the armys stated aviation ambitions114 the office of management and budget requested reallocation of the 12 b illion in requested comanche fy2005 rd spending these funds would be reallo cated to purchase helicopter aircraft survivability equipment and additional he licopters and to upgrade and accelerate helicopter recapitalization115 yet the army would require additional funding reallocation to fund other aviation objec tives such as acceler ating tactical uav programs some may find however that more urgent problems either within army eg funding the future combat system or out side the army eg general war costs offer more compelling demands for these f unds it is currently not clear whether congress will reallocate some portion or even all of the funds made available by the comanche cancellation to progra ms outside of army aviation final question pertains to funding mechanisms might the budgetary tensions presented above generate increased pre ssure for legislators to adopt new or previously controversial funding pproaches to satis fy dods helicopter modernization plans for example leasing rather than procuring military helicopters may become more attractive to some legislators because lease typically requires less money up front than does pr ocurement contract it may be for example that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32447crs26 116 see crs report rl31404 on the full funding principle and crs report rl32056 on the kc767 leaselack of nearterm budget in the air for ce procurement account was one factor that stimulated policy makers to pursue the c ontroversial lease of 100 boeing kc767 aerial refueling aircraft instead of the mo re traditional procurem ent congress has also traditionally demanded that dod pursue full f unding principle in its procurement programs so not to tie the hands of future congresses yet exceptions to full funding called incremental funding ve been allowed in some circumstances such as the eventual kc767 2080 co mpromise incremental funding profiles typically allow more even authoriza tion of funds over time than full funding profiles which can be dvantageous in budget c onstrained environments116 critics however note that this appr oach limits future flexibility and may foreclose future options force structure dods current helicopter modernization plans may raise questions on future force structure the rationale behind the planned numbers for so future helicopter inventories is unclear and may be subject to examina tion for example the current aviation modernization plan indicates that the army will procure approximately 456 fewer attackreconnaissance helic opters than it currently fields this is almost 35 decrease in the current force structure it is likely that this smaller inventory is anticipated to be as effective as the larger force due to helicopter improvements and through the effective exploitation of uavs but is this the case is this smaller force enough to maintain or improve combat cap abilities can the army accurately predict and quantifiably demonstrate that this smaller force is as or more lethal than the larger force if not does the army have hedging strategy if desired improvements in future helicopter programs do not co to fruition or if uavs become more difficult to exploit or are not as eff ective as hoped will the army procure more attackreconnaissa nce helicopters recent press reports describe some army techniques for increasing the effectiveness of smaller helicopter for ces these techniques include improvements to radar infrared sensors and communica tions changes to doctrine and concepts of operation may also be utilized training and experimentation with tactics and doctrine has been conducted for the korean peninsula as one example and these lessons learned may be applicable elsewhere operating in smaller formations would reduce the exposure of helicopters to air defenses and allow the army to overwhelm north korean forces by attacking from multiple directionsthe goal would be to mass fires not mass formationsthe concept of smaller formations is critical in korea and other mountainous environments eg afghanis tan where there is limited number of valleys helicopters can fly through to reach target making them more vulnerable to airdefense traps because an adversary could probably not

approach splitting the force should allow at least some to engage the enemy unimpeded117 conversely the navy appears to be addi ng rather than reducing helicopter force structure the navy currently plans to replace 386 legacy aircraft with 497 mh 60rs helicopters what is the navys justification for purchasing 111 more multipurpose helicopters than are required t oday typically more effective aircraft are purchased in smaller quantities than the legacy aircraft they replace does the navy foresee the requirement for this kind of capability increasing the armys aviation modernization pl an does not indicate how many joint vertical airlift task forces jvatf it will equip the army does indicate that 303 luh platforms will be procured but this is just one of several helicopters that will populate the jvtaf the apportionment of the various utility helicopters among the jfatfs is not currently clear congress may opt to inquire into this issue to determine the depth and ma turity of army plans finally question remains about force st ructure coordination the services are making plans that may significantly alte r the size of their individual helicopter inventories over the coming decades are these plans and their potential force structure implications being adequately coordinated and considered by the joint staff or office of the secretary of defense to ensure maximum operational economic and industrial benefit coordination of modernization efforts diversity and competition among the armed services can often be positive diversity can complicate our adversarys planning and the creative friction from competition can lead to new and impr oved warfighting approaches in weapons acquisition and modernization however th savings and efficiencies derived by coordination and jointn ess often are more beneficial th an the fruits of diversity and competition all the services are pursuing or have initiated helicopter modernzation programs some of these plans are broad in scope and effect he licopter programs for decades at issue is whether there is sufficient coordination among these programs to realize maximum be nefit do opportunities exist for closer coordination if so would this coordination save money or result in increased jointness as described in the previous section of this report the services already fly many of the same helicopters and plans to consolidate the num ber of types of helicopters will perpetuate this state of affairs there appear to be however several opportunities for increased consolid ation that may be explored one

separa uh1 replacement programs have the services explored the effi cacy of cancelling either the luh or the common vertical lift support platform cvlsp and making th survivor joint program along the same line of inquiry congre ss may probe why the army veloping the luh prior to the announcement of the intended coma nche cancellation th army planned on replacing the uh1 with uh60 variant and creating an all blackhawk fleet homogenous fleet based on proven platform one that is flown by the navy and air force appears to offer the potential for om savings similarly the marine corps could consider replacing its h1 helicopters with the mh60s as the navy is doing and achieve increased commonality with its sister service alternatively the marine corps could participate in the armys luh the air forces common vertical lift support pl atform program or preferably joint program derived from either th army or air force program there are number of options that some observers maintain the marines could consider to replace the ah1 cobras sooner rather than later and facilitate the expedited retirement of h1 airframes fro m dods inventory for example the marine corps could consider the ah60 battlehawk developed by sikorsky for the australian army if congress decides to block the comanche retirement and the army continues operating the oh58d the mari ne corps could consider that

use of uavs for this mission if so could the h6s be retired and replaced by variant of the armys luh or preferably could the h6s be replaced by variant of joint army and air force prog ram conversely some argue that the h6 is an attractive candidate to replace oh58s through the armys light armed reconnaissance helicopter larh program which is expected to be fielded in 2007 with total of 368 units

competition conversely how much of consideration should i ndustrial base factors be in determining modernization strategies some industry observers predict resp ectable growth in military helicopter production from 2003 to 2012 compared to the 19932002 period123 up to 8700 helicopters worth 78 billion are projected to be built world wide would the cancellation of the comanche have negative or positive impact on this projection would it cut jobs or actually create jobs many observers assert that if the comanche is cancelled it will have negative nearterm effects in terms of job loss124 sikorsky officials hope that m odernization activity that will be pursued in lieu of the comanche will make up for most of these lost jobs however it does not appear that the armys current plans to purchase an additional 80 uh60s will offset the value of the comanches cancelled this suggest s that winning new contracts may be important for this company to sustain its position in the helicopter industry other large companies such as lockheed martin will continue to work on other projects such as apache components and upgrades the cancellation of the comanche could retard sikorskys entry into the attack helicopter market how will this effect sikorskys longerterm diversification and competitiveness will this result in less competition for boeing and bell in terms of producing attack

operating at 50 percent capacity125 while much of the defense aviation industrial base has consolidated over the past 15 years eg only boeing and lockheed martin t oday manufacture new fighter aircraft the helicopter industrial ba has not followed suit there are currently five large global helicopter firms these companies include bell helicopter boeing and sikorsky in the united states and eurocopter and augustawestland in europe126 some say that the planned cancellation of the comanche program is likely to hasten helicopter industry consolidation it was difficult to purchase or sell companies involved in the comanche pr ogram these observers argue because company valuation was too tenuous now th at the comanche appears likely to be cancelled boeing may be more likely and more able to sell its military helicopter business united technologies the parent company of sikorsky helicopters is one potential buyer127 domestic helicopter manufact urers today appear to face increasing competition from eurocopter and augustawestland the european companies are spending increasing amounts of money on rd and have increased their market share of sales over the past 10 years128 the european domestic market for military helicopters is much smaller than that in the united states and many observe that the europeans are poised to increase their attempts to penetrate the us defense market the competition for the us presidential helicopter contract is one example some say that expertise in domestic and military tilt rotor technology is one advantage that us companies have over european comp anies if true to what degree should supporting us competitiveness be fact or in making decisions on the v22 program129 noting the desire of european companies to more effectively penetrate the us defense market some argue that bell helicopter merger with augustawestland is another possibility current political tensions between the united states and many european countries however as well as trade and competitiveness concerns may make such an international merger more difficult than national one also the potential vulnerability of the v22 program could make

needs and to achieve defense strategy goals do dods modernization efforts put todays helicopter programs on path to meet tomorrows challenges based on experience with helicopters in number of recent conflicts it appears that improvements in deployability reliability survivability and safety might prove particularly valuable deployability before helicopters can contribute to the fight they must get to the fight unlike longrange aircraft or ev theaterrange aircraft helicopters range is too short to allow them to self deploy across oceans while this problem is largely solved for navy and marine corps helicopt ers by being based on aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships air force and ar my helicopters typically are transported by air or sea to the theater of conflict an army helicopter task force task force hawk participating in the 1999 conflict in serbia operation allied force heightened awareness of the difficulties sometimes associated with deploying helicopter forces to and around theater of conflict130 in kosovo the army was criticized fo r not being able to quickly deploy and use task force hawk group of 24 ah64 apache attack helicopters accompanied by mechanized ground units critic s emphasized that the task force had grown into 5000soldier force that required 500 c17 sor ties to deploy while many of the specific organizationa l and planning problems of task force hawk appear to have been addressed131 deploying to subsequent operations in afghanistan and iraq have heightened cerns about potential ai rlift shortfalls it may be that fighting global war on terrorism could place even greater demand on improved helicopter deployability do todays helicopter modernization programs do enough to improve deployability folding rotorblades are one innovation that can make it easier to fit helicopters into airlift aircraft are other techniques being pursued increasing helicopter range can increase the number of installations at which helicopters can be based and still r each the fight increasing helicopter effectiveness through improving capabilities or by integrating the aircraft with uavs can lead to reduction in fo rce structure and organization which in turn can improve deployability changes in helicopter organi zation can help addr ess deployability how much experimentation are the services pursuing toward

and that it would have to find innovative ways to address readiness and maintenance challenges133 has the army and other services budgeted enough in terms of spare parts and diagnostic equipment to address the high wear and tear caused by the combination of high operations tempo and harsh nvironments some argue that current helicopters suffer from mainta inability and reliability probl ems in part because they were not originally designed to operate in the harsh environments of iraq and afghanistan134 if true will moderniz ation be enough to impr ove maintainability and reliability of legacy helicopters or would newbuild programs make more sense from reliability standpoint do opportunities exist to more widely implement programs like the marine corps mod programs wh ich will resu

afghanistan alone how will the army meet its operational and readiness challenges if it loses more and more aircraft to upgrades and maintenance so army leaders have ex pressed concerns but have not
