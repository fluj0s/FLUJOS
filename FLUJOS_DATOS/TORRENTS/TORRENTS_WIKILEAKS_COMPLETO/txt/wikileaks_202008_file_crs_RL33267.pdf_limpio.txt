various environmental laws has been the subject of public scrutiny and debate in congress as result numerous administrative and legislative efforts both proposed and enacted have intended to expedite or streamline the environmental compliance process although methods to do so vary streamlining measures are often proposed or implemented when the participation of multiple local state tribal or federal agencies is necessary to comply with various environmental requirements streamlining measures may be applied to various environmental compliance processes such as federal permitting or approvals major focus of streamlining efforts has been the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa 42 usc 4321 et seq the implemen tation of which is overseen by the council on environmental quality ceq among other provisions nepa requires federal agencies to analyze environmental impacts and involve the publ ic before proceeding with any major federal action significantly affecting the human environment many agencies have implemented administrative and legislative streamlining actions including the department of agriculture u sda department of transportation dot department of the interior doi army corps of engineers the corps department of energy doe and federal energy regulatory commission ferc streamlining efforts vary from agency to agency but usually involve one or more of the following elem ents designating specific agency as the lead agency responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable requirements directing the lead agency to develop coordinated environmental review process specifying certain lead agency authority eg to establish project deadlines or develop dispute resolution procedures codifying existing regulations delegating specific federal au thority to states designating specific activities as being categorically excluded or exempt from ce rtain elements of nepa and establishing limits on judicial review streamlining proposals have generated great deal of controversy proponents of such measures argue that streamlining efforts are needed to cut through the bureaucratic red tape often associated with federal project delivery others c ounter that such actions are an attempt to weaken environmental protection and lessen public participation in federal decisionmaking processes this report discusses elements of nepa relevant to streamlining issues associated with determining project delays attributed to nepa common streamlining methods and recently enacted legislative and administrative streamlining activities

factors can affect the timing of federal project delivery factors that may contribute to delays in federal project include changes in the planning and design process changes in funding priorities construction complexities local controversy or community opposition to project and compliance with myriad local state tribal or federal laws with regard to the latter certain federal actions such as highway construction projects and permitting for mining operations cattle grazing forest thinning and energy development projects may trigger compliance with literally dozens of statutor and regulatory requirements these in turn may require the participation or input of possibly dozens of local state tribal or federal agencies in recent years the time it takes to comply with various environmental laws has been the subject of public scrutiny and debate in congress one law that has been the subject of particular scrutiny has been the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa 42 usc 43214347 signed into law by president nixon on january 1 1970 nepa declared national policy to protect the environment and created council on environmental quality ceq in the executive office of the president to implement the na tional policy nepa requires that environmental factors be considered when federal agencies make decisions and that detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the human environment the detailed statement referenced in the w is now known as an environmental impact statement eis ceq regulations for implementing nepa among other provisions introduced additional levels of environmental reviewthose for environmental assessments eas and categorical exclusions generally eas are prepared to determine whether the impacts of federal action will be significant under nepa an action is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an eis or an ea if it is of type or in category known to have significant environmental impacts for more detail on these requirements see the discussion regarding the nepa process in the following section of this report also see crs report rs20621 overview of national environmental policy act nep requirements by kristina alexander and crs report rl33152 the national environmental policy act background and implementation by linda luther the preparation of eiss is probably the bestk nown requirement of nepa however projects requiring an eis represent small fraction of all federal actions for example from 1986 to 2006 an average of 255 final eiss were filed with epa each year 1 by comparison in 1997 ceq reported that federal agencies estimated that approximately 50000 eas were prepared annually2 determining the total number of federal actions subject to nepa is difficult as most agencies track only the number of actions requiring an eis one agency that tracks all its projects is the department of transportations dot fede ral highway administration fhwa in 2005 fhwa reported that just over 84 of all highway projects were classified as categorical exclusions representing just over 815 of fhwa project funding 9 required

funding3 although they may be small in number compared with all federal actions projects requiring an eis often include those with the greatest impacts and highest stakeholder interest stakeholders such as state and local project sponsors and industry representatives with an interest in the implementation of federal actions charge that meeting nepas environmental review requirements is sometimes done inefficiently and can be overly timeconsuming such critics charge that the law creates complicated array of regulations and logistical delays that stall agency action environmental organizations look at the nepa process as an essential tool to help agencies plan and manage federal actions in responsible way by requiring policymakers and project sponsors to consider the environmental implications of their actions before decisions are made they also view the nepa process as an important mechanism to provide the public with an opportunity to be involved in agency planning efforts they argue that expediting what is supposed to be deliberative process is not necessarily in the best interest of the public or the environment further they argue that blaming the environmental compliance process for project delays is misplaced they contend that if federal projects are in fact delayed by the nepa process it is because agencies required to participate in the process are overburdened and insufficiently funded staffed or equipped to meet the demand as result of the debate between stakeholders regarding nepas implementation numerous administrative and legislative actions have been proposed to expedite compliance with nepa the activities associated with such proposals are often collectively referred to as streamlining regulatory or legislative definition of streamlining exists it is defined differently by different stakeholders or agencies for different classes of projects however the term is often used to describe process or procedures intended to accelerate decision making especially when the input of multiple federal state tribal or local agencies is required to comply with multiple environmental laws regulations or executive orders for example fhwa may propose highway construction project that affects wetlands that are home to an endangered species within the context of conducting review of the envi ronmental impacts of the project under nepa fhwa may also be required to demonstrate comp liance with elements of the clean water act and the endangered species act as result the us environmental protection agency epa the us army corps of engineers and the department of the interiors fish and wildlife service would have statutory obligations to participate in the proposed project these agencies with potentially conflicting missions eg protecting endangered species or sensitive wetlands versus building highway are then required to work together to review various aspects of fhwa s proposed project streamlining efforts may be implemented with the intent of expediting the requirement of having these agencies work together many of the issues leading to call for streamlining as well as challenges to implementing such actions are summed up in the following excerpt from report issued by the national conference of state legislatures regulators often lack guidance on how to successfully integrate the complicated requirements of state and federal environmental laws and regulations depending on the complexity of the issue and the priority given the issue by decision makers decisions can be 3 fhwas steamlining

individual regulators tend to be experts in only one set of laws and regulations this tends to create some resistance to proposals that coordinate or integrate the provisions of different laws regulators tend to be cautious about integrating the requirements of different laws unless they can define all possible regulatory and technical impacts 4 this statement recognizes that barriers to efficient decision making arise not from nepa alone but from the challenges of integrating compliance with multitude of laws and regulations that may apply to given federal action

g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 nepa has been interpreted by the courts to be procedural statute with two primary aims5 first it obligates federal agencies to consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of an action before proceeding with it second it ensures that the agency will inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process in this capacity nepa has become one of the primary mechanisms through which the public is able to participate in the federal decisionmaking process as procedural statute the courts have ruled that nepa does not require agencies to elevate environmental concerns above others instead nepa requires only that the agency assess the environmental consequences of an action and its alternatives before proceeding if the adverse environmental effects of the proposed action are adequately identified and evaluated the agency is not constrained by nepa from deciding that other benefits outweigh the environmental costs and moving forward with the action nepa is declaration of policy with action forcing provisions not regulatory statute comparable to other environmental laws intended to protect air water wetlands or endangered species it establishes the basic framework for integrating environmental considerations into federal decision making however the law itself does not provide many details on how this process should be accomplished for example alt hough nepa gave ceq variety of duties the authority to promulgate regulations implementing nepas environmental review requirements was not one 6 that authority was ultimately given to ceq by executive order in 19777 but it did 4 the national conference of state legislatures environment energy and

decisions did determine that ceqs interpretation of nepas requirements was owed substantial deference by courts 7 executive order 11991 relating to protection and enhancement of environmental quality

ceqs regulations was to reduce the time and paperwork required to prepare an eis the ceq regulations were intended to be generic in nature each federal agency was required to develop its own nepa procedures that would be specific to typical classes of actions undertaken by that agency9 separately ceq regulations directed federal agencies to review their existing policies procedures and

for legislation and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment detailed statement by the responsible official on the environmental impact of the proposed action 11 the detailed statement is now referred to as an environmental impact statement eis projects for which it is not initially clear whether impacts will be significant require the preparation of an environmental assessment ea if at any time during the ea preparation it is determined that projects impacts will be significant an eis must be prepared however if in preparing the ea the agency determines that the project will have significant environmental impact finding of significant impact fonsi will be issued by the lead agency the fonsi must briefly present the reasons why the proj ect will not have significant effect on the environment if project is of type or in category known to have significant environmental impacts it is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare and ea or eis individual agencies are required to specifically list in their respective nepa procedures those projects that are likely to be considered categorical exclusions ces12 for example dot has identified the construction of bicycle and pedestrian lanes landscaping and the installation of traffic signals as actions that would generally be classified as categorical exclusions13 some agency nepa procedures answer the questi on of whether or what types of documentation may be required to demonstrate that project is categorically excluded by focusing on whether the project involves extraordinary circumstances that may cause normally excluded action to 8 ceq is charged with providing oversight and guidance to agencies with regard to eis preparation epa is required to review and

report on proposals for legislation and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment interpretation of each element of th is phrase has been the subject of myriad court decisions and guidance from ceq the ceq regulations at 40 cfr 150818 specify that the term major in the phrase major federal action reinforces but does not have meaning independent of significantly therefore in determining whether and how nepa will apply to an action it is necessary to determine whether an action is in fact federal one and if so if its environmental impacts will be significant federal actions include those that are potentially subject to federal control and responsibility such actions include projects and programs entirely or partly funded assisted conducted regulated or approved by federal agencies 15 specifically federal agency compliance with nepa may be required for actions that require federal permit or other regulatory decision to proceed16 ceq regulations require agencies to determine the significance of projects impacts on case bycase basis based on its context and intensity17 because degrees of impact must be evaluated such an evaluation may be highly subjective although court decisions have been rendered regarding most elements of nepa implementation few federal courts have attempted to specifically define significance most often court will determine whether the evidence for given project involved potentially significant environmental effects and then decide whether the agencys decision not to prepare an eis was reasonable

regulations specify that to the fullest extent possible agencies must prepare the nepa documentation concurrently with any other environmental requirements24 the appropriate nepa documentation must also indicate any federal permits licenses and other entitlements required to implement the proposed project this means that compliance requirements of any additional environmental laws regulations or executive orders must be determined but not necessarily completed during the nepa process in this capacity nepa functions as an umbrella statute meaning it is framework to coordinate or demonstrate compliance with any studies reviews or consultations required by any other environmental laws the use of nepa in this capacity has led to confusion the need to comply with another environmental law such as the clean water act or endangered species act may be identified within the framework of the nepa process but nepa itself is not the source of the obligation if hypothetically the requirement to comply with nepa were removed compliance with each applicable law would still be required for additional information about nepas hist ory and requirements see crs report rl33152 the national

debate regarding the need for streamlining measures originates from assertions that nepa delays federal projects the debate stems from disagreement among stakeholders regarding the degree to which if any the nepa process itself is to blame for federal project delays delays attributed to the nepa process generally fall into two broad categories those related to the time needed to complete required documentation primarily eiss and delays resulting from neparelated litigation g6g142g157g142g155g150g146g151g146g151g144g561g6g142g149g138g162g156g561g20g142g149g138g157g142g141g561g157g152g561g16g7g18g3g561g6g152g140g158g150g142g151g157g561g18g155g142g153g138g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 the research data collection analyses and public participation necessary to prepare nepa documentation takes time in some cases years the debate begins when stakeholders attempt to determine the extent to which the preparation of nepa documentation alone adds to or delays the time to complete federal project several unique aspects of nepa make it difficult to determine the degree to which the nepa process itself is the source of delays first other than the department of energy doe and very recently dot federal and state agencies do not routinely maintain information on th time needed to complete the nepa process therefore gathering accurate data specific to the time needed to prepare nepa documents is difficult also for some classes of projects document preparation under nepa is generally done concurrently with other stages of project such as preliminary project design if project undergoes specification changes those changes may necessitate changes in nepa analysis and documentation consequently the time to complete the nepa process may be extended however determining if such delays are directly attributed to the nepa process itself may be problematic 24 40 cfr

the time taken on federal project that actually involves the nepa process when measuring the length of the nepa process for given project an agency generally looks at the date of the notice of intent noi to file an eis and the date of the rod however these dates do not necessarily reflect the time it take to prepare nepa documentation for given project federal project may stop and restart for any number of reasons that are unrelated to nepa or any other environmental requirement this may be the case particularly for costly or controversial projects for example filing an noi in 1988 and subsequently issuing the rod in 1998 does not necessarily mean that it took 10 years to complete the eis the time it took to co mplete the project may have been associated with funding issues changes in agency priorities community opposition to the project or engineering requirements to name few second project having significant impacts on the environment is likely to require compliance with number of environmental laws the use of nepa as an umbrella statute blurs the distinction between the time to complete the nepa process and the time it takes to address other environmental requirements the sometimes extensive reviews required under other environmental laws by agencies such as the corps the fish and wildlife service the coast guard or epa as well as various state regulatory agencies are often attributed to the nepa process in fact the nepa process may be extended as result of the need to complete permitting process or other analysis required under separate statutory authority eg the clean water act or endangered species act over which the lead agency may have authority one agency fhwa observed that many delayed projects or failed processes can be traced back to disintegrated and disconnected approach to meeting nepa and other requirements fhwa stated that experience in administering nepa has show n that many practitioners do not fully understand or practice the approach of using the nepa process as an umbrella for integrating all required studies reviews or consultations 25 third project with significant impacts may be large highprofile complex project costing millions of dollars depending on the impacts such projects may generate local controversy and be opposed by certain stakeholders delays of such projects are wellknown among agency officials and interested stakeholders however such projects make up small percentage of all federal actions further although examples of neparelated delays associated with such projects exist few data suggest that delays associated with them are widely applicable to all federal projects subject to nepa finally it has been observed that it takes longer to complete necessary nepa documentation today than it did in the 1970s the nepa process as it is implemented today is not comparable to the nepa process soon after the law was enacted until november 1978 there were binding ceq regulations outlining eis ea or ce requirements while an eis may have been completed relatively quickly during the 1970s compared with today it may not have withstood judicial review further many agencies did not have their own nepa procedures until well into the 1980s such procedures may make the process take longer today but they may result in fewer overall project delays in situations where adherence to the procedures results in more legally sound eis also there were fewer environmental laws and regulations in the 1970s see reference to the use of nepa as an umbrella statute above and the public is more involved in the nepa process today than in the 1970s 25 notice of proposed rulemaking 65 fed reg 33965 may 25 2000 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33267g22g145g142g561g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561

of nepa often cite litigation as significant cause of neparelated project delays such critics charge that individuals and groups who disapprove of federal project will use nepa as the basis for litigation to delay or halt that project others argue that litigation only results when an agency does not comply with its own nepa procedures since 2001 plaintiffs have primarily cited two reasons for filing neparelated lawsuits the first is that the required nepa documentation eg an eis ea or fonsi was inadequate that may mean that they charge that among other things an eis or ea did not include sufficient analysis of all project alternatives did not consider all reasonable project alternatives or did not adequately analyze the cumulative or indirect impacts of an action the second is that an ea was prepared when an eis should have been ie fonsi was issued when impacts were in fact significant26 nepa litigation began to decline in the mid 1970s and has remained relatively constant since the late 1980s this may be due in part to improved agency compliance after promulgation of ceq and agency nepa procedures and improved agency expertise at preparing required documentation for example in 2005 total of 118 neparelated cases were filed27 the majority of suits were filed against two agencies the department of agriculture or usda specifically the us forest service with 50 cases filed against it and the department of the interior 26 cases filed 28 although litigation has decreased agency concern regarding the threat of litigation still has an affect on the nepa process particularly for complex or controversial projects project sponsor may be mindful of previous judicial interpretation when preparing nepa documentation in an attempt to prepare litigationproof eis stak eholder opinions vary on this aspect of nepa implementation some look at it positively asserting that the fear of lawsuit makes agencies more likely to adhere to nepas requirements others counter that the threat of litigation may lead to the generation of wasteful documentation nd analysis that does not add value to but can slow the decisionmaking process like issues related to documentation several unique elements to nepa have led to litigation playing prominent role in the laws implementation for example unlike other environmentrelated statutes nepa s requirements apply only to federal agency actions and individual agency has enforcement authority over those requirements the absence of government enforcement authority is sometimes cited as the reason that litigation has been chosen as an avenue by individuals and groups that disagree with how an agency meets nepas mandate or eis requirements for given project eg they may charge that an eis is inadequate or that the environmental impacts of an action will in fact be significant when an agency claims that they are not another unique element of nepa is the role that public participation is intended to play in the process in 1997 ceq study found that the extent to which the public is involved in the 26 council on environmental quality 2005 litigation survey available at httpceqehdoegovnepanepanethtm 27 ibid 28 many of these suits relate to the finalization of land and resource management plans and implementation projects on federal land httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33267g22g145g142g561g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561

litigation29 the study found that some states citizen groups and businesses believe that certain eas are prepared to avoid public involvement ie because public participation requirements are not specified for eas as stated earlier disagreement regarding the decision to prepare an ea rather than an eis is the most common source of conflict and litigation under nepa

proffered to streamline compliance with nepas requirements those proposals have generally been unique to the categories of projects they are intended to expedite however most streamlining provisions particularly legislative proposals include similar elements for example discussed below are elements common to legislative streamlining provisions in laws enacted in the 108 th 109th and 110th congresses for discussion of selected laws in which these provisions are included see the legislation enacted section below also discussed below are selected issues associated with each element

streamlining provisions direct the lead agency to create some form of coordinated environmental review or compliance process this process often requires the lead agency to establish specific administrative procedures for processing permits license applications or environmental reviews under the nepa process often that coordinated process must be delineated in memorandum of unde rstanding mou between the designated lead agency and participating agencies for certain classes of projects eg projects that require preparation of an eis or ea legislation usually delineates required elements of the coordinated process the content of the mou or both for example it may specify certain decisionmaking authorities of the lead and participating agencies in the selection and analysis of project alternatives and it may specify methods to conduct the environmental review process under nepa concurrently with other environmental requirements some legislative proposals have allowed the lead agency to establish such process only if requested by project sponsor or applicant others specify that such process must be implemented for entire classes of projects undertaken by an agency eg all projects that require an eis proponents of coordinated compliance process argue that it is crafted to address the charge that the problem of delays with the nepa process lies in its implementation and that better coordinated process could lead to better and faster results critics are concerned with the details of such processes such as limits on participating agency input or the imposition of strict deadlines especially if those deadlines could limit public involvement 29 council on environmental quality the national environmental policy act study of its effectiveness after twentyfive

numerous provisions intended to reduce delays and paperwork30 following are current requirements in ceq regulations that are often found in streamlining proposals often as part of the coordinated environmental review process referred to above integrate requirements of nepa with ot her planning and environmental review procedures so that all procedures run c oncurrently rather than consecutively integrate the nepa process at the earliest possible time to avoid delays and potential conflicts establish appropriate time and page limits on eiss emphasize interagency cooperation before the eis is prepared rather than adversary comments on completed document some streamlining proponents argue that these directives would be more strongly emphasized if put in to law others counter that if similar regulatory provisions are already required of agencies there is guarantee that such statutory provisions would enable or cause agency staff to execute them more efficiently further they argue that the difficulty in integrating many of these existing streamlining requirements has more to do with lack of sufficient staff and resources to perform those responsibilities than lack of will to do so g6g142g149g146g151g142g138g157g146g151g144g561g14g142g138g141g561g3g144g142g151g140g162g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g162g561 as discussed previously the lead agency is the agency responsible for preparing the nepa analysis and documentation most streamlining legislation establishes in law specific agency as the lead agency for certain categories of projects and delineates that agencys authority in the environmental compliance process eg dot is to be the lead agency for surface transportation projects many legislative streamlining provisions authorize the designated lead agency to set deadlines applicable to participating agency actions and to implement dispute resolution procedures some proposals also specify in law the existing requirement that the lead agency is authorized to determine an eiss purpose and need statement and to define project alternatives as required under nepa 31 establishing lead agency in legislation specific to individual agency actions may serve to reassert lead agency authority to participating agencies however since this right is already afforded to federal agencies under current law and regulatory requirements additional legislation may not significantly streamline the compliance process 30 40 cfr 15002 and 1500415005 31 see correspondence between transportation secretary norman mineta and ceq chairman

stakeholders as potential cause for delay is the added step of obtaining federal agency approval of less complex documentation such as categorical exclusion determinations some industry stakeholders argue that some of these federal environmental responsib ilities could be delegated to states which could speed up the environmental review process by eliminating significant layer of bureaucracy that federal approval entails this approach is not endorsed by environmental stakeholders who have expressed concern that the delegation of authority to the states would be the fox guarding the hen house they argue that states often have vested interests in moving projects forward and thus their determinations may not have the level of scrutiny that would be provided with federal oversight one potential challenge to state delegation of authority includes possible lack of staff qualified to process potentially complex documentation in may 2003 the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office reported that some transportation stakeholders identified state agency staff shortages as significant cause of project delays32 if state or local agency does not have sufficient staff to accommodate its needs the delegation of additional authority to that agency may serve to slow the compliance process instead of streamline it staff at the state or local level may have difficulty determining all environmental requirements applicable to their project which could further slow the process if it takes longer to ensure that required documentation is complete it may be difficult task for project sponsor to review and approve the documentation that will ultimately demonstrate that all environmental requirements have been met for example state may have had consultant prepare nepa documentation for an eis but relied on the federal agency to provide oversight for ce determination

one method of expediting the nepa process includes specifically designating certain projects as categorical exclusions ces although this report focuses on legislative efforts to streamline the nepa process agencies may also use the regulatory process to add new ces to their nepa procedures as discussed previously individual agencies are required to list specific types of projects that can be categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an eis or ea according to ceq most agency ces were approved 10 or more years ago 33 the regulatory process usually begins with data request from an agencys headquarters to its field offices the data gathered and submitted is used to develop the proposal for new and revised ces in developing ces most agencies use information from past actions

open to public comment before final approval in using the legislative process to designate new ces congress may list specific actions undertaken by an agency that will be presumed to be categorically excluded under nepa proponents of the legislative designation of ces argue that the regulatory process of adding ces is cumbersome they further argue that because such projects have significant environmental impact their designation should be done more quickly opponents to this approach argue that legislatively designating actions as ces circumvents the process and eliminates the potential for public comment further since ce determinations generally do not provide an opportunity for public comment public involvement in such projects will likely be eliminated also opponents argue that some actions in categories designated by law as ces may in fact have potentially significant environmental impacts

review of agency action and hence not surprisingly deadline on when such petitions for review must be filed in the large majority of instances cases that consider delay in the filing of nepa litigation have applied laches an equitable defense under which court may dismiss an action after assessing the length and reasonableness of the filing delay and the resulting prejudice to the defendant numerous courts have said that laches is to be sparingly applied however out of concern that nepas environmental objectives may be frustrated in other cases courts have turned to the statute of limitations used for judicial review under the administrative procedure act that statute at 28 usc 2401 mandates broadly that civil actions against the united states must be filed within six years after the right of action first accrues one streamlining method involves the establishment of specific statute of limitations on the judicial review of final agency actions relate d to nepa eg publication of rod proponents of such provisions argue that other environmental statutes specify statutes of limitations on the filing of petitions for review often 60 to 120 days and that the six years allowed under 28 usc 2401 is too long opponents of such measures fear that if the statute of limitations is too short it will effectively eliminate the mechanism for citizen enforcement of nepas

mechanism for streamlining the nepa process for forest service activities has been through the expansion of the agencys list of ces 37 for example since 2003 the following projects have been designated as ces38 forest fuels reduction activities up to 1000 acres treated mechanically or 4500 acres burned by prescription and rehabilitation activities for lands up to 4200 acres and infrastructure affected by fires or fire suppression39 small timber harvesting projects up to 70 acres of live trees or up to 250 acres of dead or dying trees or to control insects of disease40

must demonstrate that potential impacts to certain types of resources ie public parkland historic sites wetlands threatened or endangered species and their habitat or property in minority neighborhoods have been considered and that compliance with applicable requirements is documented the perception that compliance with environmental requirements results in extensive delays and additional costs to the successful delivery of federal projects can be magnified when compliance with multiple environmental laws and regulations is required as would likely be the case with large complex federal projects ceq provides oversight and guidance to federal agencies but it does not enforce its regulations the ceq regulations were meant to be generic in nature with individual agencies formulating procedures applicable to their own projects this approach was taken due to the very different nature of projects and environmental impacts of the various federal agencies due to the nature of nepa implementation determining the time it takes to prepare nepa documentation 48 assessing the nature of delays related to nepa and finding remedies to those delays may be more appropriately accomplished agency by agency streamlining proposals have generated great deal of controversy among interested stakeholders agency representatives industry groups environmental organizations and others most stakeholders agree that the process for complyin g with environmental requirements applicable to complex federal projects could be implemented more efficiently however there is disagreement on exactly how streamlining best can be or should be accomplished stakeholders such as industry representatives who would like to see their projects implemented more quickly often feel that the authority of lead agencies must be strengthened to reduce delays caused by potential disagreements among agencies and that hard deadlines must be set and enforced environmental groups are concerned that by speeding up the compliance process and reducing emphasis on concerns of nonlead agencies streamlining will have the result of weakening environmental protections this debate is likely to continue if additional streamlining methods are proposed by agencies implementing their own nepa procedures the degree to which additional streamlining provisions will be included in legislation enacted by the 110 th congress is unclear g8g152g155g561g3g141g141g146g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 listed by federal agency the following
