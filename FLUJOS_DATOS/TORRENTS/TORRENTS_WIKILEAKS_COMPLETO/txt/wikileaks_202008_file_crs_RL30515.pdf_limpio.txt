components of the international affairs budget function and shows current programmatic allocations for fy2000 this report serves as resource for the annual congressional debate on foreign policy spending providing context and trend analysis of the past 20 years it considers the full scope of the international affairs budget or budget function 150 as foreign policy spending is designated within the context of the budget resolution1 it also illustrates spending trends of the major comp onents that make up budget function 150 data are presented in terms of both current dollars and constant fy2000 dollars the latter which takes into account the effects of inflation over time amounts are expressed as discretionary budget authority and outlays representing the amount of funds congress maintains direct control over through enactment of annual appropriation bills excluded are amounts for mandatory foreign service retirement programs as well as resource flows of the foreign military sales trust fund and other mandatory accounts that are not regulated through the appropriations process data also exclude funding for international monetary fund quota increases and for other imf facilities amounts that congress has approved on five occasions in the pasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30515crs2 2 the united states participates in the expansion of imf resources or the creation of new imf facility at irregular intervals although congress provides new budget authority through appropriations for the full amount of us participation the transaction is considered as an exchange of assets between the united states and the imf and results in outlays from the us treasury in short the appropriations are offset by the creation of us counterpart claim on the imf that is liquid and interest bearing including budget authority figures for the imf creates spikes in selected years and tends to blur continuing trends in funding levels because of this and the fact that imf budget authority does not result in an outlay or have any impact on the federal deficit or surplus amounts are excluded from this reportfigure 1 international affairs discretionary budget authority fy200020 years2 in each illustration actual dollar trend lines are compared with 20year annual averages of spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30515crs3 changes in budget scorekeeping procedures and problems with precise analysis of spending trends following enactment of the budget enforcement act of 1990 the united states began applying in fy1992 different procedures for appropriating funds for credit programs prior to fy1992 congress would appropriate the full value of direct loans issued by the us government for commercial loans guaranteed by the united states congress placed annual limitations on the total amount of these guarantees but was not required to appropriate any funds under the terms of credit reform congress must now appropriate the subsidy value of both direct loans issued and loan guarantees backed by the government in simple terms the subsidy value as determined by omb is an amount that represents the risk to the us government in issuing or backing the loan plus the extent to which if any the loan carries concessional interest rate below market value accordingly there are inherent problems with comparing trends before and after fy1992 for any element of discretionary spending that includes credit programs several credit programs operate within function 150 including direct loans under foreign military financing fmf and prior to fy1999 pl 480 food programs loan guarantees issued by the agency for international developments usaid urban and environm ental credit office and direct loans and loan guarantees managed by the exportimport bank and the overseas private investment corporation two examples illustrate the mixed impact on appropriation requirements of the credit reform policy changes that took effect for fy1992 in fy1997 congress enacted 60 million subsidy appropriation for fmf direct loans an amount that allowed the defense department to issue military aid loans with total face value of 540 million prior to fy1992 congress would have had to appropriate the full 540 million instead of the 60 million subsidy that backed the loans on the other hand in the case of loan guarantee congress approved in fy1997 35 million subsidy appropriation permitting usaids urban and environmental credit program to guarantee 294 million in loans these represent loans issued by commercial lenders for which the united states government guarantees repayment before fy1992 appropriation would have been required as seen in the two examples congress appropriated in fy1997 635 million in support of these programs budget rules that existed in the precredit reform period would have required an appropriation of 540 million to implement these two activities in exactly the same way they were carried out in fy1997 because omb has not adjusted its figures for prefy1992 credit programs comparisons between the two time periods cannot be totally precise nevertheless an assessment of funding trends before and after fy1992 is still useful in identifying an illustrative pattern of spending decisions while the application of postcredit reform procedures on balance probably tends to overstate somewhat the degree of reductions in function 150 spending during the mid1990s the extent of this overstatement does not appear to be sufficient to override the general conclusion that cuts in the international affairs budget were substantial comparison of the increases in fy1999 and fy2000 for function 150 resources with pre1992 levels face the same methodological problems at subfunction level howev er where credit programs exist such as for state department and us international exchange programs the credit reform changes have effect on measuring and comparing discretionary spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30515crs4 figure 2 international affairs budget discretionary budget authorityinternational affairs discretionary budget authority international affairs discretionary budget authority measured in real terms has experienced several cycles over the past two decades there were periods of rapid growth followed immediately by sharp declines during the mid1980s after several years in the late 1980s and early 1990s of relative stable budget levels amounts fell at first gradually and then sharply through fy1997 the foreign policy budget rose slightly in fy1998 but significantly in fy1999 and fy2000 compared to amounts during the mid1990s the increases in fy1998 and fy1999 represented the first backtoback years in which the international affairs budget grew compared with the previous year since fy19901991 the earlytomid 1980s were marked by steady increase in foreign policy spending largely the result of rising amounts of security assistance allocated for strategic purposes in central america pakistan and military base rights countries such as the philippines at the same time that this growth in securityrelated aid peaked in fy1985 congress approved two major supplementals 225 billion economic aid package for israel egypt and jordan and about 1 billion in famine relief for africa all of these factors combined to set foreign affairs discretionary budget authority at 361 billion in fy2000 dollars level about 36 higher than the current amount absent the unique combination of these international demands that spiked aid spending in fy1985 and with intensifying pressure in washington to reduce the federal deficit function 150 discretionary spending like other federal spending fellhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30515crs5 abruptly in fy1986 and declined further in the next two years the following period fy1988 through fy1993 marked relativ ely stable level of foreign affairs budget authority ranging in most years at roughly between 243 and 259 billion annually as calculated in fy2000 dollars to considerable extent this steady period can be attributed to annually negotiated budget agreements between the administra tion and congress for major discretionary spending categories one of which was international affairs small temporary upsurge occurred in fy19901991 primarily the result of supplemental appropriation for aid to panama and nicaragua additi onal costs associated with the persian gulf war including supplemental assistance for israel and turkey and added expenses for us agencies operating in the gulf region althou gh the foreign affairs budget had been on long downward trend since fy1985 the drop in fy1994 was the first significant annual decrease in real terms since fy1988 the 37 real cut for fy1994 was followed by two years of increasingly larger reductions in real spending for foreign policy programs fy1995 discretionary budget authority dropped 55 below fy1994 followed by an 119 cut in fy1996 reductions continued for fy1997 although at more modest 16 level this downward cycle reversed in fy1998 with international affairs budget authority rising by 35 in real terms over fy1997 followed by far more significant rise 211 in foreign policy spending for fy1999 only the 34 increase between fy1984 and fy198 5 has exceeded the annual growth in foreign affairs budget authority that occurred in fy1999 in addition to approving modest increases for programs throughout the function 150 account congress further agreed to nearly 1 billion for us arrearage payments to various international organizations and multilateral development banks about 15 billion for security upgrades at american embassies and missions around the world and large supplementals for central american victims of hurricane mitch 1 billion and for kosovo humanitarian aid relief 11 billion foreign policy funding for fy2000 in real terms falls below fy1999 by 29 even though the budget continues relati vely stable levels for regular international affairs programs fy2000 further includes two special funding initiatives 18 billion onetime aid package in support of the wye rivermiddle east peace accord and about 1 billion for colombian counternarcotics program with the exception of fy1999 the fy2000 foreign affairs budget is larger than any since fy1993 the fy2000 function 150 discretionary budget authority of 233 billion nevertheless is 54 below the annual average

bilateral development aid and contributions to the world bank and other multilateral development institutions may not be spent for several years as result the spikes and rapid reductions that characterize budget authority trends are flattened somewhat in outlay patterns function 150 outlays peaked in fy1986 lagging one year behind the high point of international affairs budget authority fell sharply the next year then continued on generally upward trend through fy1993 as budget authority took substantial downturn in fy1994 outlays followed immediately declining from 233 billion to under 20 billion two years later although foreign affairs budget authority began to climb in fy1998 outlays hit twentyyear low point of 189 billion in real terms reflecting the sharp appropriation cuts of the two previou s years with significant increases in budget authority for fy1999 and fy2000 some of which target fast disbursing emergency requirements function 150 outlays have risen to an

another way of analyzing trends in inter national affairs resources is to draw relationships between foreign policy spending and overall funding for total federal discretionary programs this is relevant especially for the present debate over budgetary prioritysetting decisions since it is within the roughly 622 billion discretionary request for fy2001 that international affairs requirements must compete although the patterns are similar to those for budget authority dollar trends the degree of sharp growt h and decline are muted somewhat when measuring international affairs discretionary ba as of total budget authority one of the most notable trends is the substantial continuity in the amount of the budget authority devoted to internation affairs especially during the eight year period fy1988 to fy1995 although dollar amounts for foreign affairs may have risen somewhat in fy1991 and fallen through the next four years function 150s proportion of total discretionary budget authority deviated only slightly from sustained level of 4 annually in short even though the foreign policy budget fell steadily in the early to mid199 0s it declined at roughly the same pace as the total for all other programs funded through discretionary spending but in fy1996 this 4 share of total discretionary budget authority that had been sustained for eight years ended and function 150s proportion fell to 361 in fy1997 and fy1998 it fell further tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30515crs10 figure 5 international affairs budget as of total federal budget authorityabout 355 of discretionary ba what this meant was that at time when congress and the president had reduced total discretionary budget authority resources for foreign policy programs declined even faster than other federal programs with the approval of higher amounts for function 150 in fy1999 and fy2000 including embassy security central america hurricane relief kosovo humanitarian aid plan colombia and the wye rivermiddle east peace supplementals the foreign policy share of total discretionary budget authority rose once again to 4 the highest level since fy1995 currently function 150s share of total us government discretionary budget authority is about 21 less than the 406 annual average level since fy1980 internati onal affairs as percent of total federal budget authority reflects similar pattern as discretionary ba between fy1980 and fy2000 but as the non discretionary portion of the federal budget has grown conside rably relative to discretionary spending function 150 like other discretionary categories has fallen steadily over the past 15 years international affairs which had fluctuated between 165 and 234 of total federal budget authority through fy1985 has declined in nearly each year since through fy1997 foreign policy spending grew slightly in fy1998 and fy1999 relative to the total budget but fell modestly in fy2000 to 129 except for fy199698 fy2000 is the

assistance function 150 is divided into five broad categories of subfunctions subfunctions 151 and 152 include development aid and security assistance programs respectively and are commonly referred to as the foreign aid budget for development assistance there have been several periods of decline and growth since 1980 the highest point of spending in real terms occurred in fy1980 followed closely by fy1985 when the united states provided large amounts of emergency food relief for faminestricken africa and paid some overdue contributions to multilateral development banks development assistance budget levels rose more gradually in the earlytomid 1990s prompted mainly by the opening of aid programs in eastern europe and the former soviet union development assistance experienced one of the sharpest annual cuts during the past two decades in fy1996 when spending fell in real terms by 22 from the previous year and continued to drop slightly in fy1997 congress reversed this pattern during the next two years when development aid grew annually in real terms by 19 and 22 respectively the fy1999 total of 919 billion an amount that was boosted by large supplementals especially for central american hurricane relief and kosovo humanitarian aid was the largest since fy1985 development aid spending in fy2000 declined somewhat to 779 billion even with the addition of 1 billion supplemental for countern arcotics initiative in colombia overall the size of development aid discretionary budget authority at present is nearly identical to the subfunctions annual average of 783 billion since fy1980httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30515crs13 3 credit reform budget process changes probably have had greater impact in the security aid part of the function 150 budget than anywhere else if it were possible to adjust pre1992 levels to conform to current budget scoring methods the decline in security aid would not be as severe as these figures indicate the cuts however would still be sizable figure 7 international security assistancesecurity assistance accounts have experienced even wider budgetary swings over the past two decades but in general funding levels have fallen significantly since the mid1980s following implementation of the camp david accords in 1979 security aid resources grew steadily during the early tomid 1980s when the united states significantly increased assistance to central america pakistan and military base access countries including the philippines spain and portugal the winding down of cold warrelated conflicts has contributed significantly to the reduction in security assistance budgets by fy1994 security aid had largely been reduced to concentration on israel egypt and other middle east programs plus relatively smaller sums for new and prospective members of nato unlike development aid which dropped significantly in fy199697 funding for security assistance increased in each of those years and continued to rise through fy2000 the 26 increase in security aid for fy2000 was largely due to congressional approval of 18 billion package in support of the wye rivermiddle east peace accord providing supplemental assistance to israel jordan and the palestinians the fy2000 level of 76 billion is the largest amount in real terms for security assistance since fy1992 but remains 21 less in real terms than the average annual amount of 96 billion over the past two decades3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30515crs14 figure 8 foreign aid subfunctions 151 152 the combined foreign aid budget authority trends subfunctions 151 and 152 are

the end of the cold war and persian gulf conflict sharp drop in fy1996 followed by an increase in fy1998 that has continued through fy2000 the current estimate for fy2000 of 1539 billion is higher

category that is largely made up of state department operational costs and assessed contributions to the other international organizations and peacekeeping the general trend has been steady growth between fy1980 and fy1994 with sharper increases occurring in the mid 1980s when the us implemented diplomatic security initiative and the early 1990s when peacekeeping payments grew budget authority fell from 5 billion in fy1994 to 43 billion in fy1995 to about 4 billion the next two years and to 39 billion in fy1998 following the august 1998 bombings at us embassies in kenya and tanzania the administration proposed and congress approved 15 billion new embassy security initiative for fy1999 this combined with 475 million appropriation to clear portion of us arrears at the united nations4 pushed subfunction 153 resources for fy1999 to 59 billion the highest amount in either nomina l or real terms over the past two decades absent the special fy1999 supplemental the level for fy2000 is down to 49 billion after adjusting for the transfer of public diplomacy resources to subfunction 154 unlike other areas of function 150 funding for the conduct of foreign affairs in fy2000 is 28 higher in real terms than the average annual level of 384 billion over the past 21 years over the longterm addons for enhancing diplomatic security establishing new embassies and consulates in the former soviet union and paying higher peacekeeping bills have all been major reasons for the upward spending trend in subfunction 153 but an additional factor is the comparatively large proportion of state department personnel costs met in this spending element as compared to the foreign aid accounts salaries and other expenses usually have costofliving increases built in so that at minimum they keep pace with inflation foreign aid accounts on the other hand include much smaller proportion of personnel costs relative to total spending foreign information and exchanges category that includes usia operations its exchange programs international broadcasting and the national endowment for democracy received an estimated 115 billion for fy2000 including public diplomacy funds level 135 less
