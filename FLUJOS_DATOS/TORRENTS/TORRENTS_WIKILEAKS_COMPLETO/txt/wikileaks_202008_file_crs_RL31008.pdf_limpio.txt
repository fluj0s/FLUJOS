administration tsa the enacted conference agreement mandates significant safety and inspection requirements be met by mexicodomiciled trucks before dot begins processing mexican applications for operating authority in the us beyond the commercial zones along the border it does however include number of modifications in response to administration concerns that the original senate bill as well as the house bill violated provisions of the north american free trade association agreement nafta the conference agreement created controversy when the conferees redirected and earmarked 9976 million of revenue aligned budget authority raba funds the raba mechanism adjusts dot program authorization and obligation levels to reflect recent fuel tax revenues by increasing or decreasing both the authorization and the obligation limitation for fy2002 this added 45 billion to dot programs this redirection of raba funds reduces the raba portion of the states formula funding by 107 from what they otherwise would have received authorizers see this action as usurpation of their authority and some vowed to oppose this sort of action in the future congress responded to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 by passing the 2001 emergency supplemental appropriations act for recovery from and response to terrorist attacks on the united states pl10738 that act provides 40 billion

more than in the house bill and 391 million less than the senate bill at 32895 billion the federal highway administration fhwa receives slightly less than in fy 2001 the federal railroad admini

billion the federal transit administration fta budget increases 8 to 6747 billion and the coast guard budget receives an increase of 12 to 5031 billion the september 11 2001 simultaneous hijack ing of four airliners from three different airports and the enormous loss of life that resulted from the terrorists suicidebomber tactics had quick impact on transportation appropriations congress responded to the terrorist attacks by passing the 2001 emergency supplemental appropriations act for recover from and response to terrorist attacks on the united states pl 10738 the bill provides 40 billion to pay the costs of variety of responses including providing increased transportation security the funds may be transferred to any authorized federal activity to meet the purposes of the act as of this writing roughly 19 billion has been approved for transfer to the department of transportation dot the length of availability of these funds varies depending on the purpose of the spending the transportation appropriations framework transportation is function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget it is also considered part of the discretionary budget funding for the dot budget is derived from number of sources the majority of funding comes from dedicated transportation trust funds the remainder of dot funding is from federal treasury general funds the transportation trust funds include the highway trust fund the transit account of the highway trust fund the airport and airway trust fund and the inland waterways trust fund all of these accounts derive their respective funding from specific excise and other taxes in fy2002 trust funds accounted for well over twothirds of total federal transportation spending together highway and transit funding constitute the largest component of dot appropriations most highway and the majority of transithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31008crs2 programs are funded with contract authority derived by the link to the highway trust fund this is very significant from budgeting standpoint contract authority is tantamount to but does not actually involve entering into contract to pay for project at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc authorized funds are automatically made available at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriations legislation although appropriations are required to make outlays at some future date to cover these obligations where most federal programs require new budget authority as part of the annual appropriations process transportation appropriators are faced with the opposite situation that is the authority to spend for the largest programs under their control already exists and the mechanism to obligate funds for these programs also is in place prior to the fy1999 dot appropriations act changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component had been achieved in the appropriations process by combining changes in budgetcontract authority and by placing limitations on obligations the principal function of the limitation on obligations is to control outlays in manner that corresponds to congressional budget agreements changes in transportation appropriations as result of tea21 beginning in 1999 tea21 changed the transportation budgetary process in two ways first it created new budget categories and second it set statutory limitations on obligations tea21 amends the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 to create two new budget categories highway and mass transit tea21 further amends the budget process by creating statutory level for the limitation on obligations in each fiscal year from fy1999 to fy2003 the net effect of the creation of these new budget categories is predetermined minimum level of funding for core highway and transit programs referred to in tea21 as discretionary spending guarantee the highway and mass transit categories are separated from the rest of the discretionary budget in way that prevents the funds assigned to these categories from being used for any other purpose these so called firewalls are viewed in the tea21 context as guaranteed andor minimum levels of funding additional funds above the firewall level can be made available for highway and transit programs through the annual appropriations process in addition tea21 provides mechanism to adjust the amounts in the highway account but not the transit account to correspond with increased or decreased receipts in highwaygenerated revenues this revenue aligned budget authority raba redistributes to the various states for obligational tea21 highway programs also known as core programs the trust fund revenues that are in excess of projected receipts these additional revenues are allocated to the states using the formulas spelled out in the law however the fy2000 fy2001 and fy2002 administration requests proposed redirection of raba funds from highway programs to other dot initiatives in the end the fy2000 and fy2001 dot appropriations acts did nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31008crs3 adopt the proposed redirection of raba funds in fy2002 however the administration request is honored in part more importantly the fy2002 act makes major redistributions of raba funding outside of the core programs these distribution s will be discussed in the federal highway administration fhwa section of this report tea21 changes the role of the house and senate appropriations and budget committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs the appropriations committees are precluded from their former role of setting an annual level of obligations in addition it appears that the tea21 precludes at least in part the house and senate appropriations committees from exercising what some members view as their traditional option of changing spending levels for specific programs or projects in the fy2000 appropriations act the appropriators took some tentative steps to regain some of their discretion over highway spending the fy2000 act called for the redistribution of some funds among programs and added two significant spending projects in the fy2001 appropriations act the appropriators continued in this vein by adding funds for large numbers of earmarked projects further the fy2001 act called for redirection of limited amount of funding between programs and includes significant additional funding for some tea21 programs this trend continues and even accelerates in the fy2002 act as appropriators have made major redistributions of raba funds and in some instances have transferred raba funds to agencies that would not be eligible for raba funding from tea21 as suggested earlier the tea21 firewalls appear to diminish the flexibility of the committees on appropriations to meet the goals of the annual budget process because the committees can only adjust the dot agency or program budgets outside the firewalls hence any reduction in spending for function 400 must be allocated to agencies or programs other than highways or transit and as will be discussed in the next section most aviation programs changes in transportation appropriations as result of the wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century fair21 or air21 fair21 pl 106181 signed april 5 2000 provides socalled guarantee for faa program spending the guarantee for aviation spending however is significantly different from that provided by tea21 to highway and transit programs instead of creating new budget categories the fair21 guarantee rests on adoption of two pointoforder rules for the house and the senate the first pointoforder rule prevents congress from considering any appropriations legislation for aviation purposes that does not spend all of the total budget resources as defined by fair21 total budget resources are essentially the revenues and interest accruing to the aviation trust fund the second pointoforder prevents any spending for federal aviation administration faa operations and maintenance om or for research engineering and development red unless the airport improvement program aip and the facilities and equipment fe portions of the faa account are funded at their fully authorized levelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31008crs4 almost all observers view the fair21 guarantees as being somewhat weaker than those provided by tea21 for highway and transit programs because congress can and sometimes does waive pointsoforder during consideration of legislation in addition there is sense that appropriators might still have some latitude to make significant changes to faa om funding which is dependent on both trustfund and generalfund contributions for fy2001 and fy2002 however pointoforder waivers were considered supporters of fair21 believe the act requires significant new spending on aviation programs and for at least the fy2001 appropriations cycle this has been the case enactment of fair21 means that transportation appropriators have total control over spending for only the coast guard the federal railroad administration fra which includes amtrak and number of smaller dot agencies all of these agencies were concerned about their funding prospects however the fy2001 act provided budget increases for all major dot agencies except for the fra budget supporters of the coast guard are especially concerned about this new transportation appropriations environment the coast guard is not funded by trust fund and cannot claim userfee base to support an argument for its own budget firewalls the coast guard has unique status within the transportation budget category because of its wartime role in national defense it is not unusual for the coast guard to receive some funds from military appropriations during the annual appropriations process it is possible that the coast guard will seek additional funding from the military side of the budget in the years ahead if additional funds from transportation appropriations do not become available in fy2001 however the existence of significant budget surplus abated these concerns for fy2002 national security concerns have overridden the budgetary issues and the agency will receive significant increase in funding table 1 status of department of transportation appropriations for fy2002

began in earnest in proposing department of transportation dot budget of roughly 59 billion the administration washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31008crs5 1this report relies on figures from tables provided by the house committee on appropriations because of differing treatment of offsets rescissions and the structure of dot appropriations bills the totals will at times vary from those provided by the administration the dot appropriations bills do not fund the maritime administration but do fund some smaller entities that are not included in the dot budget ie the architectural and transportation barriers compliance board and the national transportation safety boardproposing roughly 15 increase over last years budget total1 the fy2001 budget however included slightly less than 28 billion of what the administration referred to as one time projects that were added to the budget of the federal highway administrati on fhwa if these are subtracted the administrations fy2002 proposal could be seen as 65 increase the budget request was in conformance with the basic outline of both the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 pl 105178 which authorized spending on highways and transit and the aviation funding authorized in the wendell ford aviation investment and reform act of the 21st century fair21 or air21 pl 106181 although there was consensus on funding the larger programs at or above their guaranteed levels there were still number of other issues that arose during the debate the conference agreement hrept 107308 pl 10787 three months after the house and senate had passed their versions of hr 2299 congress agreed to the conference report on the bill that resolved differences between the two bills not only on money and program matters but also on the presidents objections to provisions in the house and senate bills concerning the implementation of the north american free trade agreement nafta provisions on access of mexican commercial trucks to the us market president bush signed pl 10787 on december 18 2001 pl 10787 provides 596 billion for dot roughly 600 million more than the president requested and 15 billion more than enacted for fy2001 most dot agencies however are funded at or near the administrations request compared to fy2001 the fy2002 dot appropriations act hereafter referred to as the fy2002 act provides significant increases for most dot agencies the federal aviation administration faa budget increases roughly 6 to 13295 billion the federal transit administratio n fta budget increases 8 to 6747 billion and the coast guard receives an increase of 12 to 5031 billion two agencies get slightly less than in fy2001 at 32895 billion the federal highway administration fhwa receives slightly less than in fy 2001 the federal railroad administration fra is funded at 734 million 21 million less than enacted in fy2001 the fy2002 act also provides 125 billion to be offset by newly authorized user and airline fees for the transportation security administration recently created by the aviation and transportation security act pl 10771 transit issues the administrations budget request had proposed to convert the federal transit administrations fta bus and bus facilities program and job access and reverse commute program from discretionary to formula programs both these programs have been subject to earmarking in the past formula programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31008crs6 are generally not available for earmarking both the house and senate rejected these program changes the administration also proposed to reduce the maximum federal share under the ftas new starts program from 80 to 50 beginning in fy2004 there are always many more transit project proposals than funds to support them supporters of this change see it as way to fund more new starts projects and also argue that 50 local share would assure that only projects supported by strong local commitment would get funded on the other hand some argue that the reduced federal share could skew the awards process to favor projects in wealthier urban areas and make the provision of funding less needs based the fy2002 act directs fta not to sign any new fullfunding grant agreements after september 30 2002 that have maximum federal share higher than 60 raba distribution and congressional earmarking when the fy2002 dot budget debate began there were number of reasons to expect that the treatment of raba would be at issue first the bush administrations budget request proposed two raba setasides one would have provided 56 million to support construction of state and federal motor carrier inspection facilities along the usmexico border second setaside of 145 million would have supported two pilot programs that make up the administrations proposed new freedom initiative of this amount 45 million would have been used to promote innovative transportation solutions for the disabled the remaining 100 million would have been used to fund competitive matching grants to promote access to alternative transportation second the clinton administration had previously proposed raba setasides in its fy2000 and fy2001 budgets congress however did not adopt the requested redirection of raba funds during those years third the fy2000 and fy2001 dot appropriations acts did make modest change in the raba distribution both years acts redirected the raba funds from allocated commonly referred to as discretionary programs which are under the aegis of the fhwa to the core highway programs that are distributed to the states by formula some observers thought this might happen again in fy2002 finally the large size of the fy2002 raba 4543 billion increased the attractiveness for using these funds for congressional initiatives or for earmarking the fy2002 act sets aside 563 million of raba funds for usmexico border infrastructure but raba funds are set aside for the presidents new freedom initiative more controversial is fy2002 acts redirection of 423 million of the raba revenues that under tea21 are added to the formula funds distributed to the states instead the 423 million is added to the 574 million of fy2002 raba that under tea21 is distributed to the allocated ie discretionary programs this made total of 997 million in raba funding available for distribution to the fhwas allocated programs the conference report language however specifies the programs that are to be funded and provides the dollar amounts for each only programs provided with raba set asides in the conference report receive any of the money ie allocated programs that are not given set asides get raba funding most notable of the programs that lose their raba funds under fy2002 act is the high priority projecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31008crs7 2the conference report also provides for the setaside and transfer of 239 million to the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa per pl 106159program among the programs benefitting from these additional funds are indian reservation roads 356 million public lands highways 318 million and 451 million park roads and parkways 213 million ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities 256 million the corridors and borders program 3523 million the transportation and community and system preservation pilot program 2511million the interstate maintenance discretionary program 76 million the bridge discretionary program 625 million and for border infrastructure improvements 563 million most of the money from these raba setasides is earmarked in conference report hrept 1073082 some members of congress have expressed dissatisfaction with the degree to which these set asides are in nonconformance with tea21 section 330 of the conference report also provides an appropriation of 144 million for surface transportation grants the funds are earmarked in hrept 107 308 the extent of earmarking especially of raba funds continues to be controversial nafta implementation and the mexican trucking issue the most contentious debate during both house and senate consideration of the dot appropriation involved the implementation of the north american free trade agreement nafta provisions regarding the operation of mexican trucks throughout the us nafta provisions prescribe phasedin implementation which was to be complete d by january 1 2000 citing safety concerns the clinton administration refused to allow mexican trucks beyond the border commercial zones mexico filed complaint against the us under nafta dispute resolution recently the arbitration panel held against the us the bush administration announced its intention to implement the trucking access provisions of nafta by the end of 2001 provision added by amendment in the house to hr 2299 prohibited the use of funds to process applications by mexicobased trucking firms for authority to operate beyond us border municipalities and commercial zones taking different approach the senate bill included series of safety requirements and preconditions to be met before any funds appropriated can be used to review or process an application by mexican motor carrier to operate trucks beyond the border commercial zone among the requirements and preconditions required in the senate bill were full onsite safety compliance review of mexican motor carrier companies equipping all usmexico border stations with weighinmotion systems proof of valid insurance with usbased insurance company and requiring that mexican commercial motor vehicles may not cross at border crossing unless an inspector is on duty after long and contentious debate the senate passed hr 2299 as amended with virtually all of the mexican trucking provisions intact the fy2002 act incorporates senate provisions some of which have been modified regarding processes and measures to promote the safety of crossborde r trucking between the united states and mexico the modifications were sufficient to overcome bush administration concerns that the senatepassed version of the bill might violate nafta the agreement provides for 25866 million for salarieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31008crs8 expenses and capital costs to implement these provisions these funds are in addition to funds provided in the appropriation for the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and the motor carrier safety assistance program mcsap that also are intended to enhance the ability of us dot and the states to promote the safety of mexican trucks and buses entering the united states see crs report rl31028 north american free trade agreement truck safety considerations by paul rothberg antiterrorism emergency supplemental appropriations the september 11 2001 simultaneous hijacking of four airliners from three different airports and the enormous loss of life that resulted from the terrorists suicidebomber tactics quickly had an impact on transportation appropriations congress responded to the terrorist attacks by passing the 2001 emergency supplemental appropriations act for recovery from and response to terrorist attacks on the united states pl 10738 hereafter referred to as the emergency supplemental appropriations act the bill provides 40 billion to pay the costs of variety of responses including providing increased transportation security this 40 billion was divided into three categories of availability 10 billion was available immediately for allocation 10 billion was to be made available 15 days after congressional notification and the final 20 billion which requires separate legislation to appropriate the funds the funds may be transferred to any authorized federal activity to meet the purposes of the act as of november 30 2001 640 million of the immediate and 15day funds have been allocated for transportation security purposes of the final 20 billion authorized the president requested 734 million be made available for transportation security through appropriating legislation the fy2002 department of defense dod appropriations bill hr 3338 pl 107117 was the vehicle for allocating funds from the final 20 billion the fy2002 dod appropriations act allocated 1296 billion for transportation projects and activities mostly for security purposes all together pl 10738 provided 1936 billion

to special fund in the us treasury while general funds appropriated for the programs would have been reduced by similar amounts industry in the past has objected to such proposal maintaining that it already pays its share of taxes and that it invests heavily in safety both the house and senate bills denied the administrations request to collect user fees to help fund fra safety and rd activities

authorize continued funding for fras regulatory and safety compliance activities or change any of the existing authorities used by fra to promote railroad safety reauthorization statute changing the scope and nature of fras safety activities would most likely affect budgets after fy2002 the adequacy and effectiveness of fras gradecrossing safety activities continue to be of particular interest relevant safety issues include how effectively is fra helping the states deal with the gradecrossing safety challenge is fras fy2002 budget adequate to deal with that challenge congressional reaction

reduced amtraks funding to just over 520 million the presidents budget however would allow amtrak to use their entire appropriation immediately rather than being given 40 in the first year and 60 in the second year as in previous years appropriations this would give amtrak total of 833 million for fy2002 5215 million appropriated for fy2002 plus 312 million carried over from fy2001 the fy2002 act provides 5215 million it is silent on the accelerated funding arrangement though both the house and senate bills approved it after september 11 amtrak increased security at its main passenger terminals and along its tracks demand for amtraks services skyrocketed during the time that commercial air travel was suspended even after air travel was restored many travelers preferred not to fly increasing demand for amtraks services at the same time however after september 11 many people preferred not to travel at all with the result that eventually amtraks overall passenger load was down slightly the increased spending on security and decreased passenger demand exacerbated amtraks revenue shortfall the amtrak reform and accountability act of 1997 pl 105134 prohibits the appropriation of federal operating grant funds for amtrak after fy2002 section 201 however the congress has appropriated only capital grant funds to amtrak for several years now with the understanding that those funds may also be used for operating expenses the act also requires that if the amtrak reform council determines that amtrak will not be able to operate without federal operating grant funds after fy2002 it shall notify the president and amtraks authorizing committees the council will then have 90 days to submit to the congress an action plan for restructured national intercity passenger system pl 105134 section 204 at the same time amtrak will have 90 days to submit liquidation plan to the congress the amtrak reform council on november 9 2001 formally declared that amtrak would need

increasing employee productivity and any time after december 2 1999 amtraks ability to operate without federal operating assistance after september 30 2002 if as the council concluded amtrak requires federal operating grant funds after fy2002 then federal law requires the council to submit an amtrak reorganization plan to the congress and requires amtrak to submit to congress an amtrak liquidation plan the council made this finding on november 7 2002 these plans are due to the congress by february 7 2002 the council submitted its second annual report to congress in march 2001 in it the council recommended that the congress should provide stable and adequate funding for the capital needs of passenger rail operations and that amtraks multiple roles as quasigovernment agency maintainer of rail infrastructure and provider of commercial passenger service be separated the council suggested several possible structures for this new arrangement of responsibilities federal highway administration fhwa httpwwwfhwadotgov the fy2002 act approves 32895 billion in total funding for fhwa this represents an increase of 122 billion over the fy2001 enacted level the obligation limitation which supports most of the federalaid highway program is set at 31799 and is significantly more than the 29661 billion provided in fy2001 funding forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31008crs17 figure 3 federal highway administrationexempt programs emergency relief and portion of minimum guarantee funding is set at 995 million down slightly from fy2001s 1069 billion there are some distortions in the comparisons between fy2002 and fy2001 because of 2759 billion in earmarked projects and additional emergency relief funding from sources outside the highway trust fund added in fy2001 setting that aside the fy2002 act still represents significant increase over core program spending in the fy2001 act the most controversial element of the fy2002 act is the redirection and earmarking of just under 1 billion in raba funds from the way they would have been distributed by tea21 to accomplish this redistribution the act removes nearly half billion dollars from core program redistribution to the states additional monies are derived by zero funding number of programs that would have been eligible for raba funding from tea21 the act directs that these funds be distributed to specific discretionary programs under the control of the appropriations process for example the corridor and border corbor program gets over 352 million in raba funding in addition to its 140 million annual authorization these funds are then earmarked to 124 specific projects the provision of raba funds to programs outside fhwa to the motor carrier safety administration is also somewhat controversial as result of these actions the states lose significant amounts of core program funding that they expected as part of the raba distribution process in addition the act eliminates raba funding for programs such as the high priority projects that arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31008crs18 operated by the states outside the core program the redistribution of these funds has raised concerns among the states and amongst several leaders of house and senate transportation authorizing committees that the act disregards the guidance of tea21 these same members have indicated that they might attempt to undo some of the acts earmarking but specific mechanism has yet been identified to accomplish this the act as mentioned in the raba discussion above continues trend of earmarking an ever larger share of fhwas noncore formula programs some discretionary activities ie the transportation and communi ty and system preservation pilot program are now completely earmarked the growth in earmarking is controversial opponents of earmarking contend that this process negates the intent of authorizing legislation in this case tea21 that seeks to make some of these funds available on competitive basis appropriators however believe that they should have role in determining when and where funds are spent further they believe they are simply responding to the desires of members of congress who have filed large numbers of earmarking requests with the committee the administrations fy2002 proposal requested that portion of the 4543 billion in raba funds be set aside for designated new projects 145 million for new freedom initiative intended to increase mobility for americans with disabilities and 56 million for federal motor carrier inspection facility construction at the us mexico border the fy2002 act provides funding for border inspection facilities at level in excess of the administration request but provides funding for the new freedom initiative the tea21 funding framework tea21 created the largest surface transportation program in us history for the most part however it did not create new programs rather it continued most of the highway and transit programs that originat ed in its immediate predecessor legislation the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 istea pl 102240 programmatically tea21 can be viewed as refinement and update of the istea process there are few new funding initiatives in tea21 such as border infrastructure program but the vast majority of funding is reserved for continuing programs there are several groupings of highway programs within the highway firewall most of the funding is reserved for the major federal aid highway programs which can be thought of as the core programs these programs are national highway system nhs interstate maintenance im surface transportation program stp bridge replacement and rehabilitation brr and congestion mitigation and air quality improvement cmaq all of these programs are subject to apportionment on an annual basis by formula and are not subject to programbyprogram appropriation there is second category of highway funding within the firewalls this so called exempt category consists of two elements an additional annual authorization of minimum guarantee funding 639 million per fiscal year and emergency relief 100 million per fiscal year these funds are not subject to the annual limitation on obligationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31008crs19 further set of programs which are also within the firewall are known as the allocated programs these programs are under the direct control of fhwa or other governmental entities these programs include the federal lands highway program high priority projects former demonstration project category appalachian development highway system roads formerly ineligible for trust fund contract authority the national corridor planning and border infrastruct ure program and several other small programs as discussed earlier tea21 provides link between the highwaygenerated revenues that flow into the highway account and highway spending the act requires that the secretary of transportation make an annual evaluation of revenues into the highway account during the previous fiscal year visavis spending authorized within the highway firewall for the new fiscal year if revenues go up program spending is increased conversely spending can go down if revenues go down tea21 specifies formula to determine the direction and amount of highway funding adjustment known as raba this revenue aligned budget authority was employed beginning in fy2000 fhwa research development and technology rdt programs the administration proposed increased funding for various rdt activities from 4372 million in fy2001 to 5287 million in fy 2002 the fy2002 act provides for an obligation limitation of 4475 million consistent with the contract authority specified in tea21 rdt funds are used primarily to advance and deploy technologies

transportation rd and intelligent transportation systems its programs the its deployment program provides funds for states and local governments to use advanced communication and information systems to improve the management and safety of their surface transportation systems an issue associated with the its deployment program is the earmarking of funds during the last few years the appropriators have designated substantial portion of the incentive funds intended to accelerate its deployment this practice was continued in the fy2002 act some members and proponents of its would prefer to have the deployment funds competitively awarded tea21 however also specifies several projects which are to receive some of the its deployment funds during debate in the senate provision was inserted in the

two major transit programs the capital investment grants and loans program and the urbanized area formula grants program there are also several smaller formula and planning and research programs capital investment grants and loans program section 5309 this program formerly known as section 3 has three components new transit starts fixed guide way modernization and bus and bus facilities for fy2002 the administration proposed funding this program at 2841 billion up from 2695 billion8 in fy2001 the fy2002 act provides 2891 billion9 5 increase over fy2001 these funds are allocated among these three components on 404020 basis respectively funds for the fixed guide way component are distributed by formula while funds for the other components are distributed on discretionary basis by fta or earmarked by congress for fy2002 and fy2003 the administration proposed to shift the bus and bus facilities component 568 million in fy2002 plus 50 million transferred from the clean fuels formula program to formula based on population and population density factors the conference report is silent on this proposal in fy2002 as in fy2001 virtually all the money in this component was earmarked by congress in fact the 568 million allocated to the bus and bus facilities program was increased by 50 million transferred from the clean fuels formula program as in fy2001 in addition 17 million in unobligated bus facilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31008crs21 figure 4 federal transit administration appropriationsfunds from previous appropriations acts is included for total of 6197 million in fy2002 funding the bush administration also proposed that beginning in fy2004 the federal matching share for new starts under the capital investm ent grants and loans program section 5309 be reduced to maximum of 50 from the current maximum of 80 the rationale for this change was that there are more applicants for new starts funding than there are funds available so reducing the federal share would spread the available funding to more projects critics countered that raising the local share requirement would increase the difficulties for those cities and states which have fewer fiscal resources to draw on for their local share and which thus need more help the fy2002 act provides that after fy2002 fta is not to sign any new full funding grant agreements that have maximum federal share greater than 60 urbanized area formula program section 5307 the program formerly known as section 9 provides for capital and in some cases operating needs for urbanized areas

with the enactment of tea21 operating assistance funding was eliminated for urbanized areas with populations over 200000 however preventive maintenance generally considered an operating expense is now eligible for funding as capital expense urbanized areas under 200000 population and nonurbanized areas section 5311 can use formula funds for either capital or operating purposes other transit

the eas program is operated through the office of the secretary of transportation ost and receives its funding from designated user fees collected from overflights of united states territory by foreign aircraft eas has an annual authorized funding level of 50 million for fy2002 the bush administration predicts that overflight user fees will generate only 40 million it therefore asked that 10 million in aip funding be provided from the airport and airway trust fund to make the program whole the eas program received 52 million in fy2001 more controvers ial proposal in the administration budget would have significantly affected participation in the eas program at present 78 communities outside of alaska receive eas subsidized service the administration proposed that 18 communities lose their subsidy payments in order to compensate for higher costs involved with providing service at the remaining eas communities the proposal would have accompli shed this adjustment by changing some of the distance restrictions driving distance to alternate airports in the existing program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31008crs25 the house agreed with the administration that funding for the

somewhat related small community air service development pilot program scasd this program created by fair21 to increase service to small and rural communities was not funded in fy2001 the 10 million
