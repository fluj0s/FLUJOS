aging of the population and the lengthening of life spans makes it increasingly likely that individuals also will have to grapple with the demands of their jobs and the obligations of caring for

public and privat sector employees worked at covered employers and met the acts eligibility criteria during the 18month survey period that spanned 1999 and 2000 although the shar of eligible employees at covered worksites who took fmla leave increased significantly over time fmla leave takers accounted for only 19 of all employees estimates of the number of employees who took leave under the act in 19992000 ranged from 22 million to 61 million onefifth of fmla leaves were ta ken on an intermittent basis employees most often took fmla leave to care for th eir own health conditions twothirds of persons who took leave for fmlareasons received some pay employees most often said lack of funds was the cause of their not taking leave for fmla reasons almost 64 of employers rated the act as verysomewhat easy to administer in 19992000 which was greatly below the 85 r ecorded 5 years earlier many more employers reported in 2000 than in 1995 that the law had negative impact on individual productivity and absences th human resources professionals who responded to 2000 survey of the so ciety for human resource management indicated that productivity loss was the most costly consequence of the fmla in addition 63 of respondents said that becau of the fmla their firms had had to retain some employees who otherwise would have been terminated for poor

work outside the home the majority of american women have always been mothers and now majority of mothers are also employees1 while employed single parents alwa ys have felt the pr essure of trying to fulfill both workplace and childrearing responsibilities the workfamily juggling act increasingly has spread to married c ouples with dependent children ie under age 18 both spouses have been breadwinne rs in the majority of these families since 19782 in 2000 for example the husband and wife were in the labor force in 67 of marriedcouple families with dependent children the share of married mothers caring for their own infants ie less than 1 year old and bringing home paychecks has grown greatly as well the labor force participation of mothers with infants was 53 and 648 of them were employed fu lltime ie 35 or more hours per week more broadly 60 of all wo men were in the labor force 75 of all working women held fulltime jobs and 47 of all labor force participants were women because of the aging of the babyboom generation and the lengthening of life spans it also is increasingly likely that individuals will have to grapple with the competing demands of their jobs and of caring for parents or elderly relatives in the mid1990s the typical informal or family careg iver of an older friend or relative was an employed married middleaged woman who sometimes had dependent child at home3 according to one estimate about onefifth of working parents are members of the sandwich generation i providers of both elder care and child care4 with women more likely than men to be unpaid caregivers and with mothers more likely than not to be in the labor force working women in general and working mothers in particular are widely viewed as the chief beneficiaries of the family

request leave for fmlapurposes of their status as key employees and the reasons for which they are being denied job restoration in determining whether restoration of key personnel would cause substantialgrievous injury employers can consider such things as thei r ability to do without the individual or the expense of restoring the employee if permanent replacement had been hired during the

benefits length and form of leave eligible employees at covered employers are entitled to maximum of 12 workweeks of leave for fmla reasons in 12month period 13 to give employees not only the time but also the flexibility to balance the demands of work and family pl 1033 allows employees to ta ke their 12week entitlement on an intermittent basis in other words the leave may be taken in separate blocks of time for the same fmla reason flexibility also was bu ilt into the act by permitting eligible employees to work reduced schedule i fewer hours per week or per day employees are entitled to intermittentreduced schedule leave to care for their own spouses childs or parents rious health condition they must obtain the agreement of their employers to use these work arrangements in connection with the two other fmlaqualifying reasons in those cases where employees can foresee the need to take intermittent or reduced schedule leave they must work with their employers to schedule it to avoid disrupting business operations employers may temporarily transfer employees to job with equivalent compensation that more easily accommodates their altered work hours employers must account for intermittent fmla leave in the shortest increment that their payroll system uses for other types of leave so long as it is 1 hour or less employee and employer notification when employees can foresee the use of fmla leave they should provide 30 days notice to their employers when the need to take leave is unforeseen employees are to provide noti ce as soon as practicable this has been interpreted to mean that employees give employers notice within 12 business days of realizing their need to take leave employees should provide enough information to allow employers to determine whether the leav is for fmla reason although employees do not have to refer to the act when notifyi ng employers in those cases in which employers were not made aware that an employee was away from work for reason covered under the statute and in which em ployees want the leave to be counted toward their 12week entitlement employees are to give timely notice of their intent ie within 12 business da ys of returning to work covered employers must provide informa tion to their employees about the law the information is to be conveyed in posting approved by the dol and in employee handbooks or ot her written materialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30893crs6 in addition employers must provide written notice within 12 business days of having received an employees notice of need for leave stating that the leave will count against the employees fmla entitlement detailing whether the employee must furnish medical certification nd among other things explaining the employees right to substitute accrued pa

v wolverine worldwide inc that even if an employer does not timely designate leave as falling under the act th appropriate remedy is not the automatic provision of an additional 12 weeks of fmla leave the divided court held that the employee has to prove heshe was harmed as result of the employers failure in this instance the employee had taken the maximum amount of leave allowed by the company 30 weeks which is more than twice the mandated minimum in the fmla the supreme courts decision overrides the dols regulation at 29 cfr 825700a which states that if employees take paid or unpaid leave but their employers do not designate it as fmla leav the leave taken does not count against the 12week fmla entitlement the court not ed that the duration of leave under the statute was carefully balanced

lawmakers expressed at the time of the acts passage maintenance and accrual of benefits the only fringe benefit that employers are required to continue providing to employees on fmla leave is group health insu rance if employees have chosen cash payments in lieu of group health benef its employers need not maintain those payments the obligation to continue the absent employees health coverage ceases ifwhen employees tell employers that they do not intend to return to work when the leave period ends or if they do not return to work at that time for those employers who require employee contributions toward health insurance the employers obligation also stops if employees are more than 30 days late in paying their share of the premium and if employers have given them 15 days advance written notice informing them of the impendi ng cessation of coverage other kinds of benefits eg paid leave and seniority do not accrue while employees are on unpaid fmla leave if these benefits do not accumulate for individuals while they are on other types of unpaid leave although fmla leave is not considered break in service under an employers retirement plan the leave time does not count

otherwise indicated it should be noted that various busine ss groups raised objections and suggested changes to the survey they believed it wa s meant in part to elicit support for the clinton administrations desire to broaden the act eg by minimizing the negative consequences of the law for employers and for the coworkers of fmla leave takers employer coverage and employee eligibility according to the employer survey the fmla applied to 108 of private sector establishments in 1999200015 yet at the same time 583 of employees who worked at private sector employers were covered by the act these disparate proportions reflect the fact th at most worksites in the pr ivate sector are relatively small and therefore exempt from pl 1033 but most people are employed by relatively large firms according to the employee survey whic h covered both public and private sector workers 889 million persons worked at covered establishments and met the fmlas eligibility criteria in 19992000 covered ligible workers accounted for 617 of all employed persons in the united states an additional 215 million individuals or 149 of all employees worked at covere d employers but did not fulfill the acts lengthofservice and hourso fwork eligibility requirement s thus almost one in five employees at covered worksites were ineligible to utilize the fmla during the latest survey period another 336 million people or 233 of all employees did not work at covered establishmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30893crs9 16 leavetakers in the employee survey who said that they had heard of the act were asked whether their longest leave was taken under the fmla much of the information presented from the two rounds of employee surveys concerns the longest leave taken if more than one leave was taken because res pondents were not asked about multiple leaves in the initial survey 17 establishments that stated they were covered by the fmla were asked the number of employees who had taken leave under the actknowledge of the fmla almost 60 of employees regardless of whether they worked at covered or noncovered employers reporte d that they were aware of the fmlas existence in 19992000 about onehalf of employees at all worksites said they did not know if the law applied to them personally howev er employees at covered establishments were significantly more likely than those at noncovered establishment to know their correct status under the statute nonetheless just 379 of employees at covered employers correctly knew that the fmla applied to them far more covered establishments 840 than employees correctly knew that the law applied to them noncovered tablishments showed greater confusion about their status however with 555 repor ting that they did not know whether the act applied to them although employers stated that they most often got their information about the fmla from existing company policies or practices 894 the number that also obtained information from the labor department increased significantly between the 19941995 539 and 19992000 831 survey periods the third most often cited source of fmla information which so posted significant increase over the 5year period from 570 to 779 was attorneys or consultants use of fmla leave use of the fmla increased substantially over time according to the employee surveys 183 of all eligible persons at covered worksites who took leave for fmla reasons in 19992000 did so under the act16 this was significantly above the 116 recorded for 19941995 as shown in table 1 those who exercised their fmla entitlement during the latest survey period also accounted for significantly larger share of all leavetakers and of all employees the rate of leavetaking under pl 103 3 also increased significantly over time according to the employer surveys17 in 19941995 there were 36 fmla leave takers per 100 covered employees in 19992000 the figure was substantially higher 65 fmla leavetakers per 100 covered employees

results of the establishment survey were adjusted to take into account public as well as private worksitesaccording to the employee rvey 2233 milli on employees 18 some of this discrepancy could be because employees we re unaware that employers counted their leave toward their fmla entitlement or because employers c ounted employees who took leave under the fmla multiple times table 1 employees

under the fmla in both survey periods caring for newborn newly adopted or newly placed foster child was the second most common reason returning to work after fmla leave virtually all fmla leavetakers said they resumed working for their sa employer about 980 in both survey periods the establishment survey yiel ded much different results however with 298 of covered worksite s reporting nonreturning fmla leavetakers in 1999 2000 for example while 526 of thos employers with nonreturning fmla leavetakers said only one person did not co back to work those with two or more nonreturning leavetakers increased sign ificantly between the survey rounds from 146 to 474 under certain circumstances the law permits employers that have maintained the health benefits of employees on fm leave to ask nonreturnees to repayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30893crs11 19 employers cannot seek repayment if the employee does not return to work because of continuation of the same health condition that precipitated the fmla leave or because of circumstances beyond the employees control 20 of those leavetakers who thought the leav had positive effect on their own or family members physical health 935

leavetakers who were away from work for fmlareasons in 1999 2000 82 million or 345 received pay and 44 million or 185 received partial pay those leavetakers with or partial pay frequently coped with their loss of wages by limiting extras using savings earmarked for th is or another situation putting off paying bills or cutting leave time shortcontributions and vacation or sick time in addition about twothirds of leave takers said they received some pay during their time off and 429 of paid leave takers had money coming in from multiple sources22 most paid leavetakers 722 received their full paychecks for the w hole leave period but 582 of the leave takers who received or partial pay reported difficulty making ends meet23 and virtually all leavetakers who returned to their same employers went back to the same or an equivalent position 971 among individuals whose coworkers had taken leave for fmla reasons 462 indicated that they assumed additiona l duties 321 worked more than their usual number of hours and 229 worked different shift nevertheless majority 674 said that their coworkers leave for fmla reasons did not have any impact on them this question touches on the idea of workfamily backlash ie young unmarried or childless employ ees who resent or are demoralized by coworkers for taking leave because they are asked to pe rform extra work to compensate for the leavetakers absence it is raised again in the policy issues section of this report when the subject of intermittent leave is taken up employer compliance with pl 1033 employers indicated that they most of ten conveyed information about the act through postings on bulletin boards 924 or through employee handbooks 919 the law requires covered employer s to notify their workforce by these two

notice of how much fmla leave they have taken and how the law relates to preexisting leave and benefit policies most establishments said they complied with 823 providing the fo rmer and 926 providing the latter despite employers presumably having gained greater familiarity with the 1993 law and its 1995 final regulations they ppear to continue to have difficulty complying with it the society for hu man resource manageme nt shrm in its 2000 fmla survey declared that the act stands in contrast with other employment laws which have caused less confusion over the years as the law becomes settled

option among employers who said they relied on more than one method to cope with an employees absencemore understood by both employers and empl oyees in the first full fiscal year following the fmlas implementati on the wage and hour division found violations in 616 of the complaints lodg ed by employees the ratio of violations to total complaints has va ried little over the ensuing years and in fy1999 stood at 612 complaints lodged under the w have most often involved an employers failure to reinstate an employee returning from fmla leave to the same or an equivalent position 46 of the complaints filed on average since the acts implementation another 22 dealt with an employers refusal to grant leave and an additional 16 were related to employer discrimination against employees who took leave under the act see appendix table 1 according to the dols summary of litigation the depar tments solicitor brought suit in 32 cases through fy1999 for unresolved fmla violations24 the court cases most often concerned an em ployer who had terminated an employee while they were on fmla leave other cases dealt with employers who failed to restore returning employees to their sa or an equivale nt position and with employers who denied requests for fmla leave employer administration of the fmla in 19992000 employers most often 983 handl ed the work of fmla leave takers by temporarily assigning it to other employees 25 hiring an outside temporary replacement came in distant second at 413 the use of this option as well as hiring permanent replacement fell si gnificantly since 19941995 possibly due to the tightening of the labor market between survey periods in terms of the ease or difficulty of ad ministering the act employer responses varied widely at one end of the spect rum 860 of employers said they found it verysomewhat easy to determine whether the law applied to their organization and 834 found it verysomewhat easy to dete rmine whether certain employees were eligible at the other end of the spect rum 544 of employers replied that they found it verysomewhat difficult to administe r the fmlas notification designation and certification requireme nts and 528 found it verysomewhat difficult to coordinate the fmla with other fe deral laws on an overall basis majority of employers 636 rated the act as verys omewhat easy to administer but the proportion dropped significantly from its 1995 level 851 this finding could be related to the need for more employers to become familiar with the law and its regulations because as previously discussed the rate of fmla leavetaking increased significantly over the 5year periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30893crs14 impact of the benefit mandate on covered employers several provisions were included in pl 1033 to minimize its impact on employers employers indicated they found the requirement that employees give advance notice of foreseeable leave to be the most useful of these provisions followed by the requirement that employees provide written medical certification for serious health conditions the least usef ul provision intended to help employers manage fmla leave was allowing them to deny job restoration to key employees large majority of employers said t hat the fmla had noticeable effect on their establishments performance ie 765 said it had effect on productivity 876 on profitability and 877 on growth in the relatively few instances that employers thought the act had any impact th ey were much more likely to believe it hurt rather than helped their bottom line two to three times as many employers reported negative as opposed to positive ffect on the three measures of business performance similarly most employers reported that pl 1033 did not have perceptible impact on the individual pe rformance of employees ie 670 said it had effect on productivity 763 on absences 859 on turnover 956 on career advancement and 647 on morale however significantly more employers reported in 2000 than in 1995 that the st atute had negative impact on individual productivity and absences according to the shrms 2000 fmla survey the human resources hr professionals who responded indicated that productivity loss was the most costly consequence of the fmla in addition 63 of respondents said that because of the act their firms had had to keep some employees who otherwise would have been termin ated for poor attendance the opportunity to take fmla leave in termittently has c oncerned employers because it could be more disruptive to bus iness operations and be more burdensome from recordkeeping standpoint than if the leave entitlement were exercised just once in 12month period according to the dolcommissioned establishment survey however 812 of covered employers stated that intermittent leave did not have any impact on productivity and 937 said that it did not affect profitability another measure of the fmlas impact on covered employers is the costs it imposes such as those involved in admin istration benefit c ontinuation and the temporary replacement of leavetakers eg hiring and training costs although majority of establishments said in response to the dolcommissioned survey that these costs had not changed since they beca covered by the act sizeable minority reported higher fmlarelated expenses see table 3 respondents to the shrms 2000 fmla survey indicated that after productivity losses the next costliest items associated with the law were the time and effort expended by hr staff and the replacement of leavetakers howe ver the majority of survey respondents said that it was too difficult to quantify the overall cost of fmla administration 30 or that they had not done so 66httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30893crs15 table 3 changes in selected
