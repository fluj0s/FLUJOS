onslearned reports pply to this report information about the iraq war is incomp lete and imperfect so early lessons are subject to change each war is unique in some ways so observers should avoid overlearning the lessons of the iraq war and potential us adversaries can derive lessons from the iraq war and apply them in future conflicts against us forces possibly devaluing usperceived lessons it can also be noted that some persons or organizations offering pur ported lessons of the iraq war may have financial institutional or ideological stake in the issue many observers have concl uded that the iraq war validated the administrations vision for defense transformati on or major parts of it ot her observers disagree the issue is potentially significant because implementing the administrations vision could affect the composition of us defense spending and because the administration may invoke the theme of transf ormation to help justify or seek rapid congressional consideration of legislative proposals including proposals that could affect congress role in c onducting oversight of defense pr ograms the iraq war may influence debate on whether activeduty us military forces are sufficiently large to carry out current us military strategy and on whether greater emphasis should be placed on forces that are less dependent on access to intheater bases one of the most significant defenseprogram debates going into the iraq war and potentially one of those most significan tly influenced by the war concerns the future size and composition of the activ eduty army both supporters and opponents of maintaining at least 10 activeduty ar my divisions may find support in the iraq war for their positions as may both suppor ters and opponents of the current army plan to shift toward mix of fewer heavy armored units and larger number of lighter and more mobile units the iraq war validated the effectiveness of combataircraft armed with precisionguided weapons and may influen ce discussions about current plans for investing in specific aircraft and munitions programs the iraq war may reinforce support generated by the war in afghanistan for increased investment in us special operations forces it may also highlig ht questions concerning reserve combat divisions and the potential consequences of extended callups of large numbers of reserve forces the war appears to have demonstrated the value of networ kcentric operations and timely battlefield intelligence and the potential value of psychological operations it appears to have confirmed the importance of preparing for urban combat the war offered limited realworld test of the patriot missile defense system the war may lead to renewed di scussions about strategies for reducing friendly fire incidents it may reinfor ce support for investing in aerial refueling capabilities and increase interest in poten tial new airlift and sealift technologieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31946contents

implications for congress coordinated by ronald orourke washington 1991 may 15 2001 82 piraq war defense program implications for congress introduction1 the recent war against iraq known forma lly as operation iraqi freedom oif was the largest us military operation since the 1991 persian gulf war and may have implications for various defense programs of interest to congress this report which is similar to one that crs prepar ed following the 1991 persian gulf war2 surveys some of those potential implications it will be updated periodically as new information becomes available scope of report this report focuses on how the iraq wa r may affect defense programs that congress may address in acting on defense authorization and appropriation bills for fy2004 and subsequent fiscal years it does not cover broader defense policy issues such as us national security strategy or congress role in declaring war nor does it cover the postwar occupati on and reconstruction efforts in iraq or the potential impact of the war on us foreign relations and the us role in the world issues like those are covered in other crs products deriving lessons of the war some cautionary notes although the department of defense dod and other organizations customarily produce lessons learned reports following the conclusion of major military operation like the iraq war this report fo r the most part avoids using the term lessons because it can imply the making of recommendations something that crs reports do not do even so certain cau tionary notes associated with lessons learned reports apply to this re port these include the following information is imperfect early lessons are subject to change public information about the iraq war is curre ntly incomplete nd will likely remain so for some time although certain asp ects of the war such as the operations of us army and marine corps ground forces moving from kuwait to baghdad received extensive press covera ge many details of these operations are not known other aspects of the war such as coalition air operations were reported in less detail and some aspects of the war such as the activities ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31946crs2 special operations forces have received very little press coverage knowledge about the war at this point is thus fra gmentary and unbalan ced historically moreover early information that is pub licly available about war often proves to be inaccurate attempts to iden tify lessons should be tempered by an appreciation for gaps and imperfections in the available information as information becomes more complete and accurate with time early lessons may need to be modified or dropped each war is unique avoid overlearn ing the lessons of this war particularly for us military forces which fight conflicts in different parts of the world against various adversaries each war is characterized by unique combination of variables such as geographic setting preconflict warning and preparation time us and enemy war aims the size and composition of enemy military forces the quality of enemy military training and leadership the amount and kind of military assistance that the united states or the enemy receives during the war from other governments or groups the enemy governments degree of popular suppor t among its own population and the presence or absence of factional di visions within the enemy countrys population due to ethnic differences or ot her factors given how at least some of these factors usually change for the united states from one war to the next it has long been staple of us less onslearned reports to note that lessons from one conflict may not necessarily pply to the next might need to be applied with caution or might contradict lessons of previ ous conflicts some of the lessons of the iraq war for example may differ from lessons of the usled war in afghanistan in 20012002 or the us military operation in kosovo in 1999 in short the lessons of the iraq war should not be overlearned because the iraq war in some ways might not serve as an accurate template for future conflicts nonus observers derive lessons as well possibly devaluing us perceived lessons the united states is not the only country that derives lessons from us military operations obs ervers in other countries do so as well nonus observers keenly obs erve the us way of war and draw conclusions about its strengths and wea knesses these conclusions if correct can be applied by potential us adversaries to improve their ability to contest us forces in future conflict serbia for example observed the 1991 persian gulf war and drew lessons fro m it on how to counter the effects of us air power these lessons were applied with some success by serbian forces in kosovo in 1999 in short less ons that us observers reach about given us military operation can be devalued by lessons that potential adversaries draw from that same operation this is another reason to avoid overlearning the lessons of given us military operation numerous persons or organizations may offer what they contend are the lessons of the iraq war in evaluating purporte d lessons offered by various sources one factor to consider is whether those sources have potential financial institutional or ideological stake in the issue persons or organizations identifying the lessons of war can be influenced perhaps strongly by such stake indeed some persons or organizations may deliberately identify nd publicize purported lessons with the aim of influencing policy decisions on defense pr ograms in way that promotes their ownhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31946crs3 interests although lessons offered by persons or organizations with stake in the issue in many cases may be reasonable or correct policymakers may wish to take such interests into account in evaluatin g lessons put forward by such sources organization of report the remainder of this report consists of series of discussions on various defense program issues that might have been affected in one way or another by the iraq war the discussions are designed to be fairly selfcontained so that readers may browse

and speculations if correct and not all observers agree with them6 are potentially of great significance to congress for at least two reasons implementing the administrations vision for defense transformation could substantially affect the composition of us defense spending shifting defense funding toward defense programs that are judged to be transformational and away from defense programs that are judged to be nontransformational or legacy such shifts could signif icantly affect revenues and employment levels at companies associated with the affected programs the administration may be encouraged to invoke the theme of transformation to help justify or seek rapid cong ressional consideration of legislative proposals affecting dod that may or ma not be transfor mational depending on

firepower to destroy them piece by piece through process of gradual attrition until the enemy is longer capable of fighting effectively 9effectsbased warfare also called effectsbased operations refers to warfighting strategy that has been proposed as an alternative to traditional attritionstyle warfare rather than focusing on seeking out and destroying enemy forces wherever they might be effectsbased operations focuses on attacking selected key ements of the enemys ability to fight in coordinated manner under an effectsbased strategy us forces might attack the enemys military leadership its military commandandc ontrol systems and the most politically and militarily significant elements of the enemys fielded military forces while bypassing less significant enemy military forces the goal of effectsbased warfare is to create specific effects on the enemy that lead to rapid co llapse of the enemys willingness and ability to fight without having to go through timecons uming and potentially costly effort to destroy the bulk of the enemys military forces through gradual process of attrition 10asymmetric threats refer to military capabilitie s that adversaries may field as part of strategy to avoid directly attacking perceived us strengths and instead attack perceived us weaknesses potential asymmetric strategies include terrorism use of nuclear chemical or biological we apons and development of socalled antiaccessareadenial forces that are intended to prevent us forc from establishing an initial foothold in contested overseas area of military operationsdod budget accounts and eliminate ma ny dod reporting requirements that were instituted to assist congress in conducting ove rsight of dod activities7 the administrations transformation vision the administration identified defense transformation as ma jor goal for dod soon after taking office and has since worked to define its transfor mation vision in general that vision calls for shifting us military planning away from reliance on massed forces sheer firepower military services operating in isolation from one another and attrition style warfare8 and toward greater reliance on speed and agility stealth precision application of firepower by widely distri buted forces information technology joint ie integrated multiservice ope rations and effect sbased warfare9 s m transformation advocates characterize thes changes as shifting from an industrial age approach to war to an information age approach transforming the military along these lines the administration and its supporters argue will permit the united states to apply military power more rapidly and flexibly in distant parts of the world outpace enemy decisionmaking on the battlefield more eff ectively counter socalled asymmetric military threats10 and generally achieve us military combat goals with fewer forces more quickly and at lower cost the administrations transformation vision also includes proposals for changing dods business prac tices particularly with an eye toward streamlining those practi ces so as to accelerate the fielding of new weapons and generate sa vings that can be used to invest in themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31946crs7 11c4isr stands for command and control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance c4isr systems include things such as groundbased airborne and spaced based sensors for locating identifying and tracking friendly and enemy forces and computers datalinks and networ king software for rapidly processing and sharing information among networked friendly forces battlesp ace awareness refers to having realtime understanding of the location identity and movement of friendly and enemy forces within military area of operationstransformational vs legacy programs within the discussion on defense transformation there has been significant debate over which programs qualify as transformational and which do not advocates of various defense programs have argued that their programs should be viewed as transformational or at least not as legacy label that in some eyes has become synonymous with obsolescence and suitability for reduction or termination defense program areas that have frequently been identified as closely associated with the administrations transfor mation vision include the following precisionguided airdelivered weapons lighter and more mobile army ground forces special operations forces unmanned vehicles smaller and faster navy surface ships space systems and missile defense forces for countering terrorists nd weapons of mass destruction and c4isr systems that link us and coalition military units into highly integrated networks possessing superior battlespace awareness11 defense program areas that have been identified by various observers correctly or not as nontransfor mational or legacy include the following unguided weapons heavy armored forces for the army manned tactical aircraft large slowermoving navy surface ships and weapons and associated c4isr systems that operate in an isolated stand alone manner rather than as part of network the prewar debate prior to the iraq war the administration had identified transformational programs as high defe nse investment priority in submitting its proposed fy2004 defense budget to congre ss in february 2003 the administration stated that the request was the first to fully reflect its transformation vision and included more than 24 billion in acquisiti on funding for transf ormational programs some transformation advocates outside the administration argue that the administration though rhetorically suppor tive of transformati on has continued to place too much emphasis on legacy progra ms and not enough on transformational programs they argue for example that the administrations defense budget plans devote too much funding to manned tacti cal aircraft programs and not enough funding to programs for upgrading or re placing the air forces longrange bombershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31946crs8 which can deliver large numbers of pr ecisionguided weapons or for acquiring unmanned vehicles in the weeks leading up to the iraq war some observers speculated that the conflict would test important elements of the administrations transformation vision including its increased reliance on precisi onguided airdelivered weapons special operations forces unmanned vehicles and joint operati ons the use of advanced c4isr systems for networked operati ons and improved battlespace awareness reduced reliance on massed ground forces and war plan reflecting an effectsbased approach more than traditional attritionstyle warfare prewar speculation that the conflict would test the administrations tr ansformation theories was strengthened by reports that secretary of defense rumsfeld had played strong role in shaping the war plan to make it more in keeping with the administrations transformation vision particularly in terms of reducing the planned number of conventional ground forces to be used in the invasion debate following the iraq war those who support the idea that the iraq war validated the administrations tran sformation vision or at least important elements of it could argue one or more of the following the usled war effort which produced quick victory with low casualties featured significant and successful use of precisionguided airdelivered weapons special operations forces unm anned vehicles joint operations and advanced c4isr systems it also employed strategy that avoided attrition style warfare where possible and focu sed more on effect sbased operations directed against the key leadership and commandandcontrol targets and the most politically and militarily significant elements of the enemys fielded military forces the number of conventional ground forces making up the invasion force was not only fairly small compared to the 1991 persian gulf war but even smaller than the administration had planned due to turkeys decision not to permit the armys 4th infantry division to use turkis h territory to invade iraq from the north and the administrations decision to begin the war before this division was redeployed to kuwait the speed and precision of the usled war effort significantly reduced iraqsability to mount coordinated response leading to scattered and largely ineffective iraqi defensive efforts and to many instances of iraqi military units in the field that were hopelessly uninformed about the location and movements of us forces lighter and more airmobile army forces which the army is currentlydeveloping as part of the administr ations transformati on plan would have been useful following turkeys deci sion for quickly establishing more significant us ground presence in northern iraq those taking more skeptical view on whether the war validated the administrations transformati on vision could argue one or more of the following the us military force employed in the war was largely product of investment decisions made prior to the bush administration although the force incorporated some elements of the administrations transformation planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31946crs9 12among other things iraqs air force did not take to the air important bridges in most cases were not destroyed armored units were left out in the open where they would be vulnerable to us air attack repeating mistake made from the 1991 persian gulf war ineffective humanwave tactics were used to attack us armored vehicles and few apparent preparations were made to mount an organize d defense of baghdad in addition iraq did not make use of options that might have co mplicated us and coalition operations such as attacking the buildup of us and br itish forces in kuwait ign iting large numbers of oil wells blowing dams to flood likely invasion r outes and employing any available chemical weapons an alternative but similar argument is that ir aqs response to the invasion reflected not iraqi military ineptness but rather decision by iraq s leaders to forego making serious attempt to resist the invasion in favor of strategy of allowing the invasion effort to succeed going into hiding and then reemerging after the withdr awal of us and other foreign forces to win back control of the country through the effort s of reorganized baath party this scenario is consistent with the sudden and apparently planned disappearance of much of iraqs top leadership as us forces entered baghdad fo r articles discussing this possibility see sale richard cia reported to believe saddam is alive upicom june 2 2003 saddam plotting return to power exgenerals say new york times on the web may 19 2003 reuters wire service storyit represented only partia l or embryonic version of the administrations vision for transformed force mo re fully transformed force would have featured for example more and mo re capable unmanned vehicles more completely networked c4isr environm ent and the use of lighter more mobile army forces that are now in development the war thus did not provide pure test of force fully transformed along the lines of the administrations vision iraqs military was significantly inept in mounting defense of the country12 in light of iraqi military ineptness it is not clear that the war amounted to serious test of the administrations tr ansformation plan more traditional usled war effort or an effort reflecting transformation plan significantly different from the administrations might also have succeeded the number of conventional ground forces making up the invasion force was greater according to some press reports than some transformation advocates had proposed during the early stages of planning for the iraq war and the larger force that was used came close to being insufficient if iraqi forces had mounted more effective effort to cut the extended and thinly defended supply lines linking us ground forces to supply areas further south the invasion might have experienced signif icant setback in this sense the relatively small ground invasion force ma have introduced greater risk into the war plan than anticipated although heavy armored ground forces ar not closely associated with the administrations transformation plan and have been characterized as legacy forces the war underscored the value of heavy armored ground forces heavy armored units were successful both in br eaking through iraqi defenses in the south and in urban combat operations in baghdad and other cities they were largely invulnerable to iraqi rocketp ropelled grenades and other light arms and in drawing fire from such weapons proved valuable in uncovering the locations of hidden iraqi fighters who could then be killed more lightly armored ground forces like those being deve loped by the army as part of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31946crs10 13see for example tiboni frank wa r game

the kinds of weapons used by iraqi defenders even if iraqi military operations had been better planned and executed thewar could not provide major test of certain elements of the administrations transformation plan for example alt hough iraq laid mines in the persian gulf and may have attempted to fire antiship cruise missiles at coalition naval forces iraqs military capabilities and geographic options for c ountering enemy naval forces were very limited the war therefore could not pose significant test of the administration s programs for transforming us naval forces so as to make them effective against significant enemy maritime anti accessareadenial forces potential intermediate view would combine arguments from both sides of the debate this view while noting the success of the war effort and its significant use of force elements associated with the ad ministrations plan w ould also acknowledge that the us force used in the war represented only partial fulfillment of the administrations transformation plan that iraqi military ineptness was significant factor that the war may offer mixed evidence concerning the administrations plan for transforming army forces and that th war did not significantly test other elements of the administra tions transformation plans it should also be noted that observers who take skeptical view on whether the war validated the administrations transf ormation vision are not necessarily opposed to that vision they may support the vision but conclude that the war did not happen to offer clear validation of it an additional potential implication concerns asymmetric military threats by demonstrating to the world the formidab capabilities of conve ntional us military forces the iraq war may encourage othe r countries to place increased emphasis on developing asymmetric mean s of countering the united st ates including terrorism nuclear chemical and biological weapons cyberwarfare against us military and civilian computer systems and antiaccess areadenial weapons such as theater range ballistic missiles that are intended to prevent us forces from gaining foothold in an overseas operating area in this sense the success of the usled war effort it might be argued may strengthen the need for us defense transformation to focus on developing capabilities for countering such asymmetric threats 13 some of the program areas mentioned above including army ground forces special operations forces and unmanned ve hicles are discussed in more detail in subsequent sections of this report size of military needed

supporters argued in response that us forces were of sufficien t size to carry out the strategy administrations military strategy the administrations military strategy is sometimes called the 142 1

the iraq war those who were concerned about whether us forces were suffi ciently sized to carry out this strategy pointed to the high operational tempo that certain parts of the military have maintained in recent years the large number of reserve forces th at have been activated since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and the extende d length of certain reserveunit tours of duty since that time the interest among certain army officers for increasing the armys activeduty end strength so as to better support ongoing commitments in various locations gaps in forward deploy ments of navy ships to certain overseas regions and the relationship of the total number of active air wings divisions and ships to the potential requirements of fighting two regional wars in overlapping time frames some observers expressed concern that going to war in iraq would stretch certain activeduty us forces too thinly they argued that war with iraq could reduce forces available for pursuing the global war on terrorism or leave the united states with insufficient forces to deter or respond to potential aggression by north korea forces that were cite d as at risk of being in short supply

to the iraq war iraqi military ineptness contributed to the quick and relatively lowcost victoryof the usled war effort future dversaries may not be as inept and may learn and apply their own lessons from the iraq war suggesting that future regional conflicts on average might require us forces at least as large as those used in the iraq war if so the size of us forces needed in the future to fight two regional conflicts in overlapping time frames might be larger than suggested by the iraq war in february 2002 the air force was forced to begin making exceptions to therotational cycle for its 10 aerospace expe ditionary forces aefs so as to meet overseas demands for air force personnel in certa in career fields as result some air force personnel have d to deploy longer or more frequently than the aef standard the iraq war has created postwar mand for maintaining tens of thousands of army soldiers in iraq for peacekeeping and constabulary purposes28 adding to existing demands for army peacekeeping and constabulary forces in afghanistan the balkans and other locations maintaining significant numbers of peacekeeping and constabulary forces in iraq and elsewhere might require the army to use large numbers of activated reserve forces for extended periods of time signal that the activeduty force is not sufficiently sized the iraq war coming at time of elevated tensions on the korean peninsula may highlight the difference between conflicts that occur in overlapping time frames vs those that occur simultaneously us strategy is to have forces sufficient for winning two major regional conflicts that occur in overlapping time frames but nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31946crs15 29this section prepared by ronald rourke specialist in national defensenecessarily for winning two such conflicts that occur simultaneously the distinction though important is often ove rlooked in popular descriptions of us strategy the requirement for winning two conflicts that occur in overlapping time frames refers in part to an assumption that the second conflict will start some number of weeks after the first and that certain us forces that are needed primarily or most urgently in the early stages of regional c onflict such as certain airlift and sealift forces some kinds of aircraft cruisemi ssilearmed navy ships and perhaps marine amphibious forces can therefore be rota ted from the first conflict to the second such forces are sized closer to the requirements for fighting one conflict rather than two if this assumption proves incorrect if the second conflict begins before such forces can be rotated from the first c onflict to the second the us ability to prosecute the second conflict successfully or at acceptable cost could be reduced the combination of the iraq war and the tense situation on the korean peninsula provides policymakers with potential case study for reviewing the planning assumption of overlapping time frames and the potential risks of planning us forces on that basis overseas base access29 uncertain access as planning issue the iraq war like the war in afghanistan in 20012002 appears to have underscored how in the postcold war era us access to foreign bases and territory in time of war can be uncertain and when provided can come with restricti ons from host nations on how the bases and territory can be used this is potentially significant because some military analysts have argued that us defense programs must take uncertain access to foreign bases into account in planning us military forces war in afghanistan in the war in afghanistan few air bases in countries close to afghanistan were ma available to support us military operations and bases in pakistan that were made available had to be used in lowprofile manner with limited us presence and prefer ence for conducting operations at night rather than during the day as result of these limitations seabased forces operating in the northern arabian sea carrierbased navy

turkish bases forcing them to fly into that area from more distant bases and sorties of navy aircraft flying into iraq from two carriers in the eastern mediterranean were reportedly reduced because air force tankers needed to refu the navy planes had to fly from more distant bases in eastern eu rope and consequen tly could provide them with less on station inflight refueling capacity us war

us ground forces its decision to not permit its ports on the persian gulf to be used by us military sealift ships which reportedly contributed to bottleneck at kuwaiti port facilities for unloading

up to the war th ere was uncertainty about whether saudi arabia would permit the united states to use the large usbuilt air operations command center at prince sultan air base south of riyadh although

dod ship aircraft and weapon acquisition programs other observers argue that the issue of overseas base access while concern has been exaggerated they could argue that although the united states encountered challenges with base access in iraq and afghanistan the united states in both cases was able to secure sufficient base acce ss to support its operations in part by capturing air bases inside both countries they can also note that following the 1991 persian gulf war many observe rs argued that iraq had erred by allowing the usled coalition to build up forces in the persian gulf for 6 months without challenge and that us adversaries in the future would not repeat this mistake in the iraq war they could argue this expectation proved inaccurate as iraq once again allowed us and british forces several months to build up forces in the persian gulf observers who believe the baseaccess issue has been exaggerated can also note that other things held equal longrange systems can be mo re expensive than shortrange systems they could argue that given the cost of longrange systems and the likelihood that the united states will be able to gain at l east some access to inregion bases dod should maintain its current mix of long and shortrange capabilities army forces36 prewar controversy one of the most significant defenseprogram debates going into the iraq war and potentially one of those most significantly influenced by the war concerns the futu re size and composition of the activeduty army issues involved in this bate include among other things the number of activeduty army divisions to be maintained in the future programs for upgrading the armys m1 abrams tanks and other heavily armored vehicles and the armys plan to shift to mix of combat forces that includes fewer heavilyarmored combat units and greater number of lighter and more mobile combat units the armys transformation plan the army currently includes 10 active duty divisions as well as some additional independent activeduty combat brigades several of the divisions and independent brigades are heavily armored units the armys transformation plan which was initiated in 1999 by army chief of staff eric k shinseki would leave the number of activeduty army divisions unchanged at 10 but shift the composition of the army toward mix featuring fewer heavily armored units built around armored vehicles like the m1 abrams tank andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31946crs19 37immediately following iraqs invasion of kuwait us officials were concerned that iraqi forces might continue their advance into north eastern saudi arabia so as to seize important saudi oil fields and port facilities located there if they had done so it would have given iraq control over major source of oil nd significantly complicated for us military planners the task of mounting counteroffens ive to expel iraqi forces from territory they had seized 38the army uses legacy force as neutral term for referring to army units built around weapons and equipment procured in previous ears although as mentioned earlier in the report the term legacy has become synonym ous in some eyes with obsolescence and suitability for reduction or terminati on the armys use of the term does not carry that meaningthe m2 bradley fighting vehicle and greater number of moremobile army combat units built around more lightly armored combat vehicles the principal goal of the transformation plan is to significantly improve the armys ability to rapidly deploy signifi cant ground combat forces to conflicts in distant areas the plan was prompted by the 1999 us military operation in kosovo which exposed inadequacies in the armys ability to rapidly deploy heavy forces and by the armys initial reaction to iraqs i nvasion of kuwait in august 1990 in the latter instance the army was able to quickly deploy some lightly armed units such as the 82nd airborne division to northeast saudi arabia to defend against potential iraqi followon attack into that country37 but some observers at the time said that those forces would serve as little more than speed bumps in slowing down any such attack the first step in the armys transformation plan is to create 6 new mobile combat brigades over the next few years these brigades are to be built around the lightly armored stryker wheeled combat vehicle and consequently are called stryker brigade combat teams sbcts or simply stryker brigades the 6 stryker brigades would constitute the core of the ar mys interim transformation force the second step in the armys transfor mation plan would be to create group of more technologically advanced mobile combat units that would be the eventual successors to both the legacy force38 and the stryker brigades these more hightech combat units would be built around the futu re combat system fcs collection of advanced combat vehicles and supportin g systems that is now in development the first fcsequipped unit is to enter service in fy2008 army units built

activeduty army many observers be lieve that secretary of defense donald rumsfelds announcement in early 2002 of his preferred choice for general shinsekis successor which was made more than year before the end of shinsekis term as army chief of staff reflected this tension and was in tended to prematurely turn shinseki into lame duck some observers believe that osds views on army transformation efforts are conditioned by general osd preference for air power over ground power others believe osd s perceived tepid support for the armys transformation plan is due in part to the fact that it was initiated in 1999 during the clinton administration39 prewar debate over the plan independent of re ported tensions between osd and the armys leadership the army s transformation pl an has generated significant debate among military analysts merits of maintaining 10 divisions supporters of the armys intention to maintain 10 activeduty divi sions have argued that this is the correct number for carrying out the armys portion of the us national military strategy ten active duty army divisions together with 3 activeduty marine corps divisions will be sufficient they have argued for fighting two regional conflicts in overlapping time frames while carrying out add itional responsibilities in other areas if additional us ground forces are needed they have argu ed they can be mobilized from the army and marine corps reserves some opponents of the 10division figure ve argued that it is insufficient to carry out the armys portion of the national military strategy the high operational tempo of activeduty army forces in recent years and the need to mobilize large numbers of army reserve personnel for extended periods of active duty since september 11 2001 they have argued is evidence that 10division force is insufficient to carry out the armys various ongoing duties around the world particularly after 911 other opponents of the 10division figure including reportedly officials within osd argue that 10division force is larger than what the army will need in the future to carry out its portion of the national military strategy they argue that advances in us warfighting technology and changes in us military doctrine might permit the army to be reduced to as few as 6 active duty divisions 2 divisions for each of 2 overlapping regional conflicts and 2

transformation overview and issues for congress by edward f bruner washington 2003 updated periodically 6 pmerits of planned shift to lighter forces supporters of the armys plan to shift to greater reliance on lighter forces have argued that it represents good strategy for making the army more mobile and responsive they have argued that stryker vehicles can be transported to di stant locations aboard air force airlift aircraft much more easily than the army s current heavily armored vehicles that strykerequipped units will derive their survivability on the battlefield from superior situational awareness standoff capabilities and agility rather than from armor that stryker vehicles would be more useful than heavily armored vehicles for maneuvering through countrysi featuring poor roads and bridges and that they would be highly effective for combat operations in congested urban areas opponents of the armys plan for shifting to lighter forces have questioned the survivability in combat of more lightly armored vehicles like the stryker the stryker brigades they argue could prove to be good way for rapidly deploying army personnel into combat situations where they will be defeated by opposing forces opponents of the armys transf ormation plan have also expressed doubts about the technical feasibility of the fcs which is to be significantly more mobile than the armys current heavily armored vehicles while at the same time offering degree of protection against enemy fire similar to that of heavily armored vehicles even using new technology opponents have argued it will not prove possible for the fcs to offer both things at the same time40 army operations in the iraq war activeduty army combat units along with marine corps and british combat units played central

highly capable on the battlefield in conflicts against opposing ground forces the us and british ground campaign benefitted from we lltrained soldiers and marines good equipment effective air support from air force and na vy and superior s ituational awareness us and british ground forces appeared to have achieved some tactical surprise at the start of the war in spite of the ngthy prewar buildup by starting their attack before the 4th infantry division deployed to kuwa it and before the start of extensive us air attacks once the invasion was underway us and british ground forces achieved further tactical rprise through their high speed of advance which involved bypassing some iraqi towns and military units and their use of unexpected routes the flexible battle plan and rapi d maneuvers used by us ground forces kept iraqi forces offbalance some ground engagements involved fierce fighting but most weapons used by iraqi forces were match for the armys m1 tanks and m2 bradley fighting vehicles potential program implications number of activeduty army divisions following the iraq war those who support reducing the army to less th an 10 activeduty army divisions could argue that the relatively small number of ar my divisions used for most of the war the equivalent of less than 3 full divisions and the dominance achieved by those units in combat demonstrate that the army can safely be reduced to less than 10 activeduty divisions while still retaining capacity in conjunction with marine corps divisions for fighting two regional conflicts in overlapping time frames and performing additional duties elsewhere the iraq war they could argue is consistent with the planned path of us defense transformation which envisages the united states fighting future conflicts with ss reliance on massive ground forces like those assembled for the 1991 persian gulf warhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31946crs23 42for an article discussing this issue in the context of the armys postwar

division which was redeployed from the eastern mediterranean to kuwait while the war was underway and did not participate in combat operations until the final days of the conflictthose who support the idea of mainta ining at least 10 activeduty army divisions could argue following the war th at the original us war plan called for using an additional division the 4th infantry division throughout the war that army supply lines were stretched to the breaking point and thinly defended as result of the rapid advance to baghdad that the num ber of us ground forces needed for the invasion was reduced by the contribution of an additional division by coalition partner britain which is something the united states cannot count on happening in future conflicts that about 148000 ar my national guard and army reserve members were activated to help fulfill army commitments during the war and that the commitment of army forces for the iraq war exacerbated an ongoing situation of high worldwide operational tempo for both active and reserve army units42 programs for upgrading armored vehicles supporters of reinstituting funding for upgrading the armys m1 ta nks and other heavily armored vehicles would argue that the iraq war dramatica lly demonstrated the continuing value of heavy armor in modern warfare not only fo r defeating enemy forces in open terrain as many expected but for conducting comb at operations in urban areas which many observers did not anticipate given the im portance of operations by heavily armored units in the iraq war they could argue th united states should ensure that all of its armored forces are fully upgraded particularly for fighting two regional conflicts in overlapping time frames against capable enemy forces they could also argue that upgrading all the armys armored vehicles will provide more time to develop the fcs and thus reduce technical risk in the fcs development program opponents of reinstituting funding for ar mor upgrades could argue that the war demonstrated that us armored units are ready vastly superior to enemy forces and that expending funds on further upgrade s would therefore be unnecessary and wasteful they can note that the armored vehicles that were used successfully by the army and marine corps for most of the war are not the most upgraded versions in the us inventory and that the army already has substantial number of more highly upgraded versions that can be use d if needed to fight more capable enemy forces in the future43 in light of this they might argue the army can successfully rely on its current plan to maintain force that includes mix of highly upgraded and somewhat less upgraded but still very capable armored vehicles plan to shift to lighter forces supporters of the armys plan to shift to mix of forces including fewer heavily armored combat units and greater number of lighter and more mobile combat units could argue that the battlefield dominance achieved by the relatively

enough heavily armored combat units to fight future conflicts they might also argue that lighter and more mobile units like the pl anned stryker brigades would have been valuable during the iraq war in helping the united states establish more formidable ground presence in northern iraq following turkeys decision not to allow its territory to be used as staging area for u s forces from their perspective in the days following the end of major fighting in the war stryker vehicles would have been useful in iraqi cities for helping to reestablish civil order the effectiveness of the m1 tank in combat operations in baghda d they could argue resulted in part from baghdads broad avenues nd sizeable public plazas and other open areas which gave the m1s room to maneuver and long lines of sight future urban combat situations they are likely to maintai n may take place in cities and towns with narrower roads and shorter lines of sight which could make m1 s less effective and potentially more vulnerable to enemy attack opponents of the armys plan to shift the mix of its forces could argue that the iraq war by demonstrating the continued value of heavy armor in modern combat suggests that the united states should think twice about reducing the number of army armored units particularly given the requirement for being able to fight two regional conflicts in overlapping time frames they could also argue that stryker vehicles would have been vulnerable to so of the weapons that iraqi forces used ineffectively against m1 tanks and m2 bradley fighting vehicles and that the war thus demonstrated the inadvisability of shifting the army toward more lightly armored combat units in particular th ey might argue that the army should be cautious in its planning for the fcs to use situational awareness as compensation for less armor protection they may also argu that although heavily armored units are more difficult to transport the united states was able to deploy sufficient numbers of them to start the war in reasonable amount of time and that given the potential vulnerability to enemy fire of lightly armored vehicles the need to improve the armys rapidresponse capability should be met not by lightening army forces but by investing in improved airlift and s ealift capabilities such as winginground aircraft44 and very highspeed sealift ships see sections on

however caution that th effectiveness of air operations in destroying iraqi ground forces is still bein g assessed they note that many of the early assessments of the ffectiveness of air operations against iraqi ground units in the 1991 persian gulf war were later downgraded some analysts for example now estimate that coalition aircraft were responsible for only 17 percent of the iraqi tanks

propos it is now considering to replace the engines on its b52s prior to the iraq war bomber supporters argued that programs for modernizing the bomber force are underfunded relative to tactical aircraft programs in dod budgets71 that dods current plan to retire certain b1 bombers early is unwise72 and that the current dod plan for developing nextgeneration bomber to replace the aging bombers in the current fleet is not sufficiently aggressive73 supporters of current dod plans argued that the forcestructure and modernization needs of the bomber force are properly reflected in dod planning and budgeting bomber supporters could argue that the iraq war and the war in afghanistan demonstrated that the value of bombers in combat operations has been significantly enhanced by the advent of precisionguided weapons they could also argue that the two conflicts underscored the value of bombers for reducin g the need for intheater bases and for maintaining ai rcraft with precisionguided weapons over the battlefield for long periods of time in light of the enhanced role of bombers they could argue dod should place greater emphasis on bombe r programs in its plans and budgets

for fighting regional conflicts particularly given how precisionguided weapons have mu ltiplied the number of targets that each bomber can attack during single sortie they could also argue that the

best way to guarantee continued us air dominance in future conflicts they have argued that the successful operations of current us aircraft in recent military operations does not imply that they would achieve similar success in future conflicts airdefense technology they have argued is devel oping and prolifera ting rapidly making tomorrows adversaries potentially more capable than yesterdays

capabilities if needed for responding to changes in the in ternational security environment for example they have argued if cruisemissile defense becomes much more prominent mission for tactical aircraft these new aircraft will be well suited to incorporate this mission critics of dods tactical aircraft modernization program have argued that dod simply cannot afford to proceed with all three tactical aircra ft programs as now planned at least not without requiring si gnificant cutbacks in other critical dod programs they have argued that th tremendous success in recent us military operations of current us ai rcraft such as the f15 and f16 fighter demonstrate that the margin of us superiority in air operations is so significant that it is likely to last for some number of years75 they have also argued that with the growing importance to us air operations of precisionguid ed weapons associated surveillance and targeting systems and technologies for ne tworked air operations investing in new tactical aircraft designs is now less critical for insuring future success in us air operations than investing in these othe r airrelated technologies in optimizing

like the navys seawolf submarin program that was initiated in the 1980s with the goal of producing an expensive highcapability platform for addressing projected soviet military threat that never materialized77 successful us air operations in the iraq war and previous c onflicts they could argue demonstrate that todays tactical combat aircraft are more than sufficiently effective and that upgrades to these aircraft can therefore maintain dods air power dominance until less expensive manned aircraft such as the jsf or unmanned combat aerial vehicles ucavs are fielded as result they could argue the fa22 program can either be terminated or procurement of the ai rcraft can be reduced from the currently planned total of about 276 to smaller silver bullet force of more than 100 aircraft supporters of procuring 276 or more fa22s could ar gue that the airtoair capabilities of iraq like those of afghanistan and enemy serbian forces operating in kosovo were known to be virtually nonexi stent and that none of these wars consequently do anything to invalidate the projected future threat for which the fa 22 will be needed an enemy equipped with modern highly capable fighters and

and the war in afghanistan marine fo rces conducted ground combat operations 350 or more miles from shore and perhaps 450 or more miles away from their navy amphibious ships at sea these are much longer operating distances than marine forces have traditionally experienced v 22 supporters could argue that the marines deepinland operations in iraq and afghanista n could be repeated in future conflicts which would underscore the value of replaci ng the marine corps aged helicopters with fasterflying v22s v22 supporte rs could also argue that difficulties experienced in the iraq war with maintaining the readiness of the aged heavylift helicopters underscores the need to proceed with v22 procurement other observers could argue that althoug h the v22 can be of value in replacing aged

republican guard division by 34 ah64 helicopters from the armys 11th attack helicopter regiment has been described as near disaster every helicopter was hit by ground fire one helicopter was lost and 27 of the 33 that re turned to base were too damaged to fly again without repair83 some observers suggest th at reminiscent of problems with army helicopter operations in kosovo and afghanistan an army failure to coordinate the apache attack with supportin g air force and navy aircraft operations may have played significant role in the poor outcome of this attack84 by using different tactics and by more closely integrating their efforts with fixedwing attack aircraft and army artillery ah64s from the 101st air assault division conducted raid on the city of karbala four days later with much less damage85 one traditional role for army attack helicopters is conducting close air support ie attacking enemy forces that are directly in contact with or near contact with friendly forces early in the iraq war attack helicopter pilots complained that they were being sidelined that us war pl anners were relying more on fixedwing aircraft many armed with precisiongu ided weapons than on helicopters for performing close air support missions86 this perceived preference for fixedwing aircraft if accurate may have been due in part to concerns regarding helicopter survivability following

helicopter maintainability keeping helicopters flying in the harsh desert conditions of iraq app ears to have been challenge early reports indicate that many different helicopters but perhaps pecially marine corps heavylift ch53es were frequently grounded due to sandinduced engine problems while some maintenance difficulties may always be expected for forces operating in the field in time of war some observers argue that little improvement in helicopter maintainability has been made since the 1991 persian gulf war and that the desert conditions in which these helicopt ers must operate are well known87 in light of the mixed results with helicopter operations in iraq and other recent operations there is speculation that dod may consider the option of placing less emphasis on helicopters in its plans and budg ets the helicopter program that might most be affected by this is the armys rah66 comanche helic opter program the comanche is stealthy ar med reconnaissance helicopter that the army has been developing for about 20 years during wh ich time it has been frequent topic of debate in late 2002 dod restructured th program reducing the armys planned procurement of the helicopter by about half from about 1200 to about 600 and including in the program new effo rt to develop companion uavs for each helicopter these companion uavs could be used to improve situational awareness for the crews flying the comanches or to attack targets on the ground that might threaten comanches88 supporters of reducing the planned procur ement of comanche programs further or of terminating the program entirely could argue that the iraq war demonstrated that attack helicopters can be signifi cantly vulnerable to ground fire in modern combat operations and that missions prev iously performed by helicopters can now be performed by higherflying fixedwi ng aircraft armed with precisionguided munitions supporters of the comanc he program could argue that the problems with helicopter survivability in the iraq war reflected incorrect tactics including lack of coordination with air force and navy fixe dwing aircraft rather than inherent problems with helicopters and that adjusting tactics produced better results they could also argue that the co manche helicopter w ith its stealth features and support from companion uavs will be much more rvivable on the modern battlefield than todays attack helicopters helicopters they could argue will retain their effectiveness relative to fixedwing aircraft in responding with agility to enemy maneuvers on the battlefield something that iraqi forces did little of in the iraq war but which enemy forces on future conflicts could do significantly89httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31946crs38 90for more on combatsupport aircraft programs see crs

ongoing global war on terrorism and more recently the iraq war in addition at least 47500 more reservists have been activated in other statuses for example to serve as members of the national guard under state control or as volunteers for active duty some reservists who were called up after september 11 2001 were released from active duty and returned to civilian life prior to the start of the iraq war at the time of the iraq war roughly 220000 reservists were on active duty105 the callup of reservists since septem ber 11 2001 represents the secondlargest reserve callup since the end of world war ii in 1945 only the korean war mobilization of 858000 reservis ts in 19501953 was larger106 the post911 reserve mobilization appears to have experienced many fewer administrative and

and possibly even exacerbated two issues regarding reserve force structure and accessibility which began to emerge during the 19901991 callup one of these issues concerns the army nati onal guards combat di visions and separate brigades the other concerns reserve recruiting and retention in an era of repeated callups national guard combat divisi ons and separa brigades the army national guard has 8 combat divisions and 15 enhanced separate brigades107 guard divisions have been called to activ duty for an actual or potential foreign conflict since the 1961 berlin crisis and none of the separate brigades has been called up for such purposes since the vietnam war in 1968 three army guard combat maneuver br igades were mobilized for the 1991 persian gulf war all thr ee were roundout units designat ed to bring parent active army divisions to full strength upon mob ilization these three brigades however were not activated until several months after the crisis began with iraqs invasion of kuwait in august 1990 the two brigades w hose parent divisions fought in the war did not deploy with those divisions none of the three brigades left the united states and the only one to be validated as combatready was so judged on the date the war officially ended the brigades experience in the conflict generated much controversy about the viability of the roundout concept and the active armys relationship with the national guard in particular engendering great bitterness in official relations between the guard and the armys senior uniformed leadership108 none of the guard divisions and brigades have been activated to serve as whole divisions and brigades since septembe r 11 2001 substantial number of the combat battalions that make up these di visions and brigades however have been activated since that date mostly to provide physical security for military installations including air force bases in the united st ates few of the battalions have been deployed to provide reararea security in kuwait and iraq given the number of activeduty army units committed to iraq and other locations at the time of the iraq war some observers suggested that some guard divisions and brigades should be activated to reconstitute strategic reserve against possible threats elsewhere such as the korean peninsula there is indication however that dod has contemplated ta king such an action dod and the administration have argued that more for ces have not been needed other observershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31946crs44 109studies done in the mid1990s by the institute for defense analyses suggest that national guard heavy ie armored or mechanized infantry brigades with properly structured pre and postmobilization training can be read to deploy overseas into combat within 60 days after being called up and that light brigad ie light infantry or airborne brigades can be ready in several weeks less ot her studies by the rand corporation however assert that such brigades might take between 96 and 154 days to be trained after activation the reasons behind this radical difference in the two organizations estimated readiness times remain unclear see crs report 97719 f the army reserve co mponents strength and force structure issues by robert l goldich washington 1997 updated july 15 1997 passim but especially p 910 110some of these activations have been directly related to war or armed conflict examples include the 19901991 callup for the 1991 persian gulf war the mostly lowintensity us confrontation with iraq of 1991 2003 which required reserve callup starting in 1998 to support both rapid us depl oyment of ground troops to kuwait and the maintenance of the uscoalition nofly zones over northern and southern iraq the global war on terrorism which began after september 11 2001 and the iraq war other activations have been in support of missions that were primar ily peacekeeping and nationbuilding such as the intervention in haiti 19941996 and the ongoing bosnian peacekeeping mission 1995present the ongoing kosovo mission 1999present has been combination of armed conflict and peacekeeping argue guard divisions and brigades have not been called up because the senior uniformed leadership of the army is an tinational guard and s ecretary of defense rumsfeld is antiarmy in general the history of the army guards combat divisions and separa brigades since 1990 raises the following potential questions for congress if these divisions and brigades are not to be activated under circumstances short of total national mobilization which has not happened since world war ii 60 years ago of what use are they in the foreseeable future if some of the subordina battalions of the divisions and brigades are considered useful during less extensive mobilizations as their recent activations indicate then s hould some or all of the smaller component units of the divisions and brigades be ma intained while the expensive and officer heavy brigade and division headquarters ar eliminated there appears to be persistent assumption by senior active army general officers that guard combat brigades and divisions cannot be made combat ready without lengthy post mobilization training is this belief s upported by so lely realistic analysis and judgment or is it influenced by organi zational and contractua l relationships and loyalties109

challenges for reservists some reservists suffer mobilizationrelated financial hardships due to income loss increased expenses or erosion of their professional practices others experience family problems due to the strain of separation from family members in light of these hardships there has been significant concern since at least 1990 that morefrequent and morelengthy reserve callups would lead to recruiting and rete ntion problems for the reserve components the size and duration of the post911 mobilization has increased those concerns to date the data indicate that reserve recruiting and retention have not suffered due to increased use of the reserve com ponents reserve recruiting in fy 2002 was very robust with every reserve component exceeding its recruiting goals sometimes by substantial margins veral scholarly studies have looked at the link between the mobilization for the 1991 persian gu lf war and reserve retention111 these studies found that the mobilization had significan t impact on reserve retention rates this is consistent with studies of active component personnel which indicate that provided they are well managed and not excessive deployments do not have negative impact on retention and can even enhance retention by providing participants with sense of accomplishment112 some of these activecomponent studies however also indicate that beyond certain threshold level depl oyments can have negative ffect on retention in light of this finding there might be reason to believe that repeated or prolonged mobilization of reservists might have an adverse affect on reserve retention and possibly reserve recruiting as well some observers are concerned that although reserve recruiting and retention has held up in recent years the post911 mobilization of reservists might begin have negative impact on recruiting and retention especially if it continues for an extended period of time if the current reserve mobilization does at some point begin to erode reserve recruiting and retention congress may examine options fo r redressing the s ituation potential questions for congress under such circ umstances could include the following

redeployed to kuwait following turkeys decision not to grant baseaccess rights elements of the division did not enter the war until the final days of the conflictncw in the iraq war many observers believe the effectiveness of us forces in the iraq war was likely due in significant part to the early stages of ncw that were implemented in time for the war principal case in point concerns us air operations which featured rapid tran smission of information from sensors to shooters particularly for attacking timesen sitive targets ncw might have figured even more strongly in the iraq war had the armys 4th infantry division the division with the highest degree of ncw implementation played more significant role in the war117 potential program implications the success of us forces in the iraq war may serve to reinforce interest in imp lementing ncw more fully throughout the services this is potentially significant because investing in ncw might result in reduced investments in traditional military platforms c4isr programs for achieving ncw require funding that might otherwise go to traditional military platforms and the improved force effectiveness generated by ncw may permit military tasks in the future to be performed by us military forces consisting of fewer numbers of platforms should c4isr programs for nc w be accelerated or expanded if so which other dod programs should be re duced to serve as the bill payers advocates of ncw could argue that do d plans and budgets should be adjusted to place greater emphasis on c4isr programs and less emphasis on procurement of traditional combat platforms because funding invested in c4isr programs w ill result in greater increase in overall combat capability dollar per dollar than funding invested in traditional military platforms supporters of investing in combat platforms while acknowledging the importa nce of ncw and c4isr programs could argue that creating network requires platforms just as much as it requires systems to link them that todays platforms are aging and growing increasingly expensive to operate and that nextgeneration platforms will be designed to take better

c4isr systems or acquire systems that are not compatible with us continuedof networking technology than todays plat forms ensuring that us forces gain maximum benefit from the implementation of ncw key current constraint on achi eving ncw concerns communications bandwidth capacity ie simultaneous data transmission capacity especially for nonlineofsight systems networking sy stems require large amounts of bandwidth and us operations during the iraq war placed strains on current bandwidth capacity118 although steps can be taken to re duce the amount of bandwidth required by individual c4isr systems wider implementation of ncw will likely require dod to substantially increase bandwidth capacity one dod effort to improve bandwidth capacity involves investing in satellites that tran smit data using lasers rather than radio waves another ncw issue concerns the potential vulnerability of ncwrelated c4isr systems to potential enemy cyberwarfare attacks as implementation of ncw grows the dependence of us forces on ncwre lated c4isr systems could also grow observers concerned about this growing dependency could argue that although iraq may not have been well prepared for c onducting cyberwarfare attacks against us c4isr systems other future potential adve rsaries might be they could note that dod computers are now being attacked on regular and even daily basis by computer operators in foreign countries in some cases in largescale organized operations that suggest possible support by fo reign governments what steps is dod taking to ensure that ncwrelated c4isr systems will remain secure against cyberwarfare attack what is dods plan for ensuring the security of these systems while keeping them affordable and userfriendly119 ncw also has potential implications for

invading forces large numbers of civilian deaths and ma ssive damage to buildings and supporting infrastructure observers ex pressed particular concerns about the likelihood of urban combat operations in baghdad given the larg size of the city and its importance to the iraqi regime122 iraqi officials before and during the iraq war stated that enemy forces would be killed in large numbers in urban fighting and that the invasion effort as whole would be defeated in the streets of iraqs cities123 urban combat in the iraq war as expected fighting in urban areas proved necessary in the iraq war figh ting in and around iraqi towns and cities appears to have accounted fo r sizeable share of us and british combat casualties us and british forces were drawn into more extensive urban fighting in southern iraqi cities than they had planned but us forces were able to take control of baghdad much more rapidly and with fewer us and civilian casualties than many observers had anticipated bold

argue that the iraq war demonstrated the value of such vehicles in urban combat situations confounding the pr ewar expectations of some observers the m1 and m2 they can note were rgely invulnerable to the weapons iraqi fighters used to attack them and in draw ing fire from these weapons in urban fights proved highly valuable in uncovering the cation of hidden iraqi fighters who could then be killed without the m1 and m2 supporters could argue the army would not have been well equipped to carry out the bold advances into central baghdad that played critical role in rapidly collapsing organized iraqi resistance in the city while incurring few us and civ ilian casualties more lightly armored vehicles like the planned stryker wheeled combat vehicle they could argue would have been vulnerable to some of the weapons that ir aqi forces used ineffectively against the armys m1 and m2 armored vehicles as also mentioned in the section on the size and composition of the army however other observers could argue that the effectiveness of the m1 tank in combat operations in baghdad resulte d in part from baghdads broad avenues and sizeable public plazas and other open areas which gave the m1s room to maneuver and long lines of sight future urban combat situations they could argue may take place in cities and towns with narrower roads and shorter lines of sight which could make m1s less effective and potentially more vulne rable to enemy attack they could also argue that in the days following the end of major fighting in the war stryker vehicles would have been useful in iraqi cities

persian gulf war dod has spent about 3 billion dollars improving the patriot systems ability to track and intercept ballistic missiles for the recent iraq war the united states deployed improved versions of th patriot pac2 and th newer pac3 the pac3 is designed to fly higher and farthe r than the pac2 in contrast to the pac 2 which attempts to destroy its target with an explosive charge the pac3 attempts to destroy its target by colliding with it the latter approach called hittokill has been the primary us technological appr oach to missile defense since 1984 and is now being used for almost all other us missiledefense systems now in development ballistic missile defense in the iraq war the patriot system is currently the only operational us missile defense system and the recent iraq war represented the first opportunity for using the pac3 vers ion in combat the success rate of the patriot and particul arly the pac3 version in the iraq war was thus matter of particular interest to those fo llowing missile defense programs dod states that total of 9 iraqi ballistic missiles were targeted by the patriot system another 6 missiles launched by iraq were not targeted because they were projected to land in places where they would cause harm127 the ballistic missiles that iraq fired were not scuds but rather shorterranged and slowerflying missiles such as samoud2s and ababil100s it is not yet clear whether the lack of scud attacks in the iraq war was due to successful us operations to suppress such attacks before they could occur decision by ir aq to withhold its purported scuds for future use or because iraq at the time of th war did not have any operational scuds dod says the patriot system successfu lly intercepted all 9 of the ballistic missiles that it targeted seven of the intercepts dod says were made by pac2 missiles while the remaining 2 intercepts were made by pac3 missiles most of the patriots fired were pac2s 4 of th em were pac3s the standard firing doctrine is to fire two patriots at each ballistic missile the one iraqi missile that reportedly may have uded the patriot systems radar was lowflying iraqi cruise missile fired from

stillongoing controversy over patriot performance in op eration desert stor m in 1991 debate over the viability of hittokill technology for miss ile defense today is likely to continue supporters of the patriot sy stem and missile defense pr ograms in general could argue that the iraq war underscored the need for missile defense systems and demonstrated the effectiveness of the patrio t system for defending against shortrange ballistic missiles they could argue that the successful use of the pac3 missile in the iraq war demonstrated that hittok ill technology works and is the preferred means of seeking to destroy attacking ballistic missiles they could also argue that us military operations in western iraq suggest that operations intended to prevent the launch of enemy ballistic missiles may contribute to an overall missiledefense effort skeptics concerning missile defense programs could argue that the iraq war involved too small number of missile gagements to support firm conclusions particularly about the effectiveness of the pac3 version and its hittokill technology they could argue that the ir aq war did not validate the effectiveness of the pac3 version against the scud missile one of the most likely systems it is designed to counter but one that it has ne ver been used against in either combat operations or peacetime tests they could also argue that the successful use of pac 3s does not necessarily validate the soundne ss of the hittokill approach for other missiledefense systems that are being developed to shoot down intercontinental range ballistic missiles in midflight because such intercepts would take place in different physical environment ie outs ide the atmosphere and at much higher intercept velocities they could also argue that the failure of the patriot to stop the cruise missile that hit the seawall at kuwait city raises questions about the effectiveness of the system against lowflying cruise missiles although not confirmed the 3 friendlyfi re incidents involving the patriot system may be due primarily to operational procedures and issues associated with the complexity of the modern electromagnetic battlefield if so

combat called friendly fire or fratricide is tragic yet not uncommon aspect of warfare friendly fire incidents have been recorded throughout history130 observers argue over whether modern warfare raises or lowers the risk of fratricide on the one hand modern weapons are very lethal and frequently delivered over great distances modern comb at also emphasizes conducting nonlinear operations and missions behind enemy lines while simultaneously conducting strikes deep inside enemy territory this can in crease the risk of fratricide because the complex battlefield longer is made up of clearly drawn battle lines composed of fronts and flanks and rear echelons on th other hand todays military has far better communication navigation targeting and identification systems which should reduce the miscommunications that often lead to friendly fire incidents in addition widespread use of selfpro tection equipment such as new types of body armor greatly reduces casualties as do modern medical and evacuation capabilities concern from the 1991 persian gulf war casualties due to friendly fire emerged as significan t topic of discussion following the 1991 persian gulf war in which about 23 of us combat deaths 35 of 148 were attributed to friendly fire combat losses due to friendly fire can be particularly difficult to accept especially for the families of those killed and the percentage of combat deaths in the 1991 persian gulf war attributed to friendly fire was much higher than many people had anticipated as result of the experi ence with friendlyfire incidents in the 1991 persian gulf war minimizing casualties due to friendly fire was elevated as an issue and remained topic of some c oncern going into the iraq war friendly fire casualties in the iraq war although dod has not officially announced the number of friendly fire casua lties in the iraq war one press account shows that out of 151 total us combat d eaths at least 15 coalition deaths were due to fratricide rate of about 10 the ar ticle stated that an additional 10 incidents with 20 deaths were still under investigation so this rate could rise over the next few months131 fratricide incidents in the iraq wa r

instructing the patriot system to ignore slowerflying manned aircraft since 100 of the manned combat aircraft flying over iraq and kuwait during the war were us or british they argue patriot batteries and other air defense systems could safely have been instructed to focus solely on shooting down ballistic missiles although iraqs air force never got off the ground iraq did launch at least seven cruise missiles at military and civilian targets in ku wait on march 20 march 28 and april 2 2003135 cruise missiles appear very much like manned aircraft to air defense systems because they fly at speeds and altitudes similar to manned aircraft did concerns for potential iraqi cruise missile attacks deter us and british air defense forces from instructing the patriot system to ignore slowerflying aircraft if so does this incident suggest that additional funding should be devoted to improving the patriots ability to distinguish cruise missiles from aircraft one theory that has been advanced is that the presence on the battlefield of many patriot systems close to one another and to other us electromagneticemitting systems may have created situation of electromagnetic interference that confused the patriot system preventing it from properly distinguishing aircraft from ballistic missiles according to this theory patriot system operators in both the tornado and f18cd incidents thought they were firi ng at enemy ballistic missiles rather than aircraft136 if electromagnetic interference wa s involved in one or more of the incidents then reducing such interference may be elevated as concern in designing us weapon systems and developi ng procedures for using them the shotdown british tornado reportedly failed to reenter kuwait from iraq through one of the air corridors that had been cleared for allied warplanes137 if so then pilot error could have contributed to this friendly fire incident human error in time of war is difficult to prevent entirely but training and

the iraq war appears to have validated the central importance of deta iled accurate and real time intelligence in us military operations the availability of good intelligence was major factor in the success of the war effort enabling us forces to carry out precision strikes against critical iraqi leadership targets and military formations while bypassing other targets that were not critical to the us war plan as result iraqi military commandandcontrol capabilities were rapidly degraded critical iraqi military formations were decimated before they had chance to engage us and british ground forces civilian casualties were reduce d and significantly for the future of iraq damage to the infrastructure needed for reconstruction was minimized147 intelligence in the iraq war was collected and made available to operating forces without many of the communications probl ems that had existed in the 1991 persian gulf war the us military operation in kosovo in 1999 and even the usled war in afghanistan in 20012002 some of the improvements resulted from the availability of new equipment others re sulted from more res ponsive organizational relationships that facilitated the effective use of perishable intelligence data press reports indicate in particular that there was closer intelligence coordination between ground and air units enabling air strikes against enemy ground forces with fewer casualties to nearby friendly forces148 key form of intelligence was precise data on the location of important iraqi military installations iraq was mapped in detail by us intelligence agencies

or stored is not yet known though some sites at which such weapons and materials were thought lik ely to be located have been searched by us forces and been found empty some observers ar gue that there was insufficient intelligence information about iraqi possession of wea pons of mass destruction wmd to have warranted military attack some also question whether us intelligence agencies accurately estimated the reaction of iraqi ci vilians particularly iraqi shiites in the south to the usled invasion and the ability of various ethnic groups in iraq following the war to be integrated into democratic polity without an extended foreign military occupation151 although there were not many reports of insufficient intelligence resulting from too few collection assets obs ervers have noted that the war involved the use of considerable portion of limited inventories of socalled highdemandlowdensity hdld platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles uavs some observers suggest that the iraq war stretched available intelligence resources and that us operations in wider or longerlasting conflict could have been constrained by limits on available surveillance capabilities152 potential program implications the iraq war appears to have validated the concept of centering us military planning on the use of precise realtime intelligence for supporting precision strikes on ke enemy targets in this sense the iraq war may reinforce the emphasis in dod planning on programs for improving isr capabilities examples of such pr ograms include rec onnaissance satellites airborne

coalitions military campaign was against the government regime not the people or the nation persuade iraqi military pe rsonnel to desert or to surrender upon contact with coalition forces and persuade iraqi military commanders not to use chemical or biological cbweapons or sabotage oilfields initial assessments of the psychological operations effort have been generally positive though mass surrenders did not occur on the scale they did in the 1991 persian gulf war some largerscale desertions did occur some iraqi units that did surrender followed the distributed leaflet instructions for

positive by us officials despite instances of popular opposition some reports on the psychological operati ons effort have been more critical two noted that the part of the effort intended to

operations can be relatively costeffective means of pos itively affecting combat operations but that the success of such operations can be aff ected by numerous factors from the standpoint of planning one potential conclusion is that psychological operations can provide an advantage for us forces but that uncertainties about the extent of that advantage might make it somewhat risky for us military

for supporting us expeditionary military operations the iraq war provided test of enhancements for us air mobility capabilities that we re funded following the 1991 persian gulf war when certain air mobility inadequacies were exposed these enhancement programs included among other things the following the procurement of new c17 airlift ai rcraft to replace older c141 airlift aircraft modernizing

just 5 bases fulghum op cit official rationale for distri buting aerial refueling aircraft among so many bases has yet been announced one explanation may be that dearth of bases in general pushed tanker aircraft to secondary and tertiary bases so shorter range combat aircraft could operate from bases closest to iraq the more dispersed arrangement of tankers in the iraq war appears to have comp licated the task of coordinating tanker flights with combat aircraft flights so as to make sure that the right mix of refueling booms for air force aircraft and drogues for the navy marine corps and coalition aircraft were on hand at the right times booms and drogues ar different kinds of fixtures for connecting the tankers trailing fuel line to the co mbat aircrafts fuelintake valve the requirement for us strike aircraft to fly around rather than through turkish airspace increased aerial refueling requirements because those aircraft now had to fly longer missions and turkeys decision

fly further into iraq to improve aerial refuelin g coverage air force ta nker aircraft reportedly operated more aggressively than in past conflicts flying closer to hostile territory than in previous conflicts such as the 1991 persian gulf war while this improved tanker support for some us combat aircraft it may have reduced it for others navy aircraft flying from carriers in the persian gulf reportedly could not reach air force tanker aircraft operating deep inside iraqi airspace165 in addition it was reported that sorties of navy aircraft flying into iraq from two carriers in the eastern mediterranean were reduced due to limits on aerial refueling capability166 requirements for air mobility aircraft the experience with air mobility operations in the iraq war will likely inform congressional debate on number of general issues relating to requirements for air mobility aircraft including the following how much total airlift and aerial refueling capability does the united states need to support current and fu ture us military operations what number of airlift and aerial refueling aircraft with what mix of characteristics eg range payload ffload speed number and type of fuel dispensers will best meet this requirement how will requirements for airlift aircraft change as result of planned changesin us army forces particularly efforts to make army forces lighter and

planners preseptember 11th will increased attention to homeland security lead to decreased overseas deployments with regard to the changing mix of combat aircraft to be supported fighter aircraft tend to be more airlift and aerial refuelingintensive than either longrange bombers or unmanned air vehi cles uavs some observers argue that airlift and aerial refueling requirements which can be expensive to meet can be lowered by reducing planned dod investme nts in fighters and increasing funding for longrange bombers and uavs potential program implications the iraq war may have implications for specific air mobility program issues including the following c17 procurement the air force in fy2003 completed multiyear procurement of 120 c17 airlift airc raft and began followon multiyear procurement of 60 additional c17s bringing the total planned c17 procurement to 180 aircraft the general in charge of the us transportation command said in 2002 that he wanted total of 222 c17s to meet airlift demands169 in addition to citing these dod st udies supporters of increasing c17 procurement beyond 180 planes could argue following the iraq war that the war validated the continued importance of airlift capability for supporting us military operations that it showed the effectiveness of the c17 as an airlift aircraft particularly in transporting larger cargo loads over long distances to airfields with shorter runways and that it demonstrated how limits on foreign basing and overflight rights can lead to increased demands for airlift they could also argue that the planned transformation of the army toward lighter and more mobile forces could lead to an increased demand in the future for using airlift aircraft rather than ships for rapidly transporting army forces to distant conflicts and for transporting them directly to the combat theater rather than to forward staging area opponents of increasing c17 procuremen t beyond 180 planes could argue that the general success of the airlift effort in the iraq war shows that the united states in the future will not necessarily need mo re than 180 c17s they could argue that the iraq war and the war in afghanistan suggest that the united states in the future will fight wars with fewer ground forces th an in the past and that this combined with the armys planned shift toward lig hter forces could lead to reduction in airlift requirements they could also argue that airlift requirements in the futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31946crs68 170the c5 according to one air force estimate can carry at least 87

uavs begin to replace manned fighters and dod makes greater use of highspeed sealift ships future airlift requirements they could argue can be partly met by mode rnizing the c5 fleet and by pursuing new types of airlift aircraft approaches such as hightech airshi ps and winginground aircraft see discussion below on future airlift technologies c5 modernization nd engine replacement following the iraq war debate will continue on the number of c5s to modernize and reengine most observers agree that in the near term so mix of c17s and c5s are required to meet dods 545milliontonmileperday ai rlift requirement but how many c5s should be modernized and reengined those who support modernizing and ree ngining majority of the c5 fleet could argue that the iraq war showed that the united states needs all the airlift volume that it can muster the easiest wa to maintain and build upon our current airlift volume they could argue is to keep in service as many c5s as possible the c5s maximum payload of 281000 lbs is 76 greater than the c17s maximum payload of 160000 lbs thus it takes lmost two new c17s to replace the lost payload volume of every c5 that is retir ed the c5 supporters could also argue can carry many pieces of military equipment too bulky or too irregularly shaped for any other aircraft they can point out that although the c17 is capable of carrying much outsize and oversize cargo only the c5 can carry items such as the mark v special operations boat or the 53 foot mobile medical hospital170 in addition c5 supporters could argue modernizing and re engining all the c 5s will substantially increase the c5 fleets readiness rate ensu ring that the maximum amount of airlift payload volume is available at any given time those who support modernizing and reeng ining fewer c5s argue that the iraq war showed that overall airlift volume is important but being ab to move large payloads directly to short or austere airfields in the combat theater is more important airfields near iraq were limited in the r ecent war and the c17 was the only long distance airlift aircraft that could use the full range of airfields available in the iraq theater of operations fewer c5s they c ould argue should be modernized so that funds are available to procure more c17s suring that the future us airlift fleet will be better able to move payloads directly from the united states to the theater of combat and not just from the united states to forward airbase located in for example europe they could also argue that the outsize cargo that can be carried only by the c5 is of secondary importance and that the c17 can carry all important outsize military equipment what cannot be carried by c17s they could argue can be delivered by ship while the c5s readiness rate can be improved through modernization they could argue it will still be lower than the c17s readiness rate if readiness rates of airlift aircraft are concern they could argue fielding fewer c 5s and more c17s will result in higher overall readiness rate for the total airlift fleethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31946crs69 171for more on the full funding provision see crs report rl31404 defense

on th fy2003 defense budget dod has since considered how to implement this arrangement in general supporters of the arrangement argue that it is costeffective way to quickly improve the air forces tanker capabilities particularly at time when the air force is struggling to finance the acquisition of several other kinds of ai rcraft opponents argue that the leasing arrangement will violate the spirit if not the letter of the full funding provision that normally governs procurement of dod weapons and equipment171 and that in the longrun it will prove more expensive and less cost effective than the option of procuring new aircraft following the iraq war supporters of the leasing arrangement could argue that the shortage of aerial refueling assets in the war demonstrates need for quickly improving us capabilities in this area partic ularly if us forces need to fight two regional conflicts in overlapping time frames an official dod requirement for sizing us military forces they could argue that extending the service lives of the kc 135s would provide only shortterm fix and that procurin g new tankers would provide little nearterm relief to the situation and require procurement funding for several years at levels that the air force cannot afford supporters could also argue that the ir aq war exacerbated situation of reduced civilian air travel that began with the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 situation that has substantially reduced orders from commercial airline operators for new large commercial aircraft this situ ation they can argue has significantly damaged the financial health of boeing the only us maker of large commercial aircraft the leasing arrangement suppor ters could argue will help shore up the financial health of boeing major defense contractor involved in numerous defense programs important to dods future opponents of the leasing arrangement could argue that the iraq war does nothing to resolve the most important question f acing

because while sept ember 11 2001 and the iraq war may have reduced boeings civilian commercial aircraft business they also may have increased boeings military business due to the resulting increase in

us commercial airlines might longer be able to afford continued participation in the craf program as curre ntly structured these observers have suggested that new deals might need to be struck between dod and airlines to ensure the continued participa tion of airline operators in the craf program supporters of making such new deals c ould argue that the use of craf aircraft in the iraq war demonstrates dods conti nuing need for the program that larger numbers of craf aircraft might be needed in future times of emergency particularly for fighting two regional conflicts in overlapping time frames that the participation of commercial airline operators is critical to the programs success and that all necessary steps including new deals between dod and the commercial airliners should therefore be taken to ensure that the program remains healthy supporters of staying with the curre nt craf arrangement could argue that although commercial airlines are financially troubled and the iraq war demonstrated the usefulness of the craf program the u s government has already taken steps to shore up airline finances the airlines themselves are now restructuring their operations to further improve their financ ial health and that even if some us commercial airlines continue to experience weak finances the actual number of craf aircraft used in the iraq war military operation of significant size suggests that sufficient numbers of civilian aircraft to meet us needs for such conflict can be secured for the craf from the more financially healthy commercial

including arthur cebrowski the director of dods office of force tran sformation have stated following the iraq war that dod should consider developing nd acquiring new kinds of airlift aircraft such as such as hightech modified blimps capable of transporting 1000 tons of cargo at speeds of up to 100 miles per hour or winginground effect aircraft capable of transporting hundreds of tons of cargo at speeds of few hundred miles per hour172 developing and acquiring airlift aircraft like these they argue could fill in the current gap between todays airlift aircraft which transport much smaller payloads at higher speeds and sealift sh ips which transport much larger payloads at much slower speeds173 sealift174 test of post1991 enhancements congress has closely tracked issues relating to us sealift capabilities in recent years because they are critical along with us air mobility programs for supportin g us expeditionary military operations the iraq war provided test of enhancements for us military sealift capabilities that were funded following the 1991 persian gulf war when certain inadequacies in us military sealift capabilities were exposed these enhancement programs included among other things the following the acquisition of 19 additional sealift ships called lmsrs for large mediumspeed rollonrolloff175 ships for use in surge sealift from us ports and overseas
