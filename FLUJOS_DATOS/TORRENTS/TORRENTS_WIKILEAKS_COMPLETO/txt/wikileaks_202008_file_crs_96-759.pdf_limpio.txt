foods provide information through large food reta il stores to consumers about the health risks of pesticide residues nd how to avoid them preempt state and local food safety laws if they are based on concentrati ons of pesticide residues below recently established federal residue limits called tolerances and ensure that tolerances protect the health of infants and children contrary to widespread reports the fq pa does not repeal the delaney clause or amend ffdca section 409 food additives that are not pes ticide residues remain subject to the zer orisk delaney standard ra ther pl 104170 eliminated the distinction between raw and pr ocessed food tolerances so that all pesticide residues will be regulated under an amended ffdca section 408 new section 408 requires all tolerances to be safe ensuring reasonable certainty of harm from pesticides it authorizes slightly hi gher residue concentrations on foods when pesticide use avoids greater health risks to consumers or significant disruptions to domestic production of an adequate wholesome nd economical food supply the fqpa as enacted does not address tw issues that were addressed by hr 1627 as introduced and reported in the house but were deleted before the house and senate debates th fqpa does not include propos to federally preempt local pesticide use regulations which was opposed by several states with laws either authorizing or preempting local regula tion the fqpa also omits provision opposed by indian tribes and the administr ation that would ve prohibited tribal enforcement of pesticide use laws on land

significant changes to the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra governing the us sale and use of pesticide products and to the federal food drug and cosm etic act ffdca which limits pesticide residues on food in interstate commer ce the vehicle of these changes was hr 1627 the food quality protection act of 1996 fqpa enacted august 3 1996 as public law 104170 this report summarizes and analyzes provisions of the new law it also describes key provisions in the bill as reported in the house that were omitted prior to deba on the house floor and markup in the senate in general key fifra issues revolved around the roles of state local and tribal governments in pesticide regulation and federal law enforcement the cost of scientific tests required by the us environmental protection agency epa to support pesticide registration nd reregistration and delays in processing applications for new or amended registra tions especially for minor uses and long delays in reregistration of older pesticides and the need for fees to support the effort lesser issue involved state authority to require tr aining of persons who regularly apply non restricted pesticides in urban and suburban areas in this context congressional concerns about ffdca centered on the socalled zerorisk standard of section 409 the delaney clause for concentrated residues in processed foods of pestic ides that produce cancer in ex perimental animals there also were generally recognized needs for better data on risks to infants and children from pesticide residues on food coordination of tolerance revocations with pesticide fooduse cancellation and increased mon itoring of food imports for pesticide residues other issues included proposal for federal preemption of state and local authority to impose requirements on food with pesticide residues that are not unsafe based on federal law and epa adoption of interna tional residue standards all of these issues were addressed in hr 1627 as introduced provisions related to pesticide use were approved amended in may 1995 by subcommittee of the house agriculture committee the full committee further amended and reported the bill in july 11 1996 food safety pr ovisions were referred to the house commerce committee which reported july 23 1996 hrept 104669 parts i and ii the bill was further amended after being reported in the house but prior to house debate and passage july 23 1996 the senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry incorporated house passed language as substitute for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759crs2 provisions of s 1166 nd the senate passed hr 1627 the same night july 24 1996 the fqpa was amended after it was reported but before it was debated and passed in the house and referred to the senate this amended fqpa omitted provisions that were controversial in the housereported bill that would have preempted local pesticide use ordinances and prohibited tribal enforcement of pesticide use laws within reservation boundaries key issues addressed by the food quality protection act of 1996 in the following text analysis of provi sions related to pesticide uses including amendments to fifra pr ecedes analysis of food safety provisions and ffdca amendments within this framework issues are considered roughly in the order they are treated in the fqpa pesticide use provisions and amendments to the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra expediting suspensions of registration for imminent hazards cancelling pesticide registration when it is found to cause unreasonable adverse effects can be prolonged process lasting 4 to 8 years or more to prevent an imminent hazard during this period epa can suspend registration meaning that use of the pesticide is immediately prohibited but not before epa has published or provided the registrant with notice of its intention to cancel the registration before the fqpa fifra allowed epa in an emergency to issue suspension order at the same time it proposed to cancel or change registration and the suspension could become final after 30 days howeve r the clinton administration wanted to allow suspensions in cases of imminent hazard before any cancellation action others such as the national associati on of state departments of agriculture nasda which represents the 54 leading public officials for agricultural policy in each state and territory found th existing authority adequate public law 104170 allows epa to issue suspension order in an emergency before issuing notice that it intends to cancel registration or to change classification of the pesticide but the suspension order will expire after 90 days if epa does not provide notice by that time training pesticide applicators in urban and suburban areas while not particularly large propor tion of total pesticide use by volume household and business uses of pesticides in urban nd suburban settings may lead to exposure of larger and more diverse populations than in agricultural applications concerns about such exposures include immediate toxic reac tions in sensitive individuals as well as less visible but longerterm health effects such as cancer pesticides that end up in rivers lakes and groundwater are consider ed significant water pollution problem this can result from excessive and imprope r application or improper disposal of pesticide containers for example while these concerns apply to agricultural applications as well urbansuburban uses are sometimes at higher concentrations and may be applied by persons unfamiliar with risks or proper application practiceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759crs3 1pesticides minor usesmajor issues council for agricultural science and technology ames iowa 1992 p 3 5 2ibidmoreover when pesticides are applied to wns and gardens golf courses roadsides public buildings apartment buildings and singlefamily homes the people exposed may be very young or elderly and in robus t or fragile health people may be exposed to pesticides in such settings unknowingly or at least without prior warning as for example when entering recently treat ed roadside area or public building concerns about routine applications of pesticides in ur ban and suburban areas have led to calls for training of mainten ance applicators of unr estricted pesticides such as janitors general maintenance personnel sanitation personnel and grounds maintenance personnel applicators of restricted pesticides already must be trained the fqpa title i subtitle b adds new section to fifra authorizing but not requiring states to establish minimum requirements for training of maintenance pesticide applicators and any individual who uses or superv ises the use of pesticides not classified for rest ricted use for the purpose of provi ding structural pest control or lawn pest control on the prope rty of another for fee any training provided must include instruction in the safe and eff ective handling and use of pesticides in accordance with epaapproved labels and in integrated pest management techniques requirements do not apply to governme nt employees individuals who use antimicrobial pesticides private eg house hold use of pesticides or any use of readytouse consumer products the bill au thorizes epa only to inform states about the provisions of this subtitle facilitating minor use regist ration and reregistration according to experts about 1000 pesticide use regist rations important to the agricultural community for lowacreage specialty crops socalled minor agricultural uses may be canceled rather that reregistered1 another 2600 new minoruse registrations would be submitted through fy1997 to meet new pest control needs or to replace disappearing minoruse registrations2 without such registrations production of many fruit nut and vegetable crops might be more costly result in lower quality and diminish availability to consumers any loss in productivity could have detrimental economic impact on agricultural interests and possibly an adverse impact on consumer nutrition about 35 billion in fru it vegetable and other specialty crops are produced annually in the united states 20 of total farm r eceipts 42 of total crop receipts some farmers also believe the loss of minoruse pesticide products will put them at competitive disadvantag with foreign pr oducers who would continue to have access to the pesticides although producers sometimes may cancel registration because they fear complete safety testing will reveal an unreasonable risk from the pesticide use the more common obstacle to maintaining the availability of pesticides for minor uses is economic for some pesticides the ma rkets are not large enough to economically justify the testing costs of maintaining minoruse registrations these problems persist despite amendments to fifra in the 1990 farm bill public law 101624 which eliminated requirement for field residue data the data most often lacking for minor food uses for minor use pes ticides in geographic areas where thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759crs4 pesticide would not be registered for use authorized epa to reduce or waive the fee for minor use pesticide registration re quired public notice of voluntary registration cancellations and established grace period to transfer registrations for minor use pesticides to new registrant s and authorized research that emphasized minor or local pests epa would like to expedite procedures for registering minoruse pesticides the agency claims that it is now doing as much as possible administratively under fifra to expedite the process of mino ruse approval concerned growers have organized the minor crop farmers alliance to seek legislative remedies one of their goals is to increase federal fundi ng through such programs as the usda interregional project ir4 for data collection in suppor t of minoruse registration the fqpa title ii subtitle addresses minor uses of pesticides all interest groups as well as epa backed these provisi ons in support of minoruse registrations and reregistrations the fqpa will extend time periods allowed for submissions of pesticide residue chemistry data authorize epa to waive data requirements for minoruse pesticides direct epa to expedite processing of complete minoruse registration applications temporarily extend registration for 180 da ys rather than the current 90 days to provide additional time for registrants who do not s upport continued registration of minor use to arrange tr ansfer of the registration to another producer facilitate registration transfers establish program in epa to coordinate its minor use pesticide activities require usda to coordinate its minor use pesticide activities and establish and authorize funding for minor use grant program to develop required data the fqpa also extends the period of exclusive use that is the years during which one but the original registrant ma use the safety data for registrants of minor uses this will provide more time for the registrant to recover costs and make profit the current 10year period of ex clusive use is expanded one additional year for each 3 minor uses registered within 7 years of the first use registration exclusive use period can be longer than 13 years data supporting new minor use registered after the original exclusive use period has lapsed is protected for 10 years as long as the data are not used to s upport registration for nonminor use and the minor use registration remains in effecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759crs5 3the dhhs secretary delegates duties under ffdca to fda 4based on the heading for subsection m uthorization of funds to develop public health data this 12 million is intended to develop data to support registration of public health pesticides but the sentence authorizing appropriations states that it is to carry out the purposes of this section emphasis addedthe fqpa requires epa to report within 3 years of enactment on its progress in registering minor uses second category of minoruse pesticid are the antimicrobial pesticides used for example as preservatives in pain t antifoulants in i ndustrial cooling water disinfectants and sanitizers the fqpa title ii subtitle b sets time limits for registration of such pesticides and directs epa to identify and evaluate reforms to the registration process to reduce review peri ods to the maximum extent practicable maximum time periods for review are specified in subtitle b for various activities epa believes that these provisions might divert scarce epa resources from more important tasks some pesticides used to protect public health from diseases carried by insects or other animals are considered minoruse pesticides the fqpa title ii subtitle c extends some of the provisions for ag ricultural minor uses to public health pesticides but also increases the invol vement of the dhhs s ecretary in decisions about pesticide registration3 it also directs epa to identify pests of significant public health importance and to analyze and compar public health benef its of pesticide use against the risks this subtitle aut horizes appropriations up to 12 million for fy1997 and such sums as may be nece ssary thereafter to implement fifra section 44 epa supported these provisions title ii subtitle d of the fqpa establishes an expedited review process for applications to register or amend registra tions for pesticides that are expected to reduce overall pesticide risks ep also supported this subtitle promoting integrated pe st management ipm title iii defines integrated pest management and dir ects usda and epa to coopera in establishing research demonstration and education program to support adoption of ipm techniques in addition federal agencies would be directed to use and promote ipm this provision was not controversial coordinating fifra and ffdca regulations for fooduse pesticides epa has longstanding policy of coordi nating implementation of all statutory provisions governing pesticides for food us which the agency recently reaffirmed 61 federal register 2378 jan 25 1996 based on this coordination policy epa revoked ffdca section 408 tolerances fo r raw agricultural commodities if it revoked the corresponding ffdca section 409 food additive tolerances for residues in processed foods public law 104170 liminates the distinction between raw and processed food tolerances and the need to coordinate two sets of tolerances because ffdca now regulates all pe sticide residues under an amended ffdca section 408httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759crs6 5us gao pesticides reducing exposure to residues of canceled pesticides gaorced9523 gaithersburg mdto ensure that pesticide registrations are based on current scientific and legal standards fifra requires epa to reregister all pesticides registered for use prior to 1984 prior to enactment of pl 104170 ffdca did not have similar requirement for revisiting pesticide residue tolerances epa partly addressed concerns about tolerances for older pestic ides through its coordination policy epa revoked ffdca pesticide re sidue tolerances after it canceled the corresponding fifra pesticide registrations for food uses if and vice versa however epa took 6 years on average far longer than necessary according to december 1994 gao report to revoke tolerances after fooduse pesticide re gistrations were canceled5 delays in completing the reregistration pr ocess were further cause for concern about the adequacy of older toleran ces to protect human health public law 104170 mandates fifraffdca coordinati on as well as periodic review of tolerances for pesticide residues all tolerances and exemptions in effect when pl 104170 was enacted must be re viewed within 10 years the law also requires epa to reevaluate ffdca tolerances and exemptions when reregistering older pesticides for uses on food and an imal feed it requi res epa to revoke or suspend tolerances for pesticides if the relevant fooduse registration is canceled or suspended under fifra revocation of to lerance will become effective within 180 days of the date on which the pesticide us becomes unlawful unless residue of the pesticide will unavoidably persist the reverse situation also is covered by amending the fifra definition of unreasonable adverse effects on the environment to include human dietary risk from pesticide residue that violates tolerance it will prevent epa from registering pesticide or will require cancellation of an existing registration for food use if tolerance cannot be established or is revoked for that pesticide on that food the fqpa also requires epa to establish tolerances for residues that are expected to result from pesticide applications to foods allowed because epa has granted an emergency exemption from fifra registration requirements under fifra section 18 food safety provisions and amendm ents to the federal food drug and cosmetic act reducing reregistration delays since 1972 fifra has required epa to reregister older pesticides based on data that meet curre nt registration and scientific standards long concerned with epa s progress in reregistration congress strengthened and accelerated fifra requirements in 1988 and directed the agency to reregister by 1997 all pe sticides originally regist ered before 1984 when less toxicity information was available by september 30 1995 epa had completed reregistration actions for 170 or about 30 of the active pesticide ingredients for which manufacturers support reregistration early in 1996 epa expected to complete reregistration by the end of fy2004 7 years after the 1988mandated deadline of fy1997 during the debate over hr 1627 ep argued that timely completion of reregistration required that congress incr ease and extend epas funding authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759crs7 6the presidents balanced

is financed through combination of appropriated funds and regi stration mai ntenance fees paid by pesticide manufacturers fee coll ections have been lower and costs higher than originally anticipated according to epa epa and pesticide registrants agreed upon schedule of increased revenues that congress authorized in package of technical amendments to th 1990 farm bill pl 102237 it increased the annual registration maintenance fee cap while allowing continued agency discretion to adjust product fees to generate 14 million annually to carry out re registration in spite of this change last year epa timated budget deficit of 105 m illion to complete reregistration in 1996 the assistant admin istrator for prevention pesticides and toxic substances predicted that fy1996 re gistration and reregi stration would be at least 20 less than in fy1995 due to budget constraints and the government shutdown the fqpa title v extends epa aut horization to collect 14 million annually in registration maintenance fees from pe sticide registrants until the end of fy2001 it authorizes collection of up to 2 million in additional fees in fy1998 fy1999 and fy2000 epa is required to complete pro cessing of all pending applications for expedited review within 5 years of enactment although pesticide manufactur ers supported this extens ion of the maintenance fees they argued that historical fundi ng levels had been adequate and they questioned whether epa had managed funds efficiently the industry wanted the agency to develop system of accountab ility for expenditures on reregistration recent general accounting office gao repor t responding to request by the house committee on agriculture appeared to support industrys position7 gao recommended that congress require fiscal 1996 full scope audit of the fifra fund to consider the reasonableness of th overhead allocation and the adequacy of disclosures of direct and indirect costs8 in addition epa should prepare schedule for the reregistration process indicating how many reregistration decisions will be completed each year and specifying the che mical cases to which decisions will apply according to the report gao indicated th at such measures would allow congress to oversee epa efforts to ensure that the highrisk pesticides are addressed first fifra requires epa to give priority in reregistration to certain pesticides including pesticide active ingredients used on food th at may result in postharvest residues 7 usc 136a1c1a gao suggested amendi ng hr 1627 to incorporate these recommendations as gao suggested congress enacted fqpa provisions directing epa to establish and publish annually performance m easures and goals including goals for reregistration and to ensure that expend itures from fees are used only to accomplishhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759crs8 those goals the fqpa also requires an annual audit of the fees collected and disbursed and epa attainment of performance goals one reason for higher than expected costs and reregistration delays has been late and deficient reregistration package submissions according to epa and these problems are being addressed epa requires manufacturers applying to register or reregister pesticide to submit reports of scientific studies on pesticide toxicity and behavior in the environment the agency requires that studies conducted by industry conform to epa standards of scientific quality studies that do not meet epa standards are rejected and must be repeated and then reevaluated rejected studies contribute to the high cost of registrati on while pesticide re gistrants have argued that epas scientific standards for maintaining pesticide registrations are excessive epa has insisted that registration decisi ons should be based on the best available science in the past ep rejected approximately 30 of studies submitted 1991 analysis of factors contributing to late and deficient study submissions prompted joint epaindustry project to improve pe rformance due to workshops additional epa guidance and independent efforts of individual companies the study rejection rate today is half of what it was 3 years ago and many submissions are more timely according to epa some argued that industr ies have little incentive to submit timely and adequate applications to maintain registrations of older pesticides while decision is pending about the safety of the olde r pesticides manufacturers may continue to market them the sooner the application is complete the sooner epa will be able to make reregistration eligibility decision red and there is guarantee that epa will declare the pesticide eligible to be reregistered for all uses given current safety standards delayed reds and delayed potential registration cancellations in turn reduce demand for alternative pe sticide products this is true in part because new product alternatives lthough they may be less hazardous and equivalen tly effective for similar uses tend to be more expensiv than older products that have not been subjected to the full battery of safety studies giving them competitive advantage over newer pesticides provisions of the fqpa meant to reduce potential disincentives to registration and reregistration of certain minoruse pesticides were di scussed above in addition the fqpa directs the administrator to require the submission of data when necessary for registration review which the fqpa re quires periodically with goal of every 15 years to ensure data submission in timely manner the fqpa requires epa to suspend registration if the registrant fails to take appropriate steps to secure the data required within the time required by the administrator protecting infants and children from pesticide residues in the diet for several years congress

combined with improved information on the potentially harmfu l effects of pesticides on infants and children10 information on the potentially harm ful effects of pesticides would be improved it stated by toxicological testing of pesticides to determine perinatal and childhood toxicity and devel oping better methods to estimate exposure and the magnitude of potential adverse health effects the committee also advised epa to revise its process for settin g pesticide residue toleran ces under the ffdca so as to safeguard the health of infants and children the fqpa title iii requires that the usda secretary in consultation with epa and dhhs develop and implement procedures to collect data on food consumption patterns of infants and children improve residue data collection by pr oviding guidelines for analysis and reporting and increasing sampling of foods most likely consumed by infants and children and collect data of statewide or regiona l significance on pesticide use on major crops and crops of dietary significance in addition epa is required to ensure that pesticide tolerances adequately safeguard the health of infants and children section 405 amending ffdca section 408b1e some scientists have argued that data gathering provisions alone are not adequate to protect the health of infants and children their sensitivities and exposures must be taken into account in ri sk assessment and tole rance setting these scientists say the administration asked congress to require epa to consider the diets and sensitivity of children in setting tolerances11 congress added such provisions by amending tolerance settin g procedures of the ffdca section 408 see the discussion below in addition title iii requires epa to report to congress on progress in improving federal efforts to collect pestic ide use information including an analysis of the quality and reliability of information collected by usda epa and other federal agencies and of options to improve performance

the delaney paradox washingt on national academy press 1987 272 prevising tolerancesetting criteria for pesticide residues in food the delaney clause key issue in the 104th congress was whether to revise the socalled zerorisk standard of the delaney clause ffdca section 409 which prohibits the addition of potentially cancercausing substances to foods the application of the delaney clause to pesticide residues has been criticized for being unscientific and creating c onfusing and inconsistent t of standards for safety depending on whether pesticide was on raw or processed f ood and whether it was carcinogen or not critics of pesticide regula tion under the delaney clause maintained that it was unscientific because very small pesticide residues pose significant risk to health technology is now sophisticated enough to detect extremely small amounts of pesticides in food in some cases levels of parts per trillion thus food industry representatives claimed that rigid enfor cement of the delaney clause ie banning any measurable pesticide concentration stifled research and development of new pesticides which might have been safer than products on the market critics noted that many foods contain natural carcinogen s which are not regulated under delaney that may be more concentrated and more potent than pesticide chemical residues they said that residues might even have resulted from pesticide use to control fungi or bacteria that produce natural carcinogens in addition they claimed that in some cases the distinction between raw and pro cessed foods made sense the absolute amount of pesticide in food before and af ter processing might be the same yet tolerance could be set for the residue in raw food and prohibited for the residue in processed food because the re sidue had concentrated rela tive to the total food weight due to drying or other processing delaney clause supporters argued that the public does not want to be exposed to carcinogenic pesticides in their food matter how small the risk with regard to naturally occurring carcinogens in food th ey argued that federal agencies could not readily assess and reduce that risk especially since natural anticarcinogens often are found in the same food as the carcinogens to reduce the overall cancer risk therefore they believe the federal g overnment should minimize pesticide chemical residues in food the delaney clause also was problem atic according to some because it required regulators to treat potentially carcinogenic pesticides more stringently than pesticides that may exert other health effects this situation set up paradox by stringently regulating carcinogens section 409 may have reduced the safety of some foods section 409 allowed pproval of pesticid residues that posed greater risks than residues of carcinogens which s ection 409 did not permit because many registered pesticide products have health effects other than cancer for this reason the national research council nrc of the national academy of sciences recommended in 1987 that all pesticide residues in food whether raw or processed should be regulated on the basis of c onsistent negligible risk standard12httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759crs11 13depending on the overall weight of scientific evidence for carcinogenicity epa has classified some chemicals including pesticides as group known human carcinogens group b probable human carcinogens group c possible human carcinogens group d inadequate evidence to classify or group not likely to be carcinogenic to humans this classification scheme may soon change epa has proposed new guidelines for cancer risk assessment the new scheme would desc ribe the cancercausing potential of chemical in narrative up to two pages long carcinogenic potential would be categorized as likely known not likely and cannot be determined 14us congress house committee on agriculture subcommittee on department operations nutrition and foreign agriculture

keeping the zerorisk sta ndard and phasing out the use on food of pesticides classified as probable human carcinogens13 the administration favored single stat utory standard for pesticide residues in raw and processed food howe ver it argued that for pe sticide residues with health effects other than cancer such as birth defects or neurotoxic ity it was unclear how negligible risk standard would apply14 epa wanted to set tolerances based on the healthbased standard for noncarci nogens in the ffdca section 409 reasonable certainty of harm15 the administrations view is reflected in the fqpa the fqpa title iv amended the ffdca but did not amend or repeal section 409 which contains the delaney clause section 409 remains in effect for food additives that are not pesticide residues rather the fqpa redefined terms such as pesticide chemical and food additive so th at residues of pestic ides in processed as well as raw foods will be regulated under an ame nded section 408 rather than under section 409 section 408 tolerances so will apply to re sidues of breakdown products of pesticides i substances resulting from metabolism or degradation of pesticides and to re sidues of inert

sticide residues in processed foods under secti on 409 however the new w requires epa to assess safety in terms of total exposure to the pesticide that is to the concentration of pesticide allowed by the tolerance together with all other dietary and nonfood exposures for which there is reliable inform ation and to other pesticides that have the same toxic effects on people quantitative standard of safety is established by the new law but the committee on commerce expects epa to continue setting standards to ensure safety as it has in the past the committee expects that tolerance will provide reasonable certainty of harm if the administrator determines that the aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue will be lower by an ample margin of safety than the level at which the pesticide chemical residue will not cause or contribute to any known or anticipated harm to human health the committee further expects based on discussions with the envir onmental protection agency that the administrator will interpret an ample margin of safety to be 100fold safety factor applied to the scientifically termined observable effect level when data are extrapolated from animal studies16 in determining safe level epa is directed to take into account many factors including available information on dietary exposure to pesticides among infants and children costs and benefits prior to pl 1041 70 epa set to lerances for pesticide residues in processed foods under section 409 to ensure th at they were safe without considering benefits of pesticide use in contrast epa balanced risks and benefits in setting tolerances under section 408 hr 1627 as introduced would have regulated pesticide re sidues under the old section 408 st andard it also would have allowed epa to set tolerances for residues posing more than negligible risk if the risk were not unreasonable relative to the benefits of pesticide use the administration objected to this proposal in its view agencies should weigh only health risks and benefits th at accrue to consumers w ithout consideration of the broader benefits considerations such as regional benef its regional economic benefits or economic benefits that are not direct benefits to consumers17 i n contrast nasda wanted benefits to the agricultural economy weighed against the risks of pesticide use as enacted fqpa strictly limits the nature and influence of benefits considered in tolerance setting under secti on 408 it allows epa to maintain or modify existing tolerances but not to establish new tolerances at higher than safe residue levels only if the pesticide use avoids other great er risks to consumers or is necessary to avoid significant disruption in domestic pr oduction of an adequate wholesome and economical food supply such higher tolera nce levels may be t only for pesticides that are potential carcinogens or have some other health effect for which there is known level of exposure at which harm is anticipated known as nonthresholdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759crs13 18ibid 19broderick brian house repeals delaney clause in compromise fifra ffdca bill daily environmental news july 24 1996 bur eau of national affairs washington p a1effect the higher tolerance level allowe d for such pesticide residues must be safe for infants and children as well as with respect to health effects for which there is known threshold that is level below wh ich exposure is known to be harmless the higher cancer or other nonthreshold risk posed by the tolerance may not be more than 10 times the risk at safe vel of exposure on an annual basis and not more than twice the risk of safe level over lifetime for nonthreshold effects the house commerce committee provided additional guidance for establishing level of resi due that should be considered safe in the case of nonthreshold effect which can be assessed through quantitative risk assessment such as cancer effect the committee expects based on its understanding of current epa practice that tolerance will be considered to provide reasonable certainty of harm if any increase in lifetime risk based on quantitative risk assessment using conservative assumptions will be greater than negligible it is the committees understanding that under current epa practice epa interprets negligib risk to be oneinamillion lifetime risk the committee expects the admini strator to continue to follow this interpretation18 the fqpa also requires epa to distri bute to major food stores nationwide easily understood information for public displa about the risks and benefits of such pesticide residues on food and how c onsumers may avoid the risks without sacrificing nutrition the national coalition against the misuse of pesticides reportedly has criticized the new law for legalizing levels of pesticides that cause cancer and other adverse effects19 however very small risks from low concentrations of pesticide residues such as those permitted under th fqpa also were permitted prior to passage of the new law in addition w concentrations of potential carcinogens were legal on raw food before passage of the fqpa as long as the risks were reasonable considering the be nefits of the pesticide the new section 408 tightens the standard for pesticide re sidues in food in the future raw food tolerances as well as tolerances for processed foods must be safe and ensure with reasonable certainty that harm will result from exposure to that residue other residues on other foods other sources and other pesticides that have the same toxic effects on people only pesticides with health ffects that have known threshold eg some cancers are excepted from the safe sta ndard only under specified conditions and only if the increased risk is within strict limits moreover the new law allows growers to avoid use of pesticides that pos relatively large risks of health effects other than cancer by allowing pesticide re sidues in processed f oods that pose smaller cancer risks other provisions affecting tolerances the fqpa directs epa to develop screening program to evaluate whether pesticides may have effects in humans that are similar

affected by final re gulation has twice th time provided under previous law 60 days rather th an 30 to file an objection preempting state pesticide residue tolerances although federal pesticide residue tolerances are typically accepted across the nation the ffdca before it was amended by pl 104170 authorized states to impose tighter restrictions for example california requires businesses to warn the public about pesticide residues on food that pose significant risk def ined as more risky than one chance in 100000 of causing cancer or birth defects the agricultural sector particularly the food industry wanted federa l standards to preempt stat standards the national food processors association argued that di ffering state tolerances disrupt interstate commerce in addition it said farmers in st ates with tighter standards might be at competitive disadvantage to those in states with weaker regulations or enforcement supporters of the balance of authority re flected by the ffdca before amendment argued that unique regional demographic or food consumption characteristics made it prudent to allow states flexibility concer ning food safety such flexibility is built into most environmenta l federal laws epa opposed preemption while nasda supported preemption of tolerance setting and warnin g requirements the fqpa establishes federal preemptive authority over tolerance setting and exemptions when federal standards ensure that residues are safe but allows for state action under compelling local conditions with epa approval state and local laws requiring warning when pesticid residue is present in food are permitted20 enforcement of tolerances imports the united states imports approximately 15 of total domestic consumption of agricultural products according to epa and pesticides are used in producin g and storing many of these imports the ffdca prohibits importation of food with pesticide residue that exceeds its tolerance according to gao in 1994 fda tested about 1 of all imported shipments for pesticide residue levels21 critics such as nasda contended that this monitoring rate was too low making it unlikely that illegal pesticide residues would be detected on imported foods fda argued in the past that the low sampling rate understated the effectiveness of its detection program because the agency concentrated its efforts on the foods and countries likely to be the s ource of residues and also on shippers withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759crs15 22ibida history of violations such strategy was intended to identify violations more successfully than more frequent but ra ndom sampling however fda officials said that inadequate resources were the primary reason that the agency had not tested larger percentage of imported foods according to gao22 some questioned the cost and effectiveness of greatly increased fda monitoring arguing that it would be bette r to prevent problems from happening than to try to remedy them after the fact they preferred developing bilateral agreements with trading partners to achieve equivalent but not necessarily identical inspection systems that could prevent contaminated products from arriving at us ports of entry the clinton administration favor ed increasing support for fda monitoring of imported foods the administration also wanted enhanced authority to penalize those who introduced into interstate commerce foods with residues above ffdca tolerances the fqpa authorizes an additional 12 million spread over fy1997 fy1998 and fy1999 for increased fda monitoring of pesticide resi dues on imported and domestic foods it also authorizes civil money penalties in lieu of penaltie s assessed under ffdca criminal authorities seizure au thorities or injunc tion authorities for persons who introduce adulterated food in to interstate commerce but not for growers such penalties may not exceed 50000 for individuals and 250000 for other persons and may not exceed 500000 for ll such violations adjudicated in single proceeding see crs report 93821 the safety of imported food for more information about this issue harmonizing us tolerances with international standards the united states and its trading partners are c oncerned about facilita ting trade as well as ensuring the safety of food imports becau diverse health nd safety standards can be barriers to international trade the 104th congress considered whether to require epa to harmonize tolerances with inte rnational pesticide residue limits because diverse standards may be justified base d on regional or local health and safety concerns the goal of harmonization is agr eement on appropriate sc ientific and other noneconomic bases for setting st andards not single inte rnational set of standards proponents of harmonization argue that equi valent standards among countries would promote international economic development by facilitating trade critics on the other hand are fearful of weakening us standards and compromising sovereign rights they favor harmonization only if countries with less stringent food safety standards are obliged to meet more stringen t us standards process referred to as upward harmonization it is not clear wh ether they also would favor us adoption of more stringent standards tablished by other countries us agencies have participated for years in the activities of an organization sponsored by the ited nations the codex alimentarius that is food code commissi on which negotiates inte rnational criteria for chemical testing certification and

national association of state depart ments of agriculture and the us chamber of commercecodex mrl the fqpa requires the agency to publish notice in the federal register explaining why issues considered and dr opped prior to passage preempting state tribal and local pesticide use laws those who register and distribute pesticides sometimes complain that given federal standards local nd state pesticide use restrictions are unnecessary and burdensome to commerce fifra specifically authorizes state regulation of the sale and use of federally registered pesticides as long as state regulations are at least as restrictive as federal standa rds under fifra for exam ple states may prohibit the distribution and sale of fede rally registered pesticide or restrict pesticide use locally to protect groundwater wildlife or human health the fqpa does not allow labeling or packaging require ments on pesticides in add ition to or different from fifra requirements where states have not enacted preemptive legislation local jurisdictions also have the authority under fifra to regulate pe sticide sales and use according to the us supreme court wisconsin public intervenor v mortier 111 sct2321 environmentalists and some stat rights advocates are determined to preserve this interpretation of fifra the coalition for sensible pesticide policy an umbrella group for many representing manufacturers and user s of pesticides proposed to amend fifra to establish fede ral preemption of state regulations and state preemption of local ordinances to f acilitate national distribution of pesticide products23 hr 1627 section 106 as re ported by the house committee on agriculture would have prohibited local but not stat regulation of pesticide products nasda strongly supported preemption of local pestic ide use restrictions but many states did not this preemption provision was dropped after the bill was reported in the house but before the bill was debated on the house floor ffdca federal preemption authority is discussed below clarifying and li miting tribal pesticide enforcement hr 1627 title vi would have authorized indian tribes to regulate the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide or device and to enforce against violations of pesticide use laws within the boundaries of federal indian reservation for such tribe but would have prohibited these trib activities if less than 50 of such lands were owned by members of the tribe or the tribe the fqpa as enacted does not include this title in general with regard to pesticide laws epa treats tribes in the same way it treats states epa has approximately 23 cooperative enforcement agreements withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759crs17 24the honorable doug bereuter cong ressional record july 24 1996 p h8146tribes these delegate to designated tr ibal officers certain authority to conduct activities related to enforcement such as inspections of pesticide establishments within reservation boundaries including land owned by nonmemb ers in addition tribes may refer violations to epa for enforcement under fifra however epa does not delegate to tribes federal enforcement aut hority to invoke the penalty provisions in fifra the agency has encouraged tribes to adopt and implement pesticide laws and regulations that are similar to fifra where they have done so tribes enforce tribal codes some who supported title vi argued during debate on the house floor that states rather than tribes should enforce pesticide laws within reservation boundaries on land owned by people who are not tribal mbers if most land within reservation boundaries is owned by nonmembers of the tribe24 however tribes opposed this provision as did the clinton administrati on the administration expressed strong support for tribal authority to regulate pesticide use on all lands within tribal jurisdiction arguing that the federal g overnment lacks resources to implement pesticide programs at the local level and that significant gaps in environmental protection on reservations might be created if tribal authority were limited epa claimed that the historical record of tribal regulation of pesticide use on reservation lands is one of sensible environmental protection re spect cooperation and few welljustified enforcement actions goldm an lynn r letter to the honorable pat roberts aug 1 1995 four tribal enfo rcement actions are recorded by epa headquarters three in sout h dakota and one in idaho conclusion the fqpa has widespread support in the community of growers food processors chemical suppliers environm ental and consumer advocacy groups and state government agriculture officials the clinton administration also generally supports its provisions the fqpa aims to facilitate fifra registration and reregistration of pesticides for minor uses including public health pesticides antimicrobial pesticides and reduced risk pesticides to improve data collection relevant to pesticide residue risks to ch ildren and to protect consumer health by requiring ffdca tolerances for pestic ide residues on food that are safe and provide reasonable certainty of harm from aggregate exposure the new law tightly links epa actions under ffdca and fifra and requires both tolerances and registrations to be re viewed periodically the fqpa does not repeal the zerorisk delaney clause in ffdca section 409 but it does ensure that pesticide residue s in processed foods are not governed by that provision instead the fqpa subject s all pesticide resi dues in food to ffdca section 408 and tightens the sa fety standard in the fu ture raw food tolerances as well as tolerances for processed foods must be safe and ensure with reasonable certainty that harm will result from exposure to that residue other

pesticide laws as amended by the fqpa fifra authority and general provisions fifra as amended 7 usc 136136y25 requires the us environmental protection agency epa to regulate the sale and use of pesticides in the united states through registrati on and labeling of the timated 21000 pes ticide products currently in use26 the act directs epa to restrict the use of pesticides as necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on people and the environment taking into account the economic social and environm ental costs and be nefits of various pesticide uses to this end epa register s each pesticide for each approved use for example to control boll weevils on cotton fifra prohibits sale of any pesticide in the united states unless it is register ed in addition fifra requires epa to reregister older pesticides based on new data that meet current regulatory and scientific standards most pesticides currently registered in the united states are older pesticides and were not subject to the modern safety reviews when pesticide manufacturers apply to register or reregister pesticide active ingredient or particular use of regist ered pesticide epa requires them to submit scientific data on pesticide toxicity and behavior in the environment epa may require any combination of more than 100 diffe rent tests to register pesticide use on food epa also requires applicants to iden tify analytical methods that can be used to test food for residues and to provide data on the amount of pesticide residue that could remain on crops as well as on or in food products assuming that the pesticide is applied according to the manufacturers recommended rates nd methods based on the data submitted epa determines whether and under what conditions the proposed pesticide use presents an unreas onable risk to human health or the environment and if proposed for use on f ood crop whether safe level of pesticide residue can be established establishing safe level of residue is necessary before granting pesticide registration for food use if registration is granted the agency specifies the approved uses and cond itions of use which the registrant must explain on the product label fifra require s that federal regulations for pesticide labels preempt state local and tribal re gulations use of pesticide product in manner inconsistent with its label is prohibited epa may classify and register pesticid product for general or restricted use restricteduse products are considered mo re dangerous to the applicator or the environment and can be used only by traine d pesticide applicators certified by states individual states and indian tribes genera lly are responsible for training pesticide applicators for certification epa also evaluates the safety of pesticides after they are registered or reregistered registrants are required to report promptly any new evidence of adverse effects of pesticide exposure if ev idence indicates that registered pesticidehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759a2 27registrations also may be canceled under other conditions for example if data are not submitted in response to epas request for add itional information to ma intain registration or if registrant fails to pay the maintenance fee may pose an unreasonable risk epa may initiate special review of available information and may reevaluate the risk s and benefits of each registered use registrants also may be required to conduc t new studies to fill gaps in scientific understanding to pe rmit risk assessments if special review or reregistration evaluation finds that registered use ma cause unreasonable adverse effects the registration may be amended or canceled27 registrants also may voluntarily request cancellation or amendment of registration to terminate selected pesticide uses request for voluntary cancellation sometimes reflects registrants conclusion that the cost of additional studies is not worth the expected benefit that is profit from sales if the registration is maintained if registration is canceled for one or mo re uses of pesticide it may longer be sold or distributed for those uses in the united states although for specified period of time us farmers may use remaining stocks and commerce may continue for commodities that were legally treated with the pesticide an epa decision to cancel registration may be appealed by the registrant an appeal initiates lengthy decision review process during which the product may continue to be marketed however if there is threat of an imminent hazard during the time required to cancel registration epa is authorized to suspend registration suspension orders which also may be appealed stop sales and use of the pesticide generally fifra requirements are enforced by epa however fifra section 26 gives states primary authority including inspection authority for enforcing fifra provisions related to pesticide use prior to enactment of pl 104170 the last significant changes to the general provisions of fifra were enacted in 1988 pl 100352 authorization for appropriations expired on septembe r 30 1991 although appropriations have continued the history and provisions of fifra are summarized in crs report 97 49 enr summaries of environmental laws administered by the environmental protection agency pages 95101 ffdca authority and general provisions ffdca as amended 21 usc 301392 re quires various federal agencies to regulate foods drugs and cosm etics to ensure that they are safe for use for the approximately 300 pe sticides registered for use in food production the ffdca directs epa to establish allowable pesticide residue levels called tolerances in food and animal feed under ffdca foods with residue of pesticide for which there is tolerance established or with residue level exceeding an established tolerance limit are declared uns afe and adulterated such foods cannot be sold in interstate commerce in the united states any person who has registered pesticide may petition epa proposing establishment of tolerance or an exemption for that pesticide to permit its use onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759a3 28that is use on food crops animal feed crops or food products directly eg grains fruits or vegetables after harvest 29section 402 has become known as the flowthr ough provision this means that if the amount of the pesticide residue in the processe d food is less than the tolerance for the raw food then epa does not need to establish tolerance under section 409food28 tolerance petitions must include in formation about pes ticide application rates measured concentrations of pestic ide residues on the food after the pesticide has been applied according to directions on its label and safety of pesticide use on food ffdca requires epa to respond to each petition by establishing tolerance or exempting the pesticide from the requirement if the pesticide will not leave residues above an established safe level epa will register the pesticide for use on that food and set the tolera nce level by issuing regulation epa tolerances for pesticide residues preempt state and local restrictions on food if they are based on lower residue levels states may petition for an exception if the residue level threatens public health prior to pl 104170 the ffdca directed epa to establish tolerances for pesticide residues on food according to crite ria which differed for raw and processed commodities residues in raw commodities were subject to section 408 of ffdca this provision required that residue toleran ces be set at levels necessary to protect public health considering 1 the n ecessity for the production of an adequate wholesome and economical food supply and 2 the opinion of the secretary of agriculture as to the usefulness of the pesticide epa interpreted this directive to require balancing of risks and benefits in the setting of tolerances if tolerance was not necessary to protect public healt h epa was required to grant the pesticide an exemption from the requirement for to lerance section 408 made reference to cancercausing chemicals in contrast the former ffdca treated pesticide residues in processed food as food additives which are governed by section 409 this provision requires tolerances for food additives to be ba sed on fair evaluation of the data establishing that the proposed use of th additive is safe moreover section 409c3a prohibits finding that food additive is safe if it has been found to induce cancer in man or animal thus it prohibits the addition of potentially carcinogenic substances to foods this ffdca clause is known as the delaney clause notwithstanding the provisions of section 409 however pesticide residue in processed food was not unsafe if it resulted from pesticide use on raw food in accord with prescribed tolerance or exemption was removed to the extent possible in good manufacturing practice and was in readytoeat food at concentration not greater than the to lerance for the raw food product ffdca section 402a2c29 pesticide residue in pro cessed food was safe therefore if it had not concentrated dur ing food processing if it did concentrate the food could be sold only if food additive toleran ce ie section 409 tolerance had been established indicating that the pesticide residue was safe at or below that level and the pesticide residue on th processed food was below th at tolerance level or an exemption had been granted for the pesticide in that food however if the pesticide was potential carcinogen food additive tolerance could be established therefore processed foods could contain greater centration of potentiallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759a4 carcinogenic pesticide residue than was permitted in the same f ood before processing and residue at all if the pesticide was not used on the raw food 1992 decision by the us court of appeal s for the ninth circuit explicitly barred balancing of risks and cost s in setting section 409 tolerance for carcinogenic pesticide matter how small the cancer risk v epa ca 9 9170234 this decision led epa to propose revoking several food additive tolerances for potentially carcinogenic pesticide residues in processed foods pesticide residues in pro cessed food even if they have concentrated during processing are longer subject to secti on 409 or the delaney cl ause all pesticide residues are regulated under the amended ffdca section 408 the standard for tolerance setting under this revised standard is that aggregate exposure to the pesticide must be safe see pages 11 to 12 in the main body of this report for more information about the revi sed food safety standard epa has long coordinated pesticide registrations for food uses under fifra with tolerance setting under ffdca p ublic law 104170 codifies this policy thus if epa revokes residue tolera nce under ffdca it cancels the fifra pesticide registration for that food use epa explains legallyused pesticides should not result in illegal food 61 federal register 2379 jan 25 1996 epa traces the origin of its coordination policy to the legislative history of ffdca section 408 s rept 1635 83rd cong 2 nd sess 1954 p 3 similarly if pesticide registration for use on food cr op is canceled epa so cancels the residue tolerance for the food however just as fifra allows continued use of remaining pesticide stocks after registration is canceled ffdca allows continued commerce in commodities legally treated with pesticide thus epa does not immediately revoke the tolerance for the pesticide residue when it cancels the corresponding registration formerly the agency also c oordinated pesticide re sidue tolerances for raw foods with food additive tolerances for the corresponding processed foods when it revoked section 409 food additive to lerance for processed food it also revoked the corresponding tolerance for the raw agricultural commodity this effort will longer be required as both raw and processed foods are subject to the same section 408

cause food to be deemed adulterated pesticide residues in food405 amends ffdca 408 regulating pesticide residues in food safety of pesticide residuesnew 408a1 defines raw nd processed food products as food and pesticide residue on food as unsafe unless tolerance is in effect and the residue level is below the tolerance or an exemption from the requirement exists safety of residues in processed foodnew 408a2 defines pesticide chemical residue on processed food as not unsafe if the residue results from pesticide use that conforms to tolerance for the raw commodity the residue has been removed to the extent possible in good manufacturing practice and the c oncentration of processed food residue is not greater than the raw food tolerance or an exemption is in effect for the raw food pesticide degradation productsnew 408a3 defines food residue of degradation product of pesticide as safe if epa has determined that the dietary health risk posed by the breakdown product is not likely to be different than that posed by the parent pesticide bi tolerance exists for the parent pesticide and the combined residue of the parent pesticide and breakdown product is less than the tolerance or ii to lerance exemption exists for the parent pesticide and c the tolerance or exemption for the parent pesticide does not state that it applies only to the parent pesticide or that it does not apply to the breakdown product effect of tolerance or exemptionnew 408a4 food with pesticide residue shall not be adulterated within the meanin g of 402a1 while tolerance or exemption is in effect for

on its own initiative standard for tolerancesnew 408b2a i prohibits tting or retaining tolerance unless epa determines that the level is safe directs epa to modify or revoke any tolerance th at is not safe ii defines safe to mean that there is reasonable certainty that harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue considering all sources of exposure for which there is reliable information iii pesticide chemical residue for which safe tolerance exists is not an eligible pesticide chemical residue see belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759b6 provision pl 104170 eligible pesticide chemical residuesnew 408b2b i defines eligible pesticide chemical residue as residue for which harmless exposure level cannot be identified that is it exerts nonthreshold health effect the lifetime risk of such effect has been estimated using quantitative risk assessment and aggregate exposure to the residue is safe with respect to other effects for which epa is able to identify harmless level that is threshold effects ii allows epa to maintain tolerance for an eligible residue if iii the pesticide use protects consumers from greater health risks than are posed by the residue or the pesticide use is needed to avoid significant disrup tion in domestic production of an adequate wholesome and ec onomical food supply and iv aggregate exposure to the pesticid chemical including dietary exposure at the tolerance level poses yearly risk not more than 10 times and lifetime risk not more than twice that of aggregate pesticide exposure when the tolerance is at safe level v requires review of tolerances for eligible residues at least every five years vi requires tolerances for eligible residues to protect the health of infants and children see below exposure of infants and children to eligible residuesnew 408b2c directs epa when evaluating an existing tolerance or exemption i to assess the risk to infants and children considering consumption patterns special susceptibility and cumulative effects and ii to ensure with reasonable certainty that harm will result to infants and children epa may apply tenfold margin of safety for potential pre and post natal toxicity and inadequate exposure and toxicity data mandated considerations in tolerance decisionsnew 408b2d requires epa to consider certain factors when it establishes or reconsiders tolerance or exemption residue data new 408b2e author izes epa to consider data on anticipated residue levels and actual residue levels 5 years after tolerance is set requires data submissions demonstrating

percent of food treated with pesticidenew 408b2f authorizes ep when setting tolerances to consider data on the percent of food actually treated with the pesticide but only if epa finds th at the data meet certain criteria and provides for periodic reeval uation of the estimate derived from the data tolerances near the level of detectionnew 408b3 prohibits tolerance setting unless practical method is identified for detecting and measuring pesticide levels b prohibits setting tolerance below the limit of detection of the specified methodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96759b7 provision pl 104170

408c authorizes epa to establish modify or revoke tolerance exemption in response to petition or on its own initiative permits epa to allow an exemption only if it is safe meaning that there is reasonable certainty that harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide residue from all sources for which information is reliable requires consideration of certain factors prohibits ex emptions if there is practical method for detecting and measuring the levels of residue unless there is need for such method and reason is provided petitions new 408d authorizes any person to file petition for issuance modification or revocation of tolerance or exemption requires specified petition contents and authorizes epa regulations requiring information and data to support petition
