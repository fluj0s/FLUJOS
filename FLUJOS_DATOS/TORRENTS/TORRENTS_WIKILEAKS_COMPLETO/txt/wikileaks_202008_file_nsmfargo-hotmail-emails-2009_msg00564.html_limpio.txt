1004 amsubject nsm questionto commandernewsaxonorg commander schoepi know you may be busy so i will keep this sweet and simple like you i am an american with pure german heritage i am first generation and very proud of being of german blood i have attached pic of myself so you can see who you are emailing never mind the fact i am laying down with my dane pup i want to know if the nsm is dedicated to actually fighting for the white race there are lot of organizations or parties out there that just want to hold signs create shock factor and just stir momentary anxiety these groups are just bunch of posers and i want to know where the nsm stands the time is getting critical for our race to start standing up for itself and for our race to stop handing over power to the greedyass jews and the blacks that cry about anything and everything who want money from us for their ancestors time in slavery there has been great lack of success on the part of the white movement if you will party is going to have to start standing up and grabbing the peoples attention and emotions but party is doing that this part is tricky but please read the whole thing even though it sounds crazywe all need to start thinking in big picture mindset and strategically obama is going to be president and the white civil rights movement to use your words need to embrace this white people from the right are getting stirred up emotionally and starting to see who they really are and what is really going on they are starting to realize that black is going to be president and it isnt sitting well with them and of course it shouldnt obama will be under the microscope with every little thing he does wrong greatly mediated obama used to talk about being for reparations he will try to pass such bill and it will end up being the switch to turn people against him and the blacks there is much more to it but i am sure you see my point and why obama for president should be embraced there could be backfire and that would be if obama was the best president in the history of the country lol anyway i want to be part of party who is hellbent on moving the white civil rights movement forward and create more than any other civil rights movement ever has it can be done but political strategy is key factor hitler knew how to grab peoples attention and he knew when to make certain moves to further his and the nsdaps goals we need the same thing we do not have leader in the white sector who is serious about taking this forward that i have seen yet everyone is content with just holding signs and yelling slogans i am not saying we need to advocate violence but the white movement has been stagnate and impotent since the 30s40s the awarding of freedoms to blacks and the power grab of the jews is evidence enough of this fact anyway i would love to speak to you further 7193219381 this is my cell and you can reach on it from 11302015 et i live in the mountains and do not get signal before or after those times i know it all may sound crazy or farfetched but i have been studying political strategy for many years i view carl rove as kitten not someone of great strength although he is feared in the political arena by many below is an article you may find interesting and may help to show how others are coming up with the same points i made the fear it we need to grab it and use it to our advantage we need to get started respectfullyjeff heuermann obama and the professional blackvictims cartelby tom deweeseoctober 16 2008newswithviewscomamericans beware in the future should you disagree with president obama apparently you will be labeled racist as has been highly reported democratrepresentative john lewis of georgia said mccain and his running mate sarahpalin were sowing the seeds of hatred and division in the same breath lewis then made comparison to george wallace the reference to wallace can onlymean one thing racism it seems the attacks were made becausemccain and palin have started to comment on known associates of obama who have questionable backgrounds obama has tried to get people off the trail of theseassociates by saying it was long time ago not relevant and so on when thatdidnt work obamas troops played the race card even though john mccain has made reference to obamas race the fact is obamas relationships to knowncommunists do matter they speak to his character they show who influenced himin his political choices and they tell us something about what an obama administration may be interested in pursuing as policy could obama himselfbe communist is it fair question when discussing his qualifications anddeciding how to cast ballot obama says its racist is it fair to look at the statements andrecords of those around obama those who openly support him those being paidby his campaign obama says racist but that doesnt prevent obama and hisgroup to look at who surrounds and supports john mccain right wing fringe they tell us isnt that another term for racist according to them there are lots of questionable characters inobamas immediate circle including bill ayres bill ayres still travels to communistcountries in support and praise of policies which rob individuals of their rights and personal possessions for instance in november 2006 ayrestraveled to venezuela to attend an education forum thats nation quicklyfalling behind new curtain of tyranny under president hugo chavez with the great dictator by his side ayres proclaimed his support for the profoundeducational reforms under way here in venezuela under the leadership ofpresident chavez we share this belief that education is the motorforce of revolutioni look forward to seeing how you continue to overcome the failingsof capitalist education as you seek to create something truly new and deeplyhumaneis it fair to wonder if obama might consider ayres ideas on education and capitalism as his own and if they share thoseideas would it be too far fetched to wonder if perhaps obama could evenconsider ayres or someone like him to be his secretary of education personal relationships matter obama is upset that mccain crowds arecalling him terrorist how absurd says his campaign just mean spirited butayres wasis truelife terrorist he was founder of the weather underground they planted bombs in the capitol building they killed cops theycalled for the overthrow of the united states as they sided with our enemy invietnam the same communists who at the time were holding john mccain prisoner and ayres held fund raiser for barack obama does it matter how about obamas relationship with acornobamas campaign paid them some 800000 to register voters fraud has beenfound in several states as acorn has turned in voter registration forms with multiple addresses and social security numbers for the same name acorn hasendorsed obama but to question the possible connection to acorns vote fraudand obamas campaign is just racistfinally there is louis farrakhan the head of the nation of islam and one of the most documented whitehaters in thenation farrakhan by the way is associated with obamas minister the revjeremiah wright but that would be racist to point out but lets look at what farrakhan said on february 24 2008 to nation of islamsaviors day gathering you are the instruments that god is going to useto bring about universal change and that is why barack has captured the youth and he has involved young people in political process that they didnt careanything about thats sign when the messiah speaks the youth will hearand the messiah is absolutely speaking farrakhan had earlier suggested he would keep low profile in the campaign despite his enthusiasm for obamadoes it matter that obama attracts the support of the man who openly hateswhites more than any other what does farrakhan know about obamas positions that attract himhere issomething that may provide some insight into obama supporters use of the racecard in 2007 it was learned that the university of delaware has mandatoryprogram that requires residence hall students to acknowledge that all whites are racist the program went on to offer misguided whites treatment forincorrect attitudes regarding class gender religion culture or sexualitythey might hold upon entering school nowwhy did the school think all whites are racist because this is their definition of racism racist is one who is both privileged andsocialized on the basis of race by white supremacist racist system theterm applies to all whitepeople ie people of europeandescent living in the united states regardless of class gender religion culture or sexuality by this definition people of color cannot be racistsbecause as peoples within the us system they do not have the power to backup their prejudices hostilities or acts of discriminationthe schools policy deserves mention because it is advocated by most selfappointed blackleadershipthereyou have it blacks cant be racist because they dont have power over anyoneonly whites can be racists so for obama and his people to call mccain or anyone racist is simply way of saying hey whiteypity the struggling middleclass black americans who simply work to better themselves with nice homes inthe suburbs nice schools for their kids nice cars and clothes all the things any of us want unfortunately for them the professional black victims cartelrun by the jesse jacksons sharptons and barack obamas accuse them ofselling out indicating they are uncle toms who are just trying to be white turning their back on their ghetto brothers there is win for these folksby their definition of racism they become racist themselves oppressing theirown kind and for lower income blacks who may have dreams of their own the cartels message is clear their destiny is to be victims for lifefor the record before we completely losethe english language to such gibberish the true definition of racist is onewho hates another simply because of the color of his skin funny wasnt it martin luther king who dreamed of the day when people would be judged not by thecolor of their skin but by the content of their character apparently barackobama is martin luther kingso get ready america if we get president obama any opposition we voice against his compassionate policies toredistribute our possessions to the victims will be met with charges ofracism as louis farrakhan has told us the messiah has spoken 2008 tom deweese all rights reserved stay organized with simple drag and drop from windows live hotmail try it commander jeff schoepif you are not
