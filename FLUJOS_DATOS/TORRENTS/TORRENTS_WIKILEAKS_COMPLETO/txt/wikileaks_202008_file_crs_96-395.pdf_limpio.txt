pledges to protect listed sites and monuments within its borders and refrain from activities which harm world heritage sites in other countries the convention states in article 4 that each party to it recognizes that the duty of ensuring the identification protection conservation presentation and transmission to future gener ations of the cultural and natural heritage situated on its territory belongs primarily to that state1 the international community agrees to help protect them through the world heritage committee and fund world heritage committee and fund the world heritage committee

committee has two principal tasks first it recognizes the sites nominated by member states to be included on the world heritage list based on the criteria established by the committee decisions on additions to the list are generally made by consensus unesco provides administrative assistance to the committee but has role in its decisions the committee monitors the sites and when site is seriously endangered it may be put on list of world heritage in danger after consultation with the country in which the site is located in 1992 the committee adopted plan to improve its operations including an increased focus on monitoring conditions at existing sites rather than adding new sites to the list the committee also administers the world heritage fund which provides technical and financial aid to countries requesting assistance assistance can include such support as expert studies training and equipment for protection world heritage fund technical assistance must be requested by member country in an agreement with the committee which sets conditions for the assistance the world heritage fund receives income from several sources member states pay dues equal to 1 of their unesco contribution the united states is not member of unesco and therefore does not contribute as member the fund also receives voluntary contributions from governments donations from institutions individuals and from national or international promotional activities the united states contributed 450000 voluntarily to this program in fy2000 an amount appropriated in the foreign operations

legislation american land sovereignty protection act hr 883 was introduced by representative don young on march 6 2001 and referred to the committee on resources it has 30 cosponsors the legislation

appropriations act 2001 pl 106429 as passed by congress enacted by reference in hr 5526 section 580 of this bill states that none of the funds appropriated or made available by this act may be provided for the us contribution to the united nations world heritage fund pl 106429 was signed by the president on november 6 2000 issues for congress impact of the convention on us sovereignty although the debate on the american land sovereignty protection bill was often couched in terms which included influence over us parks and monu ments supporters of the american land sovereignty protection act were primarily concerned that lack of congressional role in designating the sites and lack of congressional oversight of implementation of the act undermines the congressional role under the constitution to make rules governing land belonging to the united states as the house resources committee web site on the legislation stated by using these international designations the executive branch is able to guide domestic land use policies withouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96395crs4 2 us congress house committee on resources httpwww housegov resources106th cong fullcommsovereigntyhtmconsulting congress2 supporters express concern that even though there may be international or direct control of us sites federal agency managers may take into account the international rules of the world heritage progr am in making land use decisions or use the designation to undermine local land use decisions often without the advice or even the knowledge of local authorities or property owners the world heritage convention does not give the united nations authority over us sites the department of state has testified that under the terms of the world heritage convention management and sovereignty over the sites remain with the country where the site is located supporters of the world heritage system note that member countries nominate sites for the world heritage list voluntarily and agree to develop laws and procedures to protect them using their own constitutional procedures most of the us sites named have already been accorded protection in law as national monuments or parks in commenting on the bill the clinton administration stated that the designation does not give the united nations the authority to affect land management decisions within the united states and has not been utilized to exclude congress from land management decisions the department of state noted that the convention itself has role or authority beyond listing sites and offering technical advice and assistance supporters of the convention assert that world heritage status has been the impetus behind closer cooperation between federal agencies and state and local authorities impact of placement on the world heritage list inclusion on the world heritage list increases knowledge and interest in sites throughout the world many count ries use the world heritage designation to increase tourism to site areas designation also brings international attention and support to protect endangered sites in 1993 the world heritage committee supported the united states in protecting glacier bay national park and preserve by publicizing us concerns about canadian open pit mine near the bay and reminding the canadian government of its obligations under the convention to protect the site in 1996 international concern including concern raised by us citizens was instrumental in changing the plans of polish company to build shopping center near auschwitz concentration camp in poland world heritage site in march of 2000 mexico dropped plans to develop salt plant on the shores of gray whale breeding ground in protected mexican area designated as world heritage site supporters of legislation restricting us world heritage participation express concern about the impact of the designation on private property near the sites they suggest that agreeing to manage the site in accordance with the international convention may have an impact on the use of private land nearby or may even be an indirect way of complying with treaties which the congress has not approved they claim that advocacy groups use federal regulations and international land use designations to frustrate the public land management decisionmaking process the interior department has testifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96395crs5 on the other hand that the nomination procedure includes open public meetings and congressional notification on sites being considered yellowstone national park in june 1995 the us department of the interior notified the world heritage committee that yellowstone was in danger and requested an onsite visit in follow up letter the department of the interior noted actions which the united states was taking to address the situation team organized by the world heritage center reviewed actual and potential threats to the park in december 1995 based on this visit and consultations with us government officials the world heritage committee placed yellowstone on the list of world heritage in danger citing threats posed by plans for gold mine just over 1 mile from the park the introduction of nonnative fish into yellowstone lake and activities to eliminate brucellosis from park bison herds the world heritage committee noted that any response to the threat was us domes tic decision and asked that the us government keep the committee informed of actions taken by the united states and to assess what more must be done in order to remove yellowstone from the endangered list both the non native fish and the park bison herds are the subject of ongoing federal state and local discussions the gold mine issue has been resolved congress appropriated funds to compensate the mine owners for not developing it the nonnative fish problem is ultimately unresolvable but park authorities are working to minimize the number of non native fish in yellowstone lake the administration will continue to report annually to the world heritage committee on both yellowstone and everglades national parks until they are removed from the endangered list the world heritage committee will continue to list both parks on the world heritage in danger list in consultation with the united states the december meeting of the world heritage committee will be the next opportunity for the united states to report on actions taken to eliminate the danger to the parks or to discuss changes to their designation it is too early to know what the bush administration position will be on this topic
