st090002 working draft i u introduction background ufouo on 4 october 2001 president george w bush issued memorandum entitled authorization for specified electronic surveillance activities during limited period to detect and prevent acts of terrorism within the united states the memorandum was based on the presidents determination that after the 11 september 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states an extraordinary emergency existed for national defense purposes tssiornf the 4 october 2001 presidential authorization delegated authority to the secretary of defense who further delegated it to the director of national security agencychief central security service dirns achcssj to conduct specified electronic surveillance on targets related to afghanistan and international terrorism for 30 days because the surveillance included wire and cable communications carried into or out of the united states it would otherwise have required fisc authority tssiornf the authorization specified that nsa could acquire the content and associated metadata of telephony and internet communications for which there was probable cause to believe that one of the communicants was in afghanistan or that one communicant was engaged in or preparing for acts of international terrorism in addition nsa was authorized to acquire telephony and internet metadata1 for communications with at least one communicant outside the united states or for which communicant was known to be citizen of the united states nsa was also allowed to retain process analyze and disseminate intelligence from the communications acquired under the authority 2 u this report ufouo this report provides the classified results of the nsa office of the inspector general oig review of the

surveillance program terminology ufouo for purposes of this report the psp or the program refers to nsa activities conducted under the authority of the 4 october 2001 memorandum and subsequent renewals hereafter known as the authorization as mandated by the faa this review includes activities authorized by the president between 11 september 2001 and 17 january 2007 and those activities continued under fisc authority this includes the program described by the president in 17 december 2005 radio address as the terrorist surveillance program which was content collected under the authorization top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn 2 top secrets tl wcomintor co nnoforn working draft ii review categories u one establishment of the authority ufouo immediately after the attacks of 11 september 2001 nsa considered how to work within existing sigint authorities to counter the terrorist threat within the united states and adjusted sigint processes accordingly shortly thereafter in response to white house request the director of nsa identified sigint collection gaps the counsel to the vice president used this information to draft the presidential authorization that established the psp u actions taken after 911 tssinf on 14 september 2001 three days after terrorist attacks in the united states general hayden approved the targeting of terrorist associated foreign telephone numbers on communication links between the united states and foreign countries where terrorists were known to be operating only specified preapproved numbers were allowed to be tasked for collection against usoriginating links he authorized this collection at special collection service and foreign satellite sites with access to links between the united states and countries of interest including afghanistan according to the deputy general counsel general hayden determined by 26 september that any afghan telephone number in contact with us telephone number on or after 26 september was presumed to be of foreign intelligence value and could be disseminated to the fbi tssinf nsa ogc said general haydens action was lawful exercise of his power under executive order eo 12333 united states intelligence activities as amended the targeting of communication links with one end in the united states was more aggressive use of eo 12333 authority than that exercised by former directors general hayden was operating in unique environment in which it was widely held belief that additional terrorist attacks on us soil were imminent general hayden said this was tactical decision top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn 3 top secrets tl wcomintor co nnoforn st090002 working draft ufouo on 2 october 2001 general hayden briefed the house permanent select committee on intelligence hpsci on this decision and later informed members of the senate select committee on intelligence ssci by telephone he had also informed dci george tenet ts at the same time nsa was assessing collection gaps and increasing efforts against terrorist targets immediately after the 11 september attacks it was responding to department of defense dod director of central intelligence community management staff questions about its ability to counter the new threat u need to expand nsa authority ufouo general hayden said that soon after he told mr tenet about nsa actions to counter the threat mr tenet shared the information with the oval office mr tenet relayed that the vice president wanted to know if nsa could be doing more general hayden replied that nothing else could be done within existing nsa authorities in followup telephone conversation mr tenet asked general hayden what could be done if he had additional authorities general hayden said that these discussions were not documented ufouo nsa identifies sigint collection gaps tssinf to respond to the vice president general hayden met with nsa personnel who were already working to identify and fill sigint collection gaps in light of the recent terrorist attacks general hayden stated that he met with personnel to identify which additional authorities would be operationally useful and technically feasible in particular discussions focused on how nsa might bridge the international gap an nsa technical director described that gap in these terms here is nsa standing at the us border looking outwardfor foreign threats there is the fbi looking within the united states for domestic threats but one was looking at the foreign threats coming into the united states that was huge gap that nsa wanted to cover tssinf possible solutions among other things nsa considered how to tweak transit collectionthe collection of communications transiting through but not originating or terminating in the united states nsa personnel also resurfaced concept proposed in 1999 to address the top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn 4 top secrets tl wcomintor co nnoforn working draft millennium threat nsa proposed that it would perform contact chaining on metadata it had collected analysts would chain through masked us telephone numbers to discover foreign connections to those numbers without specifying even for analysts the us number involved in december 1999 the department of justice doj office of intelligence policy review oipr told nsa that the proposal fell within one of the fisa definitions of electronic surveillance and therefore was not permissible when applied to metadata associated with presumed us persons ie us telephone numbers not approved for targeting by the fisc tssinf collection gaps not adequately filled by fisa authorized intercept nsa determined that fisa authorization did not allow sufficient flexibility to counter the new terrorist threat first it believed that because of technological advances the jurisdiction of the fisc went beyond the original intent of the statute for example most communications signals longer flowed through radio signals signals or via phone systems as they did in 1978 when the fisa was written by 2001 internet communications were used worldwide undersea cables carried huge volumes of communications and large amount of the worlds communications passed through the united states because of language used in the act in 1978 nsa was required to obtain court orders to target email accounts used by nonus persons outside the united states if it intended to intercept the communications at webmail service within the united states large numbers of terrorists were using such accounts in 2001 tssinf second nsa believed that the fisa process was unable to accommodate the number of terrorist targets or the speed with which they changed their communications from the time nsa sent fisa requests to the doj oipr until the time data arrived at nsa the average wait was between four and six weeks terrorists could have changed their telephone numbers or internet addresses before nsa received fisc approval to target them nsa believed the large number of terrorist targets and their frequently changing communications would have overwhelmed the existing fisa process tssinf emergency fisa provision not an option nsa determined that even using emergency fisa court orders would not provide the speed and flexibility needed to counter the terrorist threat first although the emergency authorization provision permitted 72 hours of surveillance without obtaining court order it did notas many believedallow the government to undertake surveillance immediately rather the attorney general had to ensure that emergency surveillance would ultimately be acceptable to the fisc he had to be certain the court top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn 5 top secrets tl wcomintor co nnoforn st090002 working draft would grant warrant before initiating emergency surveillance additionally before nsa surveillance requests were submitted to the attorney general they had to be reviewed by nsa intelligence officers nsa attorneys and department of justice attorneys each reviewer had to be satisfied that standards had been met before the request proceeded to the next review group and each request was certified by senior official in the dod usually the secretaiy or deputy secretaiy from the time nsa sent request to justices oipr until the time data arrived at nsa the average wait was between day and day and half in the existing threat environment with us interests at risk nsa deemed the wait too long ufouo early efforts to amend fisa tssinf given the limitations of fisa there were early efforts to amend the statute for example shortly after 11 september the hpsci asked nsa for technical assistance in drafting proposal to amend section iii of fisa that would give the president the authority to conduct electronic surveillances without court order for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information on 20 september 2001 the nsa general counsel wrote to judge alberto gonzales counsel to the president asking whether the proposal had merit we found record of response ufouo we could not determine why early efforts to amend fisa were abandoned anecdotal evidence suggests that government officials feared the public debate surrounding any changes to fisa would compromise intelligence sources and methods u nsa identifies sigint collection gaps to vice presidents office tssinf because early discussions about expanding nsas authority were not documented we do not have records of specific topics discussed or people who attended general haydens meetings with white house representatives general hayden stated that after consulting with nsa personnel he described to the white house how nsa collection of communications on wire inside the united states was constrained by the fisa statute specifically nsa could not collect from wire in the united top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn 6 top secrets tl wcomintor co nnoforn working draft states without court order either content or metadata from communications links with either one or both ends in the united states furthermore general hayden pointed out that communications metadata did not have the same level of constitutional protection as content and that access to metadata of communications with one end in the united states would significantly enhance nsas analytic capabilities general hayden suggested that the ability to collect communications with one end in the united states without court order would increase nsas speed and agility general hayden stated that after two additional meetings with the vice president the vice president asked him to work with his counsel david addington u presidential authorization drafted and signed tssiornf according to general hayden the vice presidents counsel david addington drafted the first authorization general hayden described himself as the subject matter expert but stated that other nsa personnel participated in the drafting process including the general counsel he also said that department of justice doj representatives were not involved in any of the discussions that he attended and he did not otherwise inform them tssinf general hayden said he was surprised with smalls when the authorization was signed on 4 october 2001 and that it only changed the location from which nsa could collect communications rules for minimizing us person information still had to be followed ufouo sigint activity authorized by the president tssiornf on 4 october 2001 the president delegated authority through the secretary of defense to the director of nsa to conduct specified electronic surveillance on targets related to afghanistan and international terrorism for 30 days because the surveillance included wire and cable communications carried into or out of the united states it would otherwise have required fisc authority tssistlwnf the authorization allowed nsa to conduct four types of collection activity k telephony content internet content top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn 7 top secretstl wcomintorconnoforn st090002 working draft 0 telephony metadata internet metadata tssinf nsa could collect the content and associated metadata of telephony and internet communications for which there was probable cause to believe that one of the communicants was in afghanistan or that one communicant was engaged in or preparing for acts of international terrorism in addition nsa was authorized to acquire telephony and internet metadata for communications with at least one communicant outside the united states or for which communicant was known to be citizen of the united states nsa was also allowed to retain process analyze and disseminate intelligence from the communications acquired under the authority ufouo subsequent changes to the authorization tssinf after the first presidential authorization the specific terms wording or interpretation of the renewals periodically changed see appendix b for completed listing of changes tssinf domestic collection the wording of the first authorization could have been interpreted to allow domestic content collection where both communicants were located in the us or were us persons general hayden recalled that when the counsel to the vice president pointed this out general hayden told him that nsa would not collect domestic communications because 1 nsa was foreign intelligence agency 2 nsa infrastructure did not support domestic collection and 3 his personal standard was so high that there would be problem getting fisc order for domestic collection tssinf afghanistan in january 2002 after the taliban was forced out of power afghanistan was longer specifically identified in the authorization tssinf iraqi intelligence service for limited period of time surrounding the 2003 invasion of iraq the president authorized the use of psp authority against the iraqi intelligence service on 28 march 2003 the dci determined that based on then current intelligence the iraqi intelligence service was engaged in terrorist activities and presented threat to us interests in the united states and abroad through the deputy dci mr tenet received the presidents concurrence that psp authorities could be used against the iraqi intelligence service nsa ceased using the authority for this purpose in march 2004 top secretstlwcomintorconnoforn 8 top secrets tl wcomintor co nnoforn working draft u two implementation of the authority and resulting sigint product tssinf general hayden said that although he felt comfortable exercising the presidential authorization and believed it to be legal he recognized that it was politically sensitive and controversial and would be subjected to scrutiny at some point in time he and nsa leadership strove to ensure that nsa personnel executed the terms of the authorization with care and diligence and that they not go beyond that which was authorized psprelated operations began on 6 october early on personnel worked under the assumption that the authorization was temporary and that operations would stop in the near future after it became evident that the authority would be continuously renewed management focused on designing processes and procedures for program activity ufouo stand up of operations tssinf on 4 october 2001 after receiving the authorization general hayden informed the sigint director and other key personnel of nsas new authorities and asked the nsa general counsel if the authorization was legal the general counsel said that the next day 5 october he told general hayden that he believed it was legal see appendix d tssiocnf under general haydens

saturday and sunday 6 and 7 october small groups of operational personnel were called at home and asked to report to work for special psp clearance briefings tssiornf on monday 8 october 2001 columbus day general hayden briefed the analysts programmers and mathematicians that had been selected to implement the authorization at that briefing general hayden said he did not share the specific content of the authorization with attendees but relayed key information such as w the authorization came from the president w the authorization was temporary x the authorization was intended to be an early warning system of impending terrorist attacks in the united states 0 the nsa general counsel had reviewed the authorization and concluded that it was legal 0 nsa would do exactly what the authorization stated and not one electron or photon more the authorization should be kept secret and it required strict compartmentation attendees had to sign nondisclosure agreement tssinf general

were cleared for access to the psp on 11 october 2001 the associate general counsel for operations and the nsa deputy general counsel were cleared for the program and agreed with the nsa general counsels determination that the authorization was legal nsa ogc did not formally document its opinions or legal rationale see appendix d tssistlwnf the mac was created to analyze metadata obtained under psp authorization by 7 october 2001 it was 24hour 7day week watch center with 20 analysts reporters and software developers working in three shifts many mac employees were former russian traffic analysts with manual call chaining analysis experience initially the mac reported directly to general hayden and the deputy director the mac chief briefed the director eveiy week and the deputy director visited mac spaces for briefing each evening tssinf while the mac was setting up to analyze psp metadata the counterterrorism ct product line was realigning to conduct psp content tasking and analysis the mac and the ct product line worked closely together to coordinate efforts and share information the ct product line was growing rapidly as handpicked employees were moved to support the new mission tssinf within 30 days the psp was fully operational while awaiting delivery of requested computer servers the fbi and cia gave nsa lead telephone numbers and the mac was able to immediately chain within the united states with sigint collected overseas private sector partners began to send telephony and internet content to nsa in october 2001 they began to send telephony and internet metadata to nsa as early as november 2001 ufouo ongoing operations tssinf after operations began and it became evident that the authorization was likely to be renewed indefinitely nsa management became increasingly focused on designing processes and procedures to implement the program effectively and to ensure compliance with the authorization top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn 11 top secretstl wcomintorconnoforn st090002 working draft u organizational structure tssinf nsa conducted all psp analysis and reporting at its headquarters at ft meade maiyland within the sigint

acquisition psp activities were managed at nsa field sites oig will insert high level sid org chart from 2001 here tssinf although the formal chain of command for sigint operations was through sid in practice the director and deputy director of nsacss managed the program while keeping the sigint director informed over time the sigint director became more involved but the director and deputy director always maintained direct operational control tssinf program manager five officials held the program manager position over the life of the psp5 initially the program manager reported to the chief of the ct product line in 2004 the program manager position was restructured as the sid program manager for ct special projects and elevated to report to the sigint director this allowed the program manager jurisdiction of psp elements across sid not just those within the directorate for analysis and production at that time the position was also formally designated as senior level civilian position small staff was added to form the program management office tssinf sid analysis and production initially the mac analyzed psp metadata data that describes the content events or networks associated with sigint targets while sigint development in the ct product line analyzed nonpsp metadata the ct product line performed psp content analysis sigint development separate organization within the sid managed approvals for content tasking in 2004 the analysis and production of metadata and content were consolidated into new organization called the advanced analysis division aad aad was divided into three teams internet metadata telephony metadata and content tssinf coordination with fbi and cia by 2004 four fbi integrees and two cia integrees operating under

numbers and email selectors on pspauthorized collection by private sector companies and taking them off collection u metadata tssinf the authority to collect bulk telephony and internet metadata significantly enhanced nsas ability to identify activity that may have been terroristrelated contact chaining is the process of building network graph that models the communication email telephony etc patterns of targeted entities people organizations etc and their associates from the communications sent or received by the targets6 metadata is data that describes other data specifically information that describes the content events or networks associated with sigint targets for example for an email message it would include the sender and recipient email addresses it does not contain the subject line or the text of the email they are considered to be content likewise for telephone conversation metadata would include the called number and the calling number as well as the duration of the call tssinf although nsa had the capability to collect bulk telephony and internet metadata prior to the psp its application was limited because nsa did not have the authority to collect communications in which one end the number being called or the recipient address of an email was in the united states psp significantly increased the data available to nsa analysts and allowed them to create more thorough contact chaining this gave nsa the key to an early warning systemthe ability to identify individuals in the united states or individuals outside the us using us telecommunications structures in contact with foreign target terrorist tssinf because metadata was not constitutionally protected nsa did not consider it to be as sensitive as content collection nevertheless processes were set up to document requests for metadata analysis and justifications for conducting such analysis under program authority the 6 tssiocnf additional chaining can be performed on the associates contacts to determine patterns in the way network of targets may communicate additional degrees of separation from the initial target are referred to as hops for example direct contact is one hop away from the target contact of the direct contact would be described as being 2 hops away from the target the resulting contactgraph is subsequently analyzed for intelligence and to develop potential investigative leads top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn 13 top secrets tl wcomintor co nnoforn st090002 working draft following describes the process used to obtain requests conduct analysis and report results under the psp see appendix for flowchart of the endtoend process tssinf requests for information and leads contact chaining analysis requests were received from fbi cia or nsa requests typically took one of two forms requests for information rfi and leads rfis were specific questions about targets telephone numbers or email addresses called selectors at nsa leads were more general requests about targets contacts requestors submitted leads to discover new investigative leads contact chaining requests were documented from the inception of the psp tssiocnf approvals to chain prior to chaining nsa counterterrorism shift coordinators reviewed chaining requests to determine whether they met criteria provided by the ogc and based on the terms of the authorization they had to have enough information to identify terrorism nexus and demonstrate compliance with criteria required by the authorization before analysis could begin shift coordinators either approved requests approved them for 1hop direct contact analysis or denied them approved requests were passed to analysts for contact chaining tssiocnf analysis nsa used variety of tools to conduct metadata analysis and view the results nsas primary tool for conducting metadata analysis for psp and traditional sigint collection was mainway mainway was used for storage contact chaining and for analyzing large volumes of global communications metadata at the beginning of the psp only the sigint navigator tool was available to view mainway output over time new tools and new processes such as automated chaining alerting were created to improve analysts efficiency to obtain the most complete results analysts used data collected under psp and nonpsp authorities typically they analyzed networks with two degrees of separation two hops from the target analysts determined if resulting information was reportable tssiocnf in addition an automated chaining alert process was created to alert analysts of new potentially reportable selectors previously approved selectors were compared to incoming mainway data authorized by the psp eo 12333 or the fisc alerts of direct contacts with approved selectors were reported to nsa analysts for further analysis and potential reporting to fbi and cia top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn 14 top secrets tl wcomintor co nnoforn working draft tssinf storage nsa stored metadata obtained under psp authorities in protected database only cleared and trained analysts were given access to psp metadata tssiocnf reporting reports based on metadata analysis were typically referred to as tippers tippers contained contact chaining analysis results relevant to terrorism or with potential links to terrorism that warranted the attention of the fbi or the cia for further investigation before releasing reports with us person information analysts obtained permission to do so in accordance with established nsa dissemination procedures tssiocnf for each published report nsa retained documentation of the analysis supporting rfi or lead information and justification statement explaining the link to terrorism if report was not published documentation was not retained counterterrorism personnel manually updated information in computer tracking system to reflect the disposition of chaining requests u content tssinf collection and analysis of content is nsas traditional wav of reporting means of conducting sigint content generally refers to words spoken during telephone conversation or the written text of an email message nsa collection of the content of telephony and internet communications under the psp improved its ability to produce intelligence on terroristrelated activity for example by allowing nsa access to links carrying communications with one end in the united states nsa significantly increased its access to transiting foreign communications ie with both communicants outside the united states general hayden described this as the real gold of the program and by allowing the intercept of international communications nsa was able to identify threats within the united states tssinf from the start of the program until january 2007 nsa issued 490 reports based on pspderived content information also as shown below approximately 37664 telephony and internet selectors were tasked for pspauthorized content collection during that time period only 8 percent were us targets the vast majority 92 percent were foreign tssiocnf top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn 15 top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn st090002 working draft approximate

sensitive as such processes were set up to ensure strict compliance with the terms of the authorization the following describes the general process for tasking collecting storing and reporting telephony and internet content under the psp see appendix f for flowchart of the endtoend process tssistlwnf tasking approvals under the psp each domestic selector tasked for content collection was formally approved and tracked analysts submitted content collection requests also called tasking packages to the chief of ct for approval tasking packages contained narrative analysis conclusion supporting information documentation and checklist of package contents in the chiefs absence the deputy chief of ct or the program manager could approve the requests the approving officials reviewed the tasking packages to ensure that the proposed target and related metadata selectors met criteria in the authorization if criteria were not met the officials requested additional information or denied the request in limited cases collection was approved for specific time periods if the content contained foreign intelligence the time period for collection would be extended if it did not collection was stopped all approvals were documented in tasking packages tssiocnf top secretstl wcomintorconnoforn 16 top secrets tl wcomintor co nnoforn working draft tssinf foreign selectors tasked for psp content collection did not require formal approvals or tasking packages analysts were responsible for determining whether foreign selector met the criteria for foreign intelligence terms of the authorization tssinf collection after domestic selector was approved for psp content collection it was identified as tasked in the stellarwind addresses database by ctaad tasking managers who then emailed collection tasking request to the sso collection manager for telephony and internet content collection foreign selector content collection requests were sent directly to the sso collection manager they did not require special approval tssistlwnf sso collection managers were responsible for ensuring that telephony and internet content selectors were put on or taken off collection for telephony telephony content selectors collection managers sent content collection tasking instructions to private sector companies private sector companies were responsible for implementing tasking at frontend devices to obtain the required content collection for internet content selectors collection managers sent content tasking instructions directly to equipment installed at companycontrolled locations collected data was sent back to nsasso and made available to analysts through the hybrid voice processing system for telephony content selectors or the pinwale database for internet content

sometimes called tippers or snippets were hidden in plain sight meaning the information in the report did not reveal the source of the information later fbi and cia wanted to understand how nsa knew certain information that could not be provided in normal reporting channels eventually tear line reporting was established tear lines are used regularly by nsa as way to report sigintderived

matter justify search of nsa files and submit search request in response to those requests or in response to discovery orders nsa conducts search of its databases to locate records that may fall within the scope of dojs discovery obligations and rule 16 of the federal rules of criminal procedure typically the search process begins with written request from doj including the names and aliases of individuals nsa attorneys work with personnel trained in the retrieval of nsa reports to craft search strategies reasonably designed to identify reporting that may be responsive to the request these search strategies are then used to perform electronic searches of nsa repositories of disseminated foreign intelligence reports all responsive reports to the extent any exist are made available

leadership including ogc lawyers and the ig interpreted the terms of the authorization to allow nsa to obtain bulk internet metadata for analysis because nsa did not actually acquire communications

ogc the transition of psp content collection to fisc orders was driven by doj doj had contemplated transition in july 2004 when the fiscs signing of the prtt order indicated its willingness to authorize psp activities under court order given this precedent doj concluded the fisc might also accept content collection however little progress was made until june 2005 when the doj oipr with nsa ogc and sid representatives began researching the feasibility of collecting psp content under court order in essence doj and nsa needed to find legal theoiy that would allow nsa to add and drop thousands of foreign targets for content collection because the law was more restrictive for content than metadata nsa had serious reservations about whether it would be possible to find workable solution using fisc order at that time especially given the large number of selectors to be tasked and the complexity from legal and operational perspectives for example tsstlwsiornf in addition to the telephony metdata that nsa was receiving from private sector companies as business records it was also obtaining live telephony metadata from its own sigint collection sources it continued until mid2005 we will include reference to the corresponding notification here top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn 40 top secrets tl wcomintor co nnoforn working draft 0 tssinf nsa risked losing flexibility in the means of collection given that facilities and collection accesses were complex and in constant flux 0 tssinf in executing the prtt and business records orders the fiscs and dojs consistently increasing demands for information took nsa analysts away from targetrelated duties tssinf the process imposed by the fisa statute was not able to handle the large volume of nsa requests for fisc authorization needed after 11 september 2001 0 tssinf because olcs may 2004 opinion found that the existing authorization for content collection was lawful there was pressing need to find an alternative legal vehicle tssinf in letter dated 21 februaiy 2006 the nsa gc expressed the aforementioned concerns among others to the acting assistant attorney general suggesting that now might be the right time to seek substantial revisions to the fisa the purpose of the legislation was to protect the privacy of us persons who could be subjected to surveillance either intentionally or incidentally twentyseven years later the united states government finds itself obtaining fisa orders so that it can carry out surveillance on foreign intelligence targets who are outside the united states and more often than not communicating only with others outside the united states this serves us persons privacy interests was never anticipated by the statutes drafters and diverts valuable resources from the fight against terrorism the fisa needs to be simplified and streamlined tssinf ultimately doj decided to pursue fisc order for content collection wherein the traditional fisa definition of facility as specific telephone number or email address was changed to encompass the gateway or cable head that foreign targets use for communications minimization and probable cause standards would then be applied as with the prtt and business records orders nsa collaborated with doj to prepare the application and declarations and provided the operational requirements needed to continue effective surveillance tssinf after 18 months of concerted effort and coordination the fisc ultimately accepted the theory for foreign selectors but rejected it for top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn 41 top secrets tl wcomintor co nnoforn st090002 working draft domestic selectors consequently on 10 januaiy 2007 the fisc signed two separate orders the foreign content order and the domestic content order tssinf the foreign content order negatively affected sigint exploitation most notably the number of foreign selectors on collection dropped by 73 percent from 11000 selectors under psp to 3000 under the order in addition the administrative workload for nsa analysts to put critical foreign selectors on collection was so burdensome that the order became operationally unsustainable the order was eventually superseded by congress fisa modernization it was temporarily replaced by the protect america act in august 2007 and then permanently replaced by the fisa amendments act in july 2008 tssinf the domestic content order did not create similar loss in collection because so few domestic numbers were tasked at that time it did however slow operations because of the documentation required and it took considerably longer to task under the order than under the psp over time the scope of the domestic content order gradually decreased to single selector tasked for collection in january 2009 in january 2009 the fbi at nsas request assumed responsibility for the domestic content order and became the declarant before the fisc top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn

learn of the psp and it continued to provide significant oversight over the life of the program the gc was briefed on 4 october 2001 the day the authorization was signed on 6 october he gave the director and deputy director talking points for briefing nsa personnel on the new authority the talking points included the fact that general hayden had instructed the gc and the lead attorney for operations to conduct routine review and oversight of psp activities ufouo the nsa assistant general counsel for operations provided most of the program oversight before the oig learned of the psp in 2002 he and his successors reviewed proposed target packages and rejected those not compliant with the authorization answered questions gave briefings reviewed program implementation and coordinated program related issues with doj u sigint directorate ufouo the sigint directorate office of oversight and compliance oc represents the director nsacss and the signals intelligence director in overseeing compliance with authorities that govern the collection production and dissemination of intelligence by the national security agency the chief of oc was briefed on the psp on 10 october 2001 initially ocs ability to provide effective oversight was limited by insufficient staffing and lack of methodologies to provide meaningful oversight of psp collection it therefore focused on identifying problem areas while documenting program activity it also helped establish database partitions and assisted with data flow compliance issues to prevent uncleared personnel from seeing

notifications on psp activities at nsa investigations were conducted in response to specific incidents or violations to determine the cause effect and remedy 0 reviews were conducted to determine the adequacy of management controls to ensure compliance with the authorization and related authorities to assess the efficiency and effectiveness in mitigating highrisk activities associated with the

not determine exact reasons for why the nsa ig was not cleared for the psp until august 2002 according to the nsa general counsel the president would not allow the ig to be briefed sooner general hayden did not specifically recall why the ig was not brought in earlier but thought that it had not been appropriate to do so when it was uncertain how long the program would last and before operations had stabilized the nsa ig pointed out that he did not take the ig position until april 2002 so nsa leadership or the white house may have been resistant to clearing either new or an acting ig tssinf regardless by august 2002 general hayden and the nsa general counsel wanted to institutionalize oversight of the program by bringing in the ig general hayden recalled having to make case to the white house to clear the ig at that time ufouo oig concerns lead to change c in addition to formal recommendations made in review and investigative reports oig concerns about access to the terms of the presidential authorization and about the means of reporting psp violations resulted in three major changes c first in december 2002 the ig recommended that general hayden formally delegate authority to nsa operational personnel some of whom had unknowingly violated terms of the authorization the counsel to the vice president demanding secrecy refused to let them see terms of the authority which had been delegated by the president to the secretary of defense who delegated it to the director of nsa general hayden issued the first delegation of authority letter to key operational personnel in the sid on 4 march 2003 subsequent delegation letters were issued each time the president renewed the authority top secrets tl wcomintor connoforn 45 top secrets tl wcomintor

incidents or violations that had not been reported to overseers as required because none had the clearance to see the report tssiocnf before march 2003 nsa quarterly reports on intelligence activities sent to the presidents intelligence oversight board through the assistant to the secretary of defense for intelligence oversight stated that the director was not aware of any unlawful surveillance activities by nsa other than that described in the report beginning in march 2003 at the igs direction nsa quarterly reports stated that except as disclosed to the president the director was not aware of any unlawful surveillance activities by nsa also beginning in march 2003 psp violations including those not previously reported to the intelligence oversight board were reported in presidential notifications ufouo third shortly after learning about the program the ig participated in september 2002 meeting of key cleared personnel at which important psp matters were discussed he recommended
