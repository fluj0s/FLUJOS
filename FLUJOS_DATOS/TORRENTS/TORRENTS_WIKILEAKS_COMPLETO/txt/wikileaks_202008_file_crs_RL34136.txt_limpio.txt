sidebyside comparison introduction with recent high energy prices concerns over energy security and the desire to reduce air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions there is ongoing congressional interest in promoting greater use of alternatives to petroleum fuels biofuels transportation fuels produced from plants and other organic materials have attracted particular interest ethanol and biodiesel the two most widely used biofuels receive significant federal support in the form of tax incentives loan and grant programs and regulatory programs1 on december 19 2007 president bush signed the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa pl 110140 hr 6 an earlier energy bill the energy policy act of 2005 epact 2005 pl 10958 established renewable fuel standard rfs under epact 2005 the rfs required an increasing use of renewable fuel in gasoline starting at 40 billion gallons in 2006 increasing to 75 billion gallons in 2012 although not an explicit ethanol mandate it was expected that the majority of this requirement would be met using cornbased ethanol2 about 40 billion gallons of corn ethanol were consumed in 2005 so the rfs in epact 2005 represented roughly doubling of us ethanol consumption over seven years however the us ethanol industry was expanding rapidly outpacing the required growth in the rfs as of january 14 2007 existing us production capacity was roughly 76 billion gallons per year with another 57 billion gallons of capacity under construction or in the planning stages because this capacity would outpace the rfs under epact some proponents of cornbased ethanol supported an increase in the mandated levels of the rfs because of the rapid expansion of us corn ethanol capacity there are concerns that the united states will soon reach the limit of ethanol that can be produced from corn critics of cornbased ethanol argue that the industry does not need continued government support and that current corn demand for ethanol is putting strain on corn and other grain markets leading to increases in other commodity prices such 1 for more information on federal biofuels incentives see crs report rl33572 biofuels incentives summary of federal programs by brent d yacobucci 2 for more information on ethanol see crs report rl33290 fuel ethanol background and public policy issues by brent d yacobucci crs2 as livestock feed which then leads to higher dairy and meat prices3 critics also argue that the environmental costs of cornbased ethanol may outweigh the benefits and that more emphasis should be placed on other strategies such as improved vehicle efficiency because of concerns over cornbased ethanol as well as interest in diversifying energy supply there is growing interest in developing biofuels that rely on other sources of biomass including agricultural wastes municipal solid waste and dedicated energy crops such as perennial grasses fastgrowing trees and algae this interest has led to proposals to support andor mandate biofuels produced from feedstocks other than corn starch through explicit requirements rd funding andor tax incentives4 noncorn biofuels include fuels produced from cellulosic material such as perennial grasses ethanol produced from sugarcane or beets and biodiesel or renewable diesel produced from vegetable or animal oils5 title ii of eisa requires dramatic expansion of the rfs under epact 2005 instead of the 54 billion gallons required in 2008 by epact eisa requires 90 billion gallons by 2022 eisa will require 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel in motor fuels annually compared to an estimated 86 billion gallons under epact of that 21 billion gallons must be advanced biofuel defined as biofuel produced from feedstocks other than corn starch and having 50 lower lifecycle emissions than petroleum fuels key elements of eisa and the house and senate energy bills this report provides sidebyside comparison of biofuelsrelated provisions in eisa and the house and senatepassed energy
