500000 troops and other personnel who serve in high risk pa rts of the world voluntary vaccination of up to 500000 civilian healthcare and public health workers probably would not begin until after january 24 2003 date set by s ection 4 of the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 the bush administration plan for civilian healthcare workers follows the october 17 2002 recommendations made by an advisory panel to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc on several smallpox vaccination implementation issues the panel advised immunizing two groups of civilians 1 public health response teams who would investigate initial smallpox cases and implement control measures and 2 healthcare teams composed of 50100 individuals at each of the 5100 acute care hos pitals in the united states who would care for smallpox patients smallpox vaccine has higher rate of serious complications than any other vaccine in current use when this vaccine was routinely given more than 30 years ago about 1000 persons per million vaccina ted for the first time experienced reactions that were serious but not life thr eatening such as acci dental inoculation in which the rash occurs elsewhere on the body from the vaccination site due to direct contact with vaccinia bli ndness may result if the rash velops near the eye about 14 to 52 people per million vaccinated for th first time developed potentially life threatening reactions one or two per million died as result of vaccination these more serious complications include 1 encephalitis which may be fatal or leave survivors with paralysis or other central ne rvous system symptoms 2 growth of the vaccination lesion without healing which occurs in immunocompromised individuals and is often fatal 3 passage of vaccinia to fetus which may lead to stillbirth and 4 development of vaccinial lesions over sites where there is or has been eczema which may be fatal because live vaccinia virus is used in the smallpox vaccine complications may occur in individuals w ho dont even receive the vaccine but are only exposed to someone who has recently been vaccinated the federal government is encouraging both academic scientists and companies to develop safer vaccine and antiviral treatments in the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 congre ss addresses the smallpox vaccine liability concerns of v accine manufacturers and health care workers by designating them to be federal em ployees for the purpose of administering smallpox vaccine the federal governme nt would assume liability for smallpox vaccinerelated injuries and deaths under th federal tort cla ims act which does not permit jury trials or punitiv damages if an individual injured by the smallpox vaccine were to file suit against the federal government that individual would be required to provide evidence of negligence however most vaccinerelated injuries are not the result of negligence it is exp ected that health care insurance and workers compensation programs

by the cdc in atlanta and laboratory near novosibirsk in russia there is some concern that samples of the virus may have been acqui red by terrorists or rogue governments particularly because of the unrest that occurred during the break up of the soviet union1 smallpox disease and sm allpox vaccination smallpox is transmitted via persontoperson contact or inhalation of saliva droplets from the breath of an infected person the incubati on period of 1214 days range 717 days is followed by the sudden onset of flulike symptoms after 23 days the distinctive rash begins to appear and it is this stage which lasts for 710 days that is most infectious as scabs begin to form infectivity rapidly declines about 65 to 80 of survivors have deep scars or pockmarks which tend to occur on the face the last recorded natural cas of smallpox occurred in somalia in 1977 fatal laboratoryacquired case occurred in england in 1978 the last us case was in 1949 after worldwide effort of or ganized vaccination smallpox was declared eradicated by the world health assembly in may 1980 smallpox vaccination is achieved via inoculation using live vaccinia virus pox virus that is closely related to variola virus vaccination is highly effective 95 of people who receive the vaccine before exposure to smallpox variola virus will be protected from developing the disease vaccination within 2 to 3 days after exposure to variola will prevent smallpox or significantly lessen the effects of the disease in most people vaccination 4 to 7 days after exposure to variola virus may offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease successful vaccination provides 3 to 5 years of protection from small pox partial protection is thought to continue for 10 or more years but the leng th of time and level of protection is uncertain rather than the typical hypodermic needle smallpox v accine is given using 2pronged bifurcated needle that is di pped into the vaccine solution the

successful reaction often referred to as take is often more evident in people who are vaccinated for the first time than in those who are revaccinated the side effects associated with use of smallpox vaccine are not insignificant less serious complications of vaccination include sore arm headache body ache fatigue rash and fever when this vacci ne was routinely given more than 30 years ago about

vaccinia to fetus which may lead tostillbirth eczema vaccinatum or development of vaccinial lesions over siteswhere there is or has been eczema which may be fatal because of the serious complications from the vaccine and since the risk of importation of smallpox case had been greatly reduced due to vaccination programs and quarantine regulation the us public health service recommended in 1971 that routine smallpox vaccination be discon tinued the us program stopped in 1972 smallpox vaccination has not been required for international travel since january 1982 and distribution of the vaccine to th general public stopped in 1983 routine smallpox vaccination of us health car workers was discontinued in 1976 military recruits stopped receiving the vaccine in 1990 an unfortunate side effect of the erad ication of smallpox widely acclaimed as major public health triumph is that the us population and the rest of the world are vulnerable to biologic weapon attack using variola virus in past natural outbreaks smallpox killed 30 of thos who had immunity approximately 119 million us residents born after 1972 lack immunity the immunity of the 157 million us residents born before 1972 has

attack the case for mass vaccination proceedings of the national acade my of sciences early edition july 8 2002 httpwwwpnasorg in the past naturally occurring outbr eaks of smallpox have been controlled using ring vaccination all the patients contacts are tracked down vaccinated and quarantined until the disease spread is stopped such strategy is logical if there is limited vaccine or significan t level of smallpox immun ity in the population or if society wishes to limit the number of adverse events and fatalities caused by mass smallpox vaccination however in modern society with low levels of smallpox immunity mass transit and rapid forms of long distance travel ring vaccination may not be feasible especially if the attack occurs in many sites and infects large number of people at each site moreover our so cial and economic system may be greatly stressed by the necessary imp lementation of quarantine18 some experts also question whether the existing public health system can actually implement nationwide smallpox vaccination program quickly enoug h under bioterrorist attack situation19 researchers are using mathematical models of disease transmission to determine the outcome of smallpox attack under ra nge of different conditions such as the number of initial infections the transmissi on rate number of secondary cases caused by each initial case the number of vaccinato rs and whether ring or mass vaccination is used to control the outbreak the m odels are still under velopment and provide contradictory results for example m odel developed by re searchers at emory university found that ring vaccination ev when its started only after the 25th case of smallpox can contain an epidemic lmost as well as mass vaccination provided that at least 80 of those ex posed can be found and vaccinated20 in contrast model deve loped at yale university found that mass vaccination results in far fewer deaths and much faster epidemic eradication21 the yale model predicts that in smallpox attack on large city causing 1000 initial cases ring vaccination results in 367000 cases and 110000 deaths over 350 days but mass vaccination following an attack results in 1830 cases and 560 deaths over 115 days however if 40 of the population is vaccina ted prior to attack the number of deaths would be reduced to 40000 if ring vaccina tion is used following 1000case attack but lowered even further to 440 deaths if mass vaccination is used after the attack the yale group concludes that unless pr eattack vaccination is used serious consideration should be given to repl acing the existing cdc policy with mass vaccination in the event of smallpox attack in large urban center traditional methods like ring vaccination are based on the fact that smallpox

that aerosolized smallpox virus would be quickly inactivated by envi ronmental factors such as uv radiation from the sun however the authors of the report believe the best explanation for the outbreak is that the initial case technician on research vessel acquired smallpox when her boat entered wate rs 9 miles downwind from soviet bioweapons test site located on vozrozhdeniye island in the aral sea because an aerosol of smallpox virus would have the potential to infect much larger number of people than person toperson contact this report is of concern to public health experts although the 119 million unvaccinated people in the us could face mortality rate of about 30 in smallpox attac k there is some question over the level of protection remaining in the 157 million indi viduals who were vaccinated more than 30 years ago complete protection from small pox disease begins to taper off 3 to 5 years after vaccination however some hi storical data indi cate that vaccinated individuals may experience milder disease symptoms and lower mortality rate 5 instead of 30 even up to 50 years postvaccination23 additional studies would be needed to confirm this point but if correct smallpox attack might not be as deadly or spread as rapidly as some experts had thought it might also influence decisions on who in the us population should be th first to r eceive vaccines if smallpox attack
