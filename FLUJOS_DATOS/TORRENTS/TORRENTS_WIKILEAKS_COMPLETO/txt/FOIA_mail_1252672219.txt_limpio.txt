what aspects of idag youd like to discuss with best regards ben claudia tebaldi wrote hi again im attaching the current version after some remassaging especially of the task list there is need for reference that i would like to get from david karoly and general request for input having to do with the synthesis products that originally were described as instrumental to ar5 but gabi thinks they would not be prepared in time for that so im wondering if people have specific ideas for the next round of review papers that we could describe at the end of section 3 of the document most importantly i need some very specific input from all of you only exception franciss group after asking anjuli i can confirm that government employees cannot receive funding besides travel reimbursement so for those of you that are government employees the only thing that remains to do is to go through the document once again make sure your work past and future is not misrepresented and then send note with an ok or your new comments specifying that you are government employee please dont let guess it for those of you that are academics with 12 months salary all that we can budget is small amount of consulting fees up to 2 weeks worth if you belong to this category please respond saying that you are or you are not interested if you are then include in the document at the end in the place already arranged for it statement of work referring to specific tasks as they stand in section 3 of the narrative and biosketch see end of this email for specific instructions for those of you that can get full support please say if you want it or not and if you do then do as i requested above include in the document at the end in the place already arranged for it statement of work referring to specific tasks as they stand in section 3 of the narrative and biosketch see end of this email for specific instructions please shoot an email and say something esp those of you abroad for whom im not familiar
