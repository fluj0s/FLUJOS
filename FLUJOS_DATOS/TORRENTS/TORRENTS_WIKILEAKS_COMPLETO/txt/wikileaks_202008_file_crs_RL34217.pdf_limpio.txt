the programs 432 million enrollees approximately 85 are aged and the remaining 15 are disabled 5 in 2006 spending on medicare services accounted for an estimated 58 of total federal health expenditures and 20 of all national health expenditures6 the majority of medicare spending nearly 75 is for benefits provided by parts and b the feeforservice portion of the program otherwise known as original or traditional medicare the remaining 25 is spent on private health care plans that deliver medicare services to beneficiaries under part c the medicare advantage ma program and part d the new prescription drug benefit medicare consists of four distinct parts parts b c and d medicare part hospital insurance covers inpatient hospital services skilled nursing facility services home health and hospice services medicare part b supplementary medical insurance covers variety of other medical services such as physician services outpatient hospital care laboratory services and durable medical equipment beneficiaries also have the option to enroll in private medicare part c or ma plan to receive all required part and b benefits and private medicare part d or prescription drug plan pdp for prescription drug benefits most beneficiaries who opt to enroll in private plan choose mapd medicare advantage prescription drug plan for combined part c and d coverage approximately 80 of beneficiaries receive services through the feefor service portion of the program original medicare and 20 of medicare beneficiaries receive services through private part c ma plan medicare pays for services in parts and b or traditional medicare differently than it does for services under parts c and d under the traditional feeforservice program medicare pays providers directly for each specified unit of service delivered to beneficiary the unit of service may be single procedure visit or test or group of services such as hospital stay in contrast for parts c and d medicare pays private health plans to deliver medicare services to beneficiaries in addition unlike part and b medicare providers private plans participating in medicare are paid on capitated basis as opposed to feeforservice basis under capitation private plans receive fixed monthly payment per enrollee regardless of the amount of services provided payment is made in advance for predetermined set of benefits either part and b benefits administered by part c plan or prescr iption drug benefits administered by part d pdp plan 5 the disabled population includes persons under age 65 who receive cash

health plans and providers these conflicting incentives result in different forms of fraud and abuse unique to each payment system under feeforservice providers may have an incentive to overutilize health care services or provide more care to beneficiaries in order to maximize reimbursement the more services providers deliver the more money they receive the opposite is true in capitated payment systems under capitation where the payment is fixed monthly amount per enrollee providers may have an incentive to limit health services or provide less health care to beneficiaries providers reimbursement amount does not vary with the number of services delivered medicare is administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms within the department of health and human services dhhs cms contracts with more than 40 private entities to oversee daytoday operations and conduct program integrity activities for medicare parts b c and d each year medicare contractors process nearly 1 billion claims from over 1 million providers enrolled in the medicare program in addition to processing and paying claims contractors perform certain program integrity functions contractor activities are overseen by two departments within cms the program integrity group and the center for beneficiary choices the program integrity group is responsible for oversight related to parts and b the center for beneficiary choices is responsible for oversight activities related to part cthe ma program both departments share oversight responsibility for part d

it is considered an essential component of the efficient and effective administration of government programs and integral to accomplishing programs social goals in medicare one of these social goals is to ensure access to highquality care for all beneficiaries to meet this objective medicare implements activities designed to ensure that correct payments are made to legitimate providers for appropriate and reasonable services for eligible beneficiaries on practical level program integrity activities are those directed at protecting the program from payment errors fraud and abuse broadly defined medicare program integrity functions encompass two types of activities designed to safeguard program payments 1 activities directed at reducing payment errors or improper payments and 2 activities directed at protecting the medicare program from fraud waste and abuse the first set of activities emphasizes prevention and relies largely on automated processes to detect improper or potentially fraudulent claims before they are paid the second set of activities emphasizes the identification and detection of health care fraud through the analysis of claims after they have been paid an effective program integrity strategy incorporates elements from both approaches to protect the medicare trust fund from improper payments cms contracts with private organizations that review claims to determine whether the services provided are medically reasonable and necessary although program integrity activities directed at reducing improper payments will identify some instances of fraud they are not specifically designed to do so in medicare improper payments are largely the result of mistakes or inadvertent billing errors on the part of medicare providers submitting claims or medicare contractors processing claims httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34217g15g142g141g146g140g138g155g142g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561g11g151g157g142g144g155g146g157g162g561 g561

program7 in november 2007 cms reported national paid claims error rate of 39 which amounted to approximately 108 billion in expenditures8 to protect the medicare trust fund from fraud and abuse cms contracts with private organizations to conduct program integrity activities directed at identifying and detecting actual fraud cms typically classifies these activities as benefit integrity activities examples of benefit integrity methods may include performing ongoing data analysis of claims to identify aberrant billing patterns developing fraud investigations and referring suspected cases of fraud to law enforcement personnel for prosecution although law enforcement personnel may point to deterrent effect associated with these types of activities their focus is not on preventing fraud their focus is on tracking down offenders and recovering improper payments after fraud has been committed although there is certain level of overlap program integrity approaches to address fraud and abuse in medicares feeforservice program are generally different than those used to address fraud in medicares part c and d private plans these differences stem largely from differences in medicares payment structure in feeforservice where providers have an incentive to provide more services examples of fraud may include billing for services not rendered billing multiple insurers for the same service or accepting bribes or kickbacks for referring patients in capitated payment systems where providers have an incentive to provide fewer services types of fraudulent activities may include employing misleading marketing tactics in an effort to discourage utilization cherry picking or selectively enrolling healthy enrollees or failing to provide medically necessary care historically the governments antifraud methods have focused on combating fraud in the feeforservice sector however with enrollment in private medicare plans on the rise program integrity approaches to fight fraud in capitated payment systems are becoming more important ensuring medicare program integrity is coordinated effort involving cms medicare contractors law enforcement agencies providers and beneficiaries by analyzing billing data monitoring improper payments and investigating potential fraud medicare contractors play significant role in the detection and prevention of health care fraud and abuse when these activities reveal suspected fraudulent activity contractors develop and refer cases to the department of health and human services dhhs office of the inspector general oig for further investigation and administrative sanctions if the oig suspects federal criminal law has been violated fraud cases are then referred to the department of justice doj for prosecution

private organizations otherwise known as medicare contractors to conduct these activities the bulk of which are performed for part and b medicare providers specific information on the types of private organizations that perform these functions are described in the next section g5g152g156g157g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g3g158g141g146g157g146g151g144g561 part medicare providers such as hospitals nursing homes home health agencies and other institutional providers are required to submit cost reports to cms annually 10 cost reports contain information on the providers allocation of costs across services cms contractors analyze these cost reports by conducting desk reviews the objective of the desk review is to assess whether the reported costs are adequate and accurate and to determine whether more comprehensive on site audit is necessary if the desk review reveal s problems with the cost report contractors will conduct field audits at the providers place of business field audits are designed to ensure compliance with medicare regulations and reimbursement policies and to obtain reasonable assurance that the cost report was prepared in accordance with medicare laws regulations and instructions the cost report auditing activity also includes audits of medicare part c or private ma plan cost reports 11 part b medicare providers physicians outpatient hospital durable medical equipment providers and others are not required to submit cost reports to cms g15g142g141g146g140g138g149g561g20g142g159g146g142g160g561 medical review activities are designed to identify and prevent payment errors and mistakes in billing more specifically medical review activit ies ensure that payment is appropriate for the service that is provided and meets professionally recognized standards of care as part of this process medicare contractors review claims largely through the use of automated computer edits to verify that the services are 1 covered by medicare 2 provided by legitimate providers 3 delivered to eligible beneficiaries and 4 reasonable and medically necessary 12 9 the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 pl 104191 created section 1893 of the social security act which established the medicare integrity program or mip as part of mip the legislation outlines the activities that are to be conducted in carrying out the program section 1893 also includes an additional activity this activity is developing list of items of durable medical equipment in accordance with section 1834a15 that are subject to prior authorization this item is not addressed in this report because cms does not use mip f unds to support this activity 10 generally part medicare providers are paid under prospective payment system pps with pps providers are paid predetermined payment amounts based on specified units of service such as hospital stays when performing cost report audits cms reviews the few items that could affect providers payment under pps such as bad debt organ procurement costs payments for indirect and direct medical education and the number of lowincome patients hospitals serve recent studies co nducted by gao and medpac have questioned the degree to which cmss current audit process assesses the accuracy of medicare costs for providers paid under pps see gao06813 medicare integrity program agency approach for allocating funds should

2006 the largest share of the hcfac appropriation was dedicated to the mip program which increased from 440 million in fy1997 to 720 million for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 prior to hipaa and the establishment of the mip program funding for medicare program integrity activities was taken from medicares program management budget which was subject to the annual appropriations process this sometimes led to fluctuations in funding as monies originally intended to support program integrity functions were redirected to fund ongoing medicare operations such as daytoday claims processing functions with the passage of this legislation hhs was ensured stable funding source that it could commit to medicare antifraud activities prior to hipaa medicare program integrity approaches relied heavily on pay and chase methods which entailed paying claims and then chasing after providers to recover inappropriate payments longterm financial support was intended to assist cms in developing more innovative and preventive strategies to combat fraud and abuse such as reviewing claims prior to payment as opposed to after payment during years 1997 through 2005 total funding for program integrity and health care fraud and abuse activities almost doubled increasing from approximately 06 billion in fy1997 to 11 billion by fy2005 the deficit reduction act dra of 2005 raised funding for the mip program by 112 million for fy2006 to implement program integrity and oversight activities for the medicare prescription drug benefit this increased the annual mip allocation from 720 million in fy2005 to 832 million for fy2006 only twelve million of this additional appropriation in fy2006 was earmarked for the medimedi data matching program the dra provided increasing amounts for the

care fraud enforcement and the justifications for these expenditures numbers and examples of enforcement actions program accomplishments and total recoveries in health care fraud cases are also described the most recent annual hcfac report indicates that the federal government won or negotiated approximately 15 billion in judgements and settlements related to health care fraud in fy2005 and returned 16 billion to the hi trust fund as result of these efforts 37 this is compared with 6 billion in judgements and settlements and 15 billion returned to the trust fund in fy2004 although the dollar value in fraud recoveries fluctuates from year to year the amount of money transferred to the hi trust fund as result of health care fraud enforcement efforts has been steadily increasing since 1998 furthermore the number of new civil and criminal investigations has accelerated particularly in recent years there is debate as to whether the increase in enforcement actions is actually the result of more fraud and abuse in medicare some experts contend that the increase is the result of having more resources to fight and detect health care fraud as opposed to an actual increase in the amount of fraud others indicate that the definition of what constitutes health care fraud has expanded over the years making it appear as though fraud has escalated when the actual level has remained relatively steady 38 table 3 provides summary of hcfac fraud recoveries transfers to the hi trust fund and enforcement actions for years 1998 through 2005 table 3 also highlights payment amounts awarded to relators or whistleblowers relators are private persons with direct knowledge of health care fraud who file complaints on behalf of the federal government under the false claims act relators are entitled to share of the recoveries in successful cases as the table demonstrates these individuals are significant referral source for health care fraud in 1998 the federal government paid relators 43 million in settlements by 2002 this amount had increased to 1012 million in 2005 relators payments had risen to 1368 million 37 health care fraud and abuse control hcfac annual report for fy2005 at httpoighhsgovpublicationsdocs hcfachcfacreport2005pdf the difference between the amount collected in fraud recoveries and the amount transferred to the hi trust fund in any given year can be attributed to the fact that fraud litigation is lengthy process that can sometimes take several years as result some of the j udgements settlements and administrative actions that occurred in one year may not result in monies being transferred to the trust fund until one or more years later 38 health care fraud and abuse practical perspectives chapter 4 2004

hcfac deposit amounts reported to the hi trust fund were consistent with the hipaa legislation hhs included measure of cost savings resulting from health care fraud enforcement efforts that could not entirely be attributed to the hcfac program40 in addition because fraud investigation and litigation take several years savings may not be realized until future years the office of management and budget omb echoed similar finding in its program assessment 39 the hipaa legislation does not require that hhs or doj separately track medicare and nonmedicare expenditures doj officials commented in 2002 gao report on the hcfac program that it is not practical to separate non medicare and medicare expenditures because of the nature of health care fraud gao02731 medicare health care fraud and

good indicator of performance because it is too difficult to ascertain how much of the reported savings is the direct result of hcfac activities conducted during the previous year in the 2005 hcfac

to the medicare program at the same time omb gave hcfac results not demonstrated rating the agency gave mip an effective ratingthe highest rating program can receive omb attributes this largely to the oigs and cmss measurement and reduction of the annual medicare improper payment rate cms often cites the improper payment rate as measure of its performance in protecting medicare from fraud waste and

payments were estimated at 10 billion or approximately 102 44 although many improper payments are the result of honest billing mistakes by providers others result from fraud and abuse dme fraud tends to be higher in south florida and angeles where both the number of medicare beneficiaries and the number of dme suppliers are high according to cms the primary types of dme fraud committed in these areas include billing for services not rendered and billing for services that are not medically necessary for the beneficiary 45 before dme supplier can bill medicare it must meet certain standards cms contracts with the national supplier clearinghouse nsc to enroll an d screen potential suppliers before they can participate in the program once supplier is found to be compliant with these

and the part d benefit in general in april 2006 the senate finance committee wrote letter to cms inquiring why cms had issued only one task order to medic organization after identifying numerous part d fraud vulnerabilities in fy2006 the dra provided 100 million in funds to address fraud associated with the prescription drug program portion of which was to be allocated to the medics cms then awarded an additional four medic contracts later that year in addition an oig report released in october 2007 found that by the end of fy2006 cms had not yet commenced financial audits of part d plans and data analysis of billing trends to identify potential fraudtwo other key responsibilities of the medics instead cms relied largely on beneficiary complaints to detect abusive practices in fy2006 cms expects to begin financial audits of part d plans in january 2008 61 in september 2006 report gao noted that cms does not have an adequate method for allocating program integrity funding to areas with the greatest risk including risk associated with the part d benefit62 in light of an october 2007 announcement by cms that the agency plans to recover 4 billion in payments made to plans in 2006 this is worth noting as part of the bidding process part d plans must prospectively estimate how much it is going to cost to provide prescription drug coverage to an average medicare beneficiary at the end of the year cms compares actual costs with predicted costs as part of payment reconciliation process because of lowerthanexpected drug costs for 2006 the predicted costs were 4 billion more than plans actual costs plans are required to return these extra payments to cms as part d plans gain more experience with the program cms predicts the difference between plans expected and actual

activities which receive the largest share of hcfac funding recent government accountability office gao reports have raised questions about how mip funding is be ing used and have recommended cms develop more quantitative measures to assess the impact of mip program integrity activities in the future outcomes and results from program integrity activities are difficult to assess for number of reasons while perpetrators of fraud and abuse cost the medicare program large amounts of money annually there are reliable estimates on the size of the problem the national health care antifraud association estimates that health care fraud accounts for at least 3 of total health care expenditures annually but measuring the amount of true fraud is difficult 63 this makes it challenging for policy makers to determine the extent of resources needed to effectively combat the problem the implementation of the prescription drug benefit presents new challenge for cms and its partners in addition to increasing expenditures contracting with private prescription drug plans to deliver services to beneficiaries adds new layer of complexity in administration since the start of the prescription drug benefit on january 1 2006 policy makers have expressed concerns related to cms oversight of the part d medics which are responsible for ensuring medicare integrity in the part d benefit as payments to part d plans continue to rise over the next several years it will be important to monitor the program integrity activities undertaken to safeguard payments to part d plans and providers protecting the medicare program from improper payment fraud and abuse is complex and challenging undertaking with fraud perpetrators continually devising more sophisticated schemes to defraud the system administrators need to invest in broad mix of preventive and investigative techniques to uncover fraud and abuse while the permanent authorization of hcfac and mip funds have enhanced medicares program integrity efforts improvements in oversight are needed to continue to ensure medicare beneficiaries access to high quality and appropriate care
