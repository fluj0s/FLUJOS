impoundment control act ica was included as title x of the congressional budget and impoundment cont rol act of 1974 signed into law on june 12 1974 88 stat 332 under the ica unless congress takes action to approve rescission request from the pres ident within the 45day review period prescribed by the law the funds must be released with respect to presidential rescission message congress may approve more or less than the amount requested by the president in addition absent specific request from the president congress on its own accord may initiate resci ssion actions by cancelling previously appropriated funds in subsequent law according to data compiled by the government accountability office gao from fy1974 to fy2006 presidents requested 1178 rescissions under the ica totaling somewhat over 76 billion close to third of the proposals were approved by congress with approximately 40 of the total dollar amount of presidential rescission requests 25 billion enacted by congress the sum of rescissions requested by the president and subsequen tly enacted exceeded 1 billion in only four of the 30plus years fy1981 fy1982 fy1992 and fy1994 during this period congress initiated 1610 resc ission actions amounting to 1435 billion over five times the total of presidentially requested rescission subsequently enacted reflecting trend toward an increasing number of rescissions being initiated by congress the line item veto act of 1996 pl 93 344 in effect for less than eighteen months before being overturned by the supreme court in 1998 gave the president enhanced rescission authority by reversing the burden of action regarding rescission proposals cancellations of the presiden t became permanent unless disapproved by congress ultimately requiring rejection by 23 majority in both chambers during this time the president also had authority to cancel new items of direct spending and certain targeted tax benefits as well as items of discretionary spending figures from the congressional budget office indicate that the 82 cancellations made by president clinton in fy1998 including those overt urned totaled so 355 million with projected fiveyear savings just under 1 billi on president clintons use of the short lived enhanced rescission authority thus was not notably different from the prior annual record of presidential re scissions under the ica framework during his first seven years in office president george w bush sent formal ica rescission requests to congress but some controversy veloped over his use of alternative means to propose spending reductions president bush while evidently reluctant to use existing rescission authority contained in the ica has called repeatedly for enactment of measure that would give the president greater authority to reject items of spending such bill passed the house in the 109th congress and was reported in the senate contentious issue is whether such measure might give preference to presidential spending priorities over congressional spending priorities arguably affecting th legislative power of the purse this report will be updated as necessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33869

provides in article i that money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by w article ii stipulates that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed the practice of impoundment reflects this sharing of powers between the branches in the implementation of the federal budget the term impoundment refers to execu tive actions to wit hhold or delay the spending of funds provided in law th term rescission denotes one type of impoundment that involving perman ent cancellation of the funds while instances of presidential im poundment date back to the early 19th century presidents usually sought accommodation rather than confrontation with congress1 this changed during the nixon administration 19691974 when impoundment of funds developed into ma jor conflict eventually involving the courts as well as congress and the president2 this report begins by reviewing th framework for handling rescissions established by the

included as title x of the congressional budget and impoundment cont rol act of 1974 signed into law on june 12 1974 88 stat 332 the act blished two categories of impoundments deferrals or temporary delays in funding availability nd rescissions or permanent cancellation of the designated budget authority the ica also established new reporting requirements that remain in effect3 the 1974 law required the president to inform congress of all proposed rescissions and deferrals and to submit specified informa tion regarding each such action in special message the president may combine several rescission requests in single impoundment message section 1014 of the 1974 law also stipulated that the president transmit to congress each month cumulative report on the status of impoundment actions in 1975 various of th reporting duties were transferred from the president to the director of the office of management and budget omb via executive order 118454 the ica also required the comptroller general of the general accounting office gao now th government accountability office to oversee executive compliance with the law and report to congress if the president fails to report an impoundment or improperly classifies an action both messages from the president and communications from the comptroller general are published in the federal register and subsequently prin ted as house documents5 the act further stipulated different procedures fo r congressional review and control of the two types of impoundment with rescission the funds must be made available for obligation unless both houses of congress take action to approve of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33869crs3 6 in contrast the original provisions of title x allowed deferral to continue in effect for the period proposed by the president not to ex tend beyond the end of the fiscal year so as to become facto rescission unless either the house or senate took action to disapprove it such procedures known as onehouse legislative veto were invalidated by the 1983 supreme court decision in ins v chadha 462 us 919 city of new haven v united states 809 f 2d 900 dc cir 1987 held that the deferral authority conveyed to the president in the 1974 law was inseverable from the onehouse veto provision thus the invalidation of the legislative veto also in validated the deferral authority except for what were considered to be routine deferrals authorized by sources predating the ica 7 in the past omb sometimes expanded the 45day period during which the funds were unavailable by initiating deferral prior to fo rmally reporting the rescission to congress in one case in 1986 nearly six months elapsed between the effective date of specific appropriation and the submission of the icare quired rescission message see crs report rl33365 line item veto constitutional analysis of recent proposals by morton rosenberg p 9 8 section 206 of pl 100119 served to c odify the appeals court decision in the new haven case the provision in the 1974 law as amended now authorizes the president to defer funds only for contingencies efficien cy or where specifically provided by law section 206 also reaffirmed certain provisio

statement of th committee of conference in us congress increasing the statutory li mit on the public debt conference report to accompany continuedrescission request within 45 days of continuous session6 recesses of more than three days are not counted in practice this usually means that funds proposed for rescission not approved by congress become available for obligation after about 60 calendar days although the period can extend to 75 days or longer7 the funds may be withheld from obligation until the 45day period elapses or congress disapproves the rescission congress may alter the amount proposed for rescission by the president either increasing or decreasing it as well as approving or disapproving the rescission request in toto section 1017 of the ica establishes expedited procedures for congressional action on any rescission b ill introduced with respect to special message submitted by the president in the fall of 1987 as component of legislation to raise the limit on the public debt pl 100119 that also included ch anges in the grammrudmanhollings act congress enacted several other budget pr ocess reforms as well section 206 effectively eliminated presidential

tie up the f unds even though congress by its inaction had already rejected virtually the same pr oposal the legislative history of the 1974 act suggests that prohibiting this practi ce of seriatim rescission proposals may be consistent with the original intent of congress the prohibition on seriatim rescissions in section 207 applies for the dur ation of the appropria tion so that it may remain

the impoundment control act has been in effect for over 30 years according to an assessment of c ongressional power over impoundments since 1974 coauthored by former director of the congressiona l budget office cbo although the courts did much to curb presidential impoundments through title x of the new budget act congress also helped itself to recaptu re its influence over the impoundment of funds11 in the first few years following enac tment of the 1974 law congress approved presidential requests in number of separate rescission bills subsequently congress tended to act upon rescission messages fro m the president in supplemental and regular appropriations measures rather than in individual rescission bills under the ica unless congress takes action to pprove of rescission request from the president within the 45day period the funds must be released in practice however congressional action on resci ssion requests has often occu rred after the expiration of the 45day review period so that funds are formally available for obligation for some time before being permanently rescinded as noted previously congress may pprove more or less than the amount requested by the president in addition absent specific request from the president congress of its own accord may initiate re scission actions by cancelling previously appropriated funds in s ubsequent law such factors can create ambiguities in interpreting data on rescissi ons proposed by the presid ent and congressional action on them for example are funds origin ally proposed for rescission in special message but which again become ava ilable for obligation before congress permanently rescinds them to be cons idered as congressional approval of presidents request or as rescission initiated by congress table 1 provides data on rescissions from fy1974 through fy 2005 as compiled by gao according to gaos methodology eventual congre ssional action on rescission proposed by the president is generally considered as approval of presidents request even if the 45day period has elapsed12 data in table 2 reflect the outcome of rescission requests of the presidents since 1974 provi ding percentages of their respective requests approved by congress both in re lation to total dollars requested for rescission and to the number of separate proposals by year and by administration in the early months under the

congressional approval for almost 70 percent of the dollar value of his requested rescissions the tool was essentially useless to the president in fiscal years 198387 when congress approved less than

of 1992 however the use of rescissi ons became controversial nd highly partisan political issue to an extent not seen since th conflicts of the nixon administration18 during the first four months of cal endar year 1992 president bush requested 128 rescissions totaling almost 79 billion while reportedly ttempting to portray the democraticpartycontrolled congress as more interested in securing domestic pork projects for their constituents than in reducing the budget deficit over 7 billion of these proposed rescissions affect ed the defense department mainly for weapons programs that the administrati on wanted to terminate or items that congress added to earlier defense budgets19 many of the nondefense rescissions were for small earmarked pr ojects added by congress in response to the four packages of re scissions requested by president bush in 1992 the house and senate appropriations committees devised their own alternative packages conference version with an 82 billion package of rescissions was signed into law on june 4 1992 pl 102298 although the conference agreement contained over 7 billion in defense funds only about 17 billion of that total came from programs that the administration had wanted to rescind in toto the law approved less than 21 billion of the rescissions requested by president bush but added more than 6 billion in congressionally initiated cuts20 as indicated in table 2 the clinton administration ranked at the top of the list of presidents since 1974 with respect to the percentage of rescission proposals accepted 67 and percentage of the to tal dollar amounts requested that were approved by congress 54 during hi s first two years 19931994 the democratic party controlled both houses of congress as well as the white house while in the

noteworthy feature of the data in tables 1 and 2 both the number and dollar amount of rescission requests submitted by the president have fluctuated widely in the 30plus years of experience under the

on rescissions under the ica from the perspective of the mid1990s allen sc hick concluded rescissions invite conflict between the president and congress every one is presidential demand that congress cancel resources it had previously appropriated by implication rescissions tell congress that it erred the first time around and that it wasted government funds this is not message that appeals to legislators especially when it comes from president who has different budget priorities21 the experience during the 1992 election year provided prelude to very significant development in rescissi ons since 1974 the increase in number of congressionally initiated rescissions by the end of fy 1992 presidents had proposed over 1000 rescissions under the ica with c ongress approving about third of

in 1993 testimony milton socolar fro m the gao office of general counsel called attention to this development the data suggest an evolution in the use of rescissions as budgetary tool the share of total enacted rescissions originally proposed by the president has fallen and the share originating in the congress has increased as the congress has come to embrace an equivalent or greater amount of reductions than proposed by presidents the debate has shifted from deciding whether to cut to deciding where to cut emphasis in original23 according to mr socolar however these enacted rescissions often had effect in reducing total spending if an equivalent amount of budg et authority was added to another program thereby reflecting shift in priorities rather than reduction in total spending the proportion of enacted rescissions in itiated by congress rather than by presidential request has continued to expand see table 3 the share of total dollars rescinded originating w ith congress exceeded 91 in fy1992 and fy1993 and by fy1997 and fy1998 over 99 since fy1982 the percentage of total rescissions enacted included in presidential messages reached double digit figures in only three

congress one factor that may have contributed to the growth of rescissions initiated by congress relates to the limits on discretionary spending dating to the budget enforcement act bea of 199024 as noted previously congress came to include rescission provisions in regular or s upplemental appropriations measures an appropriations measure could include resc issions of previous ly appropriated funds in order to accommodate dditional monies for other purposes the rescission mechanism on occasion might have proved useful in efforts to avoid breaching particular spending cap and possibl

certain items in appropriations and entitlement measures and also certain narrowly applicable tax breaks the act authorized the president to cancel in w hole any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority appropriations any item of new direct spending entitlement or limited tax benefits with specified characteristics contained in bill otherwise signed into law the cancellation was to take effect upon receipt in the house and senate of special notification message cancellation in this context meant to prevent from having legal force in other words provisions canceled never were to become effective unless congress re versed the action of the president by enacting disapproval bill the president was only to exercise the cancellation authority if he determined 1 that such cancellation w ould reduce the federal budget deficit and 2 it would not impair essentia l government functions or harm the national interest and 3 he notified the congress in special message of any such cancellation within five calendar days after enactment of the law providing such am ount item or benefit the act provided 30 days for the expe dited congressional consideration of disapproval bills to reverse the cancellations contained in the special messages received from the president detailed provisions for expedited consideration of the disapproval bill in the house and senate were outlined since the president would presumably veto the disapproval bill 23 majority in both the house and senate ultimately would be necessary to override and disapprove of cancellations the law

congress even consider president s rescission requests funds proposed for rescission by the president in special message must be made available for obligation unless congress act s to approve the presidents requested rescissions within 45 days of continuous session the ica moreover allows the president to request resci ssions only of discretionary spending portion of the budget which accounts for 38 of annual outlays while 62 of outlays go to mandatory spending controlle d by law other than appropr iations acts including net interest49 the record of cancellations during the brief time in fy1997 and fy1998 that the 1996 liva was in effect arguably serves to rebut such criticisms of the current ica process as discussed above the li va reversed the burden of action regarding rescission proposals cancellations of th president became permanent unless disapproved by congress ultimately requiring rejection by 23 majority in both chambers to override presidential veto of disapproval bill during this period the president also had authority to cancel new items of direct mandatory spending and certain targeted tax benefits as well as items of discretionary spending cbo figures indicate that all the cancellations made by president clinton in fy1998 including those overturned totaled some 355 million with projected fiveyear savings justhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33869crs21 50 ibid 51 to

amount to be saved over five years was less than 600 million50 the brief experience in the clinton administration does not necessarily reflect how enhanced rescission authority might be exercised by other presidents in other circumstances still president clintons use of the 1996 lineitem veto statute is consistent with how little the 1974 laws rescissi on system has been used 51 another concern in terms of budgetar impact of rescissions under the ica is that funds rescinded do not necessar ily reduce outlays monies rescinded may simply allow for increased spending elsewhere as acting cbo director marron testified in 2006 under current practice rescissions seem to have been used primarily to pay for other spending ra ther than to reduce spending overall52 some proposals to modify the ica framework have sought to avoid this outcome the liva provided for lockbox mechanism to ensure that deficit reduction would result from cancellations in 2006 the legislative line item veto act hr 4890 109th congress as passed by the house and title i of the stop over spending act s 3521 109th congress as reported in the senate both specified that amounts rescinded would be dedicated only to deficit reducti on and not be used as an offset for spending increase elsewhere53 although many observers do not view modi fying the ica framework to give the president expanded rescission authority as an effective means to achieve significant savings or deficit reduction number of studies i ndicate that governors use the stronger item veto mechanism to favor executive priorities over legislative priorities54 in 1995 during hearings on the line item veto act then cbo director robert reischauer testifie d that rather than generating much budgetary savings granting the president item veto or enhan ced rescission authority would have more important impact in giving presidential spending preference over congressional spending presidents could use expanded rescission authority to redirect greater resources to their own spending agendas55 similar perspective on possible effects of proposals such as those to expand the presidents rescission authority ppeared in testimony by gao assistant comptroller general harry havens in 1992 according to mr havens the most significant impact would likely be in the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches and not in budgetary

constitution and which has historically been one of clear legislative primacy56 the experiences in 1992 with the george hw bush administrations rescission proposals and the congressional response as discussed above arguably prove illustrative regarding the subject of competing spending priorities between the president and congress using the existing ica framework president bush transmitted four special ssages proposing 128 rescissi on and totaling almost 79 billion the house and sena appropriations committees reviewed the presidents request and each chamber reported and pa ssed substitute packages conference version containing 82 billion was signed in to law containing less than 21 billion of the presidents proposals but over 6 billion in congressiona lly initiated cuts during senate floor deba on its substitute resci ssion package in 1992 senator robert byrd chairman of the appropriations committee referred to the presidents recent reference to the wasteful spending of congress and stated the following so to hear the chief executive speak on that occasion to the effect that only congress is guilty of wasteful spending and the president singled out some examples of what he considered to be wasteful spending and the senate has gone along with some of them but the presid ent did not say anything about wasteful spending in the executive branch let bring few examples of wasteful spending to the attention of my colleague s and to the attention of the american people57 senator byrd then proceeded to describe examples of what he termed wasteful executive branch spending included in the senate substitute such as grant from the national science foundation to study sexual aggregation of fish in nicaragua or from nih to study the incidence of dental fear in the population58 supporters of the existing ica framework might note that in 1992 the president was able to gain public attention for hi s proposed rescissions when congress crafted an alternative package of rescissions largely congressionally initiated and saving more than the presidents requested rescissions the spending priorities of congress ultimately preva iled arguably upholding the power of the purse reviewing the history of impoundments law review article in 1974 stated every president from george washington to richard nixon almost certainly has impounded appropr iated funds59 the framework established by the ica in 1974 has provided the opportunity for greater acc ountability in reporting of rescissions andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33869crs23 for increased congressional oversight and

impoundment data and reporting requirements until the 1970s accurate and systematic data concerning impoundments were often lacking60 congress first attempted to facilitate the availability of relevant data by stipulating reporting re quirements in the federal impoundment and information act of 197261 however there was an initial delay in ombs compliance with the law and subsequent concerns in congress about the comp leteness of the information provided 62 on march 8 1973 congress sought to tighten up the requirements by requiring quarterly reports on impoundment actions from omb63 the impoundment control act of 1974 established the current reporting requirements as noted above the law re quires the president to inform congress of all proposed rescissions and to submit certain information regarding each such action the president may combine several resc ission requests in single impoundment message the law also requires the comptroller general of the government accountability office gao to oversee ex ecutive compliance with the law and report to congress if the president fails to report an impoundment or improperly classifies an action both the message s from the president and the communications from the comptroller general are to be printed in the federal registe r and issued as house documents64 section 1014 of the 1974 law also stipulated that the president transmit to congress each month cumula tive report on the status of impoundmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33869crs25 65 the cumulative reports are published in the federal register and issued as house documents 66 specifically president ford conferred upon the omb director the functions of transmitting copies of the special rescission and deferral messages to the comptroller general and to

has submitted resc ission requests to congress there were two deferral requests from the ad ministration in fy2001 and the monthly cumulative reports from om b appeared through september 2001 there have been cumulative reports on rescissions and defe rrals since june 17 2002 because there have been presiden tial messages omb stated in the last report that as of june 1 2002 funds were being deferred67 therefore according to omb pursuant to pl 93344 until ch time as the president transmits special message on congress on subsequent rescission proposals or deferrals cumulative reports are required to be transmitted to the congress68 for number of years omb prepared informal reports at the end of each fiscal year which provided convenient res ource for compiling aggregate data on rescissions these yearend reports also proved useful as research reference documents since the october cumulative report would commence with the new fiscal year and would not capture actions occurri ng during september the final month of the previous fiscal year these reports were apparen tly discontinued in the 1990s69 the house appropriations committee also has compiled data on rescissions in interpreting the respective sources it is necessary to keep in mind that the appropriations committee includes in rescissions approved by congress congressionally initiated actions to cancel funds previous ly appropriated even in the absence of rescission request by the president the approach used by the appropriations committee makes sense from the perspective of tracking the status of appropriations law and an amendments thereto on the other hand omb in reporting rescissions pursuant to the 1974 law only considers the outcome of rescissions proposed by the president what was requested by the president and what action was taken by congress if any httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33869crs26 70 letter from comptroller general to sen r obert byrd chairman senate appropriations
