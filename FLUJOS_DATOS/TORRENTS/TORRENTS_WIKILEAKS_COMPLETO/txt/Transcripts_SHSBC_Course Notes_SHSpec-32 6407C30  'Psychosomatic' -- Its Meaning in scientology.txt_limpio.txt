6407c30 shspec32 psychosomatic its meaning in scientology medical treatment lies in what they call psychic trauma within 24 hours of lrhs setting out program of helping the medicos they goofed with saint hill student bill websterjohnson they gave him the wrong bloodtype during transfusion and thereby possibly cost him his life thats pure damn foolishness in the first place they monkey around when they get outside their limited proper field this caused lrh to take sharp look at possible cooperation and made him question it legislatures pass laws about things that they know nothing about theres nothing in the constitution that says you have to be sane to be citizen and yet if you are pronounced insane you are longer citizen and have civil rights whatsoever the right to say who is insane is given to people with training in the field of the mind who think that the mind is the brain by law they do not have to be trained in anything but medicine anyway there is bill or law that says that psychiatrists can practice in the field of the mind only that one must be an md psychiatrists do not have to be licensed and the term psychiatrist has legal standing to train an animal you wait for the animal to do something and then say the command word and reward the animal association according to pavlov and thompson is concatenation of events by which one reaches conclusion freudian psychiatry is not currently practiced none of the current practitioners was trained by freud and the original system may have called for more intelligence on the part of the practitioner than seems to be used now freud probably used savvy and wordassociation to cone down on the problem free association is the lengthy procedure for contemporary freudians amassing enough data appears to be their system but by the time one amasses enough data one is simply confused you need chance to apply the data technology is dicey stuff the more vias it goes through the more errors it becomes subject to lrh handles lots of tech queries from students instructors msh etc the right to practice depends ideally on the ability to do not on some state legislators decisions promoters and lobbyists determine what laws and appropriations shall be made anyway in order to get more money for their department or industry or whatever that is why there are periodic attacks on scientology it is being used as an example of how bad it all is over there if you hit someone mentally or physically with enough force duress or bad news you can make him give you something mass physical blow significance saying how bad it is eg is seepage troubling your loved ones this is mortuary bad news comeon for expensive caskets blackmail is based on the same principle so is taxation and the draft the medical doctor uses this technique in diseasefighting campaigns that scare people with how bad it is instead of getting their income from curing people they use the scare tactic as large source of funds if you understand how this law operates you can usually put together good defense or counterattack this scare tactic is also used by patients im so bad off youve got to give with the next bad news artist you run into ask him boldfacedly what am i expected to give you you will stop him cold in his tracks this completely discombobulates him you apply the second half of the law that he is operating on albeit unknowingly before he is ready for it you complete the cycle unexpectedly you may not get sensible answer to your question but you will change what he is doing his attention he may not doing this consciously he may have you misidentified and be dramatizing something he surely doesnt expect your response if you can make people laugh when theyre crying and cry when theyre laughing then you would know something about the human mind this is an interesting point but knowing the mind doesnt mean manipulating the mind the medical profession means something else by psychosomatic healing than what you mean by it they mean the minds influence on the body but they consider the mind to be the brain so psychosomatic means the brains or the nervous systems effect on the body this is like saying that the switchboard is the causative element of the phone company so psychosomatic has come to mean the bodys effect on the body thus the subject of psychosomatic illness has disappeared as meaningful subject the word psychosomatic actually means psyche soul plus soma body so proper definition of psychosomatic would be thetans influence on the body that is our definition but not the medicos the first downgrade was to translate psyche as mind the thetan had lost his identity and had become identified with the masses and machinery of the mind the second downgrade was to make mind mean brain and nervous system this makes psychosomatic mean about what the influence of the switchboards and telephone lines on the government would mean that is what the mds mean since the brain and nervous system are part of the body you are just dealing with the bodys influence on the body case has just fallen out of it better term then might be spiritual healing or the spirits influence on the body you can educate or process someone to recognition of the effect he as being is having on his you could ask him for times in his life when he was ill following being upset he might comm lag long time but getting few of these out of the way will improve someones case we have advanced beyond the tradition of psychosomatic healing because we recognize three stages of influence the thetan psyche influencing the mind psycho which then influences the body soma we recognize that the mind is doing something to the body some retained memory has held pain or an experience in place keeping the body ill or predisposing the body to illness or injury you wouldnt have somatic body feeling of feeling good because it would be you that felt good dianetics was at the level of mind over the body but even here the mind was not totally causative we had to recognize that something was doing something that was not the mind we recognized that the thetan existed and could influence the mind to make it stop influencing the body for the worse and that makes us different we have found the thing that the thetan can influence the mind he may not be able to influence the body directly but he can influence the mind which in turn is influencing the body this is more effective than earlier healing practices because asking the thetan to influence the body directly is too great gap for him to jump scientology handles predisposition to illness and we are the only ones who can just as we are the only ones who can handle prolongation of illness
