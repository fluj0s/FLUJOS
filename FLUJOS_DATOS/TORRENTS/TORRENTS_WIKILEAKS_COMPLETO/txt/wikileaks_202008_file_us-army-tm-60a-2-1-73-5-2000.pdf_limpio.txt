section 1 introduction 1 purpose this manual is general guide for the us of the main charge disrupter mcd tool an explosiveformed penetrator efp as loworder disruption technique 2 scope this manual presents description and general p rocedures for employing the mcd applicable conditions for use techniques re sults target bombs insensitive munitions ims tactics and limitations are covered the mcd has proven effective in explosive filler disruption for an assortment of munitions 3 introduction the united statesdeveloped mcd figure 1 was modeled after the united kingdoms baldrick tool the baldrick is nato tool however it has not been approved for us use the mcd is packaged in co ntainer containing 12 mcds container ex 788 mod 0 12 stands figure 2 12 tonator holders two explosive packers and 24 tie straps the mcd tool is an aluminum cylinder with copper hemisphericalshaped liner similar in appearance to misznayschardin liner figure 3 the mcd is issued empty it is fieldfilled with the proper amount of plastic explosive for the mission operation or application nylon pa d is attached to the liner to provide cushion dampening slightly the velocity of the explosi ve wave of the detonation and reducing the velocity of the liner the detonator hol der has an opening through the middle of the holder for insertion of blasting cap centered at the apex of the liner 4 general when clearing an ordnancecontaminated area the course of action is to render safe munitions use the standoff munitions disrup tion technique smud or handemplaced explosive charges for ordnance detonation blowinplace bip the mcd offers an alternative method as some procedures have draw backs performing render safe procedures rsps may be timeconsuming using t he smud technique requires good aim and ricochets and other downrange dangers must be considered as with smud the mcd was developed to produce deflagrat ions low orders that consume all or most of the explosives contained in large mu nitions during rapid clearing operations the mcd was designed for rapid clearance an d quick positioning it is standoff friendly ie the standoff does not need to be exact but placed approximately 6 inches 152 millimeters from the target the mcd can als be used for baseplate removal on mk 82 and mk 83 bombsfor official use only for official use onlysection ii description 5 technique general the mcd is used against highexplosive he bombs and large projectiles the mcd disrupts the main charge of the m unition by rapid deflagration of the explosive filler as with smud t he mcd is used only against hefilled munitions the disruptionreaction eff ects from the penetration of the efp on the hefilled munitions are detonation violent deflagration deflagration slight reaction chemica l reaction and burnout as the efp penetrates the he filler the explosive is com pressed and the deflagrationtodetonation transition ddt process be gins if the munition case is sufficiently weakened the detonation process ends nd the deflagration continues to consume all or part of the fil ler for the definition of ddt refer to the 60series manual on general informat ion on ordnance low order disruption techniques reactions of the fillers ar classified as category chemical reaction the mcd may not have penetrated the casing if penetration occurred the shock must have been insufficient to induce the deflagration process explosive may be exposed further reaction category b slight reaction negligible deflagration or explosive contribution is evident category c deflagration substantial amount of the hefiller is consumed casing remains somewhat intact or splits into l arge fragments traveling short distance baseplate and nose segments are usually intact after deflagration shallow crater is visible the crater can contain the casing or large fragments category d violent deflagration casing fragmentsspli ts large fragments travel several hundred meters all or almost all of the fill er is consumed the indication of violent deflagration may also an the ordnance has undergone ddt shallow crater with large fragmen ts may be visible indication of ddt or crater that is shallo w at one end and deeper at the other is an indication that ddt has ccurred category detonation mcd causes detonation evidenced by large blast reaction and noise casing ruptures into small highvelocity fragments which travel long distances category burn the main charge either burns to total co nsumption the main charge burns until booster heats sufficiently t detonate the main charge or the main charge is partially consumed b results with categories b c and d filler disruptio n occurs with less blast and fragmentation than category or an intentional detonation however categories c and d may still produce violent explosion resulting in blastfor official use only for official use onlyand long fragmentation travel filler disruption may ave the area littered with disrupted munitions casings containing varying amounts of ex plosives and possibly armed fuzes burning munitions and other hazar dous munitions residue category produces the nearly normal designed blast and fragmentation and results in complete destruction of the munition category is not desirable as the munition will have t be reattacked until favorable results are achieved c target munitions tables 1 through 9 see list of f igures show the test results of the mcd tables 10 through 20 see list of figure s show the results of the baldrick tool testing has proven that both tools have simi lar characteristics and produce nearly identical results tables are group ed corresponding to the bomb weight and mkblu number the mcd was tested agai nst bombs in pristine condition and against dropped bombs containin g boosters and fuzes the baldrick was tested against bombs some bombs contained b oosters and armed fuzes some contained boosters and others had n either boosters or fuzes the h6filled bombs were also thermally protected it appears the thermal protection did not significantly alter the flagration results there is predicted outcome of hefilled munitions the tables are the results of the munitions that have been tested and what should be exp ected the target munition wall thickness generally determines results and the vulnerability to penetration the fill generally determines the volati lity for the reaction for definition of volatility refer to the 60series manual on general information on ordnance loworder disruption techniques d insensitive munitions ims ims are designed to with stand such stimuli as heat shock impact and fragmentationbullet impact the munition is usually designed to two different design technologies the firs t is to design the case with some means of venting the case such as employing vent holes filled with fusible filler that melts when heated or stress rise r weakened area and other means of venting the case and the second i s to design the explosive to make it resistant to detonation from bulle t and fragmentation impact requirements of ims refer to the 60series manual on description of and disposal procedures for conventional explosives and related hazardous materials for further information with vented case design the case will rupture with very little pressure buildup the stress riser r vent will have to be attacked or the case will not allow pressure buildup nd will not sustain deflagration attacking munition with stress risers or venting design should be at that vent or stress riser as attacking any other rea of the case will result in an unacceptable result attacking the stress ri ser or vent is also the weakest point of the case granting easy penetration for the efp use the mcd should be considered for use in except ional circumstances where there is requirement for rapid clearance of mul tiple unexploded ordnance uxo items or when filler disruption is deemed esse ntial the possibility of detonation of the target munition must be considered even though less violent reaction is probable after the ordnance experiences deflagration there will be residue of fuzes in unknown conditions boosters explosives and case fragments when munition deflagrat hazardousfor official use only for official use onlyresidue in the area can be rendered safe removed or d isposed of after all the uxo targets have been attacked f procedure the mcd uses 2 4 or 6 ounces of plastic ex plosive the correct amount of plastic explosive may be determined by using th label on each mcd the label contains three divisions 2 4 6 whe n placed on an m112 block of c4 it will allow for precise cutting of the d esired amount the correct amount may also be determined by using 125pound bl ock and dividing it into ten 2ounce segments note if the mcd is dropped during assembly procedures it will be n ecessary to reinspect ensuring the liner is securely in the housing and the explosive is still packed firmly against the liner 1 assembly procedures mcd figure 1 remove label from mcd b remove foam detonator holder c inspect mcd ensure 1 the mcd is clear of foreign objects 2 there are dents cracks or damage to housing or li ner 3 the liner is firmly seated in housing 4 there is significant corrosion white or gre powder at linerhousing interface d using explosive packer figure 4 or wooden dowel pack mcd firmly and evenly around liner with required amount of plastic explosive taking care to leave voids in explosive replace foam detonator holder note navy and marine corps units are restricted from storin g explosiveloaded mcds
