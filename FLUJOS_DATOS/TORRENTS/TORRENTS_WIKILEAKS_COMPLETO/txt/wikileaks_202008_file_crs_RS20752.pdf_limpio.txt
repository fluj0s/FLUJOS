g4g158g141g144g142g157g501g561 the budget and accounting act of 19211 as amended requires the president to submit budget annually to congress toward the beginning of each regular session this requirement first applied to president harding for fy1923 the deadline for submission of the budget first set in 1921 as on the first day of each regular session has changed several times over the years in 1950 to during the first 15 days of each regular session in 1985 to on or before the first monday after january 3 of each year or on or before february 5 in 1986 and in 1990 to on or after the first monday in january but not later than the first monday in february of each year the 20th amendment to the constitution ratified in 1933 requires each new congress to convene on january 3 unless the date is changed by the enactment of law and provides january 20 beginning date for new presidents fouryear term of office therefore under the legal framework for the beginning of new congress the beginning of new presidents term and the deadline for the submission of the budget all outgoing presidents prior to the 1990 change were obligated to submit budget 2 the 1990 change in the deadline made it possible for an outgoing president to leave the annual budget submission to his successor an option which the two outgoing presidents since then george h w bush and clinton took

g346g561as stated previously presidents clinton and george w bush submitted the original budgets for fy1994 and fy2002 as incoming presidents on april 8 1993 and april 9 2001 respectively in past years congress authorized the submission of budget for fiscal year after the statutory deadline by enacting deadline extension in law for example the deadlines for submission of the budgets for fy1981 fy1984 and fy1986 were extended from midjanuary to latejanuary or earlyfebruary by pl 96186 pl 97469 and pl 991 respectively beginning in the late 1980s however several original budgets have been submitted late without authorization for fy1991 the budget was submitted week after deadline that already had been extended by law pl 101228 for fy1989 and the transitionyear budget for fy1994 the budget was submitted after the deadline by 45 and 66 days respectively without the consideration of any measure granting deadline extension the experience with transition budgets during the period that the congressional budget process has been in operation is roughly comparable in terms of timing with the experience of earlier years presidents eisenhower kennedy and nixon submitted their revised budget messages to congress on april 30 march 24 and april 12 respectively 6 like the budget itself the revisions may take whatever form the president desires they have ranged from piecemeal submissions in the earlier instances to consolidated budget messages beginning with president ford although presidents reagan clinton and geor ge w bush did not submit detailed budget proposals during their transitions until early april each of them advised congress regarding the general contours of their economic and budgetary policies in special messages submitted to congress in february concurrently with presen tation made to joint session of congress on february 18 1981 president reagan submitted document containing an economic plan and initial budget proposals for fy1982 america s new beginning program for economic recovery in conjunction with an address to joint session of congress on february 17 1993 president clinton submitted to congress budgetary document vision of change for america to accompany his address to joint session of congress the 145page document outlined the presidents economic plan and provided initial budget proposals in key areas on february 28 2001 president george w bush submitted 207page budget summary to congress blueprint for new beginnings responsible budget for america s priorities the day after his address to joint session of congress to facilitate the development of the budget fo r the incoming clinton administration president george h w bush submitted to congress on january 6 1993 573page singlevolume budgetary document to congress
