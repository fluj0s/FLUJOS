children preferably sons in dari afghan persian the word for married maleadult is khana dar meaning householder father builds his house when he marries to pass from youth to the status of real complete man you must have wifeahouse and offspring in the refugee camps this passage to manhood is extremely difﬁcult marriage requires paying bride price 2to marry you must have money young refugee with education job money has little prospect of marriage it is important toremember that since the soviet invasion of 1979 afghans have comprised the largestconcentration of refugees in the world one third of the afghan population at least 5million people have been in exile or internally displaced tens of thousands arestarving without the money to marry and found family young refugee has noprospect of ever becoming proper complete man how then shall he have honour refugees with schools have nowhere to go but the mosque and the madersa where excitable mullahs can ﬁll their minds with wahabbist 3propaganda distorting islam for political purposes such distortions include their confusion of the west with satanshaitan and their promotion of suicide as martyrdom and source of honour when honour is the most important thing in his culture and martyrdom procures honour forhis family suicide can seem attractiveespecially for youth raised in poverty with noproper schooling and prospect of marriage if the west wants to achieve greater security for ourselves and for our children we have to convince people that we are not evil incarnate westerners are remarkably badat projecting positive images hollywood and the tv corporations export ﬁlms extollingbeach nudity and marital inﬁdelity for many moslems degrading the image of womanconstitutes direct insult to god who made woman our ﬁlm industry has achievedthe remarkable feat of making moslems jealous of our wealth while despising us for ourway of life envy and contempt breed anger in place of jealousy of corrupt and wealthy west we need to develop the pride of other nations in the achievements of their own culture and economy people who feelgood about themselves will not feel so angry with us that means doing

religionislam comes after honour and hospitality and is intimately mingled with thesetwo many stories illustrate the importance of honour in afghanistan and the followingis just one among many 4in the dark days of the ﬁfteenth century when the sultan mohamed shah sent his army from delhi to conquer the afghans the people resistedas ﬁercely as they did against the russians in the twentieth century and the british inthe nineteenth century it was in 1462 that sultan mohamed shahs army moved against the village of sirhind the wily pashtun warriors melted into the hills before the soldiers arrived the indiansfound only handful of women and children in the village and single ancient oldman named malik feroz he was too weak to walk so the soldiers carried him to prisonto be kept at the sultans pleasure for weeks he remained in solitary conﬁnementexpecting death one day the cell door opened and the old man was dragged out of his cell he found himself being washed and dressed in clean clothes you have to be elegant laughed hisjailors for you are to dine with the sultanmalik feroz was amazed to be carried intoaroom ﬁlled with high ofﬁcials and ofﬁcers of sultan mohamed shahs court some versions of the story say it was his governor not the king himself malik feroz was satat table and plied with rich foods that he could not eatnot only because he was tooold to enjoy rich food but also because for weeks in his prison cell he had been givenonly bread and soup then the sultan clapped his hands and called for the entertainment to begin soldiers carried in sacks soaked with blood to the old mans horror they emptied the sacks onthe ﬂoor of the dining hall and he saw they contained the severed heads of pashtunwarriors tears streamed down his cheeks as he realised the hindu army had returnedat night to sirhind and found the village men asleep in their houses the pashtuns askedno mercy ﬁghting to the death and the indian commanders jazrat and malik skandarhad decapitated every one sultan mohamed shah was in good mood he ordered malik feroz to stand and to give him the name of each head though weak and inﬁrm the old man rose to hisfeet and answered the sultan in quavering voice as each head was lifted he gave thename of the man and some information about his bravery then young head wasdownloaded by open university library at 1731 18 july 2008 410 robin edward poulton raised that he said he did not recognise the sultan demanded to know if this was stranger to sirhind village the old man only answered in whisper i do not knowhim the gruesome ritual resumed suddenly as one head was held high for inspection the commander of the attack on sirhind called out i recognise that one he was doughtyﬁghter it took three of us to cut him down now the ofﬁcers were encouraged toparticipate as the old man gave the name of each villager hindu ofﬁcers described howthey had fought each enemy as they neared the end malik feroz realised that somesirhind warriors were missing perhaps they had escaped he muttered prayer to godbegging him to help the survivors avenge his village at last there was only one head left on the ﬂoorthe one malik feroz had said he could not name i recognise that one called out hindu ofﬁcer he was so brave anddetermined that we fought him for an hour he must have killed dozen of my menbefore ﬁnally we were able to wound himyet even when he was on his knees hefought until we cut off his head i also now recognise this head cried the old man he seemed to stand straighter despite the weeks of solitary conﬁnement and the hateful experience of the sultansdinner party malik feroz seemed to have grown new strength this is the head of myown shaheen i would not recognise him to you in case he had not fought bravelynow i hear that he fought like lion against the inﬁdel scum that you are i am proudto proclaim him my so saying malik feroz collapsed and expired on the ﬂoor ofthe dining hall this story and countless others like it are sung by pashtun girls to encourage their brothers in war and blood feuds they illustrate the importance of honour to the afghanpeople and to pashtuns especially the afghan interpretation of islamand especiallythewahibbism of the talibanis entwined with concepts of honour and hospitality the guest is sacred as long as he lives in your house hospitality is sanctuary it is sacredand must be honoured even if the guest turns out to be rival or an enemy you maykill him once he has left your house but you must defend him with your life as longas he is your guest osama ben laden was the guest of the taliban he was even kin to the leader of the taliban oneeyed mullah muhamed omar they were brothersinlaw and sonsinlawfor they had exchanged daughters there was possibility for the taliban to surrenderben laden they were honourbound to defend him with their lives which they diddownloaded by open university library at 1731 18 july 2008 honour guns and jihad 411 the pashtun tribal code of honour if we wish to help central asians build peace and like our way of life we must respect their values and build on their sense of honour at the same time we need to be awareof the divisions between peoplesethnic linguistic historical religious divisions in thecentral mountains of afghanistan for example the hazaras are feared both because theyare shiites and because they are the descendents of the mongol hordes of genghiskhan most afghans follow the hanaﬁte rite of sunni islam rejecting both shiism and wahibbism islam does not unite this region it divides peoples one from the other the taliban are pashtuns pathans pakhtuns from the same ethnic group as sher ali and his nephew abdul rahman khan who created buffer state between the britishand russian empires 5sixty per cent of afghans are not pashtun tajiks and kizilbashes are persian indoeuropeans hazaras and uzbeks turkmens and kirghiz are turcomongols the pashtuns origins are nomadic their ethnic patterns appear semitic andsome afridis even claim descent from the lost tribes of israel 6 the rest of the afghan mosaic of different peoples did not get on well with the taliban the taliban ruled because they had weapons supplied by pakistans interservice intelligence agency isi according to the late ahmed shah masood assassinated on 9 september 2001 with bomb hidden in television camera up to 28000pakistani troops were helping the taliban the pakistani government have denied thisyet the evidence is overwhelming that pakistani professional soldiers commandedtaliban operations in some battles many of massoods pakistanis were probablyalqaida mercenaries osama ben laden iswas an arab and his men were not popularafghans referred angrily to alqaida soldiers as those arabs the ofﬁcial code of honour of the pashtuns called pashtunwali has greatly tributed to deﬁning the taliban brand of islam and its repression of women the pashtun code is based on four fundamental rules 7 hospitality the ﬁrst law of pashtunwali requires the showing of hospitality melmastia to all visitors without hope of remuneration or reward some pashtun claim descent from abrahamand isaac both nomads and this is the law of the desert which for example forbidsanyone to charge for water for water is life this law includes badragga meaning tribal escort for visitors if badragga is violated tribal feud will followdownloaded by open university library at 1731 18 july 2008 412 robin edward poulton revenge the second law of pashtunwali demands the taking of revenge badal over time or over space to avenge wrong here we can recognise the ancient biblical law an eye for aneye tooth for tooth such practice leads eventually to land of blind and toothlesspeople sanctuary nanawatay derives from the verb to go in it is used when the vanquished party seeks refuge or goes to the victors to beg forgiveness there is nanawatay when the dispute involves injury to women torblack cases concern the honour of women torcan only be changed to spin white by death i remember colleague requesting three days leave to pay blood money for his cousin had just killed man as part of 100yearoldblood feud my friend would be the next target for revenge he preferred to offernanawatay evidently women were not involved rules apashtun must obeyto protect his honourdecisions and rules nang of elders and tribal councils jirga the rules include service in the lashkar the tribal army which implements decisions of the jirga nagha is tribal ﬁne imposed upon the wrongdoer by the jirga which can be collected if necessary by the mobilization of lashkar wrongdoer may have his house burned nang includes correct behaviour towards your tarboor cousin who may be rival for female cousins hand in marriage hence the pashtun proverb there is hatred like that between cousins although pashtunwali is very much the code of the pashtuns who live on either side of the afghanpakistan frontier myriad ethnic groups in afghanistan have intermingledover the millennia so that they share many of the same values while the talibansprotestant salafa deobandi interpretation of islam derives from and is bankrolled by saudi wahhibism itisthe mixture of pashtun tribal values and pakistani politics which has made the talibans creed appear so repressive so violent and alien to westernobservers so antiislamic according to many moslem commentators

ﬁrst knife at age seven his ﬁrst riﬂe at age 12 or 14 from thenon he can hunt game and kill enemies the role of islam in afghanistan cannot be overemphasized islam is the umbrella under which all

they havebeen inside afghanistan while displacement has brought women new ideas andexperiences beyond the walls of their husbands house the radicalization of politicalparties by the isi and saudis has
