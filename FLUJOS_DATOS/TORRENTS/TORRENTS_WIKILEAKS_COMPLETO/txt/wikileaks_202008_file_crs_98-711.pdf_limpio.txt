has its own history customs decisionmaking styles procedures jurisdiction and so on what this means for senate markupssessions where committee members consider changes in the text of the measure or matter before themis that these drafting meetings also reflect the personality of each comm ittee to large extent each committee has considerable flexibility in how it goes about marking up measure or matter before it for instance during the 110 th congress committee rules for the senate foreign relations committee stipulate that insofar as practicable proceedings of the committee will be conducted without resort to the formalities of parliamentary procedure by comparison other committees identify detailed procedures for their markup meetings senate rule xxvi clause 2 states that each co mmittee shall adopt rules not inconsistent with the rules of the senate governing the procedure of such comm ittee this requirement however does not mandate strict parallelism between committee rules and senate rules committees need not embrace procedures identical to those applied on the floor of the senate for example supermajority vote is required to invoke cloture in the senate the judiciary committee allows majority of its members to end debate provided that at least one minority lawmaker votes to support this nondebatable motion senate rules however do impose certain limited requirements and prohibitions on committees during the markup stage they specify for instance meeting quorum openness proxy voting and reporting requirements these and other related topics are outlined in senate rule xxvi which is titled committee procedure g15g138g155g148g158g153g561g15g142g142g157g146g151g144g156g561g141g158g155g146g151g144g561g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g21g142g156g156g146g152g151g156g561 committee may not meet on any day 1 after the senate has been in session for two hours or 2 after 200 pm when the senate is in session this prohibition does not apply to the appropriations and budget committees and it may be waived for any other committee either by unanimous consent or by joint agreement of the majority and minority leaders or their designees clause 5 g19g158g152g155g158g150g561g138g157g561g15g142g142g157g146g151g144g156g561

majority vote to close meeting or series of meetings the senate rule enumerates six reasons for closing committee meetings specifically when discussions will involve national security internal staff manageme nt law enforcement agents or information the privacy of an individual the release of trade secrets and matters required to be kept confidential under other legal provisions clause 5 b

adopt rules providing for proxy voting however clause 7 a3 of rule xxvi stipulates that vote of any member of any committee to report measure or matter may be cast by proxy this rule has been interpreted to mean that if physically present committee majority see below votes yes on reporting matter proxies could be cast to change that decision to on the other hand if physically present majority quorum votes on reporting proxies cannot be employed to change that outcome to yes because it would violate the senate rule against reporting measure by proxy votes senate rules further state that proxies may not be voted when the absent committee member has not been informed of the matter on which he or she is being recorded and has not affirmatively requested that he or she be so recorded clause 7 a3 under senate precedents it is not in order to use proxies to establish quorum g24g152g157g142g561g157g152g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g138g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g561g152g155g561g15g138g157g157g142g155g561 senate rules stipulate that measure or matter or recommendation shall be reported from any committee unless majority of the committee were physically present clause 7 a1 further senate rules require the concurrence of majority of the members of the committee who are present to report measure or matter to the floor clause 7 a3 senate precedents prohibit the polling of committee members to report measure or matter

as conducting secret markups contrary to the terms of clause 5 b that impropriety will have effect if committees follow proper procedures for voting to report measures or matters to the floor as clause 7 a3 states action by any committee in reporting any m easure or matter in accordance with the requirements of this subparagraph the majority physically present rule shall constitute the ratification by the committee of all action theretofore taken by the committee with respect to that measure or matter including votes taken upon the measure or matter or any amendment thereto and point of order shall lie with respect to that measure or matter worth highlighting is that many important markup practices are unregulated by formal senate rules one involves the choice usually made by the committee or subcommittee chair of what is to be marked up senate bill house bill the chairs prepared mark or something else for further information see crs report 98311 senate r ules affecting
