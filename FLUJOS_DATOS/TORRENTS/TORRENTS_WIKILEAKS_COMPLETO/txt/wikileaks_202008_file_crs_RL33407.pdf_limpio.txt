and massive support from stateowned tv and other mass media in march 2000 putin was elected president in his own right he won second term four years later putin who was soviet kgb foreign intelligence officer for 16 years and later headed russias federal security service domestic component of the former kgb is an intelligent disciplined statist his priorities appear to be strengthening the central government and restoring russias status as great power putin won early victories over regional leaders reclaiming authority for the central government that yeltsin had allowed to slip away first putin created seven superregional districts overseen by pres idential appointees then he pushed legislation to change the composition of the federation council the upper chamber of parliament body that was comprised of the heads of the regional governments and regional legislatures giving those leaders exclusive control of that chamber and also parliamentary immunity from criminal prosecution with putins changes federation council deputies are appointed by the regional leaders and legislatures but once appointed they are somewhat i ndependent in 2005 th kremlincontrolled parliament gave putin

police arrested khodorkovski in october 2003 prosecutors then froze yukos stock worth some 12 billion khodorkovskis arrest was seen by ma ny as politically motivated aimed at eliminating political enemy and making an example of him to other russian tycoons many observers also saw this episode as the denouement of long power struggle between two kremlin factions businessoriented group of former

president putin propos ed number of changes to the political system promptly approved by the legislature that further concentrated power in his hands necessitated he sai d by russias intensified war against international terrorism he proposed inter alia that regional governor s longer be popularly elected but instead that regional legislat ures confirm the presidents appointees as governors and that all duma deputies be elected on the ba sis of national party lists based on the proportion of votes each party gets nationwide the first measure makes regional governors w holly dependent on and subservient to the president undermining much of what remained of russias nominally federal system the second measure eliminates independent puties further strengthening the pro presidential parties that already controlled an absolute majority in the duma putin and his supporters argued that these meas ures would help reduce corruption in the regions and unify the country the better to fight

putins choice for president in 2008 perhaps as place holde r mechanism that would allow putin to retain control andor return to the presidency after brief interregnum this brought the issue of the putin successi on which had been heating up since 2006 to full boil2 but in russias election cycle the vote for president is preceded by the parliamentary election which is seen as rbinger of the presidential contest the kremlin decided to make the december 2007 parliamentary election referendum on putin and putinism and despite putins apparent genuine popularity they were determined to take chances on the outco in the runup to the duma election the authorities used myriad official and fficial levers of power and influence to assure an overwhelming victory for united russia the main kremlin party putins october 1 2007 announcement that he would r for parliament at the head of the united russia ticket made th outcome doubly sure the statecontrolled media heavily favored united russia and largel ignored or disparaged the opposition opposition party literature was seized and their rallies of ten shut down or harassed potentially popular opposition candidates were bought ff intimidated or barred from running on legal technicalities in march 2007 for example the supreme court ruled that vladimir ryzhkovs republi can party one of the few remaining liberal democratic parties must be disbanded because it violated the 2004 law requiring parties to have at least 50000 members and 45 regional offices russian authorities effectively prevented the main election observing body of the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce from sending an observer team first by limiting their numbe r to 70 compared to 450 osce observers for the previous duma election and then delaying issuance of visas until the last minute thus blocking normal mon itoring of the election campaign the preordained result of the decembe r 2 2007 balloting for the duma was sweep by united russia which reporte dly won 643 of the popular vote and 315 of the 450 seats more than the twothirds majority required to amend the constitution second prokre mlin party just russia widely believed to have been created by kremlin political technol ogists in 2007 to draw leftist votes away from the communists won 774 percent of the vote and 38 seats the platforms of united russia

reputation for rightwing extremism the ldpr is also reliable supporter of putin in the duma thus the kremlin can count on th votes of 393 of the 450 duma deputies the only opposition party in the duma is the communist party which according to the official vote count won 1157 of the vote and 57 seats the remaining parties failed to cross the 7 thre shold required to win seats in the legislature the

90000 votes nationwide in the december 2007 duma electiondespite some allegations of ballotbox stuffing voter intimidation and other irregularities4 there is little doubt that by dint of putins genuine popularity an honest vote count would still have given ited russia resounding victory the main problem with the election was not th vote count but the entire process leading up to the balloting in the words of an osce parliamentary assembly official the executive branch acted as though it practi cally elected the parliament itself on december 10 barely week after the duma election putin announced his choice for president dmitry medvedev one day after his anointment medvedev announced that if elected he would ask putin to serve as prime minister one week later putin formally accepted this offer this carefully choreographed arrangement presumably was meant to assure political continuity for putin and those around him on march 2 2008 medvedev easily won election as russias next president with 70 of the vote the kremlin made sure that the outcome was never in doubt news coverage was skewed overwhelmingly in medvedevs favor especially tv news the principal source of political news for most russians the previous format of allputin all the time was shifted to medvedev5 like putin before him medvedev refused to pa rticipate in public debates with any of his rivals moscow also imposed the same restrictions on th osces election observers as during the duma election with the same result the osce refused to send election observers under the conditions imposed by moscow election commissions in the united states the united kingdom spain france and germany all officially informed moscow that they would not observe the presidential ballot6 the putin regime manipulated election laws and regulations to block inconvenient candidates such as form er prime minister mikhail kasyanov and former chess champion gary kasparov from getting onto the ballot in the end there were three candidates besi des medvedev the ldprs vladimir zhironovsky and the communists longtime leader genna dy zyuganov the fourth was the little known andrei bogdanov leader of the tiny democratic party7 dmitry medvedev the 42 yearold longtime putin protÃ©gÃ© was inaugurated as president on may 7 2008 like putin and many of the kremlin inner circle medvedev is native of st petersburg

many in russia and the west as one of the most liberal of the generally illiberal cadre surrounding putin all agree that he is putin loyalist although there was doubt that medve dev would win the election there is considerable uncertainty about the future relationship between president medvedev and prime minister putin competing scenarios and ru mors abound some speculate that putins obedient duma majority may amend the constitution to shift power from the president to the prime minister but russias superpresidential constitution would require major rewrite to implement that others suggest that president medvedev may voluntarily cede substantial power to prime minister putin allowing the mentor to continue wielding real pow er but such dual power arrangement is viewed by some observers as inheren tly unstable another scenario envisions medvedev resigning after decent interval necessitating new presidential election in which putin would be eligible to run since he would not have served more than two consecutive terms alternatively putin might remain as prime minister for year or two while making sure that medvedev is an able and loyal successor and presumably be prepared to push medvedev aside if the younger man proved unsatisfactory the future is murky chechnya in 1999 islamic radicals based in russi as breakaway republic of chechnya launched armed incursions in to

mostly ethnic russians from other former soviet republics against this background of near colla pse in 1999 macroeconomic indicators began remarkable and sustained recovery this was due partly to the sharp increase in the price of imports and in creased price competitiveness of russian exports caused by the 74 ruble devaluati on in 1998 the surge in the world price of oil and gas also buoyed the
