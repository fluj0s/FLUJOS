management dana shea specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21766 the threat of terrorist detonation of dirty bomb one type of radiological dispersal device rdd has focused public attention on efforts to counter use of this weapon an rdd attack might cause casualties economic damage and potentially public panic though experts disagree on the likely magnitude of each of these effects the impact of an rdd attack would depend on many variables such as meteorological conditions type and amount of radiological material duration of exposure and method of dispersal issues of potential congressional interest include the level of federal funding for research and development of medical countermeasures against rdds and the appropriateness of current standards for environmental decontamination following an rdd attack this report will be updated as events warrant introduction the possibility that terrorist groups might use radiological dispersal device rdd in civilian setting increased government and public concern about such weapons1 this report addresses controversies surrounding the health effects of lowlevel radiation concerns related to decontamination following an rdd attack and issues of federal research into rdd countermeasures rdds are devices other than nuclear explosive device designed to disseminate radioactive material to cause destruction damage or injury2 dirty bomb is one type of rdd in which explosives disperse the radioactive material but in general rdds do not require explosives research indicates that rdds have little effectiveness as military 1 see for example john mintz and susan schmidt dirty bomb was major new years worry the washington post january 7 2004 p a1 2 fema risk management series reference manual to mitigate potential terrorist attacks against buildings fema 426 december 2003 appendix c p c15 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 weapons because of their inability to incapacitate prepared soldiers3 rdds may pose greater threat in civilian setting while there may be few immediate health effects from the dispersed radiological material longterm health risks such as cancer may increase significant economic damage may result should people be unwilling to live or work in an area with higher radiation level experts contend that terrorists are interested in constructing and using rdds4 terrorist group has used an rdd to expose civilians to radiation so the potency of an rdd as terror weapon is untested5 both the threat posed by terrorist rdd use and the magnitude of impact are matters of some contention some experts believe that terrorists could without great difficulty obtain radioactive material and construct an rdd while others assert that obtaining significant quantities of an intense radiation source would be difficult they additionally claim that radiation sources intense enough to cause casualties in an rdd attack would be injurious to the terrorists during acquisition and use most experts agree that few casualties would be likely to directly result from an rdd attack but posit significant economic costs arising from contamination following the attack6 whether terrorists more highly value an rdd due to its potential economic and psychological effects or devalue an rdd due to the inherent difficulties of handling radioactive material combined with httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21766 limited direct casualties is matter of debate7 effects of lowlevel radiation experts disagree on the health effects of lowlevel radiation this debate centers on the validity of extrapolating to low radiation levels the results from scientific studies conducted at higher radiation levels past and current research efforts have not yet led to definitive conclusion regarding the health effects of lowlevel radiation the environmental protection agency epa supports the approach that radiation related health effects can be extrapolated ie the damage caused by radiation exposure 3 iraq reportedly tested oneton rdd in 1987 to assess its military usefulness william j broad document reveals

linearly dependent on the intensity of the radiation and exposure to any amount of radiation causes increased health risks such as an increased probability of developing cancer in contrast others including some professional associations believe that the linear model may overstate the health risks of lowlevel radiation8 some experts maintain that threshold exists below which minimal or ill effects occur supporters of the linear model posit that this model should be used in the absence of definitive experimental evidence since it is the more cautious model supporters of the threshold model point out that safety and regulatory actions that apply to radiation levels below threshold may not be necessary and may greatly increase remediation costs as part of the effort to assess these models the federal government funds scientific research into the health effects of radiation exposure in 2005 the national academy of sciences board on radiation effects research assessing the current scientific literature issued draft report concluding that current scientific evidence supports linear threshold relationship between cancer development and lowdose radiation9 medical countermeasures httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21766 few medical countermeasures exist against rdds exposures and they are limited in scope the department of defense dod has identified treatments that ameliorate the symptoms arising after radiation exposure but do not treat the radiationexposurerelated damage itself for example the dod uses granisetron an antivomiting drug to allow soldiers to complete mission goals following which medical treatment of the radiation effects can be provided10 postexposure medical therapy is designed to treat the consequences of radiation exposure rather than prevent the initial radiation damage medications designed to limit or prevent the damage caused by radiation exposure are called radioprotectants current radioprotectants are intended as preexposure treatments and have limited application if taken after radiation exposure occurs in clinical settings radioprotectants may be used during radiation cancer therapy to reduce damage to healthy tissue11 many compounds provide some degree of radioprotection but those compounds with the highest protection have significant side effects12 also most compounds with high radioprotection require injection for maximum efficacy this 8 for example see health physics society radiation risk in perspective position statement of the health physics society march 2001 9 national research coucil health risks from exposure to low levels of ionizing radiation beir vii phase 2 draft report national academies press washington dc 2005 10 see us department of defense treatment of nuclear and radiological casualties

walker prospects for radioprotection in r i walker and t j cerveny eds textbook of military medicine medical consequences of nuclear warfare falls church va tmm publications office of the surgeon general department of the army 1989 chapter 11 crs4 combination of significant side effects and the need for injection has limited widespread use of these compounds as pretreatments for nonclinical radiation exposure13 many postexposure therapies remove radioactive contaminants from the body thereby limiting the total radiation dose they either block absorption of radioisotopes by internal organs for example potassium iodide decreases radioactive iodine uptake by the thyroid gland or enhance expulsion of radioisotopes through the gastrointestinal tract radioisotope scavenging compounds such as chelators may be given to those who are internally contaminated with specific radioisotope to reduce the time that the radioisotope remains in the body federal medical countermeasure research the federal government sponsors radioprotectant research the dod has longstanding efforts to develop medications allowing soldiers to work in contaminated environments for many years the walter reed army institute of research supported an antiradiation drug development program which provided many candidate radioprotectant molecules14 the armed forces radiobiology research institute afrri is focal point of defense radiobiology expertise and performs research and testing of antiradiation drugs as one component of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21766 its mission15 other federal agencies have been concerned with the development of antiradiation medications as well the national institutes of health have funded research into combination therapies using radioprotective compounds to enhance radiation treatment for cancer patients in 2003 the national institute of allergy and infectious disease organized an expert panel to review and identify areas where specific gaps in rddrelated radiation research and development occur and to generate research priorities to address these gaps16 the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has explored mechanisms of protecting astronauts against radiation in space17 the department of energy is interested in developing treatments and protections for department of energy personnel following radiation or radioisotope release and maintains select inventory of investigational new drug medical countermeasures18 13 for example in 1997 it was recommended to the department of energy that because of its side effects amifostine radioprotectant not be used during plannedfor radiation exposures in emergencies joseph f weiss pharmacologic approaches to protection against radiationinduced lethality and other damage environmental

research activities sponsored by the federal government are several publicprivate partnerships involving cooperative research and development agreements cradas these cradas allow for joint development of prospective medications between federal agencies and private companies for example holliseden pharmaceuticals entered into crada agreement with uniformed services university of the health sciences to develop prospective radioprotectant drug19 radiological contamination some experts believe that the economic and psychological effects from an rdd attack would outweigh the direct medical costs these experts weighing the current guidelines on radiological contamination and the degree of dispersal expected with successful rdd attack state that an rdd attack could contaminate large areas because the dispersal of radiological material would likely be uneven the level of radiation in different areas would vary depending on meteorological factors such as wind speed and precipitation some models of an rdd event have suggested that the release of finely ground httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21766 radiological material might contaminate many city blocks to level higher than the current epa standard20 some analysts suggest such models exaggerate the seriousness of such contamination because they are based on the linear nothreshold radiation standard they claim that concerns related to this level of contamination are overstated and contend that some inhabited areas have naturally occurring background radiation levels higher than the level current epa decontamination standards require oversight issues rddrelated research and development matter of some contention is whether the threat of terrorist rdd use justifies an expansion of federally funded research on antiradiation therapies in addition to dod research performed at afrri the national institutes of health has increased research into nuclear and radiological countermeasures the development of effective medical countermeasures to an rdd attack might have significant health benefits by reducing the number of casualties lower potential casualties might act as disincentive to terrorist acquisition of such weapons health effects from radiological dispersal may vary widely and some analysts assert that the 18 continued found online at httpwwwehdoegovhealthhservicesreactshtml 19 written testimony of richard b hollis founder chairman and chief executive officer of holliseden pharmaceuticals before the house armed services committee subcommittee on military research and development march 12 2002 20 see for example testimony of dr henry kelly president federation of american scientists before the senate committee on foreign relations march 6 2002 crs6 major damage from an rdd attack would likely be economic in nature additional investment in medical countermeasures would not necessarily reduce economic damage21 federal efforts in developing medical rdd countermeasures might serve to reduce the psychological aspects of an rdd attack validated medical countermeasures might reduce public panic and concern about the exposure of first responders to radiation during treatment of casualties alternately similar reduction in the psychological impact of an rdd attack might be achieved through continuing public outreach campaigns22 some companies have urged the department of health and human services hhs to purchase existing rdd countermeasures using project bioshield funds as nuclear and radiological devices have been determined as material threats hhs has issued requests for proposals related to select types of rdd countermeasures through the project bioshield program23 decontamination standards new decontamination standards developed for rdd terrorist incidents may become an area of future congressional interest the department of homeland security issued draft protective action guideline on january httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21766 3 2006 relating to rdd decontamination24 this draft guideline has been criticized as being too lenient and potentially harmful to those residing in areas contaminated by an rdd event25 some analysts claim that the decontamination standards for radiological cleanup are too strict and that much of the cost associated with an rdd attack would come from removal of radiological material that has little health impact they assert that the required decontamination under current standards would likely create large amounts of waste contaminated buildings might need to be destroyed and the rubble removed others view the epa standard as ensuring that adverse health effects arise from longterm exposure to rdd residue adherence to stricter decontamination standard might also serve to reduce public anxieties arising from the psychological component of an rdd attack26 21 for example see richard l garwin the technology of megaterror technology review september 1 2002 22 charles ferguson and william potter with amy sands leonard spector
