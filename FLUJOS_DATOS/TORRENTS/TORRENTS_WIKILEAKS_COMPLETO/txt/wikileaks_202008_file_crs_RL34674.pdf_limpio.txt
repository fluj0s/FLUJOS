and supported by senate democra tic leadership in the nate controversy over tax increases on the oil and gas industry par ticularly over proposed repeal of the tax codes 199 deduction for the major

national objectives is not new but historically us federal energy tax policy promoted the exploration and development the supply of oil and gas the 1970s witnessed 1 significant cutback in the oil nd gas industrys tax preferences 2 the imposition of new excise taxes on oil some of which were subsequently repealed or expired and 3 the introduction of numerous tax preferences for energy conservation the development of alternative fuels and the commercialization of the technologies for producing these fuels renewa bles such as solar wind and biomass and nonconventional fossil fuels such as shale oil and coalbed methane comprehensive energy policy legislati on containing numerous tax incentives and some tax increases on the oil industr was signed on august 8 2005 pl 109 58 the law the energy policy act of 2005 contained about 15 billion in energy tax incentives over 11 years including numerous tax incentives for the supply of conventional fuels as well as for ener gy efficiency and for several types of alternative and renewable re sources such as solar and geothermal the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109 432 enacted in d ecember 2006 provided for oneyear extensions of some of these provisions but some of these energy tax incentives expired on january 1 2008 while othe rs are about to expire at the end of 2008 in early december 2007 it appeared that congressional conferees had reached agreement on another comprehensive energy bill the energy independence and security act hr 6 and particularly on the controve rsial energy tax provisions the democratic leadership in the 110th congress proposed to eliminate or reduce tax subsidies for oil and gas and use the additi onal revenues to increase funding for their energy policy priorities energy efficiency and alternative and renewable fuels that is reducing fossil fuel demand rather than increasing energy oil and gas supply in addition congressional leaders wanted to ex tend many of the energy efficiency and renewable fuels tax incentives that either had expired or were about to expire the compromise on the energy tax title in hr 6 proposed to raise taxes by about 21 billion to fund extensions and liberalization of existing energy tax incentives however the senate on d ecember 13 2007 stripped the controversial tax title from its version of the comprehensive energy bill hr 6 and then passed the bill 868 leading to the presidents signing of the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 on december 19 2007 the only taxrelated provisions that survived were 1 an exte nsion of the federal unemployment tax act surtax for one year raising about 15 billion 2 higher penalties for failure to file partnership returns increasing revenues by 655 million and 3 an extension of the amortization period for geological and geophy sical expenditures from five to sevenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34674crs2 1 see us library of congress congressional research service extension of

currently 6 and is scheduled to increase to 9 when fully phased in by 2010 3 several times the house has approved energy tax legislation and several times in the senate such legislation failed cloture vote nd thus could not be br ought to the floor for debate the latest was hr 6049 the house tax extenders bill which was approved by the house on may 21 2008 but failed three cloture votes in the senate several times recently the senate has been prevented from taking action on energy tax legislation due to the failure to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the house energy tax extenders bills the first was june 10 when the motion failed by vote of 5044 the second was on june 17 when the motion failed by vote of 5244 the thir d was july 29 when the cloture motion failed by vote of 53

the latter provision was the only tax increase on the oil and gas industry in the final bill those three provisions would offset the 21 billion in lost excise tax revenues goin g into the federal highway trust fund as result of the implementation of the revised corporate average fuel economy standards the decision to strip the mu ch larger 21 billion tax title stemmed from white house veto threat and the senates inability to get the votes required to end debate on the bill earlier in the day senate majority leader harry reids dnev effort to invoke cloture fell shor t by one vote in 5940 tally since then the congress has tried several times to pass energy tax legislation and thus avoid the impending expiration of several popular energy tax incentives such as the wind energy tax credit unde r internal revenue code irc 45 which since its enactment in 1992 has lapsed three times only to be reinstated1 several energy tax bills have passed the house but not the senate where on several occasions the failure to invoke cloture failed to bring up the legislation for consideration senate republicans objected to the idea of raising taxes to offset extension of expiring energy tax provisions which they consider to be an extension of current tax policy rather than new ta x policy in additi on senate republicans objected to raising taxes on the oil and gas industry such as by repealing the irc 199 deduction and by streamlining the fo reign tax credit for oil companies2 the bush administration repeatedly threatened to veto these types of energy tax bills in part because of their proposed increased ta xes on the oil and gas industry frustrated with the lack of action on energy tax legislation over the last two years house democrats introduced and appr oved several such bills ch as hr 5351 which was approved by the house on february 27 2008 house speaker pelosi and other democrats sent president bush letter february 28 2008 urging him to reconsider his opposition to the democratic renewable ener gy plan arguing that their energy tax plan would correct an imbalance in the tax code3 at this writing renewed legislative effort is being made to enact energy tax

produced or extrac ted in whole or in significant part in the united states note that extraction is considered to be ma nufacturing for purposes of this deduction which means that domestic firms in the business of extracting oil and gas qualify for the deduction this deduction was enacted under the ameri can jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 also known as the jobs billhr 6899 includes several tax incentives for renewable energy that would reduce revenue by an estima ted 19 billion over 10 years6 at cost of 69 billion over 10 years it extends renewable ener gy production tax credit covering

introduced its own energy tax bill hr 6566 which also extends and expands some of the energy tax incentives and contains tax increases offsets the energy tax provisions in this bill are however smaller and somewhat narrower than those in hr 6899 s 3478 in the senate legislative efforts on energy tax incentives and energy tax extenders center around s 3478 the energy independence and investment act of 2008 40 billion energy tax bill offered by finance committee chairman max baucus and ranking republican charles grassley senate majority leader harry reid said on september 12 that s 3478 is mustpa ss legislation reid told reporters the energy tax package which includes extensions of tax incentives for renewable energy should be prioritized even ahead of the broader energy policy bills being considered and the rest of the nonenergy tax extenders package reid said he hopes to bring the bill to the floor during the week of september 15 but noted that the schedule depends on whether senate republicans will agree to move to the legislation8 while most of the tax incentives in the bill are extensions of existing policy and are not controversial the gislation would need to be paid for through new sources of revenue one proposed offset wh ich has been previously blocked by republicans would repeal the i rc 199 manufacturing deduction for the five major oil and gas producers raising 139 b illion over 10 years the bill also would be paid for through new 13 excise tax on oil and natural gas pumped from the outer continental shelf proposal to liminate the distinction between foreign oil and gas extraction income and foreign ilrelated income and an extension and increase in the oil spill tax through the end of 2017 in total tax increases on the oil and gas industry would account for 31 billi on of the 40 billion total cost of the legislation the final major offset woul d come from requirement on securities brokers to report on the cost basis for tr ansactions they handle to the internal revenue service provision expected to raise about 8 billion in new revenues over 10 years the tax offsets or tax increases in s 3478 are not without controversy however particularly the repeal of th irc 199 manufacturing deduction for the five major oil and gas producers as discussed previously several times the house has approved energy tax gislation and severa l times in the senate such legislation failed cloture vote and thus could not be brought to the floor for debate as noted above republicans have in the past objected to the idea of raising

deduction the bush administration threatened to also veto any energy tax bill that would increase taxes on the oil and gas industry at this writing it appears that inclusion of the 199 deduction repeal as an offset might preclude the energy tax bill from coming to the senate floor some believe that it would fail nother cloture vote so this provision might not survive the process9 finally the
