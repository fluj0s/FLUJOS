authorization and appropriations are required for full settlement implementation legislati on based on the settlement h r 4074 hr 24 and s 27 is pending related bills ve also been introduced key legislative issue is how to finance the settlement specifically how to resolve congressional payasyougo paygo issues other challenges are how to achieve the ttlements dual goals of fisheries restoration and water management and how to address concerns of stakeholders not party to the settlement without disrupting the negotiated agreement the amount of water projected for rest oration flows and the volume of reduced friant water deliveries are related but the relationship would not necessarily be one forone available estimates for total annual friant wate r supplies including both contract and temporary water are on average 15 to 16 less under the settlement than under current operations but such estimates do not account for improvements in water management that might reduce the impact on water users for threequarters of water contractors the reduction woul d represent reduction in one of their available sources of water the impacts of such reductions will vary by contractor depending on the firmness of existing rface water supplies and the reliability of groundwater supplies how to offset the decrease and who would pay for investments in other water s ources and improved efficiency has not been determined although the region may benefit from in creased recreational expenditures and investment in river rest oration activities under the ttlement studies suggest its largest and mostly negative economic impact would be on the agriculture industry at least in the short term in addition dow nsteam interests not party to the settlement have been concerned about increased flooding groundwater infiltration and competition with existing federal financial commitments nearby communities fear harm to groundwater quantity and quality some of these concerns have been addressed in the legislati on but some remain on th other hand some communities and interests believe restoration will bring other benefits to the river such as improved surface water qua

large chinook salmon populations since the bureau of reclamations friant dam on the san joaquin river became fully operational in the 1940s much of the rivers water has been diverted for agricultural uses as result approximately 60 miles of the river is dry in most years making it impo ssible to support chinook salmon populations in the upper reaches of the river in 1988 coalition of conservation and fishing groups advocating for river restoration to suppor t chinook salmon recovery sued the bureau of reclamation hereafter referred to as reclamation whic h owns and operates friant dam natural resources defense council v rodgers 1 most longterm water service contractors who receive the diverted water were added to the case shortly thereafter as defendant intervenors us district court judge has since ruled that operation of friant dam violates state law because of its destruction of downstream fisheries faced with mounting legal fees considerable uncertainty and the possibility of dramatic cuts to water diversions parties agreed to negotiate settlement instead of proceed ing to trial on remedy re garding the courts ruling in september 2006 settlement agreemen t was reached

authorization and appropriations implementation legislation based on the settlement hr 4074 hr 24 and s 27 is currently pending other san joaquin water management bills have also been introduced eg hr 3768 and hr 2498 under the settlement increased water flows for restoring fisheries would reduce diversions of water for offstream purpos such as irrigation hydropower and municipal and industrial uses the quantity of water used for restoration flows and the quantity by which water deliveries would be reduced are related but the relationship would not necessarily be onefo rone for instance in some of the wettest years flood water releases coul d provide significant amount of the restoration flows thereby lowering the reduction in deliveries to agricultural and municipal users under the settlement water would be released for restoration purposes in the driest of years thus re ductions in deliveries to friant contractors would be made due to the settlement in those years additionally in some years the restoration flows released in late winter and early spring may free up space for additional runoff in millerton lake potentially minimizing reductions in deliverieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs2 2 house and senate budget rules require offs ets for certain spending measures including those that include new mandatory direct spe nding finding an offset that is reducing spending elsewhere to fund new program especially one for several hundred million dollars is an often difficult tasklater in the year assuming millerton lake storage is replenished consequently how deliveries to friant wate r contractors might be reduced in any given year would depend on many factors regardless of the specifics of how much water might be released for fisheries restoration visàvis water diverted for offstream purpos there will be impacts to existing surface and groundwater supplies in and around the friant division service area and adjustments in local economie s although some opposition to the settlement and its implementing legislation remains the largest and most directly affected stakeholders ie the majority of friant water contractors

filed with the us district court ea stern district of ca lifornia september 13 2006 the settlement agreement was accepted by the district court on october 23 2006 the stated goals of the settlement

reduce or avoid adverse water supply impact s to the friant longterm water service contractors that may result from both inte rim flows and restorative flows provided in the settlement to accomplish these go als the settlement calls for numerous actions some of which need congressional authorization and appropriations further appropriations authorization is needed to finance settlement

and 11 b illion federal funding for these projects and activities is s ought by the parties and is contemplated under the settlement federal budgetary and funding issues as well as the viability of attaining the water management goal appear to be key points of contention at this stage for example funding mechanisms included in the current legislation would require budgetary offset under congressional paygo rules according to some difficult task in todays budget clima an overall complication for congress in considering san joaquin settlement legislation is that although th settlement aims to end 19 year lawsuit and comports with court ruling the settlement would affect others outside the friant division rvice area another complication is the prospect that funding for the san joaquin river ttlement may divert funds from salmon restoration projects in other river basins lastly other recent events potentially limiting water exports from the sacramento and san joaquin rivers delta confluence could significantly affect implementation of the recirculation portion of the water management goal and has caused increas ed concern among some stakeholders these issues among othe

populations in good condition in the mainstem of the san joaquin river below friant dam to the confluence of the merced river including naturallyrepr oducing and selfsustaining populations of salmon and other fish and 2 water ma nagement goal to reduce or avoid adverse water supply impacts to all of the friant division longterm contractors that may result from the interim flows and re storation flows provided for in this settlement in agreeing to these goals parties ac knowledged that the historical operation of friant dam resulted in significant portions of the san joaquin river drying up in most years with detrimental consequences for fisheries downstream from friant dam they also agreed that achieveme nt of the restoration goal by 2025 may not accomplish all desired results but that effort s to achieve such results would result in public benefits eg improved downstream water quality and increased recreational opportunities they furthe r acknowledged that the implementation of the ttlement would occur over many years and agreed to cooperate in good faith to achieve the dual goals of the settlement some obligations are spelled out in the settlement moreover the settlement establishes framework for accomplishing ttlement goals through activities such as environm ental review desig n and construction restoration goal restoring san joaquin river fisheries is the aim of the restoration goal and several details and obligations are included in the settlement agreement parties acknowledge that ach ievement of the re storation goal will require combination of channel and stru ctural improvements along the river below friant dam as well as additional releases of water from the dam the settlement lists several improve ments to be implemented later than december 13 2013 with certain allowances for events beyond the c ontrol of the secretary of the interior these phase i improvements relate to modifying and improving the capacity of the san joaquin river to accommodate new releases and range from creating bypass channel around existing facilities to screening various canal entrances and modifying structures to provide fish passage second set of improveme nts phase ii would include further channel modifications andor isolati on of certain gravel pits this second set of improve ments would be completed not later than december 31 2016 also subject to appropriations and even ts beyond the control of the secretary the settlement also calls for specific restoration flows additional releases of water from friant dam in accordance with certain

commencement of restoration flows following period of interim flows sp ring and fallrun chinook salmon would be reintroduced by later than spring of 2012 restoration goal issues although significant sums have already been spent on ecosystem restoration activities in the san joaquin river watershed there is comprehensive including the upper san joaquin river program for specifically restoring san joaquin chinook salmon such as that contemplated under the settlement many of th founding principles of th settlement rely on existing salmon restoration studies conducted over the last decade or more these studies have been carried out by variety of s ources including the federal government local entities academics consulting groups and ex pert witnesses some of which have been hired by different parties to the settlement studies and expert reports that focused on water flows for salmon restoration ultimately led to the restoration flow levels established under th settlement however some uncertainties remain for example while there has been much disc ussion and study of historical springrun chinook salmon levels and the potential fo r their reintroduction some of which appears to be based on othe r relevant cases of salmon restoration in california there appears to be still some uncertainty as to whethe r flows established under the settlement and other ttlement efforts will be sufficien t to successfully reestablish chinook salmon populations in the upper san joaquin river expert reports and rebuttals prepared during litigation have identified and evaluated numerous factors relevant to the successful reintroduction of chinook salmon to the san joaquin river given the complexity in the species life cycle and the complexity of the factors which infl uence its survival restoration success cannot be predicted nor guaranteed with certainty among the more important factors are the quantity water flow and its timing fish passage and diversion entrainment water temperature and levels of dissolved oxygen water quality holding habitat spawning habitat and stock lection and genetics because chinook salmon in the upper san joaquin river would be at the extreme sout hern extension of th eir historical range all or many factors may need to be favorable to permit this species to complete its migratory life cycle while some contend that all these factors indeed can be favorable others point out that all these factors many beyond human control may not be favorable in any single year lead ing to population stress and decline if not total failure in some years the questi on could reasonably be asked whether factors will be favorable in enough years to allow periodic migratory success sufficient to sustain chinook salmon population in the san joaquin river bove its confluence with the merced river the san joaquin river restoration will be complicated in several respects eg size of area to be restored southern limit of the species range potential lack of unique genetic stock13 extreme degradation of existing habitat and potential climatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs11 13 continued that genetic capability given suitable habitat conditions anadromous fish generally possess the capacity and capability to successfully ad apt and colonize new habitat or recolonize historical habitat 14 there are several different types of contract s used in the friant division some receive water on higher priority basis than others and therefore are considered more firm than others some are for longterm deliveries and some are temporary oneyear contracts for more information on the variety of contracts nd definitions of class i class ii and 215 continuedchange concerted attempts to restore salmon habitat in the sacramento and san joaquin river basins have produced encouraging results and success in some cases but total success has been hard to claim in the short time these restoration efforts have been underway as many of thes projects have been conducted on small drainage areas it would seem there is little precedent in california for the major restoration effort contempl ated for the san joaquin river on the other hand it could be argued that extensive restorati on efforts in the klamath river basin have in all but one case at least maintained r uns and avoided listing under the federal while many other nearby popul ations have been listed water management goal the water management goal as outlined in the settlement includes two key parts 1 an agreement to develop and implement plan for the recirculation recapture reuse and exchange or tr ansfer of restoration flows for the purpose of reducing or avoiding impact s to friant longterm contractors and 2 establishment of recovered water account to make up for water losses experienced by friant longterm contractors water made available by the secretary under the new account would be priced at tota l cost of 10 per acrefoot to implement the water management goal the settlement provides for water accounting system whereby the secretary of the interior is to monitor and record reductions in water deliveries to friant di vision longterm contractors that have not been made up by recirculation recapture reus exchange or transfer of restoration flows or replaced or offset by other wate r programs or projects undertaken or funded to mitigate water delivery impacts caused by the restoration flows water management goal issues some fear that water deliveries for off stream purposes will be reduced direc tly in oneforone fashion to create restoration flows however as anticip ated under the settlement the relationship of increased restoration flows and water deliver diversions would not necessarily result in 11 tradeoff for example in some years much of the restoration flows might be met with floodwaters also under the settlement water woul d be released for restoration purposes in the driest of year s thus reductions in friant deliveries would be made due to the settlement additionally it appears friant managers may have considerable flexibility in managing supplies and balancing deliveries with othe r available sources how much less water friant contractor s might receive will depend on several factors how much is needed for restoration flows bas ed on specific water flow recommendations included in the

to make up losses from the recovered water account further the overall impact on individual water users will depend in part on their access to othe r available water supply sources other than deliveries from friant dam using two available data sources15 which do not account for improvements in water management that may dampen the settlements impact on agricultural and municipal users it appears th at annual water supplies for the friant division service area would be on average 15 to 16 less under the settlement than average supplies under current operating protocols see appendix for an analysis of available estimates of water supply reductions and desc ription of data sources although the average reduction could be 15 to16 water suppl reductions could range from reduction to as high as 34 reduction in some years the total average annual reduction in the volume of water delivered under the settlement is estimated to be 204 thousand acrefeet ta f or 225 taf depending on the source steiner 2005 and bor 2006 respectively these estimates include cutbacks in temporary water that is made available in wetter years ie water that is not contracted for on longterm basis in other words this estimate includes reduction in both contract water and mporary water delivered by the friant division these estimates can probably be viewed as an upper limit to average reductions that might occur under the settlement the av erage annual reduction in the longterm water service contract deliveries ie not including temporary deliveries under the settlement is estimated at 144 taf less than average annual longterm contract supplies without the settlement16 almost half of the friant contractors have access to other nonfriant surface water supplies mostly from local river and stream sources17 and 75 use groundwater supplies therefore for three quarters of the contractors the reductions in friant division deliveries represent re duction in one of multip supplies the level of reductions experienced by indivi dual water districts would vary depending on their water service contracts that is the reduced delivery experienced in given year by an individual water district w ould largely depend on how firm is thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs13 18 see appendix for description of the different types of contracts and water suppliesdistricts friant wa ter supply contract18 contracts with first priority delivery known as class i contracts generally are held by the districts which serve municipalities and agricultural users without sources to other supplies areas often in the foothills not underlain with adequate or re liable groundwater supplies existing data assume reclamation re duces supplemental water deliveries before first priority deliveries these da ta estimate that aver age annual reductions in the friant division longterm water servi ce contract water deliv eries for individual friant water districts would range betw een 5 and 27 the low range being cutbacks to contractors with relatively firm er friant division contract supplies 46 of contractors and the high range appli cable to those with only supplemental friant division contract supplies 7 of contractors all distri cts with supplemental friant division contracts known as class ii cont racts have groundwater or other surface water supplies so the reduction in fria nt deliveries under th settlement would represent reduction in one of their supplies regardless of the specifics of how much water might be released for fisheries restoration visavis water diverted for offstream purposes there will be impacts to existing surface and groundwater supplies in and around the friant division service area pertinent questions to which ther are obvious answers are how will water users adapt how much water might be regained and at what cost possibilities exist to partially offset wer offstream deliver ies through water conservation efficiency measures wate r transfers and marketing groundwater storage and new infrastructure however at this time it is unclear to what extent these measures could mitigate the lower deliveries at what cost and which measures might occur as part of the settlements water management goal or as part of other state and local water development effo rts such as expanded groundwater banking and conjunctive use federal financing the settlement includes several new financing mechanisms san joaquin restoration legislation based on the settlement hr 24 and s 27 would authorize and direct the s ecretary of the interior to implement terms and conditions of the settleme nt in cooperation with the state of california and authorize appropriations to carry out fede ral responsibilities wh ile the legislation includes an authorization of 250 million in appropriations it also includes several provisions involving new funding mechan isms which once established would not be subject to annual appr opriations by congress rather funding via these mechanisms would provide sources of dedicated funding to implement the agreement although funding provision nguage included in proposed legislation in exhibit of the settlement differs so mewhat from the funding provisions in hr 24 and s 27 it appears the funding mechanisms themselves are not substantively different issues because the settlement funding re lies on redirecting existing federal revenues from the friant division into new permanent restoration account among other financing mechanisms the legislation has run into difficulties regarding itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs14 19 farmlevel value does not include retail value markup or value added through food processing data taken from the us dept of agriculture census of agriculture continuedfinancing provisions cbo has estimated the total federal share of the program as outlined in hr 24 to be 500 million 430 million through 2017 and another 70 million through 2026 see congressional budget office hr 24 san joaquin river restoration settlement act cbo cost estimate april 18 2007 because the bill includes new direct spending it would re quire an offset for such spending under congressional paygo rules re storation sponsors have been working to reduce the bills budget score and therefore reduce th potential offset needed however any change in the settlements financing formulas would require new agreement among the settling parties and may prove difficult additional issues water supply impacts may also have both positive and negative economic consequences review of other water supply reduction studies suggest the settlement would have the largest and mostly negative effect on the agriculture industry at least in the short term because most of the water diverted from the san joaquin river is curren tly used to irrigate crops however it is not clear how much efforts to re duce water supply losses will also mitigate agricultural production losses on the other hand the region may benefit from increased recreational expenditures and inve stment in san joaqui n river restoration activities as well as increased downstream water supply and wa ter quality benefits the settlement will also affect communities and interests not party to the settlement for example friant division water users would likely experience reduced water deliveries but the new water releases would affect downstream communities and landowners fart her north who were not party to the lawsuit the majority of the san joaquin riverbed areas that would experience increased flows under the settlement are not adjacent to nd are mostly distant from the friant division service area see figure 2 similarly comm unities and landowners adjacent to lands served by friant division water might experience changes in groundwater quality and availability and incr eased prices for substitute water another complication is the prospect th at funding for the san joaquin river settlement may divert funds from salmon restoration pr ojects in other river basins in particular trinity rive r restoration proponents are co ncerned that san joaquin river restoration as contem plated under the settlement nd implementing legislation might result in less funding for trinity river restoration these third party concerns including possible groundwater supply impacts are discussed below agricultural impacts the san joaquin valley is among the nations most productive farming regions ranked by va lue of production four of eight san joaquin counties fresno lare kern and

are substantial differences in reporting criteria and analyti cal approaches across each of the studies making such estimates difficult to compare andor validate in addition estimated economic social and envir onmental benefits are disp ersed across broad segments of californias population there is similarly high degree of variability due to constraints related to methodology or data as repor ted in the studies that use economic models to quantif the potential farm and re gional economy effects most studies agree that reduction in available irrigation water supplies could lower gross farm revenue because of expected reductions in crop acreage andor yield studies that most closely approximate proposed reductions under the settlement those focusing on estimated effects for reductions of up to 200000 acrefeet annually in the sjv often employ similar methodological approach but with differing underlying assumptions and data spanning range of possible scenarios and outcomes and often resulting in wide range of estimated costs and benefits accordingly these studies report range of estimated farm impacts some studies further project lower farm profits and hi gher operating costs as well as negative economic impacts to the broader regional economy and job markets some studies report that these economic costs will likely be offset by other economic and societal benefits or other mitig ating gains in the farm support services or nonfarm sectors for example estimates of the potential loss in gross farm revenue from reductions in acreage andor yield range from about 40180 million per year spanning possible outcomes during full wa ter year and drought year excluding one highend drought year estimate under one of the studies examined only two of the studies reviewed by

other studies estimate job losses ranging from 3200 to 10400 finally onl two of the studies reviewed by crs estimate the potential ec onomic benefits or offse tting gains under the settlement one study reports substantial monetary bene fits approaching 18 billion annually another reports possible nonfarm gains that exceed estimated costs with net gains to the broader economy of 126 million during drought year see appendix b for summary of the studies the substantial differences in reporting cr iteria and analytical approaches across these studies make such estimates difficult to compare andor validate as result the estimated adverse economic effects and costs to the agricultural sectors under the settlement based on these studies should be viewed with caution these estimated changes in farm economic indicators ba sed on these studies also should not be assumed to be cumulative each year since these results do not take into account for the likelihood that farmers would take st eps to adjust to permanent water reallocation and such studies do not ta ke into account potential recirculation recapture and reuse or other water suppl mitigation efforts contemplated under the settlement nonagricultural economic impacts there may be positive and negative economic consequences of implementing the settlement other than those immediately related to friant contractor s concerned with agriculture and those of potential third parties possible economic effects include 1 potential costs to municipalities for replacing lost water supplies 2 potential costs related to lost power generation 3 potential benefits associated with enhanced recreational opportunities 4 benefits associated w ith improvements in water quality 5 public benefits associated with existence of environmental quality improvements and 6 economic impact s related to restoration projects there may also be positive or negative changes in land use values for land abutting the restored river while experts testifying prior to the settlement noted potential municipal water costs of approximately 78000 and power costs of approximately 12 million annually21 other experts have estimated increased recreational and scenic benefits ranging from 174 to 452 milli on annually22 further existence values the value that some place on restored river regardless of whether they actually use

of representatives sept 21 2006resource are estimated in at least one study to range from 16 billion to 17 billion23 in general significant costs and benefits are expected to result from implementation of the settlement costs of the settlement are concentrated in agriculture and several other sectors while the benefits related to existence and recreation are dispersed over broad segmen ts of the california population ideally comparisons of costs and benefits across all affected sectors and parties should be assessed to inform policy options yet expert reports reflected uncertainties related to data and modeling unsta ted or uncertain underlying assumptions and insufficient information to replicate results costs and benefits cannot be readily compared because of the lack of standards and c ontinuity in and among expert reports third party impacts communities dependent on groundwater supplies are also concerned about potential ffects on groundwater quantity and quality while most communities in the area have adequate groundwater supplies some do not similarly downstream communities and water and power users outside the friant division service area are concerne d about potential settle ment effects such as increased flooding groundwater infiltra tion competition with existing financial commitments and management of threatened and endangered species and their effect on managing land and facilities the settlement agreement states that the parties do not intend to adversely affect others who were not party to the settlement however changes in water use in the area served by the friant division may affect resources and their use in other areas actions directly affec ting specific group or interest are also likely to affect neighboring interests throug h legal market and in stitutional interactions when the settlement was disseminated some landowne rs and entities not party to the agreement expressed concern about the settlements poten tial effects on their interests the house resources commi ttee convened hearing on september 21 2006 in part to address many of the c oncerns brought forward by these third parties24 list of potential third party concerns regarding implementation of the settlement identified during the hearing included potential flooding and loss of crops and property in areas without adequate river channels

implement ation and other nonsan joaquin restoration projects eg trinity river restoration after the september 21 2006 hearing thir d parties were asked for suggestions to revise draft implementing legislation for the settlement negotiations among the settling parties the state of california and several third parties resulted in an agreement to modify the draft legislation that had been included in the stipulated settlement agreement at subsequent hearing of the house natural resources subcommittee on water and power on marc h 1 2007 testimony of several third parties suggested that many of their previ ous concerns were reso lved in the modified legislation hr 24 and s 27 introduced in the 110th congress while many third party issues appear to have been addressed some others remain groundwater issues for friant division contractors and nearby third parties who use groundwater decreased cl ass ii water supplies may be among the more important impacts from the settlement class ii supplies are often used by water users in lieu of groundwater pumpin g or to recharge groundwater supplies some fear that increased groundwater pum ping to replace the decreases in surface supplies may degrade groundwater quality esp ecially for water systems currently of marginal quality settlement participants anticipate that such impacts would be limited by the component of the settlement that requires the development and implementation of plan to recirculate recapture reuse exchange or transfer water released for restoration flows significant uncertainties exist however as key options including some proposed projects to recapture and recirculate restoration flows would be subject to regulatory limitations and existing water delivery commitments and priorities as well as available funding others are concerned that restorati on flows down the san joaquin river may degrade shallow groundwater quality beneath the river particularly in the lower reaches waterlogging of soils and leaching of salt already present in the soil are some key concerns in add ition infiltration of restoration flows especially in the upper reaches of the river seems likely to be substantial underground diversions groundwater pumping from wells near th river of the infiltrated water may increase infiltration rates bove the estimates in the settle ment this potential was explicitly addressed by the parties in the settlement article 13c however it is unclear how it may progress in practice any actions taken to curtail increased infiltration from groundwater pumping ma introduce conflict between groundwater users and parties to the ttlement charged with redre ssing underground diversions this potential conflict while beyond the scope of this re port may also raise legal questions regarding how the state of ca lifornia views surface water and groundwater interactions in sum the possible impacts that settlement implementation may have on groundwater quality and quantity are difficult to assess as such effects will depend on substantial set of variables and uncertainties while it is certain that the restoration of flows from friant dam millerton lake to the san joaquin river will lead to changes in the way water is mana ged in the region what is not known is what specific water management changes might result and how water users might adapt to reductions in water deliv eries increased dependence on groundwater as water source in southern sjv potentially coul d worsen the quality of groundwater as shallow irrigation wells recirculate groundw ater and further c oncentrate dissolvedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs19 solids and other contaminants this could degrade water quality in local drinking water wells and irrigation wells many of which are already of marginal quality there is expectation however that reduced surface water flows to the friant division ultimately will lead to more efficient use of water through continuing improvements in operations in frastructure and water mana gement practices at the same time increased river flows could raise the groundwater table and improve groundwater quality outside the friant divi sion service area beneath reaches of the river where groundwater quality is currently impaired concluding remarks and the larger policy context the settlement agreement and subsequent implementing legislation are the culmination of nearly two decades of disc ussion argument and study on whether and how to restore fisheries below friant dam federally owned and operated facility on the san joaquin river the most recent actions relate to court decision that reclamation is operating the dam in violati on of california state fish and game code the implications of this decision are far reaching for california water management and for both the directly affected water users and the indirectly affected communities landowners and water users several broad policy issues are raised by the settlement these issues partially derive from constraints imposed by the pressure to react to settlement responding to j udicial ruling as opposed to managing or legislating on an issue prior to or absent such settlement another overarching issue is how san jo aquin river manageme nt ties into other cvp management decisions as well as state and local water systems both the cvp and state water project swp largely parallel state water supply system south of the baydelta are operating under regulations that limit the am ount and timing of water that can be exported south out of the baydelta recent court decisions regarding the health of threatened delta smelt may constrain such future exports the degree to which some of the water management goals identified in the settlement might rely on moving water in and out of the baydelta could affect the ultimate ability to recapture recirculate ndor reuse san joaqui n river restoration flows at minimum it appears the restora tion effort will necess itate multiyear water planning and investments including havi ng the funding on hand and infrastructure in place to buy and put to use surplus wa ter eg for groundwater recharge and to buy water in dry years for those without sufficient access to groundwater those with primarily class ii supplies or in the driest of years therefore the future of water resource management in the central valley is not just conjunctive water management but multiyear conjunctive management with the financial resources to make it happen in addition to integration of federal state local and private infrastructure projects wh ether congress addresses this issue in california and elsewhere given current water resource authorization and ppropriations practices and restrictive budgetary c limate remains to be seen while the issues discusse d here have confronted prior administrations and congresses settlement agreement was t reached until the us district court acted ultimately resulting in the difficult choices facing congress today eg budgetary water delivery and ecosystem h ealth tradeoffs this is common dilemma for resource agencies implementin g projects and programs which are based on societal and political tradeoffs made decades ago eg agricultural industry over commercial and sport fishing industries or timber harves t over species habitat ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs20 is hard to say what is fair or just when such significant tradeoffs were made decades ago causing harm to some but providing be nefit to others who then made financial and livelihood decisions based on those polic ies in the eyes of many the san joaquin river restoration is an effort to respond to fisheries economic and ecological damage begun 60 years ago for others the potential of reduced water supplies for off stream use is breach of promises made 60 years ago for the court it is matter of friant dam operations com porting with state law httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs21 appendix analysis of existing water supply impacts data introduction to the analysis and summary of results the settlement would use sa n joaquin river water wh ich in recent history has been diverted and delivered to friant division contractors for offstream uses to maintain instream flows in the san jo aquin river for fish restoration the settlement would reduce friant water deliveries to water districts absent offsetting measures that is the settlement would redistribute portion of the annual water supply away from agricultural and municipal wa ter districts to achieve the restoration flows based on hydrographs agreed to under the settlement in given year how much less water would be available for offs tream uses in the friant division service area would depend largely on how much water would be released for fish restoration following prot ocol established in the settle ment the restoration flows would be determined annually ba sed on the basins estimated runoff for the year under the settlement restoration flows would be higher in wetter years and lower in drier years the quantity of water used for restoration flows and the quantity by which water deliveries would be reduced are related but the relationship would not necessarily be oneforone for instance in some of the wettest years flood water releases could provide sign ificant amount of the restora tion flows thereby lowering the reduction in deliveries to agricultural and municipal users under the settlement water would be released for restoration purposes in the driest of years thus in those years reductions in friant deliveries would be made due to the settlement as part of its analysis of the settlement agreement crs collected and reviewed available information on the effects that proposed increased releases for fish restoration from friant dam could have on future deliver ies by the friant division few data are available on what actions r eclamation or water users might take to mitigate reduced friant water deliveries guidelines and other specifics regarding settlement implementation remain to be determined although broad conceptual papers are available decisions on one or mo re courses of action have not been made therefore the analysis in this appendix is limited to existing data and estimates of water supplies which do not account fo r water supply management measures that could reduce the effects of the settlement on agricultural and municipal water users the analysis largely relies on two available data sets on the estimated reductions to friant water supplie s under the settlement expert report of daniel b steiner effects to water supply and friant operations resulting from plaintiffs friant release requirements september 16 2005 hereafter referred to as steiner 2005

table released december 2006 hereafter referred to as bor 2006 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs22 25 both sources use the millerton lake drainage areas past runoff conditions to illustrate the impact that the settlement might have on c ontract water supplies using actual historic allocations as starting point bor 2006 recalculates what contract water supplies ie supplies to class i contractors class ii ctors and for 215 contracts might have been in the past if restoration releases under th settlement had been in place for 1957 through 2005 the analysis in bor 2006 combines class ii and 215 water supplies by using historic allocations as starting point the bor 2006 data set does not necessarily reflect current reclamation procedures for deciding allocations and it reflects anomalies and changes in operating protocols that would not n ecessarily be replicated in the future for example 1958 was year with high runoff in the basin current operations would result in some class ii and 215 allocations bor 2006 does not show any such deliveries because in 1958 these types of contracts were not in use class ii contracts were not active until 1962 and 215 water was first available mid1995 another example is from 1998 the relatively low allocations in 1998 partially resulted from kings river water being pumped into the friant kern canal to reduce flood potential in the kings river basin the bor 2006 estimate includes data on the contract water supplies under the settlement both with and without the 10 buffer flows in contrast steiner 2005 uses historic runoff data for 1922 through 2003 to model water diversion and delivery under the settlement the modeling applies current water management re gimes and contracts with and without the settlement to the historic runoff data in othe r words steiner 2005 applies the current class ii and 215 contracts to the entire 1922 to 2003 time peri od unlike bor 2006 the analysis in steiner 2005 distinguishes betwee n class ii and 215 contracts although some data for 2004 are available in steiner 2005 the last year for which steiner 2005 presents complete analysis is 2003 the model used in steiner 2005 accounts for the distinction between runoff water year oct to sept the restoration flow year feb to jan and the contract year march to fe b bor 2006 simplified its analysis by not differentiating between the various kinds of timeframes inst ead basing the entire analysis on the runoff water year oct to septthe two data sets are not identical and both have some limitations for purposes of this analysis crs used the most comparable elements of the data sets for the analysis presented herein25 the analysis herein was performed using both data sets when possible however many of the fi gures in this appendix present information from only one data set even thoug h the data are imperfect the timates were made assuming changes in friant dam or other central va lley project cvp operations changes in water use effi ciency and other actions that might mitigate reduced friant water supplies they give some idea of the range of changes that water users might ex perience under the settlement using available data which does not account for any improvements in water management that may reduce the settlements impact on agricultural and municipal users it appears that annua l water supplies for the friant division service area would be on average 15 to 16 less under the settle ment than average supplies under current operating protocols alt hough the average reduction could be 15 to16 water supply reductions could range from reduction to as high as 34 reduction in some years the total average annual reduction in the volume of water delivered ie reduction in bot h contract water and tempor ary water delivered by the friant division under the settlement is timated to be 204 thous and acrefeet taf or 225 taf depending on the source ste iner 2005 or bor 2006 respectively less than average annual supplies without the settlement these average timates include cutbacks in temporary water that is made available in wetter years but thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs23 26 us dept of the interi or bureau of reclamation water needs assessment 2004is not contracted for on longterm basis and thus these estimates can be viewed as an upper limit to average reductions that might occur under the settlement the average annual reduction in longterm water service contract water deliveries ie not including temporary deliv eries under the settlement is estimated at 144 taf less than average annual longterm contract supplies without the settlement steiner 2006 almost half of the friant contractors have access to other nonfriant surface water supplies mostly from local river and stream sources26 and 75 use groundwater supplies therefore for at least threequarters of the contractors the reductions in friant division deliveries represents reduction in one of multiple supplies however because it is difficult to get reliable data on all nonfederal water supply source the extent of other supp lies and their accessab ility and reliability is unclear in some cases both other surf ace and groundwater supplies appear to be substantial in other cases not table a1 shows the diversity of water supplies however nonfederal supplie s are not quantified the level of reductions experienced

for individual friant water dist ricts would range between 5 and 27 the low range being cutbacks to contractors with relativel firmer friant divi sion contract supplies 46 of contractors and the high range applicable to those with only supplemental friant division contract supplies 7 of c ontractors all districts with supplemental friant division contracts ve access to groundwater or other surface water supplies possible actions that may partially offs et reduced offstream deliveries include water conservation efficiency measures water transfers and marketing groundwater storage and banking water pricing eg the recovered water account and new infrastructure however at this time it is unclear to what extent these measures could mitigate the lower deliveries at what cost and which measures might occur as part of the settlements water management goal or as part of other state or local water development efforts further so class ii supplies are used in lieu of pumping groundwater to recharge gr oundwater and to c onjunctively manage seasonal or yearly water supplies because of this complexity it is unclear what effect water conservation and efficiency measures which could reduce inflows to groundwater might have on longterm wa ter demands and s upply management the first part of this appendix provide s an overview of water supplies in the friant division service area

data that illustrate not only the average annual water supply reductions under the settlement but also th variation that might be experienced annually this appendix doe s not discuss specific eff ects of the settlement on groundwater supp lies and potential economic impacts of water reductions and increased restoration flow where reductions in water supply are discussed they are relative to longterm average water deliver ies not the full amount of water supply contracts water supplies in the fria nt division service area the friant division service area of th cvp extends from just north of the mercedmadera county line north of the san joaquin river southeast to bakersfield ca see figure 2 much of the area is natura lly wellendowed with both surface and groundwater supplies nd has benefitted from extens ive federal investment in the development of surface water supplies as well as investment in private and public gr oundwater recharge projects the wa ters of the serv ice area support substantial farm and food pr ocessing economy as well as growing population the area is bisected by several large rivers and streams the largest surface water source for the friant division

area is rela tively rich in water resources compared to much of the west groundwater overdraft s been perennial pr oblem since the area was intensely developed for agriculture early in the 20th century runoff entering millerton lake ie th millerton lake drainage area averages 1700 taf but can vary widely from 1922 th rough 2004 runoff has varied from low of 362 taf in 1977 to high of 4642 taf in 1983 steiner 2005 this large variation can lead to management difficulties particularly in extremely dry and extremely wet years millerton lake has cap acity of approx imately 500 taf27 which is insufficient to provide multiyear storage as c onsequence of its capacity the reservoir is operated on an annual basis nd may refill multiple times in wet year because the lake does not have

obligations downstream ie releasing water to the river only as necessary to meet downstream water right obligations and to manage flood waters because wate r deliveries to the friant division after downstream water right oblig ations are met are maximized each year some reaches of the riverbed remain dry during portions of many years according to the 2004 ruling of the us district court eastern

data sets crs ge nerally does not differentiate between the allocations and deliveries this appendix generally refers generically to water supplies bor 2006 presents data on reductions in water allocations while much of the data on reductions presented in steiner 2005 are in water deliveries the differences between allocations and deliveries are 1 the losses in the canals eg evaporation and infiltration and 2 not all allocated water is demanded by the water contractors ie some water may be allocated by reclamation but is not deliver ed because of the lack of contractor demand especially in wetter years steiner 2005 calcu lated average canal losses at 63 taf ie less than 5 of average annual deliveries or allo cations and assumes that the allocated water is demanded by the contractors because th allocations estimated by bor 2006 represent the quantity allocated before the canal losses oc cur and the deliveries estimated by steiner 2005 represent the quantity delivered after cana l losses occur the reduction estimates from bor 2006 may be systematically higher than the deliveries estimated in steiner 2005 but on average by only 5 crs consulted with recl amation and others in an effort to identify systematic way to account for differences in reclamation allocations and deliveries but approach was identified however it appear s that the two sets are reasonably similar 31 although class i supplies are firm relative to other friant supplies they are subject to water availability consequently the full cont ract amount may not be delivered in some years releases for diversion to canals that deliver project water to long term water service contractors in the friant division service area of the cvp surface water supplies friant division water supplies twenty eight water districts in the friant division service area have longterm water service contracts with reclamation for the deliver of water stored behind friant dam see table a1 this water supplies approximately 1 million acres of farmland and several cities and towns incl uding the city of fresno water is delivered northwest via the 36mile madera canal and south via the 152mile friantkern canal see figure 2 annual deliveries are reported to average around 1300 taf in total approximately 15000 farms are rved by friant water supp lies friant water supply deliveries and allocations fall into several categories30 class i water sometimes referred to as the firm supply31 is the first 800 taf of storable water if available in the millerton lake drainage area in excess of instream rights it is allocated to friant longterm water service contractors it is delivered under contract to districts with limited or access to groundwater supplies and as base supply to other districts class i supplies are insufficient to meet the base supplies of all districts class ii supplies are supplemental supplies class ii water is allocated and delivered only when class i demands can be fully met class ii water often is used for i rrigation supplies in wetter years class ii water also is used to di rectly recharge groundwater supplies through various means or used in lieu of groundwater ie contractors use class ii surface water instead of pumpinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs28 groundwater when it is available thereby meeting water demands and partially restorin g groundwater supplies 215 temporary water may be ma available when flood waters must be released from friant dam under 215 of the reclamation reform act of 1982 pl 97293 normal ownership and full cost pricing limitations of reclamation law are waived for lands that receive only temporary not to exceed one year water supply under 215 the secretary also is au thorized to waive payments for such supplies class ii and 215 demands and deliveries are highly variable depending on runoff quantity and timing and reclamation operating and contracting procedures for example there exists considerable financial incentiv to take 215 water in lieu of class ii deliveries when 215 fees are waived when declaration of 215 water availability is made early in the season many contractors redu ce or sometimes forego class ii deliveries this complexity makes it difficult to estimate the impacts of water supply reductions under the ttlement on class ii contractors table a1 lists the average annual class i nd class ii water

restricted analysis to the ye ars 1962 to 2003 and does not distinguish between class ii water and 215 water these parameters were chosen in order to use data from both bor 2006 and steiner 2005 and to present the data and analysis in as consistent and simple format as possible the followi ng points explain why these parameters were chosen 1 1962 is the lower time limit of the analysis because class ii water was not made available until 1962 the absence of class ii water allocations prior to 1962 makes the bor 2006 data from 1957 through 1961 sufficiently different from the current water allocation protocols to warrant its exclusion 2 2003 was selected as the upper time limit of the analysis because that was the last complete year in steiner 2005 3 bor 2006 grouped class ii and 215 water comparison of the data sets was facilitated by merging class ii and 215 data from steiner 2005 in the portions of this appendix analyzing estimated annual reductions for individual friant water distri cts crs used steiner 2005 data because districtlevel data were available in bor 2006 the longer period 1922 to 2003 available in steiner 2005 was used since it was not necessary to shorten the period to fit with the bor 2006 data steine r 2005 contractorlevel data ar available for both class i and class ii water but not for 215 water therefore the contractorlevel analysis is limited to class i and class ii waterdistrict tea pot dome water district nd stone corral irrigation district typically pump the smallest amounts of groundwater annually35 total volumes pumped in the friant division between 1987 and 2003 range from peak of over 2000 taf in 1990 to low of 450 taf in 1998 nearly fivefold difference other groundwater resources have the poten tial to also be available for use by friant contractors groundwater banking using dewatered aquifer space to store water during wet years so it can be pumped and used during dry years is increasingly being discussed and pursued in california the water transport system in the state increases the possibilities for beneficial use of gr oundwater banking those connected to the transport syst em potentially could use banked groundwater regardless of their own access to groundwat er supplies groundwater banking while an opportunity also has its costs and cons traints in california pumping and canal capacity and speciesrelate d operational issues may limit some groundwater banking opportunities further the costs to bank nd move water or purchase banked water may be higher than some users are willing to pay contract water supplies under the settlement36 the settlement establishes framework for achieving both restoration and water management goals the viability of attaining both goals is uncertain and will depend upon many factors currently the annual volume of water dive rted for offstream uses by friant water contractors is function of water availability which depends on precipitation storage capacity and flood flow management minus the riparian releases for water right holders below the dam under the settlement the quantity of water available for diversion to friant contractors would be function of water availability minus the riparian releases for downstream water right holders and releases for restoration flows httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs32 37 an illustration of the significance of water year classifications and the methodology for continuedunder the settlement agreement as specified in exhibit b paragraph 2 reclamation would categorize runoff conditions for each year into one of six water year types based on runoff conditions wet wettest 20 of years and normalwet the next wettest 30 of years are used to define the years with above average runoff normaldry the next 30 and dry the next 15 capture the years with below average runoff but not the years w ith the lowest runoff ie the bottom 5 the bottom 5 are classified into critical high or critical low critical low are the driest of years those years with less than 400 taf of runoff critical high are all other years with runoff in the bottom 5 figure a2 provides graphical presentation of the relative frequency of each of the wate r year types because only one year had runoff of less than 400 taf in the 1922 to 2004 data set the frequency of critical low runoff year is shown as 1 in figure a2 the water year type is determined by comparing the runoff predictions for the year to past annual runoff volumes in the millerton lake drainage area these runoff categories are used to select the restorati on hydrograph to be used for given year which forms the basis for monthly water rel eases paragraph 13 section j in the settlement states that the secretary of the interior shall develop guidelines for procedures for determining water year types which may affect how the designation of water year type is implemented37 figure a2 frequency of water year typeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs33 37 continued the classifications can be seen when comp aring bor 2006 with steiner 2005 there exist four differences in the classification of wa ter year types used by bor 2006 and steiner 2005 for years in which the data sets overlap as shown in table a2 steiner 2005 classified four years in wetter water year types than bor 2006 classifying year differently may have significant implications because generally the wetter the classification the more restoration releases are made for example in 1989 the runoff was 939 taf steiner 2005 classified this runoff as normal dry see table a2 which would lead to restoration releases of 247 taf under the settlement for the same runoff bor 2006 classified 1989 as dry which would lead to restoration releases of 184 taf under the settlement 38 the option for 10 buffer flow that could be used to augment the restoration base flow established in the hydrographs was added prio r to finalizing the settlement agreement the steiner 2005 data set does not include estimates with the 10 buffer flows the buffer flow was added to the settlement after steiners report was completed to take advantage of the comparable elements of the two data sets and because the implementation of the buffer flow remains to be determined the analysis in this appendix does not address the 10 buffer flow option 39 see footnote 25 for an explana tion of the 1998 data in bor 2006 40 the potential impact of climate change on water supplies particularly snow pack in california has some observers questioning past runoff as predictor of future runoff quantity and timingeach water year type is associated with an annual restorati on flow regime ie hydrograph in exhibit b of the settlement in other words each year the quantity of water to be released from millerton lake for restoration would be determined by the designation of the basins runoff as one of the six water year types under the settlement reclamation would release water to achieve the target restoration flows multiple hydrographs were considered during litigation the settlements hydrographs are based on the expert tes timony of g mathias kondolf prepared on behalf of the natural res ources defense council plainti ffs and are often referred to as the kondolf hydrographs38 the restoration flows in the settlement are higher in wetter years and lower in drier years the quantity of water used for restoration flows and the quantity of water by which friant water deliv eries would be reduced are related but the relationship is not necessarily oneforone many of the tables and figu res in this appendix depict estimates of lower friant water deliveries under the settlement the data come from two sources that make estimates based on the water quantities required to create the flows in the six kondolf hydrographs steiner 2005 and bor 2006 limitations of water supply estimates and mitigation for reductions figures a3 and a439 show graphically the estimated reduced annual friant water supplies using the st einer 2005 and the bor 2006 data sets respectively table a2 provides much of the same in formation in tabular format both sources used historic conditions as proxies for estimating the future effect of the settlement40 the two figures and the table ar ordered according to annual runoff with 1983 having the highest runoff and 1977 the lowest in the 1962 to 2003 period there are limits to these data sets due to number of factors explained below thushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs34 ultimate impact on friant water contractors is anticipated to be different than the available estimates if the settlement is implemented for example the settlement in paragr aph 16 calls for measures to mitigate lower friant water supplies as restoration releases are implemented these include establishing recovered water account nd efforts to recircul ate recapture and reuse the restoration releases the friant water users authority in february 2007 developed report titled san joaquin river restoration program water management goal potential programs projects which briefly outlines numerous projects that could be undertaken to mitig ate or offset reduced water supplies however specific water management pr ojects are identified as part of the settlement nor is it clear how funding under the settl ement would be divided between efforts to achieve the restoration goal and efforts to achieve the water management goal conse quently the analysis in this appendix cannot estimate potential savings and how these savings ma reduce the magnitude of the reductions in water supplies of the fr iant water contractors there are additional reasons why available estimates could differ from the future supplies of friant water contractors operating under th settlement guidelines on how the settlement would be implemented remain to be established and numerous provisions in the settlement provide for implementation flexibility for example paragraph 13 section j of th settlement agreement states that the secretary of the interior shall develop guidelines incl uding procedures for determining and accounting for reductions in water deliv eries to friant division longterm contractors which will affect how reclamation ma kes operational decisions at friant dam and thus allocation deci sions both bor 2006 and steiner 2005 adopt reduction protocol similar to the current protocol for how to reduce contractor water supplies to obtain water for the restor ation flows both data sets presume eliminating deliveries to 215 contracts and class ii wate r before reducing class i water supplies however the guidelines to be established pursuant to the settlement agreement could differ from the reduction protocol used by bor 2006 and steiner 2005 further districts may try to negotia different allocation for water supply reductionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs35 figure a3 estimated friant division wa ter supply under settlement steiner 2005

steiner 2005 and bor 2006 italics indicate inconsistent classifications httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs37 another example of flexibility provided in the settlement agreement which could result in contract water supplie s varying from the bor 2006 and steiner 2005 estimates is found in paragraph 3 of exhibit b of the settlement this paragraph states that the parties agree to transform the stair step hydrographs to more continuous hydrographs prior to december 31 2008 to ensure completion before the initiation of restoration flows provided that the parties shall mutuallyagree that transforming the hydrographs will not materially impact the restoration or water management goal this process may or may not materially impact friant deliveries the intent of the process is to provide sm ooth operation of dam releases and to avoid large fluctuations on daily basis table a2 also illustrates the challenge of using estimates it shows in italics that the two data sources steiner 2005 and bor 2006 do not agree on how the water year type classificati ons would be applied to hist oric runoff conditions four discrepancies in their classifications are shown 1989 drynormal dry 1993 normal wetwet 1999 normal drynorm wet and 2003 normal drynormal wet footnote 12 describes the potential significance of these discrepancies in summary numerous factors eg opera tional changes water transfers and acquisitions recirculation r ecapture and reuse projects would affect the ultimate change experienced in diversions water deliveries and water availability for the water districts in the friant division service area thus estimates of water reductions contained herein are simply estimates of the magnitude of how contract supplies might be reduced ba sed on best available inform ation because of the lack of available information and specific plan s on possible operational changes efforts to mitigate reduced friant deliveries and the viability of offsetting reduced deliveries these estimates assume ch ange in operations and water supply mitigation projects friant contract water supplies the big picture estimated water s upply reductions unde r the settlement table a3 displays average district water supplies for class i and class ii water the table shows the water supply without the ttlement which is also shown in table a1 and the steiner 2005 and bor 2006 estimates for how much on average the annual water supplies might be reduced under the ttlement these figures are averages however and do not represent the full range of reductions that might be experienced in any given water year the hist orical variation is depicted in figures a3 and a4 above figure a5 uses the bor 2006 data to show the relationship between the volume of water released fo r restoration in green and the average annual reduction in water deliveries to contractors in red the figure illustrates that the restoration flows under the settlement are higher in we tter years and lower in drier years as one can see from the figure the quantity of water for restoration flows and the quantity of water by which deliveries would be reduced are related but the relationship is not necessarily oneforone for instance in some of the wettest years much of the restoration flows would be met by flood water releases not reducedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs38 deliveries under the settlement water would be released for restoration purposes in the driest of years the last column in table a3 provides the estimates of the average reductions as percentage of the average contractors friant water supply not contract amount range of 5 to 27 these percentages represent reduction estimates only for friant dam releases not reduction as pe rcentage of all the water supply sources eg

17 of annual water supplies in critical high years class i water might be reduced on average by 12 to 17 generally class ii water is supplied in critical high years with or without the restoration flows called for in the settlement therefore for critical high years generally there is expected reduction in class ii water resulting from the settlement see figure a8 some critical high years without the settlement could have 215 water according to steiner 2005 these 215 deliver ies generally w ould not be made under the settlement steiner 2005 modeled 1976 to have 11 taf of 215 water without the settlement and 215 water with the settlement critical low restoration releases are to be made in critical low years thus there generally would be changes to friant division water supplies under the settlement see figures a3 a4 and 8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs44 to summarize within each water year ty pe variation could exist in the quantity and percent reduction in friant division wa ter supplies for different contract types see table a2 and figure a8 it is unknown whether reclamation would try to or could limit this annual variation friant water supplies the contractorlevel picture the analysis in this section is based on data from steiner 2005 bor 2006 provides estimates of the impact of the settlement on individual longterm contractors the longer da ta set available in steiner 2005 allows the contractorlevel analysis to encompass longer period 1922 to 2003 than much of the previous sections analysis steiner 2005 contractorlevel data ar available for both class i and class ii water data for 215 water at the contractorlevel are not included in steiner 2005 therefore unlike the previous section the analysis in this section is limited to class i and class ii water as noted earlier reductions of individua l contractors wate r supplies under the settlement depend largely on the contractors proportion of class i to class ii contracts and the water year type whic h depend on the runoff in given year the average reduction for class i contract deliveries is estimated at 5 the estimated average reduction for class ii deliveries is 27 see table a3 the estimated average reduction for 215 deliveries is 47 steiner 2005 many districts have both class i and class ii contracts average annual reductions in average nnual class i and class ii water supplies are estimated at 5 for the districts with only class i contracts representing 46 of the contractors ie 13 of the 28 districts 6 to 15 for 36 of the districts ie 10 of the 28 16 to 20 for 11 of the di stricts ie 3 of the 28 and 27 for the remaining 7 of di stricts ie 2 of the 28 which are fresno id and gravelley ford wd with only class ii contracts see table a3 under the settlement cl ass i water supplies would not be reduced in wet and most normalwet years see figure a8 for class i reduction on average that is 800 taf generally could be delivered to class i contractors both cu rrently and under the settlement currently class i contr acts often but not always are fully met in normaldry years with the settlement estimates are that class i contracts would not be fully met in almost half 46 of the normal dry years steiner 2005 currently class i contracts gene rally are not fully met in dry critical high and critical low years see figure a7 for average class i deliveries below 800 taf under the settlement estimateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237crs45 are that class i water supplies would be lower in normal dry dry and critical high years see figure a8 the class i deliveries in critical low years generally would be unchanged by the settlement b ecause restoration releases are made under the settlement estimates ar that class ii and 215 water supplies would be lower in wet normalwet and most normaldry years and somewhat lower in dry years see figure a8 class ii water generally is not supplied in most dry and all critical high and critical low years s teiner 2005 under the settlement this would not change in summary the ultimate effect of increased releases for fish restoration efforts from millerton lake on friant water deliveries is difficult to predict using available data which does not account for any improveme nts in water mana gement that may dampen the settlements impact on agricultural and municipal users it appears that annual water supplies for the friant division service area would be on average 15 to 16 less under the ttlement than average supp lies under current operating protocols although the average reducti on could be 1516 wa ter supply reductions could be as little as reduction to as high as 34 reduction in some years for threequarters of the friant contract ors the reductions in friant division deliveries represents reducti on in one of multiple supplie s the level of reductions experienced by individual water districts w ould vary depending on their water service contracts existing data assumes reclamation reduces supplemental water deliveries before first prio rity deliveries these da ta estimate average annual reductions in the friant division longter m water service contract deliveries for individual friant water districts range to vary between 5 and 27 the low range being cutbacks to class i contract supplies 46 of contractors and the high range applicable to those with only class ii c ontract supplies 7 of contractors all districts with supplemental friant divisi on contracts known as class ii contracts have groundwater or othe r surface water supplies it remains unclear to what extent wate r reductions might be offset by projects and programs implemented pursuant to the settlement and at what cost it is possible that portion of the cutbacks could be mitigated via efficiency gains water marketing including voluntary sales nd transfers water pricing groundwater storage and banking or new infrastructure development however the viability of further improving efficiencies in the fria nt division securing funding and attaining both the restoration and wate r management goals is certain and would depend on many factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34237 crs46 appendix b table b1 studies of
