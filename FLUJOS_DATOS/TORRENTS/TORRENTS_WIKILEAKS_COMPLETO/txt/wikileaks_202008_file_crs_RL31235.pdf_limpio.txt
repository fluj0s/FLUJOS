the cbo baseline deﬁcit projection for fy2008 is 219 billion during the second half of the 1990s deﬁcit reduction was an important objective in the setting of overall budget policy between 1992 and 1998 combination of budget policy and booming economy entirely eliminated the deﬁcit but after four successive years of surpluses outlays again exceeded revenues in 2002 and the budget has been in deﬁcit since then strictly speaking economics generally has little to say regarding whether budget deﬁcit is good thing or not whether the budget is in deﬁcit or surplus and whether the budget deﬁcit is growing or shrinking have consequences for the performance of the economy both in the short and long run at the same time the performance of the economy can have substantial eﬀects on the budget as

declin from the 248 billion deficit recorded in fy2006 the cbo expects the deficit for fy2008 to be 407 billion over fairly short periods of time say thr ee or four years fiscal policy can affect the rate of economic growth by adding to or subtracting from aggregate demand for time the effect on the economy may even be larger than the initial change in the budget these effects however tend eventually to diminish because of either higher interest rates or rising prices estimates of the multiplier effect on the economy of change in fiscal policy vary but most of them suggest that it reaches peak somewhere between one and oneanda half times size of the change in the budget in most economic models that peak effect is realized within one or two years of the initial change in policy one measure economists use to assess fiscal policy is the structural or standardizedemployment budget this measure estimates at given time what outlays receipts and the surplus or defi cit would be if the economy were at full employment although the actual budget was in surplus beginning in 1998 the standardized measure first registered balanced budget in 1999 between 1992 and 2000 the actual budget surplus increased fro m 47 deficit of 47 to 24 of gross domestic product gdp shift of 71 percentage points during the same period the standardized measure rose fro m 29 to 11 of gdp that suggests that little more than half of the shift was the result of changes in policy and little less than half was attri butable to the economic expansion between 2000 and 2007 the actual surplus fell from 24 to 12 of gdp whereas the standardized measure fell from 11 to 12 of gdp in the long run economic growth is termined primarily by three factors growth in the labor force the rate of t echnological advance and the amount of capital available to the workforce of the three the last one may be the most susceptible to the influence of policymakers the larg er the capital stock is the more productive the labor force tends to be although it is possible for fiscal polic to have an effect on the rate of technological progress in the way public money is spent it probably has much larger effect on growth throug h its influence on the size of the domestic stock of capital and the amount of capital ava ilable for each worker in the labor forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31235contents recent budget history 1 d f i c i t r s u r p l u s w h t d i f f r n c d s i t m k 3 f i s c l p l i c i n t h s h r t r u n 3 limits on fiscal policy 3 t

eliminated the deficit but after four successive years of surplu ses outlays again exceeded revenues in 2002 and the budget has been in deficit since then strictly speaking economics generally has little to say regarding whether budget deficit is good thing or not whethe r the budget is in deficit or surplus and whether the budget deficit is growing or shrinking have consequences for the performance of the economy both in the shor t and long run at the same time the performance of the economy can have subs tantial effects on the budget as well recent budget history the share of income that is saved is simply reflection of relative preferences for current and future consumption fr om an economic standpoint there is optimal rate of saving nonetheless raising the national rate of saving has long been goal of policymakers most economists however believe the cap acity of public policy to influence private saving behavior is limited the one certain way to raise the national saving rate through public policy is to increase the public sector saving rate and that is what happened in the 1990s the national saving rate rose after 1995 because increases in public saving more than offset falling private saving in recent history budget surpluses have been rare and succession of surpluses rarer still2 in every year between fy1969 and fy1998 the federal budget was in deficit that is outlays exceeded receipts beginning in 1929 and until 1969 the budget was in surplus for total of nine years and during th at time was never in surplus for more than three years in rowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31235crs2 figure 1 presents figures for federal budget outlays receipts and the surplus beginning in 1977 rather than showing do llar amounts each of the three series is expressed as percentage of gross domes tic product gdp showing the figures in this way focuses attention on the size of the budget aggregates relative to the economy as whole source congressional budget office an economic downturn began in mid1981 and ended in late 1982 contributing to drop in the surplus to 60 of gdp in 1983 since then with brief reversal attributable to an economic contrac tion in 1990 and 1991 the surplus increased steadily until 2000 in 2001 the surplus fell from 24 of gdp the previous year to 13 of gdp in 2002 there was negativ surplus budget deficit of 15 15 of gdp and by 2004 it had reached 36 of gdp since 2004 the surplus deficit has risen fallen each year figure 1 outlays receipts and the surplushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31235crs3 deficit or surplus what difference does it make the federal budget and the economy are cl osely interrelated the strength or weakness of the overall ec onomy affects the levels of outlays and receipts substantially the budget also has signif icant effects on the economy both in terms of how fast the economy grows and also in terms of the overall allocation of resources fiscal policy in the short run over fairly short periods of time say thr ee or four years fiscal policy can affect the rate of economic growth by adding to or subtracting from aggregate demand consider for example onetime increase in total federal spending with matching rise in tax receipts each additional dollar of government spending becomes income for those who satisfy th initial increase in demand for public goods and services in turn some of that increase in income will be spent raising the income of those who satisfy second wa ve of increased demand for goods and services theoretically this process continues with each successive increment to income getting smaller and smaller as some is saved and some is spent because of the initial increase in spendi ng and the additional spending that is subsequently stimulated the economy grow s somewhat faster than it otherwise would have for time the size of the ec onomy may even increase by more than the initial increase in government spending government spending is thus said to have multiplier effect there can also be multiplier effect in the case of spending cut although the effect is in the opposite direction if the government reduces spending that can cut the incomes of those who otherwise would have provided goods and services to the government if it does they must either reduce their spending or their saving to the extent that they cut spending it adds to the decline in output initiated by the cut in public spending the government may also be able to in fluence the rate of economic growth in the short run via tax cuts or increases ju st as an increase in public sector spending temporarily increases some incomes so tax cut increases the amount of income taxpayers have at their disposal some of that increase in after tax income is likely to be spent and so tax cuts may have multiplier effect just as changes in government spending do tax increas reduces disposable income and so contributes to slowdown in private sector spending limits on fiscal policy that is not the end of the story however in the view of most economists the government ca nnot permanently increase the size of the economy just by increasing spending or cutting taxes as is often the case in economics other things do not remain equal an increase in spending or tax cut increases the deficit and so increases the public sectors demand for credit increased credit demand tends to raise interest rates higher interest rates in turn discourage borrowing in the rest of the economy for those activities that depend on credit especially housing and consumer durable goodshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31235crs4 3 in the short run to which this discussi on is limited supply is more or less fixedhigher interest rates also tend to make dollardenominated financial assets more attractive to overseas investors to buy t hose assets however foreigners must first buy dollars this increased demand for do llars pushes the foreign exchange value of the dollar above what it otherwise would have been the stronger dollar makes imported goods cheaper and makes goods nd services produced in the united states more expensive abroad the change in prices tends to increase demand for us imports and reduce demand abroad for us exports raising the trade or current account deficit thus some of th stimulus is in sense exported fiscal policy may also affect prices an increase in aggregate demand stimulated by an increase in spending or cut in taxes can be satisfied in one of two ways either an increase in real production or an increase in the general price level3 if the economy is already operating at full employment and the capital stock is operating at or near full capacity then it is more likely that any increase in demand will be met by higher prices than by in creased production of goods and services in fully employed economy an increase in government spending would yield much larger increase in nominal than it would in real gdp in slack economy with high unemplo yment and idle resources stimulative fiscal policy would be less likely at least initially to push up prices instead any increase in demand could be met by increased employment and capacity utilization rates in an economy with excess capacity stimulative fiscal policy would tend to increase the production of goods and servi ces more than it would prices and any increases in real and nominal gdp would tend to be of similar size given sufficient fiscal policy boost slack economy would tend gradually to converge to full employment as the ec onomy approaches full employment of both labor and capital additional increases in aggregate demand would be more likely to be satisfied by higher prices than by increased real output whether because of higher interest rates or rising prices any effects of an increase in government spending or tax cut on the rate of economic growth tend to diminish over time estimates of the multiplier effect of change in fiscal policy vary but most of them suggest that it reaches peak value of somewhere between one and oneandahalf times the original stimulus in most economic models that peak effect is realized within one or two ears of the initial change in policy in other words for every dollar increase in federa l spending the economy within year or two will be larger than it otherwise would have been by somewhere between dollar and dollarandahalf not all changes in spending and taxes however reflect changes in fiscal policy just as the budget can have an effect on shortrun economic growth the rate of economic growth can also have an eff ect on the budget faster economic growth tends to raise revenues above and reduce outlays below what they otherwise would have been faster growth means more people are working which raises taxable incomes which in concert with progressive tax rates increases tax receipts faster economic growth along with higher in comes and employment tends to reducehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31235crs5 4 congressional budget office the cyclically adjusted and st andardized budget measures an update august 2007 5 it should be noted that these data incor porate other adjustments in addition to the one related to the business cycle these adjustments removed for example the effects of outlays for deposit insurance receipts from auc tions of the electromagnetic spectrum and foreign contributions related to operation sert storm all of which are considered to be onetime events or otherwise unrelated to discretionary policyoutlays especially for spending on une mployment insurance and various income support programs what this means is that it may be difficult to examine the ups and downs in the budget and in the deficit in particular and discern whethe r those changes reflect the fluctuations of the economy or are due to deliberate changes in budget policy the standardized budget one measure economists use to assess fiscal policy is the structural or standardiz edemployment budget this measure estimates at given time what outlays recei pts and the surplus or deficit would be if the economy were at full employment it is way of separating changes in the budget totals that are due to changes in overall economic conditions from those changes that are the result of deliberate changes in tax and spending policy changes in the standardizedemployment surplus reflect changes in policy and are not affected by variations in underlying economic conditions for example if the economy is less than fully employed then the standardized measure of outlays is less than actual outlays standardized receipts are higher than actual receipts and the standardized budget deficit would be sma ller than the actual deficit economists track the standardizedemployment surplus as percentage of potential gdp to assess if fiscal policy is stimulative or contractionary as the economy grows outlays and receipts tend to rise as well comparing the budget to gdp filters out changes due to variati ons in the overall size of the economy potential gdp is an estimate of what th total value of production of goods and services would be if labor and capital resources were fully employed using potential gdp as base for comparison avoids th problem of cyclical factors masking changes in fiscal policy decrease in the standardized budget deficit relative to potential gdp would be considered indica tive of contractionary fiscal policy similarly an increase in the standardized budget deficit as percentage of potential gdp would be indicative of stimulative fiscal policy the cbo regularly publishes estimate s of the standardized budget4 figure 2 compares the standardized budget surplus deficits are simply negative surpluses with the actual surplus since 1977 both as percentage of gdp5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31235crs6 source congressional budget office for the most part the two series exhi bit the same behavi or over time since 1977 however the two have moved in oppos ite directions on numerous occasions indicating that either the surplus rose at time that fiscal policy was actually expansionary or that it fell at time when fiscal policy was actually contractionary most of the time the actual budget surplus has been smaller than the standardized measure suggesting that at least by cbos calculations the economy has more often than not been less than fully employed between 1997 and 2001 the actual surplus was larger than the standardized measure although the actual budget was in surplus between 1998 and 2001 the standardized measure first registered balanced budget in 1999 between 1992 and 2000 the actual budget surplus increased fro m 47 to 24 of gdp shift of 71 percentage points over the same peri od the standardized measure rose from 29 to 11 of gdp that suggests that little more than half of the shift during that period was the result of changes in policy and little less than half was attributable to improving economic conditions between 1992 and 2000 fiscal policy as measured by changes in the standardized budget surplus was contrac tionary in every year between 1992 and 2000 the standardized surplus grew re lative to gdp between 1992 and 2000 the average increase per year in the surplus was 05 of gdp the average annual rate of increase in real gdp over the same pe riod was 37 although fiscal policy was contractionary other factors contri buting to economic growth more than compensated between 2000 and 2003 the sta ndardized surplus fell suggesting that figure 2 actual and standardized budget surplushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31235crs7 6 for the purposes of this explanation state and local government saving is included in public saving most of the variations in the public sector saving rate however are attributable to the federal governmentfiscal policy was expansionary since 2003 it has risen slightly in each year indicating modest c ontractionary effect fiscal policy in the long run constant deficit or surplus by itself is believed to have little if any effect on the short run rate of economic growth it is changes in the surplus that matter for short run growth however whether th budget is in surplus or not does have consequences for the composition of economic output and that can have an effect on growth in the long run in the long run economic growth is termined primarily by three factors growth in the labor force the rate of t echnological advance and the amount of capital available to the workforce of the three the last one may be the most susceptible to the influence of policymakers the larg er the capital stock the more productive the labor force tends to be although it may be possible for fiscal po licy to have an effect on the rate of technological progress in the way public money is spent it probably has much larger effect on growth through its infl uence on the size of the domestic stock of capital and the amount of capital available to each worker in the labor force how this comes about can be illustrated by brief introduction to economic accounting the total value of national output can be measured in two ways either the total value of the goods and services produced can be added up or the total value of the incomes resulting from that production can be counted these two accounts at least in the abstract add up to the same total the measure of total output based on the value of production is typically subdivided into several categor ies of demand specifically it is calculated as the sum of consumption spending c investment i government spending g and the difference between exports x and imports m gdp c i g x m the alternative measure of total output is the sum of the various uses to which income is allocated on this side of the economic accounting ledger the value of national output is expressed as the sum of consumption c pr ivate sector saving s6 and tax payments t gdp c s thttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31235crs8 7 even though the federal budget was not in surplus until 1998 the public sector saving rate was positive beginning in 1996 because of the surpluses of state and local governmentscombining the two equations and simplifying gives i s t g m x that is total investment spending is equal to the sum of private saving s the government budget surplus t g which if it is negative is deficit and the difference between imports and exports of goods and services m x the last equation is an identity in other words investment is by definition equal to the sum of private saving the budget surplus nd net capital inflows from abroad other things being equal reduction in public sector saving means less investment and slower growth in the capital stock net capital inflows reflect net imports along with international flows of goods and services financial capital fl ows back and forth between countries if the value of imports exceeds the value of exports then other things ie investment saving and the budget surplus being equal capital inflows will exceed capital outflows otherwise there would be way of paying for the excess of imports over exports among other things an increase in either private or public sector saving may have an effect on the amount of foreign financial capital flowing into the united states one reason that might happen woul d be that an increase in domestic saving would tend to push interest rates down in the united states that would make domestic financial assets less attractive to foreign investors and make foreign financial assets more attractive to us investors thus changes in domestic saving and net foreign investment could offset one another figure 3 shows each of the three sources of investment funds over the past eight years each one expressed as percent of gdp private saving includes the saving of households and businesses public saving here reflect s federal state and local governments in 1996 the public sector contribution to national saving wa s small less than 1 of gdp by 2000 public sector saving had risen to 44 of gdp but has since fallen and in 2007 accounted for about 05 of gdp between 1996 and 2007 private sector saving fell from 158 of gdp to about 13 net inflows of foreign capital rose from 13 of gdp in 1996 to over 5 in 2007 total funds available for investment in the united states fro m all sources rose from 178 of gdp in 1996 to 221 in 2000 before falling below 20 in 20077 saving from domestic sources public nd private rose from 165 in 1996 to 183 in 1998 but has since fallen below 14 in 2007 at the same time because of rising inflows of foreign capital the cl aims of foreign investors to income from the domestic capital stock were increasing in the 1980s large inflows of foreign capital were typically associated with larg federal budget defic its these deficitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31235crs9 added to domestic credit demands and pushed up interest rates more recently other factors may also have been at work source department of commerce bureau of economic analysis two reasons have been suggested for th increased foreign capital inflows at time when public sector surpluses were ri sing one is that because the domestic economy is doing so well in particul ar productivity growth seems to have accelerated there has been surge in profitable investment opportunities the other is that even in the absence of an increased yield on us assets foreign capital may have flowed here because of percep tion of increased risk in countries where the capital might otherwise have been invested in this case the united states serves as safe haven for foreign capital the economy will likely be more productive in the future than it would have been in th absence of any increase investment but of that increase in output will have to be paid out to foreign investors as either rents interest or dividends the increase in investment spending of the 1990s was made possible by both the increase in national saving and an increase in foreign capital coming into the country after 2000 there was declin in saving from domestic sources due primarily to drop in public saving capital inflows from abroad did not offset the decline and so total funds available for i nvestment measured as share of gdp fell figure 3 sources of saving by sectorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31235crs10 8 should the federal government be unable to find private sector buyers for its securities there would be two possible outcomes firs t the federal government would simply be unable to meet all of its obligations second and the more likely of the two rather than allow the federal government to default th federal reserve would buy those securities although the federal reserve is independent and under legal obligation to ensure the sale of government securities it might well step in to avert default should it come to that the threat would not be one of government insolvency but rather of inflation 9 inflation can cause both the interest rate and th growth rate of gdp to rise interest rates usually reflect investors inflation expectations but substantial rise in the price level that was unexpected by holders of existing debt would raise nominal gdp but not the level of outstanding debt and the debtgdp ratio would fallreducing the federal debt perhaps the most obvious effect of the federal government budget surpluses of the 1990s was decline in the amount of federal debt from an economic perspective however the measure of debt that matters more is not the absolute level in dollar terms but rather the debt relative to total output or gdp from this perspective the debt began to fall in 1993 many economists believe that steadily gr owing federal debt is not by itself cause for concern as long as the fede ral debt grows faster than gdp however interest payments on that debt will constitute an everincreasing share of total federal spending and of gdp if investors should come to expect that the debt would grow faster then gdp indefinitely and that the debttogdp ratio woul d continue to rise they might eventually become unwilling to buy new issues of federal debt in that case the federal reserve might be the only buyer and that would likely lead to an accelerating rate of inflation in the long run the relationship between th growth rate of the federal debt and the overall rate of economic growth is critical to financial stability perpetual debt growth in excess of the rate of economic growth is an inherently unstable situation it is likely that investors would become unwilling to buy federal debt issues long before all of gdp was accounted for by th interest payment on the federal debt because of growing doubts about the govern ments ability to raise sufficient revenue to pay just the interest on that debt8 whether the debttogdp ratio is on such an explosive path depends on the rate of interest and the rate of growth of gdp consider the case where the budget is in balance except for the interest payment on the debt that is the budget deficit is equal to the interest payment in this example the debt would grow each year by an amount equal to the interest cost of financ ing the debt thus the growth rate of the debt would equal the interest rate if th interest rate on the federal debt remained above the economic growth rate then the bt would grow faster than gdp and the ratio of debt to national output would rise the converse is also true as long as the interest rate on the debt remains below the growth rate of gdp then the ratio of debt to income will fall9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31235crs11 10 the possibility that eventually all of the fede ral debt held by the public would be paid off raises number of interesting questions for example the federal reserve manages the size of the money stock by buying and selling treasury securities in its openmarket operations in the absence of market for federal government debt the federal reserve might have to continuedthus even with budget deficit the ratio of debt to national income can fall for the united states the recent peak level of the federal debt relative to gdp was reached in 1993 at 494 when the budget deficit was 255 billion in 1994 even though the deficit was still over 200 billion the debt fell relative to gdp by 2001 federal debt had falle n to low of 330 of gdp in 2002 the ratio of debt to gdp began to rise for the first time in eigh t years and continued rising through 2005 when it stood at 374 since then debt as percent of gdp has fallen in 2007 it was 368 figure 4 shows the level of the debttogdp ratio since 1977 source congressional budget office during the period shown in figure 4 the budget was in deficit most of the time clearly variations in the ratio of debt to gdp do not depend solely on whether the budget is in surplus or deficit as long as the budget is in deficit however the ratio cannot fall to zero for the sake of long term economic stability what matters most is that the ratio is not perpetually rising10 figure 4 federal debt held by th public as percentage of gdphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31235crs12 10 continued buy and sell private sector assets to conduct monetary policy the absence of federal government debt could also affect the bank ing sector banks hold treasury securities among other assets and the fact that they are considered to be riskless assets reduces the overall risk associated with banks portfolios if riskfree assets are unavailable adjustments to these portfolios might be necessary to avoid increasing portfolio riskconclusion economics generally speaking is neutra l with respect to whether one saving rate is better than another ultimately it is an expre ssion of the publics relative preference for present versus future cons umption for the time being however the public sector can also have importa nt effects on the pool of savings whether it is better to have budget surp lus or deficit the budget has clearcut consequences for the economy in the s hort run whether the budget is in surplus makes little difference to economic performance in the short run it is changes in the surplus or deficit that can affect the rate of economic growth reduction in the deficit would tend to be cont ractionary while an increase in the deficit would tend to be stimulative those effects however are likely to be short lived in the long run shift from budget surp lus to deficit represents reduction to national saving less saving means shift from future to present consumption consuming more now means less investment now lower level of output of goods and services in the future and thus less to consume in the future than otherwise would have been the case to the extent that investment is financed by importing capital from abroad some of that higher output will be paid to foreigners even with budget deficit the outstandi ng federal debt ma still fall relative to gdp but that depends on the size of the deficit and of the interest payment on the outstanding debt rising debttogdp ratio eventually poses the risk of accelerating inflation
