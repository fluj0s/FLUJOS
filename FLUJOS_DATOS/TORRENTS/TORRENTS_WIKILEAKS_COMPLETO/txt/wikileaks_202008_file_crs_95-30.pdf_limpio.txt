established by the nbs organic act of 1901 pl 56177 nist is part of the technology administration of the department of commerce unlike most national laboratories nist has mission specified by statute 15 usc 271282a has its own authorization and appropriation and is headed by senateconfirmed presidential appointee prior to 1988 the mission of nbs was to develop and maintain standards and measurement support for scientific investigations engineering manufacturing commerce and educational institutions as well as to provide technical and advisory services to other government agencies on scientific and engineering problems the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 changed the name of nbs to the national institute of standards and technology and mandated the agency provide technical services to facilitate the competitiveness of us industry nist is directed to offer support to the private sector for the development of precompetitive generic technologies and the diffusion of governmentdeveloped innovation to users in all segments of the american economy laboratory research is to provide measurement calibration and quality assurance techniques that underpin us

in support for mep in the fy2003 budget the proposed 89 decline in mep funding was due to the presidents recommendation that centers in operation for more than six years do so without federal financing however pl 1087 provided nist with 7075 million in fy2003 funds after mandated rescission and maintained support for manufacturing extension fy2004 appropriations of 6107 million after

the nist inhouse rd effort involving approximately 3300 scientists engineers technicians and support personnel plus some 1200 visiting scientists per year from industry academia and other government agencies is conducted at laboratories in maryland and colorado major emphasis is cooperative research with industry to overcome technical barriers to commercialization of emerging technologies nist participates with us companies in collaborative rd programs in 130 research areas1 nist is composed of seven internal research laboratories2 research is focused on measurement evaluated data standards and test methods basic infrastructural technologies that enable development of advanced technologies and which industry can use to characterize new materials monitor production processes and ensure the quality of new product lines as part of the presidents american competitiveness initiative announced in the 2006 state of the union address the administration has called for doubling of funding

what was perceived as the necessity of maintaining strong manufacturing base title v of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act pl 100418 significantly expands the role of nist as the governments lead laboratory in support of us industrial quality and competitiveness to this end nist was given specific technology transfer functions and several programs were created including the advanced technology program regional centers for the transfer of manufacturing technology and state technology extension these efforts were designed to facilitate industrial activities to utilize advanced process technology to promote cooperative ventures among industry universities and government laboratories and to encourage shared risks accelerated development and increased skills the advanced technology program provided seed funding matched by private sector investment generally of at least 50 of costs to companies or consortia of universities businesses and government laboratories for development of ge neric technologies that have broad application across industries 3 awards based on technical and business merit were made for highrisk work 1 available at the national institute of

longrange support which were selected in conjunction with industry general competition also continued in fy1999 the focused programs were dropped in favor of one competition for all technologies the america competes act pl 11069 auth orized new technology innovation program tip to replace tp pl 110161 appropriated funding for this initiative while similar to tp in the intent to promote high risk rd that would be of broad economic benefit to the nation there are several differences in the operation of tip which is limited to small and mediumsized firms only initial funding for tp was 36 million in fy1991 financing of tp increased steadily until fy1995 when funding expanded significantly to 431 million however support began to decline the following year since fy2000 the initial house passed appropriations bills have not included financing for tp for the first time the fy2007 bill reported from the senate committee on appropriations also did not fund tp as required by law nist created regional centers for the transfer of manufacturing technology4 expanded in 1994 to include the state technology extension program and now known as the hollings manufacturing extension partnership this activity is designed to transfer expertise and technologies developed under nist programs to small and midsized usbased manufacturing firms funded through cooperative agreements with nonprofit or state and local organizations competitive awards were originally made for up to six years now extended non federal sources are required to provide 50 or more of each centers capital and costs during this time period pl 105309 permits the federal government to support centers after the six years if positive independent evaluation is made every two years federal funding is limited to onethird of the capital and annual operating and maintenance costs of the center centers offer expertise needs evaluation application demonstrations for new production technologies training and information dissemination centers are located in all 50 states and puerto rico with approximately 400 regional offices nist also assumed support of the 36 centers originally funded by the department of defense through its technology reinvestment project when funding for this program was terminated in fy1994 the initial appropriation in fy1988 was 125 million further funding showed slight increases until fy1994 when the original program was expanded and appropriations grew to 303 million the 906 million funding for fy1995 included support for new program links to tie together federal state and local agencies the private sector and the manufacturing outreach institutions through communications and data systems support for the program continued to grow until fy1999 when statutory requirements reduced the federal financial commitment as centers reach six years of operation new program of partnerships between industry and educational or research institutions to develop

stipends available for post doctoral work at nist these activities differ from the existing mep effort in which new manufacturing research is conducted as existing manufacturing technology is applied to the needs of small and mediumsized firms g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 beginning with the 104th congress many members expressed skepticism over technology policy based on providing federal funds to industry for development of precompetitive generic technologies this philosophical shift from previous congresses coupled with pressures to balance the federal budget led to significant reductions in funding for nist the advanced technology program and the manufacturing extension partnership which accounted for over 50 of the fy1995 nist budget were proposed for elimination while in the past strong support by the senate led to their continued financing funding for tp remained controversial since fy2000 the original appropriations bills as passed by the house did not contain funding for tp and many of the budget proposals submitted by president bush called for abolishing the program in the current congress legislation replaced atp with the tip initiative and provided funding for the new program the administration also recommended suspension of federal support for those manufacturing extension centers in operation for more than six years in the fy2003 budget the following year pl 108199 significantly cut funding for the mep program however the fy2005 omnibus appropriations act brought support for mep back up to the level necessary to fully fund the existing centers although the presidents fy2009 budget request once again includes an effort to close out the federally funded portion of the program while much of the legislative debate has focused on tp and mep increases in spending for the nist laboratories that perform the research essential to the mission responsibilities of the agency have tended to remain small 37 increase between fy1995 and fy1996 35 increase in fy1997 increase for fy1998 and 31 for fy 1999 during fy2000 there was less than 1 increase in support however fy2001 appropriations were 11 above the previous year while the figure for fy2002 included 27 in crease in funding in fy2003 support for in house rd was 12 more than the previous fiscal year although the fy2004 figure decreased by 55 funding for fy2005 included 12 increase in fy2006 support for these inhouse activities once again increased as part of the american competitiveness initiative announced by the president in the 2006 state of the union the administration will attempt to double over 10 years funding for innovationenabling research done at nist through its core programs defined as internal research in the strs account and the construction budget to this end the presidents fy2007 budget requested an increase of 183 for intramural rd at nist in the 109 th congress the fy2007 appropriations bill passed by the house as well as the version of the bill reported from the senate committee on appr opriations reflected this increase although final appropriations bill was enacted the fy2007 appropriations legislation passed in the current congress provides for an additional increase in funding for programs under the strs account as did the initial fy2008 appropriations bills passed by the house and senate and the presidents fy2008 budget proposal the final fy2008 appropriat ions legislation provided 14 increase over fy2007 below the 152 and 156 increases in the initial bills it remains to be seen how support for this effort will evolve and how this might affect financing of extramural efforts such as tip and mep as the 110th congress debates the fy2009 budget the resulting dispensation of
