mixture of prenew deal minimalist federal governance and to use recent parlance governing by network18 the federal government would make immediate appropriations to the affected area19 instead it would utilize federal resources and coordinate networks of federal state private and notforpro fit organizations to deliver relief services the presidents cabinet would direct the relief effort in close consultation with the american national red cross herein red cross thus flood response policy was centralized but its execution was decentralized20 in 1927 there was federal disasterre sponse

of communication field operations lette rs was established through it the headquarters delivered relief plan direc tions to local personnel and groups by telephone calls and radio co mmunications directed to regional red cross offices 32 furthermore coordinating the federal response with the red cross gave the relief effort the power to draw upon t housands of alreadytrained red cross volunteers in affected areas these volunteers on the scene provided information to the hoovers headquarters for use in pla nning and coordinating the response and utilized relationships they had with

encouraged banks in affected areas and the captains of industries of the day to provide working capital for the banks by buying stock in them his plan was for state reconstruction co rporations to lend money to farmers sell these loans to the federal intermediate credit corporation and use the proceeds to make more loans38 the red cross meanwhile helped citizens rebuild some of their homes and

charge of the flood response secretary hoove r was widely known throughout the nation and the president made sure that everyone got the message that hoover was in charge by utilizing the bully pulpit he issued presidential proclamation to the press that same day april 23 hoover and fies er made contact with governors to let them know that the federal government and red cross would jointly direct all activities the scholarly and press accounts on the flood response cited above reveal jurisdictional disputes between federal agencies or between federal and state agencies again hoover created an administrative machine that said the federal response has been faulted on at least four points first while the employment of governmental nd private sector resources allowed for creative responses it also opened the door to potential abuses for example hoover reportedly empowered baker to order the izure of privately owned boats by relief workers47 thus with executive order or statute private individuals were authorized to take the property of othe rs to whom individuals affected and aggrieved by civilian exercise of federal powers would protest or appeal is simply unclear48 second decentralized execution meant th at the federal government had little oversight of the actual operations of the relief camps two significant incidents illustrate the limitations of th is method of administration first critics accused the red cross of being slow to respond to the spread of venereal diseases among camp residents49 second in some red cross camps local officials brutalized black evacuees and disallowed them to leave the camps50 in each of these instances thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33126crs10 51 more problematic is that president coolid ge empowered hoover to issue reports on the progress of flood recovery with an eye on run for the presidency in 1928 this gave hoover strong incentive to be less than objec tive about inadequate results thus he would often claim that six or fewer persons died once he was put in control of flood response this figure is not deemed credible see barry rising tide p 289 52 lohof hoover and the mississi ppi valley flood of 1927 pp 140141 53

directions from headquarters and hoover to field operations were very explicit as to the goals desired in one instance hoover wired regional representative in new iberia on may 1 he ordered it to erect camp to hold 10000 persons and gave instructions on th proper construction and installation of the facilities including tent platforms latrines pipelines wells and power lines52 however these same directions provided little direction as to the appropriate meanslocals were to figure it out themselves free to use whatever means they felt necessary to achieve these ends local relie f workers in many instances forced black males sometimes at gun point to participate in flood response work 53 in short workers carrying out ostensibly federal wo rk were not federal workers and did not have to follow federal administrative laws finally there is the matter of power c oncentration in the hands of cabinet level czar as head of the hoover fl ood commission head of the red cross flood relief effort and the public face of flood relief thanks to his tireless public relations efforts secretary hoover held an immense amount of administrative and political power54 and he was permitted to wield this power for over three months april through july of 1927 for the president had given the hoover flood commission the authority to direct disast er response relief and reconstruction while this empowered him to do much good work hoover also made glaring mistakes and made matters worse by refusing to admit his errors and make amends critically nobody the president excepted c ould force hoover to change course55 for example there is evidence that hoover was aware of the mistreatment of blacks in the camps and the shortcomings of his credit provision plan yet he did little to fix these problems56 in late may of 1927 the secretary decided that the farmers of the area should plant soybeans instead of cotton he directed the red cross which received public donations for the fl ood res ponse to buy enough soybean seed for 400000 acres when informed by agricultural scientists that soybeans were not an advisable crop choice for the affected areas hoove r disregarded th is counsel
