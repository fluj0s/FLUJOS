was panelist in roundtable on policies and legislative measures mpaa ceo dan glickman delivered remarks outlining the rightsholders point of view the conference was informative with highquality presentations the roundtable discussions helped shed light on efforts underway in various countries to address the problem of internet piracy the conference was thus particularly timely as the gos is expected to unveil series of measures to combat piracypromoting websites by the end of the year 2 sbu mpaa ceo glickman told the charge that his meetings with the two ministers most responsible for combating internet piracy were encouraging minister of industry tourism and trade mityc miguel sebastian told glickman unambiguously that the interministerial commissions recommendations will include an administrative course of action to block or take down pirate websites mityc had heretofore been believed to oppose such an approach and sebastians embrace of it may be sign that the gos is preparing to implement measures with teeth though not as much as rightsholders would like to see end summary 3 u mitycs secretariat of state for telecommunications and the information society setsi organized the conference as part of the third annual ficod it opened with an address by paul brown vicepresident of spotify free legal online music service that has recently become available in spain and that was also featured recently in economist articles about successes in reducing online music piracy spotify is supported by advertising revenue or for those who wish to avoid the ads paid subscriptions the increased prevalence of legitimate vehicles for making content available and the need for much more legal content online as means of reducing the temptation to pirate were major recurring themes of the conference legislative issues 4 u the roundtable on policies and legislative measures included government officials from the us the uk germany sweden and france and wipo representative michele woods senior counsel for policy and international affairs at the us copyright office discussed the google books case its revised settlement agreement and implications for orphan works steve rowan of the uk intellectual property office ipo reported on recent developments in that country including new draft legislation adopting three strikes approach which involves cutting

enforcement directive and prosecution of the pirate bay principals french culture ministry official updated the audience on the hadopi law which after many setbacks is to take effect at the beginning of the year with the promulgation of implementing regulations it is evident that in the united states and many european countries there is great deal of activity taking place on variety of fronts approaches to combating online piracy 5 u the roundtable on the fight against iprinfringing activities on the internet was moderated by guillermo corral director general for policy and cultural industries at the ministry of culture who spoke about gos efforts to encourage negotiations between the coalition of creators and content industries and the internet service providers isp association redtel he also alluded to the interministerial commission formed october 9 ref d to make madrid 00001152 0023 of 004 recommendations to the government the first panelist aldo olcese spoke of changes that have taken place in his first year as president of the coalition which previously consisted of copyright management entities and various film and music producers and distributors and audiovisual groups the spanish association of video game publishers and distributors adese joined the coalition in january and spains major book publishing industry association joined later in the year awareness on the part of the government and the general public has grown olcese said and the content providers dont feel as isolated as they did before he characterized continuing efforts to finalize an agreement between the coalition and redtel as difficult and predicted that such an agreement will only be realized at the last minute 6 u olcese outlined what he called the spanish model for combating piracy model which he characterized as more democratic than the approach in other countries as it seeks to reduce online availability of pirated material while leaving the end user alone the spanish model is focused on the producers and distributors of pirated content the pirates supermarket per ref d on october 19 the coalition delivered list of 200 alleged commercialscale pirate websites to the mityc to be passed to the prosecutor generals office fiscalia for investigation and prosecution and also urged mityc to take independent action against the sites comment it remains unclear what authority mityc may have beyond the ability to levy modest fines nor are we aware whether the any gos entity is contemplating action against any of the listed websites end comment at the same time the coalition has been actively developing business model approach and plans to launch macro website to help users in spain gain access to legal content online so that they will be less inclined to download it without authorization both mityc and the ministry of culture have expressed the intention to provide financial support to the macroweb olcese noted that identifying the right mix of incentives and sanctions to deter internet piracy is still matter of trial and error nobody knows which model will work best 7 u maria teresa arcos executive director for isp association redtel hailed the creation of the interministerial commission and said the isps seek the continued growth of legal online market and an end to the dichotomy between technology and culture she also cited the european parliaments recent approval of the telecom package and the importance of finding balance between competing rights while acknowledging the importance of dissuasive measures arcos focused on the need for attractive legal offer with flexible prices and said redtel looks forward to the launching of the coalitions macroweb 8 u jesus rubi of the spanish data protection agency aepd stated that data protection is not inimical to intellectual property protection he noted however that under spanish law internet protocol addresses and their association with individual users are personal data and thus protected from disclosure in most circumstances under the european court of justices january 2008 ruling in promusicae v telefonica isps are not required to disclose users identities in civil litigation and governments are not obliged to compel them to do so governments are only required to seek balance between privacy and property rights rubi noted that the congressional subcommittee on intellectual property had recently sent questionnaire to aepd which had replied by suggesting several points to be taken into account if congress wishes to consider amending existing legislation rightsholders concerns 9 u juan junquera chief of staff to secretary of state for telecommunications and the information society francisco ros moderated the panel on the rightsholders point of view olivia regnier of the international federation of phonographic industries ifpi cited figures showing that 95 percent of peertopeer p2p downloads of music are unauthorized and thus illegal she also pointed to figures showing steady decline in traditional music sales in spain since 2001 and said called for more cooperation on the part madrid 00001152 0033 of 004 of isps in combating illicit downloads 10 u dan glickman chairman and ceo of the motion picture association of america mpaa referred to president zapateros october 21 speech to the american business council ref d in which he outlined the concerns of both the usg and the gos over ipr protection in spain calling piracy dagger through the heart of creators glickman noted that great quality works of art require both conduit and an artist the internet can be powerful tool for the dissemination of culture but also poses unique challenges for which there is magic solution voluntary agreements with isps are welcome but are not enough in themselves government has necessary role to play the digital environment will continue to grow as medium for cultural transmission but the physical environment should not be overlooked the notion of free content while seductive to some is an invitation to anarchy legal online offers of content will not work unless they are wellimplemented within an adequate legal infrastructure glickman stressed the importance of constructive balanced solution and said mpaa looks forward to the gos announcement of concrete measures by years end 11 u antonio guisasola of the music producers of spain promusicae in an oblique reference to state secretary ross characterization ref of spains internet piracy problem as an urban legend sought to dispel two urban legends of his own the first is that the music industry wants to do away with the internet the second is that lack of legal online alternatives is the reason piracy flourishes in spain there are he said 370 legal music services in europe with more appearing all the time consumers are able to choose from among range of options and are increasingly getting better deals guisasola announced the launch of promusicaes own portal wwwelportaldemusicaes to link spanish users to prominent legal sites but legal offer he said is not enough he cited jupiter research study showing that 32 of users in spain frequently use p2p facilities compared to an average of 15 for europe of those 52 say that free downloading has reduced their purchases of original music also only 32 of spaniards surveyed said they thought p2p activity was illegal compared to 64 in france 79 in germany and 70 in europe as whole guisasola said more cooperation is needed from isps and there must be credible risk of real punishment to deter wrongdoers carrots can help but sticks are needed as well responding to junqueras reminder that p2p is not illegal per but is technology that can be put to legal or illegal uses guisasola countered that almost all p2p downloads of music are illegal 12 u during the questionandanswer period one questioner asked whether the interministerial commission will recommend dissuasive action only against websites that house infringing material or also against p2p portals junquera replied that the gos is constrained from going after p2p activity by the basic constitutional principle protecting private communications from government interference ifpis olivia regnier demurred pointing out that p2p activity is form of public not private communication junquera however reiterated that the focus of gos enforcement efforts will be on websites that host or provide links to infringing content he also sought to clarify state secretary ross urban legend remark which has been muchcriticized by content providers the gos he said does not deny that internet piracy is serious problem in spain deserving of government attention the gos does however take issue with assertions that spain has significantly higher rates of internet piracy than its european neighbors and that it is among the worst in the world in this regard 13 u the conference included one final roundtable on implications for ipr of online social networks and speech by duke university law professor james boyle comment 14 sbu though 2009 has been frustrating year for rightholders there is good chance it will end on positive note in meeting with charge mpaa ceo dan glickman expressed satisfaction with his meetings with industry tourism and trade minister miguel sebastian and madrid 00001152 0043 of 004 minister of culture angeles gonzalezsinde sebastian he said was quite forthright and specific about the commissions work it will deliver its recommendations by years end these will include amending the law to give government more tools to combat piracy and one component will be an administrative course of action to block offending websites according to various sources state secretary ros who reports to sebastian and was present at his meeting with glickman and his staffers had been opposing such an administrative remedy in the commissions discussions refs bc but have apparently been brought around by the other ministries represented rightsholders however remain concerned that the government may implement only halfmeasures promusicae staged demonstration in front of mityc on december 1 and presented minister sebastian with peition signed by 2500 music professionals calling on the government to take valiant measures as the french and british governments have already done to protect their culture and jobs
