uslw 3456 11200 mootness the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit erred in dismissing this case as moot the case stemming from the remand in adarand constructors inc v pena 1995 involved petitioner lowbidders challenge to racially discriminatory policies in award of highway construction contracts in response to earlier phases of the litigation the colorado department of transportation cdot eliminated its racebased presumptions of disadvantaged status and instead authorized applicants to selfcertify the disadvantaged status of their majority owners the petitioner did so selfcertify based on the fact that it had been the subject of racial discrimination under the old policy the court of appeals then dismissed the underlying action as moot because cdot had recognized the petitioners disadvantaged status but the court of appeals failed to take into account that colorados selfcertification procedures had not yet been approved by the us department of transportation dot as required by federal regulation given the patent incompatibility of the certification with the federal regulations it was not at all clear that the procedures could be approved by dot the respondents did not meet their burden of establishing that it was absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur 90 per curiam apprendi v new jersey 120 s ct 2348 68 uslw 4576 62600 due process right to trial by jury sentence enhancement new jersey hate crime statute that allows judge to extend sentence upon finding by preponderance of the evidence that the defendant in committing crime for which he has been found guilty acted with purpose to intimidate because of race violates the fourteenth amendments due process clause and the sixth amendments requirements of speedy and public trial by an impartial jury any fact that increases the penalty for crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt the hate crime law which authorized the judge to extend imprisonment for seconddegree offense to imprisonment from 10 to 20 years thereby authorized the judge to increase the defendants penalty for the second degree offense of possession of firearm for an unlawful purpose punishable by imprisonment of 5 to 10 years beyond the prescribed statutory maximum for that offense the effect is to turn seconddegree offense into firstdegree offense under new jersey law the constitutional principles are violated because the factual issue of whether the defendant acted with the purpose of intimidating is left to the judge rather than being submitted to the jury and may be established by preponderance of the evidence rather than by proof beyond reasonable doubt characterizing the inquiry as one of motive does not save the statute as sentencing measure since the defendants intent in committing crime is perhaps as close as one might hope to come to core criminal offense element the states reliance on mcmillan v pennsylvania 1986 and almendareztorres v united states 1998 is misplaced mcmillan dealt with mandatory minimum sentence that did not authorize exceeding the statutory maximum for the underlyinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30616crs2 offense and the recidivismbased exception to the general rule recognized in almendareztorres is inapplicable to the new jersey

and estimated tax payments are paid is the due date on the taxpayers income tax return section 6511b2a of the tax code provides that the amount of credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within the period immediately preceding the filing of the claim equal to 3 years plus the period of any extension the plain language of section 6513b determines when withholding and estimated taxes are paid that section provides that for purposes of section 6511 withholding taxes shall be deemed to have been paid on the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of his taxable year and estimated taxes shall be deemed to have been paid on the last day prescribed for filing the return here the taxpayer did not file his 1988 return and claim refund until june 1 1993 the three year look back period lengthened as result of the fourmonth extension he had received in 1989 extended back to february 1 1990 the taxpayer had paid portion of his overpaid tax during that period since by operation of section 6513 his payments were deemed to have been made on april 15 1989 90 opinion for unanimous court by thomas beck v prupis 120 s ct 1608 68 uslw 4320 42600 rico conspiracy nature of overt act person injured by an overt act in furtherance of rico conspiracy has cause of action under 18 usc 1962d only if the overt act is an act of racketeering or otherwise unlawful under rico the provision makes it unlawful for anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30616crs3 person to conspire to violatespecified rico provisions when congress uses language not otherwise defined with settled commonlaw meaning congress is presumed to know and adopt that meaning at the time of ricos enactment in 1970 it was well established that plaintiff could bring suit for civil conspiracy only if he had been injured by an act that was itself tortious the rico analogy to an act of tortious character is an act that is independently wrongful under rico in this case the overt act of discharging from employment was not independently wrongful under rico this interpretation does not render the conspiracy language mere surplusage since as long as one conspirator has committed an overt act plaintiff could use the provision to sue other coconspirators who have not themselves committed an overt act 72 opinion of court by thomas joined by rehnquist oconnor scalia kennedy ginsburg and breyer dissenting opinion by stevens joined by souter board of regents of the univ of wisconsin system v southworth 120 s ct 1346 68 uslw 4220 32100 first amendment mandatory student fees the first amendment permits public university to charge its students an activity fee that is used to support student organizations that engage in expressive activities if the money is allocated to those groups by use of viewpointneutral criteria students opposed to the purposes and expression of some of the subsidized organizations brought this challenge alleging they should not be required to subsidize speech they find objectionable the parties stipulated that two of the three processes for reviewing and approving funding are administered in viewpointneutral fashion this viewpoint neutrality requirement is in general sufficient to protect the rights of the objecting students rights recognized in the context of union and state bar association dues are implicated by the universitys program but the protections adopted for those contexts are neither applicable nor workable in the university context in those contexts the court limited the required subsidy to speech germane to the purposes of the union or bar association the germaneness standard difficult enough to apply to unions and bar associations becomes all the more unmanageable in the university setting where the purpose is to stimulate the whole universe of speech and ideas the university may if it chooses adopt an optional or refund system but there is constitutional requirement that it do so nor need the university distinguish between on campus and offcampus expressive activities the third process the university provides for allocating funds to student groups student referendum in which the student body can vote to approve or to disapprove an assessment substitutes majority rule for viewpoint neutrality and cannot be upheld along with the other aspects of the program 90 opinion of court by kennedy joined by rehnquist

luggage search border patrol agents violated the fourth amendment by feeling and squeezing carryon luggage in the overhead storage compartment of bus the bus passenger in this case had exhibited an actual expectation of privacy by using an opaque bag and placing it directly above his seat bus passenger who places his bag in an overhead bin expects that other passengers will handle the bag in the process of making room for their own luggage but does not expect that other passengers will feel the bag in an exploratory manner that expectation of privacy is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable and the agents physical manipulation of the bag therefore violated the passengers fourth amendment rights 72 opinion of court by rehnquist joined by stevens oconnor kennedy souter thomas and ginsburg dissenting opinion by breyer joined by scalia boy scouts of america v dale 120 s ct 2446 68 uslw 4625 62800 first amendment freedom of association application of new jerseys public accommodations law to require the boy scouts of america private nonprofit organization to admit an avowed homosexual as an adult member and assistant scoutmaster violates the organizations first amendment associational rights the general mission of the scouts to instill values in young people is expressive activity entitled to first amendment protection although neither the scout oath nor the scout law expressly mentions sexuality or sexual orientation they do require scout to be clean and morally straight the court accepts the boy scouts assertion that the organization teaches that homosexual conduct is not morally straight this assertion is documented by 1978 position statement distributed to members of the scouts executive committee and by other statements made after the respondents membership in the scouts was revoked the court also gives deference to the associations view of what would impair its expression allowing gay rights activist to serve in the scouts would force the organization to send message that the boy scouts accepts homosexual conduct as legitimate form of behavior in earlier cases the court found that application of state public accommodations laws to the jaycees and to the rotary club would not materially interfere with the ideas that these organizations sought to express by contrast application of new jerseys public accommodations law does significantly burden the scouts right to oppose or disfavor homosexual conduct the courts decision in hurley v irishamerican gay group 1995 in which the court upheld the right of parade organizers to exclude message with which parade organizers disagreed is more on point while homosexuality appears to have gained greater societal acceptance an organization is free to espouse an unpopular view 54 opinion of court by rehnquist joined by oconnor scalia kennedy and thomas dissenting opinions by stevens joined by souter ginsburg and breyer and by souter joined by ginsburg and

rights ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30616crs5 political parties under the blanket primary law adopted by initiative in 1996 as proposition 198 each voters primary ballot lists every candidate regardless of party affiliation and allows the voter to choose freely among all the candidates while the court has held that racial discrimination in state sanctioned primary elections is state action for purposes of the fifteenth amendment these cases do not stand for any general proposition that party affairs are public affairs that states may freely regulate rather political parties retain rights of association that include the right to exclude non members in the process of selecting nominees for public office proposition 198 impinges on these rights by forcing political parties to adulterate their candidateselection process by opening it up to persons wholly unaffiliated with the party the law can be upheld therefore only if it is narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interest compelling state interest is furthered by proposition 198 better representation of the electorate and expansion of candidate debate are inadmissible interests that reduce to stark repudiation of freedom of political association the interest in assuring an effective vote for disenfranchised independents and minority party voters in safe districts is overborne by the countervailing and legitimate right of the party to determine its own membership qualifications other asserted interests in promoting fairness voter choice voter participation and voter privacy are not compelling justifications for blanket primary even if there were compelling governmental interest proposition 198 is not narrowly tailored all of the asserted interests could be protected by nonpartisan blanket primary in which parties might nominate candidates prior to the primary so that primary voters would not choose partys nominee 72 opinion of court by scalia joined by rehnquist oconnor kennedy souter

texas law that eliminated requirement that the testimony of sexual assault victim age 14 or older must be corroborated by two other witnesses cannot constitutionally be applied to crime committed while the earlier law was in effect such application violates the ex post facto clause of art i sec 10 the contours of the ex post facto clause were set forth in the 1798 case of calder v bull and included the category of every law that alters the legal rules of evidence and receives less or different testimony than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence in order to convict the offender the texas law at issue is unquestionably such law under the old law the petitioner could have been convicted only if the victims testimony were corroborated by two other witnesses while under the amended law the petitioner could and was convicted on the victims testimony alone neither texas nor the united states as amicus offers persuasive reasons for abandoning this category of ex post facto law which resonates harmoniously with one of the clauses principal interests that of fundamental justice 54 opinion of court by stevens joined by scalia souter thomas and breyer dissenting opinion by ginsburg joined by rehnquist oconnor and kennedyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30616crs6 carter v united states 120 s ct 2159 68 uslw 4513 61200 statutes interpretation lesser included offense the crime defined by 18 usc 2113b is not lesser included offense of the crime defined by 18 usc 2113a subsection b penalizes anyone who takes and carries away with intent to steal or purloin any property or money exceeding 1000 in value and belonging to bank subsection penalizes anyone who by force and violence or by intimidation takes from the person of another any money or property belonging to bank generally crime is lesser included offense of another crime only if the elements of the lesser offense are subset of the elements of the charged offense three elements of section 2113b are not elements of section 2113a specific intent to steal carrying away the stolen property and valuation exceeding 1000 arguments for departing from this straightforward reading of the text are rejected the fact that subsection c penalizes receipt of property taken from bank in violation of subsection b but makes mention of subsection is an anomaly but does not rise to the level of an absurdity the fact that subsections and b closely resemble the common law crimes of robbery and larceny does not require imputation of commonlaw meaning to the provisions common law meaning is imputed when congress borrows terms of art with accumulated meaning but neither the term robbery nor the term larceny appears in the statutory text the word robbery does appear in the sections title but words in title are useful only when they shed light on some ambiguous word or phase in the text and such ambiguity exists the intent to steal or purloin element of subsection b is not implicit in subsection only general intent requirement not the specific intent to steal or purloin should be read into subsection taking property in violation of should not be equated with taking and carrying away property in violation of b it would hardly have been absurd for congress to have eliminated the asportation requirement from the 1000 valuation is clearly an offense element and not sentencing factor 54 opinion of court by thomas joined by rehnquist oconnor scalia and kennedy dissenting opinion by ginsburg joined by stevens souter and breyer castillo v united states 120 s ct 2090 68 uslw 4475 6500 statutes interpretation elements of offense language in 18 usc 924c providing that person who uses machine gun during commission of crime of violence shall be sentenced to imprisonment for thirty years defines separate crime and does not merely authorize an enhanced sentence an indictment for the machine gun offense therefore must identify the firearm type and jury must find that element proved beyond reasonable doubt the section provides that anyone who uses firearm during commission of crime of violence shall be sentenced to five years imprisonment and then increases the penalty sixfold if that firearm is machine gun while the literal language of the section is neutral as to whether the relevant words create separate crime or merely authorize an enhanced penalty the statutory structure strongly favors the new crime interpretation the machine gun provision is contained in the same sentence that establishes the elements of the basic uses firearm offense it is the following three sentences that refer directly to sentencing factors such as recidivism although use of ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30616crs7 machine gun might be considered to fall within the traditional sentencing category relating to the manner in which crime is carried out the same could be said for use of firearm to ask jury rather than judge to determine the type of weapon defendant used will rarely complicate trial or risk unfairness on the other hand leaving the decision to the sentencing judge may produce conflict between the judge and jury when the jury must determine which of several weapons defendant used references to sentencing in the legislative history do not help the governments interpretation since the statutes basic uses firearm provision also deals with sentencing finally the length and severity of an added mandatory sentence weighs in favor of treating the language as referring to an element of an offense 90 opinion of court by breyer joined by rehnquist stevens oconnor kennedy souter thomas and ginsburg and joined in part by scalia christensen v harris county 120 s ct 1655 68 uslw 4343 5100 flsa forced use of compensatory time the fair labor standards act flsa does not prohibit the county from requiring its employees to schedule time off in order to reduce the amount of accrued compensatory time nothing in the flsa expressly prohibits public employers from compelling employees to utilize accrued compensatory time and the laws requirement that an employee shall be permitted to use compensatory time within reasonable period of requesting to do so does not implicitly prohibit such compulsion this latter grant of authority to employees to use compensatory time provided such use will not unduly disrupt the workplace does not implicitly preclude other methods of spending compensatory time the provision should be read as safeguarding an employees right to receive timely compensation and as guaranteeing that an employee will get to use his compensatory time deference is due department of labor opinion letter requiring advance agreement by an employee before an employer may compel use of comp time interpretations such as those contained in opinion letters are not arrived at after adjudication or noticeandcomment rulemaking lack the force of law and consequently do not warrant chevron type deference 63 merits 54 deference opinion of

violate the first amendment as applied to the operator of nude dancing establishment open to the public the ordinance permits dancers to perform wearing only pasties and gstring but not totally nude one purpose of the ordinance was to combat negative secondary effects such as prostitution and other criminal activity associated with the presence of adult entertainment establishments as general prohibition on public nudity the ordinance is not aimed at suppression of expression and consequently should be evaluated under the framework set forth in unitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30616crs8 states v obrien 1968 for contentneutral restrictions on symbolic speech there is court majority however on how the obrien test applies the fourjustice plurality would allow the city to take official notice of legislative facts and to rely on earlier cases permitting zoning of adult establishments and would not require discrete evidentiary record in order to satisfy obriens requirement that an incidental restriction on expression be greater than essential to achieve the regulations purpose the two other justices concurring on the merits would hold that there is need to identify harmful secondary effects because general law regulating conduct and not specifically directed at expression is not subject to first amendment scrutiny at all although the kandyland establishment operated by the respondents has been closed the case is not moot since the respondents may have an interest in resuming operations and the city has an interest in reversing the pennsylvania supreme courts

modify an arbitration award may be brought in any district that is proper under the general venue statute or as provided in the faa in the district where the award was made sections 9 10 and 11 of the faa provide that the district court in the district in which the award was made may enter appropriate orders use of the word may is not necessarily conclusive of congressional intent to provide for discretionary or permissive authority in this case however statutory history points toward permissive reading and this conclusion is reinforced by consideration of the practical consequences of restrictive reading when the faa was enacted in 1925 venue was ordinarily available only in the district of the defendants residence against this background the faas venue provisions had an obviously liberalizing effect there being indication that congress intended to take away the venue that is normally the most convenient for defendant the practical consequences of restrictive reading would include needless tension with 3 which authorizes court to stay and retain jurisdiction over any action that is referable to arbitration and the creation of anomalous results in the aftermath of

to control economic sanctions against burma the president is authorized to terminate sanctions initially imposed by statute and is empowered to impose additional sanctions limiting new investment in burma the presence of state sanctions as well as their perpetual nature limits the presidents flexibility the massachusetts law which applies to contracts for goods and services and to foreign as well as domestic companies is broader in scope than the federal law the massachusetts law also frustrates the presidents ability to engage in effective diplomacy in carrying out the federal laws directive to work with other nations to develop comprehensive multilateral strategy for improving democracy and human rights practices in burma the failure of congress to include express preemption language in

congressional power to abrogate miranda v arizona 1966 was constitutional decision that the supreme court declines to overrule and that may not be overruled by statute in miranda the court laid down concrete constitutional guidelines for the police to follow prior to custodial interrogation of suspect police must warn suspect that he has the right to remain silent that anything he says can be used against him in court that he has the right to an attorney and that if he cannot afford an attorney one can be appointed two years after the miranda decision congress enacted 18 usc 3501 which purported to reinstate the voluntariness principle that had measured the validity of confessions prior to miranda and that the court had found inadequate in miranda section 3501 is an invalid attempt by congress to redefine constitutional protection congress may not legislatively supersede the supreme courts decisions interpreting and applying the constitution although there is language in some of the courts decisions suggesting that the miranda warnings are merely prophylactic rules they are instead constitutionbased rules this is not to say that the miranda warnings are necessarily immutable the court in miranda invited legislative rule that would be at least as effective in protecting suspects right to remain silent during custodial interrogation section 3501 however is not an adequate substitute for the miranda warnings miranda should not be overruled by the court principles of stare decisis weigh heavily against its overruling and miranda has become embedded in routine police

tax lien disclaimer of inheritance under state law disclaimer of an inherited estate pursuant to state law does not operate to nullify federal tax lien imposed on the heirs property and rights to property pursuant to 26 usc 6321 the issue of whether the disclaimer right held under state law constitutes property or rights to property within the meaning of the federal tax lien statute is matter of federal law the language of the tax lien statute is broad and reveals on its face that congress intended to reach every interest in property that taxpayer might have section 6334a of the code which lists property exempt from levy corroborates this broad reading inheritances disclaimed under state law are not included in the listing of exempt property and congress provided that this listing is exclusive moreover the tax lien treatment of disclaimers contrasts with that of section 2518a which expressly renders statelaw disclaimers effective for federal wealthtransfer tax purposes the important consideration in determining whether the disclaimer right constitutes property right subject to tax lien is the breadth of control the taxpayer may exercise over the property here arkansas law conferred an unqualified right in the petitioner to receive the entire value of his mothers estate or to disclaim the inheritance and channel its entire value to his daughter this control rendered the inheritance property or right to property within the meaning of the statute 90 opinion for unanimous court by ginsburg edwards v carpenter 120 s ct 1587 68 uslw 4308 42500 habeas corpus

tobacco products the fda lacks authority under the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca to regulate tobacco products congress has directly spoken to the issue of fda jurisdiction within the meaning of chevron v nrdc 1984 and has precluded thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30616crs11 fdas assertion of jurisdiction the issue is not determined solely by reference to the fdcas definitions but rather by reference to the act as whole by reference to tobaccospecific legislation enacted after the fdca and to common sense as to the manner in which congress is likely to delegate policy decision of such economic and political magnitude to an administrative agency tobacco products simply do not fit within the fdcas regulatory scheme core purpose of the fdca is to ensure that regulated products are safe and effective for their intended uses because the fda exhaustively documented that tobacco products are unsafe and present extraordinary health risks the agency would be required to remove these products from the market if it asserts jurisdiction to regulate them congress however has foreclosed the removal of tobacco products from the market the six laws enacted since 1965 that directly address smoking and health all stop well short of ordering ban on sale moreover congress tobaccospecific statutes have effectively ratified the fdas former long held position that it lacked authority to regulate tobacco products absent manufacturers claims of therapeutic benefit congress has relied on the fdas denial of jurisdiction in legislating to address smoking and health has rejected bills that would have conferred such jurisdiction on the fda and has also acted to preclude other agencies from exercising regulatory authority in the area 54 opinion of court by oconnor joined by rehnquist

in order to hide leakage problem the petitioners conviction was affirmed on appeal and the pennsylvania supreme court refused to review his case after the petitioners conviction became final the pennsylvania supreme court upheld an intermediate courts reversal of the facility managers conviction and ruled that violation of permit conditions did not constitute operation of the facility without permit the petitioner then initiated habeas corpus proceedings alleging due process deprivation the question certified to the pennsylvania supreme court is whether its interpretation in the facility

usc 666 applies to hospital organizations that participate in the medicare program language in section 666 providing that covered federal programs may involve grant contract subsidy loan guarantee

significant and substantial reasons in addition to compensation or reimbursement medicare is comprehensive federal assistance enterprise aimed at ensuring the availability of quality health care for

organizations had standing to assert the interests of their members in clean water act citizen suit seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties for violation of discharge permit the relevant showing for article iii standing is not injury to the environment but rather injury to the plaintiffs here the environmental organizations established standing by documenting that the defendants permit violations directly affected the recreational aesthetic and economic interests of their members redressability one of the essential elements of standing was present even though civil penalties are payable to the government rather than to the plaintiffs the civil penalties carried with them deterrent effect that made it likely as opposed to merely speculative that the penalties would redress plaintiffs injuries by abating current violations and preventing future ones the claims for civil penalties were not mooted by the defendants compliance with its permit after the commencement of the litigation mootness is not merely standing set in time frame there can be exceptions to mootness eg capable of repetition yet evading review that cannot be recognized for standing the district courts denial of injunctive relief and the plaintiffs failure to appeal that denial did not moot the case the district courts assessment of civil penalties recognized need for deterrence 72 opinion of court

frequency of parole reviews was qualified in two respects the law gave the board discretion to determine how often within the eightyear period to reconsider an inmates status and the law also preserved the possibility of an earlier reconsideration based on change of circumstances or new information this discretion allowing the board to focus on prisoners deserving reconsideration may result in some prisoners being released earlier than would have been the case otherwise the record contained insufficient information to determine whether the change in the rule significantly

vehicle with drivers side airbag the express preemption provision of the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act which prohibits states from applying any safety standard different from an applicable federal standard does not by itself preempt the state tort action preemption by statute is inconsistent with the acts saving clause which provides that compliance with federal safety standard does not exempt any person from any liability under common law this saving clause however does not foreclose or limit the operation of ordinary preemption principles governing override of state laws including common law tort rules that conflict with federal statutes or regulations application of the tort rule would actually conflict with standard 208 because it would operate to frustrate the objectives of the federal rule the federal standard sought variety by allowing manufacturers to choose from among several different passive restraint systems and also sought gradual

congress would not have used any election to mean general election also congress has distinguished between votes and ballots in the same context of guamanian elections equating the two terms would impute to the congress strange preference for making it hard to select governor by requiring runoff even though one slate already had majority of all those who cared to make any choice among

transaction prohibited by erisa 406a1 section 406a which bars fiduciary of an employee benefit plan from causing the plan to engage in certain transactions with party in interest imposes duty only on the fiduciary section 502a3 however which authorizes civil action to obtain appropriate equitable relief to redress violations of title i itself imposes certain duties liability under section 502a3 therefore does not depend on whether erisas substantive provisions impose specific duty on the party being sued the provision contains limit on the universe of possible defendants while by contrast other provisions of erisa do address who may be defendant because section 502 l authorizes the secretary to assess civil penalty against any other person who knowingly participates in fiduciarys breach it follows that participant beneficiary or fiduciary may bring suit against an other person under the similarly worded subsection a3 concerns about possible misuse of section 502a3 are

converted into chapter 7 liquidation and the petitioner sought to recover the premiums as an administrative expense section 506c which provides that the trustee may recover from property securing an allowed secured claim the reasonable necessary costs of preserving such property creates an exception to the normal rule that secured claims are superior to administrative claims the plain language of the provision specifies that it is the trustee who may recover administrative costs and the proper inference is that the trustee is the only party so empowered the trustees unique role in bankruptcy proceedings makes it entirely plausible that congress would provide power to him and not to others the fact that congress did not use only or other restrictive language does not mean that parties other than the trustee may invoke the provision in this case the language of the code leaves room for clarification by reference to precode practice it is also far from clear that policy implications

eight feet of another person without that persons consent for the purpose of passing leaflet or handbill displaying sign or engaging in protest education or counseling is constitutional the measure is valid content neutral time place or manner regulation of speech that balances the rights of lawabiding speakers to attempt to persuade others to change their views and the recognized privacy interest of the unwilling listener in avoiding unwanted communication the restrictions are contentneutral because they regulate only the places where some speech may occur and because they apply equally to all demonstrators regardless of viewpoint although the restrictions do not apply to all speech the kind of cursory examination that might be required to distinguish casual conversation from protest education or counseling is not problematic the law is narrowly tailored to achieve the states interests the 8foot restriction does not significantly impair the ability to convey messages by signs and ordinarily allows speakers to come within normal conversational distance of their targets because the statute allows the speaker to remain in one place persons who wish to hand out leaflets may position themselves beside entrances near the path of oncoming pedestrians and consequently are not deprived of the opportunity to get the attention of persons entering clinic the statute is neither

taxable share of multistate corporations income under that system the corporations total income from its nationwide business is first determined and the share appropriately attributed to california is then calculated by applying ratios reflecting instate property payroll and sales the unitary income subject to tax excludes income derived from business enterprise that is separate and discrete from that conducted instate state may not constitutionally tax this nonunitary business income california specifies that the amount of interest that may be deducted is the amount by which interest expense exceeds interest and dividend income not subject to allocation by formula ie the amount by which interest expense exceeds interest and dividends received from nonunitary business or investment if california could show that its deduction limit actually reflects the portion of the expense properly attributable to nonunitary income the tax would not in fact be tax on nonunitary income california cannot do so however and also cannot establish that its limit is reasonable effort to allocate the deduction between taxable and taxexempt income other approaches such as ratiobased rules recognize

stop of person if the officer has reasonable articulable suspicion that the person is engaging in criminal activity here the respondents presence in highcrime area was not enough standing alone to create such reasonable suspicion but his unprovoked flight from the area when noticing the police did create reasonable suspicion that he was involved in criminal activity headlong flight wherever it occurs is the consummate act of evasion it is not necessarily indicative of wrongdoing but it is certainly suggestive of such person approached by officers who lack probable cause or reasonable suspicion may refuse to cooperate but unprovoked flight is simply not mere refusal to cooperate the fact that there may be innocent reasons for flight does not prevent an investigative stop even in

its retroactive application would violate the prohibition on ex post facto laws there are indications that congress intended the provision to apply retroactively and the normal rule in the absence of contrary indications is that the effective date is the date of enactment the preexisting provision 18 usc 3583e3 permits imposition of additional supervised release following revocation of supervised release and reimprisonment the provision allows court to revoke term of supervised release and require the person to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release focus on the verb revoke would lead the court to conclude that the language confers authority to impose supervised release following the reincarceration the conventional meaning of revoke is to annul by recalling or taking back there are some textual reasons however to conclude otherwise subsection e1 authorizes court when circumstances warrant to terminate term of supervised release and discharge the supervised person if subsection 3 had likewise been meant to conclude any possibility of supervised release later it would have been natural for congress to write in like terms also since subsection 3 provides that all or part of the term of supervised release may be served in prison this means that something about the term of supervised release survives the revocation order moreover there is an unconventional usage of revoke supported by dictionary that indicates that the recall need not be final but may be tentative for deliberation finally this unconventional reading comports with the

clear in the adea the act authorizes employees to maintain actions against any employer including public agency in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction and defines the term public agency to include the government of state or political subdivision thereof because congress lacks power under article i to abrogate states eleventh amendment immunity but may do so pursuant to section 5 of the fourteenth amendment the private petitioners in this case may maintain their federal court actions against states only if the adea is appropriate legislation under section 5 the test for appropriateness is whether there is congruence and proportionality between the constitutional injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end age is not suspect class under the equal protection clause and hence age classifications must be irrational before being held unconstitutional given this standard the adea is so out of proportion to remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to or designed to prevent unconstitutional behavior congress pursuant to its section 5 power may enact reasonably prophylactic legislation but the legislative

arguments relying on historical evidence the structure of the sixth amendment and respect for the individual the historical evidence supporting trial right longer has the same force and in any event there simply was long respected right of selfrepresentation on appeal the structure of the sixth amendment is not relevant the amendment identifies rights that are available in preparation for trial

to hold down treatment costs an hmos treatment decisions are intertwined with eligibility decisions typically fiduciary responsibilities relate to managing assets and distributing property to beneficiaries and it is doubtful whether congress intended to extend fiduciary responsibilities to mixed eligibility and treatment decisions by hmo doctors consideration of the consequences of extending coverage confirms that congress made such choice allowing recovery for breach of fiduciary responsibility simply upon showing that the profit incentive to ration health care would generally affect mixed eligibility and treatment decisions would have the effect of eliminating the forprofit hmo yet congress has promoted the formation of hmo practices for 27 years courts have warrant to

that he had heard the testimony of those witnesses who preceded him the comments prohibited by griffin suggested evidence of guilt while the comments here concerned the defendants credibility as witness the court rejecting in brooks v tennessee 1972 the heavyhanded approach of requiring defendant to testify at the outset of his defense or not at all had suggested that arguing credibility to the jury is the preferred means of counteracting tailoring of the defendants testimony because of the defendants sixth amendment right to confront witnesses the court cannot sequester the defendant and allowing comment on the defendants presence and unique opportunity to tailor testimony may sometimes be essential to discovering the truth due process denial stems from the fact that the defendant

1995 federal grazing regulations were within the secretary of the interiors authority under the taylor grazing act new definition of grazing preference omits reference to specified quantity of forage and explicitly ties forage to that allocated by an applicable land use plan defining the privileges in relation to land use plans does not violate the secretarys responsibility to safeguard previously recognized grazing privileges the statute qualifies the duty to safeguard in several respects it is to be achieved only so far as consistent with the acts purposes and provisions and those purposes include preventing injury to the public grazing lands and issuance of grazing permit is said to create right title interest or estate moreover congress has directed the development of land use plans for the rangelands and it is difficult to see how definitional change that simply refers to the use of such plans could violate the taylor act other considerations are that the prior system quantifying grazing privileges in terms of animal unit months did not afford anything close to absolute security and the new definition does not automatically diminish the security of existing grazing privileges the second challenged regulation eliminates the words engaged in the livestock business from the description of stock owners qualified to apply for permits the statute itself limits the category to settlers residents and other stock owners and extends preference to those engaged in the livestock business the terms stock owner and stock owner engaged in the livestock business are not coextensive the third challenge is to change in the regulation that provides that ownership of range improvements made pursuant to cooperative agreements shall be in the name of the united states nothing in the statute denies the secretary the authority to decide when or whether to grant title to those who make improvements 90 opinion for unanimous court by breyer concurring opinion by oconnor

indication in the bankruptcy code that congress has altered the burden of proof on tax claims the codes silence on the matter does not require reliance on precode practice that practice was not well

attorney general to preclear an election law change that does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color this language requires covered jurisdiction to make two distinct showings that the proposed plan does not have the purpose of denying orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30616crs28 abridging the right to vote and that the plan will not have that effect the court had previously held that the noeffect requirement is limited to retrogressive effects the purpose prong is also so limited the court refuses to adopt construction that would attribute different meanings to the same phrase in the same sentence depending upon which object it is modifying for purposes of preclearance the baseline for determining whether voting practice abridges the right to vote is the status quo if the change abridges the right to vote relative to the status quo then preclearance is denied and the status quo however discriminatory it may be remains in effect if proposed voting change is not retrogressive this means that it cannot be stopped in advance under the extraordinary burden shifting procedures of 5 but must be attacked through the normal means of 2 action to deny preclearance to plan that is not retrogressive matter how unconstitutional it may be would risk leaving in effect status quo that is even worse the case is not moot although there will be new census and presumably new apportionment plan before the next scheduled school board election in 2002 the current plan will serve as the baseline

racebased voting qualification forbidden by the fifteenth amendment ancestry can be proxy for race and that is the case here the court previously described racial discrimination as singling out identifiable classes of persons solely because of their ancestry or ethnic characteristics and that is what hawaiis voting restriction does simply because class defined by ancestry does not include all members of race does not suffice to make the classification raceneutral the states arguments in support of the restriction are rejected cases upholding differential treatment of certain members of

maintain an action against state on behalf of the united states under the qui tam provision of the false claims act private individual who brings such qui tam action has standing to sue the provision allows an individual to sue any person who defrauds the government and to collect portion of any civil penalty or treble damages assessed the qui tam relator suffers injury to legally protected interest but adequate basis for standing derives from the principle that the assignee of claim has standing to assert the injury in fact suffered by the assignor the united states suffers injury in fact and the false claims act effects partial assignment of the governments damages claim the long tradition of qui tam actions in england and in the american colonies supports this conclusion since article iiis restriction of judicial power to cases and controversies has been interpreted to mean cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to and resolved by the judicial process the false claims act however does not subject state to liability in qui tam action because state is not person within the meaning of the act the act does not define the term person and there is longstanding presumption that person does not include the sovereign nothing in the history and structure of the act overcomes this presumption moreover the conclusion is supported by two rules of construction congress may change the usual constitutional balance between states and the federal government only by unmistakably clear language and statutes should be construed so as to avoid

brought by class of one if the plaintiff establishes that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is rational basis for the different treatment the respondent in this case had asked the village to connect her property to the municipal water supply and the village had conditioned the connection on 33foot easement rather than 15foot easement required of other property owners the respondent alleged that the demand for 33foot easement was motivated by illwill stemming from previous successful lawsuit she had brought against the village this allegation if proved would establish that the discriminatory treatment was intentional 90 per curiam separate opinion by breyer concurring in the resulthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30616crs39 walmart stores inc v samara bros inc 120 s ct 1339 68 uslw 4217 3 2100 lanham act trade dress infringement in an action for infringement of unregistered trade dress under section 43a of the lanham act products design is distinctive and therefore protectible only upon showing of secondary meaning mark can be distinctive in one of two ways if it is inherently distinctive ie if its inherent nature serves to identify particular source or if it has developed secondary meaning secondary meaning is found if the primary significance of the mark in the public mind is to identify the source of product rather than the product itself design like color is not inherently distinctive since consumer predisposition to equate product design with the source does not exist moreover application of inherent distinctiveness to product design could harm consumer interests since competition could be deterred by the plausible threat of successful suit courts that have difficult time in marginal cases distinguishing between productdesign and productpackaging trade dress should err on the side of caution and classify ambiguous trade dress as product design thereby requiring secondary meaning 90 opinion for unanimous court by scalia weeks v angelone 120 s ct 727 68 uslw 4060 11900 jury instruction capital case mitigating factors trial judge does not violate the constitution by directing jurys attention to specific paragraph of constitutionally sufficient sentencing instruction in response to the jurys question regarding the proper consideration of mitigating circumstances after four hours of deliberation the jury had asked the judge whether it was their duty to vote for the death penalty if they found the defendant guilty of at least one aggravating factor rather than answering the question directly the judge referred the jury to language in the instruction providing that the jury may fix the punishment at death upon finding that the state had proved one aggravating factor or the instruction continued if you believe from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified then you shall fix the punishment at life imprisonment the jury also received separate instruction that you must consider mitigating circumstance if you find there is evidence to support it the court had previously upheld the virginia pattern instruction at issue given that the jury was adequately instructed and given that the trial judge responded to the jurys question by directing its attention to the precise paragraph of the constitutionally adequate instruction that answers its inquiry there was constitutional violation moreover federal habeas corpus relief is precluded by 28 usc 2254d affirmance of conviction was neither contrary to nor did it involve an unreasonable

part by souter weisgram v marley 120 s ct 1011 68 uslw 4122 22200 federal courts appeals federal rule of civil procedure 50 permits an appellate court to direct the entry of judgment as matter of law when ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30616crs40 determines that evidence was erroneously admitted at trial and that the remaining properly admitted evidence is insufficient to constitute submissible case the court had previously held in neely v martin k eby constr co 1967 that there are situations in which an appellate court may appropriately enter judgment as matter of law against the juryverdict winner cases in which there remains insufficient evidence to support the jurys verdict after exclusion of erroneously admitted evidence can fall into this neely category the appellate courts informed discretion should guide its choice among the alternatives of ordering new trial remanding for the trial court to determine whether new trial is warranted or directing entry of judgment as matter of law fairness to the parties is key to the exercise of the appellate courts discretion in the matter party whose verdict is set aside on appeal will have had notice at trial of any alleged evidentiary insufficiency and it is unconvincing to suggest that allowing the appellate court to direct entry of judgment for the defendant will punish plaintiffs who could have shored up their cases by other means had they known that their expert testimony would be found inadmissible 90 opinion for unanimous court by ginsburg williams v taylor 120 s ct 1479 68 uslw 4279 41800 habeas corpus aedpa failure to develop factual basis in state court habeas corpus petitioner has failed to develop the factual basis of his claim within the meaning of section 2254e2 of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa only if there has been some lack of diligence on his part the provision which denies federal court evidentiary hearing to habeas corpus applicant who has failed to develop the factual basis of the claim in state court proceedings is not nofault standard in ordinary usage the word failed connotes some omission fault or negligence by the person who has failed to do something moreover this statutory language echoes the courts characterization in case decided four years prior to aedpas enactment of an attorneys negligent failure to develop factual record when the words of the court are used in later statute governing the same subject matter it is respectful of congress and of the courts own processes to give the words the same meaning in the absence of specific direction to the contrary in this case there was lack of diligence as to one claim involving the prosecutions failure to disclose the psychiatric report of codefendant and witness since there were repeated references to the report in the transcript of the sentencing proceeding the petitioner met his burden of showing diligence in efforts to develop facts supporting two other claims one involving juror bias and the other involving prosecutorial misconduct 90 opinion for unanimous court by kennedy williams v taylor 120 s ct 1495 68 uslw 4263 41800 habeas corpus aedpa ineffective assistance of counsel section 2254d1 of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa which provides that federal court may grant habeas corpus relief to prisoner who has already litigated the issue in state court only if the state court adjudication was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supremehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30616crs41 court imposed new constraints on the federal courts power to grant relief in this case the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel due to counsels failure to investigate and present substantial mitigating evidence to the sentencing jury involves law that had been clearly established by the supreme courts decision in strickland v washington 1984 counsels representation during the sentencing phase fell short of the professional standards mandated by strickland and also prejudiced the petitioner by probably affecting the outcome of the proceeding the virginia supreme courts decision rejecting petitioners ineffective assistance claim was both contrary to and involved an unreasonable application of strickland the contrary to and unreasonable application clauses carry independent meaning the former clause requires that the state courts decision must be substantially different from the governing precedent the unreasonable application clause requires an objective test the subjective test that asks whether all jurists would agree that the state courts application was unreasonable is erroneous 63 result 54 applicable standard opinion of
