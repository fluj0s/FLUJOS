terms among the trends reflected in these data several stand out the clinton administration is requesting 3054 billion in new budget authority for national defense in fy2001 see table 1 which represents an increase of 13 percent in real inflationadjusted dollars from the fy2000 level budget authority for national defense including dod military functions and defenserelated activities of other federal agencies declined by 33 percent adjusted for inflation between fy1985 the peak of the 1980s buildup and fy2000 see table 6 under administration projections funding for national defense will stay flat adjusted for inflation through fy2005 funding for weapons procurement has been in decline since fy1985 bottoming out in fy1997 at 452 billion in constant fy2001 dollars between fy1985 and fy2000 procurement funding declined much more rapidly than the defense budget as whole falling by 60 under administration plans it will increase over the next few years see figure 2 under administration projections for fy2001 outlays for national defense will constitute 29 percent of gross domestic product gdp see table 11 and figure 8 and 156 percent of total federal outlays see table 13 and figure 9 national defense spending will represent smaller share of the economy than at any time since before world war ii in comparison during the defense buildup of the 1980s national defense spending reached peak of 62 percent of gdp in fy1986 and 271 percent of total federal outlays in fy1987 while defense outlays are at historically low levels as percentage of total federal outlays this trend depends as much on increases in other areas of the federal budget especially in social security medicare and other entitlements as on decreases in defense spending to illustrate trends in the regular defense program most of the data included in this report exclude costs of operation desert shielddesert storm which was largely financed by allied

almost equal to average peacetime defense outlays during the cold war to reflect trends in the regular defense program most of the data included in this report exclude costs of operation desert

budget terms the definitions that follow are taken from office of management and budget and department of defense publications accrual accounting as applied to military retired pay method of recording costs designed to reflect the liability of the federal government for the future retirement costs of military personnel currently on active or reserve duty first used in fy1985 in dod this method of accounting represents change from the earlier practice in which the cost of military retirement was measured in terms of actual payments to current retirees appropriation one form of budget authority provided by congress for the funding of an agency department or program for given amount of time an appropriation provides funds for purposes specifically designated by congress funds will not necessarily all be spent in the year in which they are initially provided authorization establishes or maintains government program or agency by defining its scope authorizing legislation is normally prerequisite for appropriations and may set specific limits on the amount that may be appropriated for the specified program or agency an authorization however does not make money available and sometimes appropriations are made without having been authorized budget authority legal authority for an agency to enter into obligations for the provision of goods or services it may be available for one or more years an appropriation is one form of budget authority budgetary resources used in the context of the budget enforcement act of 1997 deficit reduction process it refers to funds subject to automatic spending reductions for defense programs only these funds are made up of the sum of new budget authority and unobligated balances of budget authority provided in prior years currentconstant dollars the cost of goods or services in current dollars is the value in terms of prices current at the time of purchase current dollars are also referred to simply as dollars or as thenyear dollars the cost of goods or services in constant dollars is the value adjusted to eliminate the effects of changes in prices usually due to inflation constant dollars expressed in terms of an arbitrary reference year eg fiscal year 2001 dollars are determined by dividing current dollars by deflator based on the prices in the reference year constant dollars are used to assess growth rates of programs independently of the effects of inflation growth rates in constant inflation adjusted dollars are referred to as real growth rates deficit in the federal budget the amount by which total federal budget outlays for given fiscal year exceed total federal revenues for that yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30447crs27 fiscal year fiscal year in the federal government begins on october 1 and ends on september 30 and is designated by the calendar year in which it ends thus fy2000 began on october 1 1999 and will end on september 30 2000 note that the federal fiscal year ran from july 1 to june 30 until fy1977 national defe nse budget function one of the categories of the federal budget it consists of the department of defense dod budget which funds all direct dod military programs and of number of defenserelated activities administered by other agencies these activities include atomic energy defense activities funded through the department of energy civil defense programs administered by the federal emergency management agency and the selective service system the dod budget constitutes more than 95 of the national defense budget function obligation an order placed contract awarded

enforcement act of 1997 it refers to the withholdin g of funds from obligation or expenditure and the eventual cancellation of new budget authority new loan guarantee commitments new direct loan obligations and other spending authority as defined in the budget act of 1974 it also results in the reduction of obligation limitations total obligational authority financial measure unique to dod it refers to the total value of direct defense programs for fiscal year prior to fy1979 it differed from budget authority in significant ways the largest of which was that toa in given year increased if congressional action led to transfer of ba balances from prior years while ba would not change beginning in fy1979 however transfers which extend the availability of funds began to be treated as ba and not only toa the current difference between ba and toa is usually small and technical unexpended funds budget authority that has been appropriated by congress but remains unspent representing future outlays unexpended funds whether obligated or as yet unobligated are formally appropriated by congress for specific programs unobligated funds budget authority that has been appropriated by congress for specific programs but that has not yet been pledged or obligated by contract
