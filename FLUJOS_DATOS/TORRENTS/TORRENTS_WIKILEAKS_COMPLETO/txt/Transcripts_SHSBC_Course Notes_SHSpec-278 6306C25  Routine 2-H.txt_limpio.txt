6306c25 shspec278 routine 2h see hcob 25jun63 routine 2h arc breaks by assessment the use of different processes has been monitored or regulated by two things 1 the ability of the auditor to do the process 2 the efficacy of the process in advancing cases both have to be taken into account it is important that these two factors mesh otherwise auditors tend to lose what is win or lose in auditing you have to be able to define them or we wont be able to recognize them win in terms of thetan behavior is 1 intending to do something and doing it or 2 intending not to do something and not doing it lose is 1 intending to do something and not doing it or 2 intending not to do something and doing it lose gives you disagreement ridge forms between those two things ridge is bit of entrapped energy that will read on an emeter in processing intending to do something for case and not doing it is lose from the pcs side it is the basic definition for lose if the pc sets goal for the session of becoming ot and doesnt make it it is lose matter how unreal the goal was an auditors idea of win could be not to arc break the pc then he does and gets lose this is the intention and sole intention of many auditors going into session this being the case it demands of process that it work regardless of the intention of the auditor that is quite bit to demand of an automaticity but it is very safe base for process your skill as an auditor is in getting the process across and completing an auditing cycle keeping the form and running the session it does not lie in inventing process as you go along you have enough to do without having to invent processes although lrh used to do it it is feasible to dream up the process while auditing the pc but it is only necessary when you dont know what to do the way around this problem is to know the fundamentals of cases what we expect of an auditor is to be able to complete an auditing cycle hold the session form together and take care of the pcs unformness as needed that is minimal if you go lower you havent got an auditor and more randomness than order will be introduced into the session person who couldnt master repetitive process would never make an auditor because of the importance of the auditing cycle you need to be able to acknowledge this is more than just saying thank you the auditor has to understand and it is up to the auditor to minimize the possible breakdowns of the auditing cycle that results from the auditor being startled by what pcs come up with the auditor must be cured of tendency to q and since that is damaging to the pc common sort of q and is echo metering this drives the pc round the bend if this is done with dating it can ruin the pcs precious ability to estimate time any echo metering is and not q and aing is part of the auditing cycle if the pc says around 750 years you say 750 years the essence of q and is departing from the auditing cycle with new doingness because the pc has added new doingness this misses pcs withhold the worst situation you can get into is the arc break caused by your taking it up when all the pc was doing was originating the pc has originated and you thought it was question or request and acted to handle it flunk you didnt acknowledge the origination you can get the pc to clarify the origination by asking the pc was that request the final test of an auditor is not is he perfect but can he unscramble mess by session end get as good as you can get but dont get upset about imperfection just be sure you can straighten it all out as an irreducible minimum let things go that are going well and straighten out things that arent r2h is new process to assist in this see below p 426 for description of the process see also hcob 25jun63 routine 2h arc breaks by assessment for more details on the process this would be predecessor of the l1c r3r is pretty rote procedure it has variations it took 13 years to arrive at it i intended auditors to run engrams and failed in the past i had lose that is why r3r came in the main difficulty in handling engrams is the complexity of the procedure these rote steps are pretty simple done one by one r3r runs engrams better and smoother than earlier engram running ever did it is quite triumph the failure in getting auditors to run engrams was enough to make lrh abandon trying for some years of all processes this is the one not to learn by doing it on the pc dont practice running engrams on pc you will tanglefoot if you dont know the fundamentals of the time track dating is an interestingly exact skill the hardest and trickiest step is getting the duration because it is hard to get the proper duration and in rote procedure duration is everything if the pc doesnt know know what the incident is all about you have the duration wrong why the later part of the incident is always knowable as to length the question is where it really begins for instance you know how long this lifetime has been but you dont know how long your track is if you get the pc just seeing one scene every time you run him through the incident then the duration is wrong he has just got the back end of the incident in terms of reality and behavior of the meter the pc could reach the last part of the engram if he cant tell you about what is happening the duration is wrong because there is obviously something more to it and that something more is always earlier so you must redo the duration the first incident wasnt wrong youve just gotten more incident this could happen more than once in one incident if the second run is still very vague if the pc still doesnt know about the incident if he has gotten only few more pictures get the duration step redone thats all you have to do you may have to redo it several times just take the pcs data the pc will always go to the beginning of that part of the incident which he can now reach luckily this is very uncomplicated and it is very important because all that is in the bank is in engrams engram running is longer barred to the black v case even gpms are specialized engrams gpm is just an engram with pattern required to run it the mind is not confused the pc looking at it and unable to find what he wants thinks that it is confused it is an idiotically orderly machine which does what you tell it to do addressed by proper technology the mind is incredibly precise and accurate the pc may think it looks confused but he is like someone on his first trip to the library he will be confused until he cognites that he can just ask the librarian for what he wants and get it the auditor always gets what he asks for in r3r the mind is not ouija board just keep your commands sensible and comprehensible the biggest problems an auditor has are 1 finding the correct date and duration 2 arc breaks most auditors are somewhat afraid of arc breaks if you havent learned to assess and handle arc breaks you are licked you will shortly back off from running engrams because you will have had lose routine 2h comes in here it is arc breaks by assessment it is superior to arc break straightwire it asks the pc for an arc break dates it assesses it for bpc locates it and indicates it to the pc this puts you at cause over arc breaks and gives you practice at dating things that the pc is not very nervy about unlike engrams r2h can be run on pc at level 6 dubin of dubin case see p 415 above r3r doesnt necessarily run only engrams you can also run secondaries with it which is fine just dont call it engram running dont run chains that havent been assessed you risk having the chain try to branch into another chain you can run locks with r3r on case that is not up to running engrams getting the item to run is done by the rules of listing you could also assess the 18 buttons of the prepcheck and list what they have suppressed in this lifetime and get chain that you can run with ta if you hit one of the helatrobus implants shift to r3n if it is another sort of gpm you hit go to r3n2 watch for dates between 38 and 52 trillion years ago for helatrobus implants the approach to processing has been upgraded because its target has been upgraded we are not interested in clearing we are interested in ots the governments of the us and australia decided to get rough also the kremlin and the us are trying to form dichotomy expressed with nuclear fission we must hold the line legally concerning emeters and upgrade the auditing target to ot
