assisting states and communities to clean up brownfields for productive use has been an ongoing issue for more than decade as defined by statute brownfield sites are real property the expa nsion redevelopment or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of hazardous substance pollutant or contaminant emphasis added1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22965crs2 2 other epa programs including the resource conservation and recovery act rcra corrective action program address contamination as well 3 see epas brownfields program website at httpwwwepagovswerospsbfabouthtm as the definition of brownfield is relatively broad this estimate might be seen as more of rough approximation 4 an additional difference between the progra ms regards their treatment of petroleum contamination the superfund program does not address petroleum contamination whereas brownfield can include sites contaminated by pe troleum petroleum is specifically excluded from the definition of hazardous substance under ce rcla section 10114 ot her federal statutes provide authorities for responding to petroleum releases 5 by epas count there are nearly two dozen fe deral agencies that have programs developed specifically for brownfields and other programs with financing or technical assistance suitable and applicable to brownfield situation pe rhaps the most prominent nonepa brownfields activity is within the department of housing and urban development hud for description of these different programs and their funding see epa 2005 brownfields federal program guide 2005 at http wwwepagov brownfieldspartnersbf_fed_pr_gdhtmthe environmental protection agency epa addresses environmental contamination prima rily through the superfund and brownfields programs2 although epas superfund and brownfield s programs are related the programs are different in their objectives and the sites they address the superfund program and its federal funding generally cover only the sites with the highest levels of contamination or those that present immediate risks in contrast epas brownfields program assists communities with the cleanup of abandoned idled or underutilized commerc ial and industrial properties epa estimates that there are more than 450000 brownf ields sites throughout the country3 as the brownfields definition indicat whether contamination is present at all of these sites is uncertain the envir onmental contamination at brownfield site if it exists at all is not as serious or threatening as the contamination at superfund sites4 often the mere perception of environmental contamination may hinder site reuse because interested parties may be concerned they would face clea nup res ponsibilities thus primary objective of the brownfields program is site assessment this report describes the sc ope and purpose of epas brow nfields program reviews appropriation levels for the program and highlights cons iderations for policymakers epas brownfields program5 program history and authority the superfund and epa brownfields programs are authorized by the same statute but the programs were developed at different times and for different purposes with the enactment of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability ac t of 1980 cercla 42 usc 96019675 congress established the superf und program this is the fe deral governments principal program for cleaning up the nations conta minated waste sites and protecting public health and the environment from re leases of hazardous substances pursuant to the general response aut horities of cercla epa developed the brownfields program in 1993 initially the pr ogram provided seed money in the form of grants and loans to communities to stimulate redevelopment and reuse of brownfieldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22965crs3 6 see epas brownfields program website at httpwwwepagovswerospsbfabouthtm 7 the 2002 statute also included changes to cercla liability clarifying who is

prospective purchasers under the superfund act by robert meltz 8 the 2002 brownfields act adde d section 104k to cerclaproperties6 funding originally came from th superfund progra m appropriations between fy1998 and fy2001 the program received approximately 90 million each year accounting for about 5 of annual superfund appropriations in 2002 congress provided specific statut ory authority for epa to address brownfields with the enactment of the sm all business liability relief and brownfields revitalization act pl 107 118 among other things7 the statute hereinafter the brownfields act authorized grant program similar to the one epa had established administratively under general cercla author ity in the mid 1990s the stated purpose of the 2002 act was to promote the cleanup and re use of brownfields to provide financial assistance for brownfields re vitalization to enhance stat response programs and for other purpose section 201 of the brownfields act au thorized 200 milli on annually for grant program to support site ssessment and cleanup activities at brownfield properties section 231 of the act author ized an additional grant program in the amount of 50 million annually to assist state nd tribal cleanup programs the funding authority for both grant programs expired at the end of fy2006 program authority is permanent unless repealed by subsequent legislation rega rdless of expired aut horization congress has continued to provide consistent funding level for both grant programs provided in table 1 below epa brownfields grant program the grants awarded from epas brownfields program can be divided into two categories 1 competitive grants awarded to communities which are often referenced by the cercla section section 104k that authorizes them8 and 2 noncompetitive grants authorized by section 128 and thus often described as section 128 grants awarded to states and indian tribes to support their response programs competitive section 104k grants section 104k grants comprise the core of epas brownfields program receivin g the bulk of the nnual appropriation in general eligible grant recipients include state local and tribal governments and certain quasigovernmental authorities in some cases identified below other parties may receive grants however private persons and corporations are not eligible in any case there are four types of competitive brownfields grants assessment grants provide funding for grant recipient to inventory assess and conduct pla nning and community involvement related to brownfields sites site assessment is primary component of the epa brownfields program the mere perception of contamination at brownfield sites often hinders redevelopment assessment grants helphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22965crs4 9 cercla

address contaminated properties that are not covered by the federal superfund progra m epa states that section 128 funding is not intended to supplant but instead supplementstate or tribal funding for their response programs however th 2004 gao report noted that in some states their programs would not exist without epas funding15 section 128 identifies one ge neral and two specific uses of funding regarding the former the statute prescribes that funding can be used to establish or enhance state or tribal response prog ram epa interprets16 this phrase to include developing legislation regula tions procedures or guidance creating and maintaining relevant public records and conducting limited sitespecific activ ities such as assessment or cleanup17 the statute also identifies two speci fic uses of the section 128 funding financing revolving loan f und for brownfield cleanups and purchasing environmental insuran ce or developing an insurance mechanism to provide financing fo r cleanup

nfields is desirable however issues regarding the degree of financial assistance and overa ll program effectiveness have been raised since the enactment of the brownfields act in 2002 congress has funded th program below its initial authorized level total appropriations in table 1 represent approximately 66 of the initial funding authorization 250 million each year between fy2002 fy2006 some states and communities would argue th at the demand for funding far exceeds what has been made available by congress18 on the other hand the program has arguably struggled to demonstrate its effectiveness what are federal fundi ng levels achieving environmental risk reduction economic redevelopment or some combination thereof the 2004 gao re port found that the agency has not yet developed measures to determine the extent to which the brownf ields program helps reduce environmental risks this concern raises the question as to whether the program should be evaluated by its ability to reduce threats to human hea lth or whether the prog ram should be assessed with different metrics such as economic redevelopment if this is the case some may question whether epa is the most appropriate agency to administer this program
