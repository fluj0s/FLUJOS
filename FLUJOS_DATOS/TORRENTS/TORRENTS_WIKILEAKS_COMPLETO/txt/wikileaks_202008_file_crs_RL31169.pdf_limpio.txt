division updated october 26 2001 abstract for much of the postworld war ii era when the ﬁnancial press focused on argentina it was to highlight bouts of very high inﬂation and failed stabilization eﬀorts argentina again commands the attention of the ﬁnancial press but this time inﬂation is not the issue not only has argentina had ﬁve years of stable prices but over the past 2 years the price level in argentina has actually fallen thus it is now speculated that argentina may have to change its monetary regime not because of inﬂation as had been perennially the case but to combat falling income rising unemployment and possible default on its national debt how did argentina come to this end in large measure it is the consequence of the method chosen to deal with the chronic tendency of argentine public ﬁnance to produce inﬂation to lesser degree it is due to the governments failure to recognize that the method chosen to control inﬂation also placed constraints on ﬁscal policy and to

solutions october 26 2001 gail makinen specialist in economic policy government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169argentina economic problems and solutions summary after long history of high inflation argentina decided in 1991 to link its currency rigidly to the us dollar and replaced its discredited central bank regime with monetary arrangement known as currency board with this change peso currency became backed by the us dollar and inflation was brought to an end the united states derives revenue called seigniorage from this use of the dollar with the establishment of currency board argentina tied itself to the american currency area as if it were california or vermont the theory of optimum currency areas suggests that this was not wise choice first little trade takes place between the us and argentina in 1999 imports from and exports to the us were between 10 and 20 of argentinas gdp while large amount of american output is used internally theory suggests that the two such regions should be linked by flexible exchange rates second there are mechanisms that enable the american currency area to work smoothly in the face of negative shocks that are not available to argentina these include the ability of american labor and capital to move from areas strongly affected by negative shocks to areas less affected the integration of the nations financial system that makes possible the financing of regional trade imbalances and fiscal transfers that target areas of high unemployment the united states also relies on flexible exchange rates to cushion external negative shocks and if the shocks have wide effect monetary and fiscal policy can be used to combat them argentina cannot avail itself of these mechanisms and must deal with negative external shocks primarily through deflation given the well documented downward rigidity of wages and prices in the short run this can be very difficult path to follow argentina has had to follow this path in the face of four negative shocks the appreciation of the dollar the fall in world commodity prices the depreciation of the brazilian real and the increase in real interest rates in the united states in addition argentina has also had to cope with debt problem currency board imposes substantial constraints on fiscal policy fiscal deficits can longer be financed by central banks thus argentinas fiscal behavior was going to have to approximate that of an american state this has not happened the fiscal deficit of the consolidated public sector has been in excess of 4 of gdp unlike the behavior of american states these deficits have added substantially to the national debt raising concerns that argentina will default on its debt speculators have attacked thus far unsuccessfully the argentine peso several times over the past 3 years argentina has dealt with its burgeoning debt through efforts to lengthen its maturity and pay off existing debts with loans from international financial institutions banks and others the debt problem will continue until the fiscal deficits end argentina has dealt with its macro problem by imposing multiple exchange rates on exports and imports in addition when the dollar and the euro reach parity the peso will be linked to both currencies dollarization and altering the exchange rate have also been discussed they pose number of serious problems

solutions for much of the postworld war ii era when the financial press focused on argentina it was to highlight bouts of very high inflation and failed stabilization efforts1 argentina again commands the attention of the financial press but this time inflation is not the issue not only has argentina had 5 years of stable prices but over the past 2 years the price level in argentina has actually fallen thus it is now speculated that argentina may have to change its monetary regime not because of inflation as had been perennially the case but to combat falling income rising unemployment and possible default on its national debt how did argentina come to this end in large measure it is the consequence of the method chosen to deal with the chronic tendency of argentine public finance to produce inflation to lesser degree it is due to the governments failure to recognize that the method chosen to control inflation also placed constraints on fiscal policy and to two unavoidable economic shocks that reduced the price of argentine exports and made argentine products uncompetitive in brazil argentinas largest trading partner an overview of the argentine economy very high inflation rates failed stabilization efforts and long period of economic stagnation are noticeable features of the economic history of argentina in the postworld war ii era compelling case can be made that the history of chronic inflation is product of the public finance practices of the argentine government in 1990 argentina was once again in the midst of serious inflation prices for the year rose on average between 2000 and 3000 in 1991 the government engineered yet another stabilization effort the socalled convertibility plan unique feature of this program was the linkage of the argentine currency to the us dollar on rigid onetoone basis the data in table 1 show that the plan was successful in bringing an end to inflation argentina has enjoyed at least 5 years of stable if not falling prices and compared to the 1980s decade of stable prices however price level stability has not gone handinhand with low unemploymen t and an end to the business cycle rather unemployment has been high and has also shown tendency to rise and economic growth while initially strong has recently turned negative while economic growth began to slow in 1998 an actual contraction of income began in 1999 and this has continued through 2000 and into 2001 although the data for both yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs2 2 the budget deficit reported in table 1 is for the central government the consolidated public sector deficit for 1997 through 2000 as percentage of gdp is respectively 21 21 42 and 36 it is expected to be 31 in 2001 the deficit is accounted for by interest payments on government debt which has risen from 23 of gdp in 1997 to an estimate of 47 of gdp in 2001 if it were not for interest payments the remainder of the consolidated budget would be in surplus for this period except for 1999remain incomplete the current account of the balance of payments has been in deficit since the convertibility plan was implemented indicating that argentina continues to borrow abroad argentina has had fiscal deficit over this same period that since 1996 has been large relative to gdp2 the cumulative budget deficit since 1993 has increased the national debt by about 20 table

and the consequences the new monetary regime an important part of the 1991 convertibility plan was to fix the exchange rate of the argentine peso to the dollar on onetoone basis this in itself however could not guarantee low inflation rate since it was not an effective constraint on the issuance of money the key to controlling inflation to control the issuance of money the argentines abandoned their central bank based monetary regime which they felt lacked credibility and set up monetary arrangement known as currency board under this arrangement currency could be issued only if the currency board had anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs3 3 see thomas j trebat salomon smith barney july 10 2001 mr trebat cites the central bank of argentina 4 because all the states in the united states use common currency they are in essence linked to one another by rigidly fixed exchange rates the dollars that circulate in wisconsin will buy dollars worth of goods and services in new york or any other place in the us common currency area 5 it is possible in the short run for argentina to receive an inflow of foreign capital that could forestall the shrinkage in the money supply and money spending the inflow of foreign capital could thus finance the growing trade deficit this might continue for some time 6 this does not mean that argentina will have exactly the same rate of inflation as the united continuedequivalent amount of dollars each argentine peso note was thus backed by an american dollar additional dollars additional pesos this 100 backing did not apply to any of the deposits supplied by argentine financial institutions such as checking deposits that for most developed economies are the principal part of their money supply nevertheless argentine banks have been willing to supply dollar denominated deposits by the middle of 2001 about twothirds of all deposits were dollar denominated3 while the currency board guarantees only that the currency is backed by dollars this guarantee also constrains how many loans banks can make and the amount of deposits they can accept since deposits are convertible into currency on demand and hence into dollars that this constraint is effective is evidenced by the low inflation rate experienced in argentina since the institution of the currency board this new monetary regime linked argentina to the united states currency area in an economic sense argentinas relationship to the us currency area is now much like that of any state such as wisconsin or california4 as explained below this linkage did not ensure that argentina would enjoy access to the mechanisms that make the american currency area function smoothly the antiinflationary policy the fixed exchange rate and the currency board were designed to ensure that argentina would have low inflation rate one similar to that in the united states to see why this is so suppose that argentina had higher inflation rate than the us the people of argentina would now see prices in argentina that were higher than comparable goods and services that were available from the united states and elsewhere they would thus tend to switch their spending from home country goods and services to the now cheaper substitutes available from the united states or elsewhere in the world similarly nonargentineans would find argentina an increasingly expensive country to buy from and they would switch their purchases to cheaper sources of supply this would result in growing trade deficit for argentina under currency board and fixed exchange rates this trade deficit would have to be covered by loss of currency and shrinkage of the money supply5 the reduction in money supply and money spending in argentina would then bring the rate of inflation in argentina into line with that in the united states and keep it there6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs4 6 continued states each economy has large nontradeable goods sector and prices in this sector enter the price index and make it possible for the recorded rates of inflation in the two countries to be somewhat different 7 argentina does not have classic currency board the argentine currency board legislation does permit some holding of government bonds but these holdings must be purchased at market prices cannot exceed 33 of total reserves and cannot increase by more than 10 in any one year many observers regard this departure from classic currency board as minor see for example francois r velde and marcelo veracierto dollarization in argentina economic perspectives federal reserve bank of chicago first quarter 2000 8 while budget deficits are projected for the current and near term fiscal years it should be noted that argentina has recently enacted drastic fiscal measures to achieve zero deficit there is however an important question about the degree to which the budget projections provide unambiguous information about the fiscal position of the argentine government this is because the government either owns or guarantees the operation of various enterprises it is thus contingently liable for these businesses in the current economic downturn contingencies could become realities substantially increasing the realized budget deficits those who speculate against the argentine peso are likely to base their assessments on the degree to which these contingencies can become realities 9 this is the deficit of the central government as percentage of gdp the deficit of the consolidated public sector reached 42 of gdpimportant to the antiinflation program is that the currency board cannot issue currency based on any domestic asset such as argentine government bonds currency issues must be based on the possession of foreign assets in the case of argentina these are dollardenominated assets in the past the argentine central bank was used as the engine of inflation since it was forced to purchase government bonds in exchange for currency the means used to finance the large fiscal deficits7 what is seldom appreciated about fixed exchange rates and currency board is that they are not only monetary regime but also fiscal regime and they impose great deal of restraint on governments in particular this monetary regime forecloses the option of monetizing government budget deficits by central banks governments are forced to finance budget deficits by selling interestbearing debt to domestic banks and the public or to foreigners the argentine fiscal regime the single most important reason for the long inflationary history of argentina has been unbalanced government budgets large budget deficits have been financed by the expedient of printing money and this has fueled inflation the classic case of too much money chasing too few goods and services given that history one might have expected that when argentina changed monetary regimes in 1991 it would also have embraced very conservative fiscal regime yet this appears not to have been the case the data in table 1 show that argentina has had budget deficit since the stabilization was implemented8 in 1999 the last year for which complete data are available it reached nearly 3 of gdp9 the national debt of argentina is now estimated to be about 150 billion dollars or about 50 of gdp some portion of this debt is owed to foreigners what the argentine government appears to havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs5 10 at the treasury auction held on july10 2001 the argentine government paid 14 on 8277 million of 3month bills and 1596 on 22 million of one year bills these were peso denominated securities see jonathan fuerbringer economic troubles worsen in argentina new york times july 11 2001 11 the discussion to follow draws heavily on literature related to the theory of optimum currency areas the seminal paper in this literature cited in the award of the nobel prize in economics to its author is robert mundell theory of optimum currency areas american economic review vol 51 september 1961 pp 657665overlooked is that even though argentina is sovereign state when it pegged it currency to the dollar its fiscal behavior was going to have to be similar to that of large american state this has not happened as noted in table 1 its recent budget deficits have been upwards of 2 to 3 of gdp state in the united states has had this fiscal experience most have constitutionally mandated balanced budgets if they had there is little doubt that they would have had problem marketing their state debt the continuation and worsening of the budget deficit and the growth of the national debt appear to give rise to the expectation that argentina will be unable to achieve fiscal balance in the foreseeable future this fuels speculation that it will be forced to default on its debt the argentine government has had great difficulty rolling over its maturing debt and has been forced to pay upwards of 14 interest to get the public to renew maturing issues10 it does not take long for interest rates of this magnitude to make major contribution to any fiscal imbalance and make debt default real possibility the consequences of the monetary regime argentina adopted currency board and fixed its exchange rate to the dollar in order to bring to an end its chaotic history of high inflation as noted above this objective has been achieved but did this medicine come with adverse side effects compelling case can be made that it did11 in particular it can be argued that the basic if not the only mechanism within the current monetary regime that is available to deal with negative economic shocks is deflation that is in the face of negative shock money wages and prices must fall absolutely to restore full employment why is this so when argentina adopted currency board based on the dollar it placed itself in the position of us state such as wisconsin or california common consensus holds that america as single currency area works quite well in the sense that output in the united states has for substantial periods been able to grow along full employment path or at least experienced long periods of positive growth indeed the period from 1995 through mid2000 was quite spectacular gdp growth was high and the unemployment rate fell to 30year low all parts of the united states enjoyed this prosperity argentina did not its gdp contracted 34 in 1999 and another 05 in 2000 the contraction appears to be continuing in 2001 although data are not yet available to measure the extent of the fall its unemployment rate has also risen httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs6 why did argentina fail to prosper as did the american states there are mechanisms that make the american currency area work smoothly that are not available to those countries that opt through currency boards or dollarization to join the area it is worth short digression to see what these mechanisms are for they bear on how argentina got into its present dilemma and whether dollarization is good for it or for any country the american currency area the united states is subject to variety of economic shocks that affect both demand and supply these shocks do not always affect the entire country uniformly some are specific to an industry sector of the economy or geographic region to see how america deals with these shocks consider case in which the american public suddenly prefers to own foreign cars change in taste the public switches from buying us cars to foreign cars economic theory predicts several consequences from this shift on the aggregate level trade deficit would tend to emerge this would be eliminated through depreciation of the dollar which would tend to stimulate additional exports and cause some americans to switch expenditures from imports to domestically produced substitutes these additional purchases would tend to be spread across the economy and would be unlikely to offset the decline in us car sales and output and the increase in unemployment in the automobile industry moreover the automobile producing areas of the country would undoubtedly suffer trade deficit with the rest of the country if wages and prices were completely flexible within the us car prices would fall as would wages until the unemployment was eliminated this would also tend to eliminate any regional trade deficit however this adjustment would be unlikely to happen because wages and prices display substant ial downward rigidity in the short run other factors or mechanisms would come into play to reduce unemployment and deal with the regional trade imbalance that can be regarded as substitutes for wage and price adjustments first the financial system in the united states is highly integrated meaning that many stocks and bonds are highly substitutable in the portfolios of financial institutions including banks and private individuals this substitutability is aided by the fact that many of these assets can be sold in national markets to which financial institutions and individuals have ready access thus if region has trade deficit the banks in that region can finance it by selling their assets if the adverse shock is transitory financing trade deficit is an effective substitute for wage and price decreases highly integrated financial market also has the advantage that monetary changes engineered by the federal reserve will be felt throughout the us common pattern of interest rates will also prevail throughout the american economy or currency area financial integration is encouraged by common legal system second and arguably the most important way that regional imbalances are adjusted in the united states is for labor and capital to move from areas where demand for them weakens to areas where it is stronger and it is this factor mobility which tends to iron out regional imbalances in the example above this means that unemployed automobile workers would move to other industries or parts of the country where demand is stronger in export or other import competinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs7 12 it should not be overlooked that the case for single currency area is strengthened if the trade in that area is largely internal dividing such an area into subareas linked by floating exchange rates brings with it an element of exchange rate instability which in turn leads to price level instability and price level instability tends to discourage the use of money and for that reason leads to inefficiency in exchange trade within the us economy is largely internal even though the us economy is becoming increasingly open for example during the 1960s the sum of us exports and imports as percentage of us gdp varied between 8 and 10 during the 1990s this had increased to 20 to 25 of gdp very little trade takes place between argentina and the united states in 1999 imports from and exports to the us were respectively about 18 and 10 of argentine gdp thus the case for fixed exchange rate between the two countries viewed from the perspective of the theory of optimum currency areas is weakindustries us labor has shown itself to be highly mobile and this mobility is aided by common legal system and language and such things as portable pensions third fiscal policy in the united states can be used as means for automatically transferr ing income to regions hit by adverse shocks the federal government has historically targeted various pockets of high unemployment for special treatment for example the duration during which unemployment benefits have been paid has been extended and the formulas for allocating andor triggering federal expenditures often contain an unemployment rate component federally funded job retraining is also available moreover such programs as farm price supports and social security help maintain net income flow into adversely affected areas should the shock be economy wide in its effect federal tax cuts or expenditure increases have also been used to reduce unemployment this type of fiscal expansion can actually have negative effect on countries who link their currencies to the dollar this occurs in the following way fiscal expansion tends to raise us interest rates in an open economy with international capital flows that are sensitive to interest rate differentials an increase in us interest rates will draw in foreign capital and this will lead to stronger dollar the dollar will appreciate dollar appreciation will then lead to larger trade deficit and it will also have negative effect on demand in countries whose currency is linked to the dollar as the foreign price of their goods and services increases to reflect the stronger dollar finally monetary policy can be used for shocks that are spread across the whole economy and this is an advantage of central bank monetary regime12 interestingly monetary expansion in the united states will be felt in those countries whose currency is linked to the dollar even if the financial systems of those countries are not integrated with the us financial system this occurs through the effect of changes in us interest rates on the international flow of capital and the exchange value of the dollar to the extent that this effect is strong it places premium on countries having business cycles that are synchronized with us cycles if they tend not to be us monetary and fiscal policy could destabilize these countries when argentina linked the peso directly to the dollar it could not avail itself of these mechanisms that tend to substitute for wage and price rigidity to ameliorate negative shocks for example the argentine and us financial systems are not highly integrated many of the assets owned by argentine banks and other financial institutions are not saleable in the united states and hence cannot be used to financehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs8 13 as measured against 26 currencies of the leading trading partners of the united states on trade weighted basis as compiled by the board of governors of the federal reserve 14 for more comprehensive discussion of the cause of the us trade deficit see crs report rl30534 marc labonte and gail makinen americas growing current account deficit its causes and what it means for the economy an argentine trade deficit recent data suggest that argentine liabilities to american banks are only 11 billion the unemployed in argentina are not free to move to america this is not true for argentine capital because of immigration controls the us congress is unlikely to target american fiscal policy on problem areas in argentina finally federal reserve policy is geared to economic conditions in the united states not to those in argentina to the extent that the business cycle in argentina in terms of type periodicity and magnitude is different than in the us both us fiscal and monetary actions could actually destabilize argentina since these ameliorating substitutes are unavailable to argentina negative shocks to the argentine economy must be dealt with primarily by wage and price deflation and this is the specter that now faces argentina it is the consequence of having fixed its currency rigidly to the dollar the shocks to the argentine economy the argentine economy has over the past 5 years been affected to one degree or another by four external shocks the rising value of the dollar higher us interest rates falling prices for its exports and devaluation and subsequent depreciation of the currency of its leading trading partner brazil discussion of each follows in order to demonstrate how the argentine economy has had to adjust to each shock dollar appreciation between mid1995 and 2001 the dollar rose in real or inflation adjusted terms by about 3313 it is widely acknowledged that the appreciation was due in large measure to the desire by foreigners to buy american assets to do so they bought dollars this increase in demand raised the price of the dollar and this in turn led to trade or current account deficit the trade deficit was the means by which foreign capital or the inflow of foreign saving came to the united states14 dollar appreciation has caused problem for some american industries primarily those producing exports and substitutes for imports offsetting this have been the lower interest rates lower than they would otherwise have been made possible by the inflow of foreign capital and this has expanded the demand for the output of other american industries overall the net effect on the united states economy has been small because as the trade deficit grew the american unemployment rate fell the effect of dollar appreciation on argentina however has been substantial the rising value of the dollar has had the same effect on argentine export and import competing industries that it had on similar industries in america but because thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs9 15 financial integration has number of attributes it can be affected by law administrative procedures inability to adequately assess risk in lending to foreign countries etc 16 this shock must be thought of as separate from the shock that came from dollar appreciation the latter would have been spread across all argentine exports this shock only applies to raw material exports and should more appropriatel be thought of as negative termsoftrade effect that is the fall in commodity prices means that argentina must now give up more exports for each unit of imports in effect commodity prices got hit by double shockfinancial systems of the two countries are poorly integrated the relatively lower interest rates the capital inflow made possible in the united states were not experienced to the same degree in argentina15 argentina was left with trade deficit that it had to finance by borrowing abroad and losing dollar assets held by its currency board this put deflationary pressure on argentina to some degree the argentine government tried to deal with rising unemployment by running fiscal deficit it would appear however that it hoped that the rising unemployment would lead to fall in wages and prices so that argentine goods would once again be competitive in world markets falling prices are sign that this part of the adjustment mechanism is working notice that the mechanisms that substitute for deflation are not working for argentina the unemployed in argentina cannot move to the united states and the us congress does not consider them in making fiscal policy rising us interest rates the united states enjoyed robust booming economy during the last half of the 1990s the boom featured substantial rise in productivity that increased the real rate of return on capital this in turn increased investment and led to higher interest rates in addition the federal reserve raised interest rates between mid1999 and mid2000 in an attempt to reign in the boom lest the economy overheat these interest rate increases were felt directly to some degree in argentina even though the financial markets of the two countries are not highly integrated and they were indirectly felt through the effect these interest rate hikes had on the appreciation of the dollar in addition following the asian crisis investors demanded higher interest rates for lending in emerging market countries in part this was to compensate for additional fears of default and currency devaluation and these interest rate increases by decreasing spending on capital goods only curbed aggregate demand growth in argentina they were in effect another negative economic shock falling prices of exportables commodities are an important component of argentine exports and commodity prices took tumble on world markets during the late 1990s as world demand declined following the asian crisis16 if argentina had floating exchange rate its currency would have depreciated to smoothly transmit this fall in world demand and prices to the argentine economy since this channel is not available under currencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs10 17 after devaluation in 1999 the real like other currencies depreciated against the dollar and hence against the argentine peso at this point the discussion above on dollar appreciation becomes relevantboard argentine prices and wages must fall since price stickiness prevents this in the short run argentina faces recession and unemployment this fall in commodity prices did exert small downward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar however because it reduced world demand for dollars little of this benefitted argentina because it is relatively small part of the overall output of the dollar currency area thus the decline in argentine export earnings would not have been matched by commensurate fall in outlays for imports as result argentina was faced with trade deficit that had to be financed some of the deficit was financed by the sale of currency board assets and this put additional deflationary pressure on argentina another source of financing was borrowing abroad the devaluation and subsequent depreciation of the brazilia n real brazil is the largest trading partner of argentina over the period 19931999 about 25 of all argentine exports were destined for brazil these exports averaged about 2 of argentine gdp the exchange rate between the two countries is thus important to trade and argentine income growth for number of years in the 1990s the exchange rate between the two countries was fixed because brazil had higher inflation rate than argentina the fixed nominal exchange rate between the two countries implied real rate that gradually cheapened argentine products in brazil and priced brazilian products out of the argentine market in january 1999 in the face of capital flight brazil devalued its currency the real and then let it float against all currenci the devaluation and subsequent depreciation more than compensated for the differential rates of inflation in the two countries17 in inflation adjusted terms brazilian products now became relatively cheaper in argentina and the latters goods became expensive in brazil this would put downward pressure on argentine export earnings and tend to increase outlays for imports as result it would tend to aggravate any existing trade deficit and this had to be financed again the loss of currency board reserves would put downward pressure on money spending and this reduced output and caused unemployment to rise these four external shocks have had major deflationary effect on the argentine economy between 1995 and 199798 the deflationary pressure from the balance of payments deficit was masked or offset by the ability of argentina to borrow abroad foreign capital did come to argentin this came to an end with the east asian financial crisis of 1997 and the russian default in the summer of 1998 foreign lending to argentina dried up and the full deflationary effects of these shocks tended to be felt because nominal wages and prices in argentina have shown marked downward rigidity the initial response to deflation has been falling output and rising unemployment argentina has been thrown into recession it is not always clear why currencies become vulnerable to speculation the argentine peso has come under speculative attack several times over the past fewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs11 years most recently late in 2000 undoubtedly one factor influencing speculators is how long the continued policy of deflation will be politically acceptable the longer it continues and the higher the unemployment rate climbs the more reasonable is the view that politicians will bring the deflation to an end with currency devaluation ie that the pesodollar exchange rate will be changed this will invite speculation argentinas solution to its economic problems argentina has two economic problems to deal with macroeconomic instability characterized by falling income and rising unemployment and growing national debt these problems are not separate but interrelated falling income has increased the fiscal deficit and this has increased the national debt argentina has responded both actively and passively to these problems macroeconomic instability argentina has faced the contraction of income and the rise in unemployment in three ways first it has allowed its fiscal deficit to grow its fiscal behavior unlike that of any state in the united states has given rise to fear that the government will have to default on its debt second since the exchange rate has not been changed argentina must hope that the fall in income and rise in unemployment will put downward pressure on wages and prices if wages and prices fall enough exports will again become competitive and the people of argentina will buy cheaper domestic substitutes for imports both of these will expand domestic demand of course downward rigidity in wages and prices could make this prolonged process more activist policy has also been pursued in december 2000 legislation was passed to alter the currency board arrangement the law now specifies that when the euro and the dollar reach parity the argentine peso will be pegged to both currencies the intent of the legislation is to curb any tendency of the peso to appreciate as it has when pegged only to the dollar since this scheme has not yet come into effect an evaluation of it is confined to the appendix to expand demand the government in march of 2001 unveiled scheme to subsidize exports and penalize imports to this end it rewards each dollar earned abroad by exchanging it for 107 pesos dollars to be spent abroad for imports can be acquired only by paying 107 in pesos while this may have small effect on the trade deficit it is very inefficient way to stimulate demand as it will lead to all sorts of devices to make it appear that dollars were earned abroad and few dollars are to be used to acquire imports multiple exchange rate schemes have dismal record for accomplishing any macroeconomic goals instead they have good record in encouraging criminal behavior httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs12 18 see

to the debt problem has been different until recently there was much debate in the government about reducing the budget deficit the source of the increase in the debt very little happened as the political factions could not agree on the distribution of the burden inherent in deficit reduction the required reduction grew quickly as interest rates rose thus the debt continued to grow this changed dramaticall in july 2001 when the government committed itself to the zero deficit plan nevertheless the government has been faced with the problem of rolling over the existing debt and finding new lenders to acquire the new debt the existing debt is denominated both in pesos and several foreign currencies such as dollars euros and yen one approach was to try to lengthen the maturity of the debt coming due thus postponing the problem to future day finding new lenders especially foreign to acquire growing debt posed additional problems some observers point out that argentina is unlikely to acquire balance of payments surplus in the foreseeable future thus it is unlikely to have the foreign exchange to service the debt denominated in foreign currencies this increases the chance of default and increases the reluctance of foreigners to buy argentine debt an additional approach is to line up lines of credit with such international lending institutions as the international monetary fund imf foreign governments and various international banks the most recent effort by the government to deal with the debt was in december 2000 397 billion support package was provided by the imf the interamerican development bank ibd the spanish government and other lending institutions it includes 137 billion line of credit from the imf 5 billion in loan commitments from the world bank and ibd and 1 billion from the spanish government the remainder consists of nonbinding commitments from argentine banks and foreigners to roll over their existing loans18 about 254 billion of the 397 billion support package will be available by the end of 2001 which covers almost all of argentinas debt payment requirement for that year19 other negotiations have continued throughout 2001 aimed at debt extension and additional support while these aid packages can help alleviate the funding burden temporarily they do nothing to alter the effects of the four external factors that caused argentinas current macroeconomic predicament policy options for argentinas macroeconomic problems two options to lift argentina out of the economic doldrums have been proposed depreciating the peso by changing the exchange rate to the dollar and replacing the currency board by formally adopting the dollar as the legal tender of the country both of these medicines come with potentially serious side effectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs13 changing the exchange rate argentina has always had the option of changing its exchange rate rather than deflating its economy in response to an appreciating dollar thus it could for example give 15 pesos for each dollar and this would cheapen its goods abroad and increase the price of imports in argentina this would increase the sale of exports and cause individuals in argentina to switch from buying imports to substitutes produced in argentina both would increase demand in argentina and put people to work reduce unemployment while the solution sounds simple it does not come without major costs first it would remove the credibility of the fixed exchange rate as constraint on inflation individuals would reason that if the rate could be changed once it could be changed again and again in effect argentina could be back in the old inflation cycle and this could undermine the desire of foreigners to invest in the country second and more important devaluation could wreck havoc on the financial system this is because argentina has become increasingly dollarized since the 1991 reform banks for example have substantial dollar liabilities if the peso were devalued the peso value of those liabilities would rise account owners could withdraw substantially more pesos after devaluation than before where could the banks obtain these additional pesos if their assets were denominated in dollars they might be able to force those who owe these assets to pay more in pesos for example homeowners could find themselves with larger mortgages if not the banks would be in serious difficulties and this is also true for other financial institutions thus changing the exchange value of the peso to the dollar to stimulate demand is likely to run the risk of wrecking financial ruin on the financial system it may be for this reason that there is not much support for this option in argentina even among the opposition parties dollarization the argentine economy is now heavily dollarized us currency circulates widely in the country all of the peso denominated currency is effectively backed by dollar denominated assets about two thirds of all bank accounts are expressed in terms of dollars the only thing that is lacking from complete dollarization is that the us dollar is not legal tender in argentina those who advocate dollarization do so on the grounds that it would lower real interest rates in argentina and this would encourage spending by consumers and businesses on such things as durable goods and housing they cite as evidence the fact that yields on argentine government debt are higher than on comparable us treasury debt the yield differential they argue is due to two factors fear of debt default and fear that the pesodollar exchange rate will be altered ie the peso will be devalue d the yield differential is held to compensate for these additional risks while this argument has some merit it is based on the questionable proposition that if these risks were not present the yield on comparable argentine and us treasury debt would be the same for this to be true the financial systems in both countries would have to be highly integrated and this is simply not the case thus the argument neglects the fact the argentina is currently financing growing budget deficit while the us has been disposing of budget surplus however if the exchange rate risk is important dollarization could reducehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs14 20 recently provincial governments in argentina have taken to issuing their own money in the form of interest bearing notes which they pay to civil servants and others who supply services to the government in some cases these notes are legal tender they are similar to scrip issued by municipalities in the united states during the 19291933 depression in the 1990s the state of california resorted to similar experiment when it ran out of funds it is well to remember that the issuing authorities get only short term gain from this expedient when the scrip is returned in the payment of taxes or other dues it provides revenue to the issuing government for discussion of this development see anthony faiola hard times tarnish sterling symbol washington post august 30 2001 21 seigniorage is the profit that government gets from issuing money under the currency board system seigniorage is represented by the income the currency board derives from the assets it holds as backing for the peso if the peso were abolished and argentina adopted the dollar instead the seigniorage would accrue to the united states 22 omitted from this list is the hope that the federal reserve continues to lower interest rates in the united states even though the financial markets of argentina and the united states are not well integrated lower rates are better for argentina than higher rates at least they may bring about some depreciation in the value of the dollarreal interest rates it should not be forgotten that dollarization would bind argentina more completely to us currency than does the present currency board and like the latter argentina would continue to be excluded from the cushioning effects that moderate the recourse to deflation that us states enjoy to deal with macroeconomic imbalances20 there is one tangible benefit that might come from dollarization since there would longer be any risk of devaluation it might stop if not reverse any capital flight from argentina that has occurred all agree however that there is one shortcoming of dollarization the government would forgo the seigniorage or profit that it currently gets from the currency board system21 to minimize this loss argentina might be able to negotiate treaty with the united states to give it the seigniorage accruing to the dollars circulating in argentina if that is not possible the loss of seigniorage it is argued is small price to pay for the gain in demand stimulus that should come from lower interest rates22 summary and conclusions argentina decided in 1991 that chronic tendency to inflation was harmful to economic growth and well being to achieve price level stability the government rigidly fixed the exchange rate of the peso to the us dollar and to control the money supply adopted currency board to replace the largely discredited central bank regime under currency board the peso currency is backed 100 largely by us dollars with minor exception new peso currency can be issued only if the currency board acquires an equivalent sum of dollars while checking accounts and other bank deposits are not backed 100 by dollars the fact that they are convertible into peso notes constrains the ability of banks to supply themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs15 with this new monetary regime argentina achieved price stability if not deflation this medicine did not come without side effects the most important of them is that the road back to full employment in the presence of negative economic shocks is largely through deflation or absolute declines in wages and prices this occurs because the monetary regime makes argentina part of the us currency area and the mechanisms that enable the us to cope with such shocks are in general not available to argentina these include flexible exchange rates monetary policy of the federal reserve federal fiscal policy the highly integrated nature of the us financial system and the ability of americans to migrate freely from areas and industries where demand is weak and unemployment high to areas and industries where demand is stronger and unemployment lower in addition great deal of us trade is internal and this strengthens the case for common currency area usargentine trade is very small and this strengthens the case for linking the two countries by flexible exchange rates in the second half of the 1990s argentina was hit by four negative external shocks the appreciation of the dollar high real american interest rates the fall in the price of the brazilian real and the decline in price of raw materials because the adjustment mechanisms integral to the us system are not available to argentina the country has been forced into serious contraction of income and an increase in unemployment the decline in the price level during the past 2 years is the primary way argentina has to restore income trade and employment in addition the new monetary regime has placed major constraint on argentine fiscal policy argentina should have conducted its fiscal policy as if it were another us state this it has failed to do and the long string of fiscal deficits has greatly added to the countrys national debt the prospect that it can service this debt or will attempt to get out of its economic problems by altering the pesodollar exchange rate has led to speculation against the peso argentina has dealt with its macro problem by running budget deficit subsidizing exports and taxing imports the exchange rate of the peso has been linked to both the dollar and the euro but this will only come into effect when the linked currencies reach parity with each other its debt problem has been dealt with by efforts to lengthen its maturity postpone the problem and borrow from variety of international agencies to meet maturing obligations recently discussions have centered on dollarization as way to reduce domestic interest rates some have proposed that the pesodollar exchange rate be altered both of these solutions have inherent problemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs16 23 those familiar with monetary history will recognize this situation as analogous to that occurring from the operation of bimetallic monetary standard in which both gold and silver money are used and the official or mint exchange ratio of the two currencies deviates from that dictated by the market 24 essential to this discussion is that the currency board runs out of dollars notice that by supplying dollars for euros the currency boards action tends to drive the market exchange ratio back to the currency board ratio if this occurs before the currency board loses all of its dollars then the discussion to follow in the text will not occurappendix the dual currency board when argentina set up its currency board it linked the peso only to the dollar as its reserve currency this exposed argentina to all of the shocks that affect the international exchange value of the dollar of particular importance has been the strong appreciation of the dollar in the period since 1995 this appreciation has had major deflationary effect on argentina to prevent this from happening in the future argentina decided to reduce its dependency on the dollar as reserve currency by linking the peso to both the dollar and the euro the change will take effect whenever the euro reaches parity with the dollar on the international exchange markets at that point the peso will be set equal to one dollar or one euro that is the holder of an argentine peso will be able to go to the currency board and exchange it for either dollar or euro one for one this shift to dual currencies while conceptually simple accomplishes quite number of changes to make the following discussion manageable the operation of the system will be described first to see how the new system works and how it avoids the shock that comes from appreciation of single reserve currency assume that the euro reaches parity with the dollar and that on that date the argentine currency board converts half of its dollar assets into euros the proportion converted into euros is immaterial to the example further assume that shortly thereafter for some reason the dollar suddenly appreciates such that in the market one dollar exchanges for 15 euros since the market ratio now deviates from the currency board ratio it becomes profitable for individuals including the currency board to engage in arbitrage in this instance individuals would take pesos to the currency board exchange them for dollars and sell the dollars for euros in the market the euros would then be taken to the currency board and converted into pesos on oneforone basis the net result is 5 euro profit for each peso purchased23 this could continue until the currency board is stripped of all of its dollar assets24 at this point its assets would all be denominated in euros nothing would prevent the currency board itself from doing the same thing once the currency board longer holds dollars the argentine peso would only be convertible into euros the depreciated currency and one would have any incentive to bring dollars to the currency board for conversion into pesos because the currency board undervalues the dollar in effect the argentine peso is linked only to the euro and it becomes the sole reserve currency of great importance the prices of argentine goods and services will not effectively rise in terms of the euro evenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs17 25 this is also true for all currencies whose exchang rate for the euro remains unchanged during the period of dollar appreciation 26 of course the increased demand for argentine goods and services is likely to put upward pressure on their peso prices domestic price increases should be expected to affect demand both domestically and internationallythough the dollar has appreciated25 in fact not only will the appreciation of the dollar not have negative effect on the argentine economy it will actually stimulate demand for argentine goods and services to see why this it true consider the case of an argentine good that costs 100 pesos as the dollar appreciates the market price of the good might be expected to rise to 150 euros and this should discourage individuals in the euro area or any other country whose currency rises in value with the dollar from purchasing the good the essence of the exchange rate shock however this wont happen the euro price of argentine goods will not rise because the currency board will still convert euros into pesos on oneforone basis since the price of the good in argentina remains 100 pesos it only costs 100 euros to the purchaser in the euro area for with 100 euros 100 pesos can be obtained from the currency board thus the appreciation of the dollar does not translate directly into an increase in argentine prices for those holding euros hence with dual currency board an appreciation of the dollar or the euro would impose adverse shock on argentina quite the contrary the appreciation of the dollar will stimulate demand for argentine goods for all dollar holders and for those in countries whose currency has risen in value with the dollar since in the market one dollar will now command 15 pesos and the peso price of argentine goods will fall in terms of dollars and for all other currency holders whose currency rises in value with the dollar26 should the reverse occur and the market exchange value of the euro rise above the dollar relative to the currency board ratio the currency board would be hit by the opposite phenomenon and its assets would tend to shift from being all euros to all dollars the analysis above suggests that despite having dual currency board the argentine peso is likely to be linked to either the dollar or the euro but not to both simultaneously for the market ratio of the two currencies is seldom going to be the same as the currency board ratio and the assets of the currency board are unlikely to be large enough to make this possible thus shocks that lead to an appreciation of one or the other of the two reserve currencies will expand demand in argentina not cause it to contract another implication of the dual currency board system is that argentina will switch from being in the dollar area to being in the euro area every time the peso becomes linked only to one currency while the theory of optimum currency areas suggests that argentina should not be linked to the dollar it may not be true for the euro the euro area is for example argentinas second largest trading partner thus there may be number of efficiency losses when the peso link is forced from one currency to the other and then back again as the market ratio of the two currencies departs from the currency board ratiohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31169crs18 27 the reader may wonder if the currency board will suffer loss each time individuals shift from wanting to hold dollars or euros or vice versa because the market exchange rate deviates from the currency board rate simple answer is in an accounting sense the assets of the currency board are always valued in argentine pesos at the currency board exchange rate of onetoone thus matter whether the assets are all dollars or all euros or some combination of the two they are always converted into pesos at oneforone rate losses could be incurred is the assets were to be valued in terms of the market ratio of the two currencies but this is not how it is done more sophisticated answer however is that losses or gains are possible as the assets are shifted from those denominated in one currency to the other this depends on the relationship of the interest rates that prevailed when the assets were acquired versus those prevailing when they are sold should the rates rise losses could be incurred should the rates fall gains could be madedoes this change to dual currency system come with any other adverse side effects it may first shocks to the dollar or the euro are unlikely to coincide with the argentine business cycle by having link to two currencies argentina may be exposing itself to many more shocks than if it was linked to only one currency while this could be stabilizin g it is more likely to be destabilizing second the currency board is likely to hold very short term assets to facilitate the shift in preferences between the dollar and the euro whenever the market exchange rate deviates from the rate set by the currency board since short term assets typically yield less than longer term assets this arrangement is likely to reduce the seigniorage earned by the currency board it is conceivable that the currency board would yield seigniorage at all27 third the dual system may discourage foreign investment in argentina would international investors want to invest either dollars or euros in argentina when there is some probability of being paid in depreciated currency when the time comes to repatriate either the principal or earnings this would add an additional element of risk to the investment and require some additional interest to compensate for it similarly americans may be less eager to trade with argentina since they may not know if their transactions will be settled in dollars or euros fourth the dual system could discourage international contracts for at least one of the parties could be in the position of not knowing what the contract would cost this will not be problem as long as the market ratio and the currency board ratios are the same when they are not and the peso shifts from being pegged to one to the other the cost of the contract could become greater or less than intended thus while the dual currency board may shelter argentina from adverse shocks due to an appreciation of single reserve currency it is medication that does not come free of adverse side effects some of which may be serious
