been falling since early 2002 over this five year span the currency on real trade weighted basis is down about 25 for most of this time the dollars fa ll was moderately paced at about 20 to 50 annually recently however the s lide has accelerated falling about 9 between january and december of 2007 an acceleration of the depreciation brings the periodic concern of an impending dolla r crisis to the fore there is precise demarcation of when falling dollar moves from being an orderly decline to being crisis most likely it would be situa tion where the dollar falls perhaps 15 to 20 annually for several years and sends significant negative shock to the us and the global economies crisis may not be an inevitable outcome but one that likely presents considerable risk to the economy the large us current account deficits are sustained by an inflow of foreign capital that inflow also exerts upward pressure on the value of the dollar as investors demand dollars to enable the pur chase of dollar denominated assets there is limit to how much external debt even the us economy can incur erasing the us trade gap would stop the accumulation of debt this would occur through rebalancing of global spending composed of decreas of domestic spending in the united states and an increase of domestic spending in the surplus economies such shifts in domestic spending patterns must be induced by depreciation of the dollar causing the price of foreign goods to rise for us buyers and the price of us goods to fall for foreign buyers the critical factor governing whether orderly and disorderly adjustment of international imbalances occurs is foreign investor expectations about future dollar depreciation rational expect ations will have smoothi ng effect on the size of international capital flows in contrast sharp plunge of the dollar is likely to occur if investors do not form rational expectations if the dollar then depreciates at rate faster than foreign investors now expect dollar crisis becomes likely currently foreign investors do not app ear to have realistic expectation of future dollar depreciation dollar crisis could start when they realize their error and try to move quickly out of dollar assets the likely stampede would cause dollar crisis three prominent counterarguments to the dollar crisis prediction the global savings glut argument the bretton woods ii argument and the economic dark matter argument do not offer credible alternatives to the dollar crisis outcome the transition to new equilibrium of trade balances may not be smooth likely involving slowdown in economic activity or recession the ongoing us housing price crisis raises the risk of dollar cr isis causing recession with fiscal policy most likely out of consideration in the near term the task of atte mpting to counter the shortterm contractionary effects of dollar crisis would fall upon the federal reserve stimulative monetary policy can be implemented quickly but its eventual effectiveness is uncertain the most us eful policy response by foreign economies would be complementary expansionary policies to offset the negative impact of their appreciating currencies on thei r

the dollar crisis scenario see stephen marris deficits and the dollar world economy at risk institute for international economics washington dc 1985dollar crisis prospect and implications introduction the dollars value in international ex change has been falling since early 2002 over this fiveyear span the currency on real tradeweighted basis is down about 251 this depreciation has been orderly so far for most of this time the dollars fall was moderately paced at about 20 to 50 annually recently however the slide has accelerated falling over 90 be tween january and december of 2007 but falling faster over the last four months than during the previous seven months for the first three months of 2008 the dollar has fallen another 29 an acceleration of the depreciation brings the periodic concern of an impending dollar crisis to the fore there is precise demarcation of when falling dollar moves from being an orderly decline to being crisis most likely it would be situation where the dollar falls perhaps 15 to 20 annually for several years and sends significant negative shock to the us and the global economies this crisis may not be an inevitable outcome but one that likely presents considerable risk that negative shock will likely lead to some degree of slowing of economic activity for the us economy already weakened by the ongoing housing price crisis further dampening effect caused by plummeting dollar would significantly raise the risk of recession for the rest of the world the impact would also depend on what else was going on in their economies at the time of the dollars fall it is likely that the negative impact would be substantial for foreign economies that are highly dependent on export sales to the united states 2 this concern about the dollars nearter m path raises three questions 1 will dollar crisis occur 2 what macroeconomic impact might dollar crisis have on us economy and the world economy and 3 are there policy responses that can counter adverse impacts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34311crs2 3 for more extensive discussion of interna tional asset flows and the trade deficit see crs report rl31032 the us trade deficit causes consequences and cures by craig k elwellanatomy of dollar crisis the large us current account deficits ar sustained by an inflow of foreign capital the necessary counterpart for this in flow to occur is economies in the rest of the world that generate capital outflows and run trade surpluses the country with trade deficit is an interna tional borrower and is accumula ting external liabilities the economies with trade surpluses are international lenders and accumulate external assets the capital inflow to the united states also exerts upward pressure on the value of the dollar as investors demand dollars to purchase do llar denominated assets the upward demand pressure on the value of the dollar is pulling against the downward pressure on the dollar exerted by the large supply of dollars pumped into the foreign exchange markets by the us trade deficit from the mid1990s until early 2002 the strength of foreign demand for dollar assets was sufficient to keep the dollar appreciating despite the rapid expansion of the trade defic it in this time period since 2002 however although the united states tinued to receive rising inflow of capital the strength of the associated demand for dollars has not been sufficient to prevent the dollar from depreciating modera tely under the weight of large current account deficits in this time period3 this external financing of the us current account deficit has occurred with relative ease so far but larg scale borrowing can not go on indefinitely there is limit to how much external debt even the us economy can incur currently the us debtgdp ratio is at historical high of about 192 it is uncertain how much higher this ratio can go but most econo mists would argue that there is an upper bound and at some point the us trade deficit will need to be closed to stabilize the level of external debt at feasible level erasing the us trade gap will require rebalancing of global spending trade deficit is symptom of an economy that spends more than it produces therefore rebalancing requires decrease of domes tic spending in the united states in contrast trade surplus is symptom of an economy that spends less than it produces therefore rebalancin g requires an increase of domestic spending in surplus economies these shifts in domestic spending patterns can be induced by decrease in the price of us goods and services relative to the price of foreign goods and services for the change in relative prices to happen the dollar must fall causing the price of foreign goods to rise for us buy ers and the price of us goods to fall for foreign buyers in addition to the downward pressure on the dollar of the large trade deficit an important animating force in this adjustment would likely be reduction in the demand for dollar denominated assets by foreign investors and shrinking of the associated capital inflowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34311crs3 4 paul krugman will there be dollar crisis economic policy july 2007 5 see for example micheal obstfeld and kenneth rogoff global current account imbalances and exchange rate adjustment brookings papers on economic activity 1 2005this rebalancing of globa l spending does not have to be disorderly and disruptive the major depreciation of th dollar that followed the breakup of the bretton woods international monetary system in the ear ly 1970s was largely orderly more recently the protracted fall of the dollar and reduction of the us trade deficit in the late 1980s and early 1990s was also an orderly adjustment of international economic imbalances why might disorderly adjustment and dollar crisis occur the critical factor is foreign investor expect ations about future dollar depreciation economic theory indicates that rational foreign investor in deciding whether to hold more or continue to hold his current dollar assets will build into that decision some estimate of future dollar deprecation for example dollar sset and euro asset each of similar risk and each offering 2 real return would present very different expected returns if the dollar is expected to preciate 4 annually and the euro to remain steady over the holding period with these expectations the rational investor would need the dollar asset to offer real yield in excess of 6 to make it more attractive then the euro asset at 2 moderation of market behavior and cris is free adjustment ccurs when foreign investors develop rational expectations about the currencys future path rational expectations about the dollars future path will have smoothing effect on the size of international capital flows in time of capital inflows some expectation of possible future depreciation tends to mode rate those inflows conversely in time of capital outflows some expectation of possible future appreciation will tend to moderate those outflows in contrast sharp plunge of the dollar is likely to occur if investors do not form rational expectations about the dollars futu re path if the dollar then depreciates at rate faster than foreign investors now expect dollar crisis becomes likely the rate of depreciation of the dollar that is rational to expect is the rate which is consistent with avoiding the accumulation of an unsustainable level of us external debt it is however difficult to say what that debt level is neve rtheless there is debtgdp ratio that prudent economic agen ts will judge to be an upper bound given that the question becomes what rate of dollar depreciation will give rate of closure of the trade deficit that contains the debtgdp ratio below that upper bound the economist paul krugman has calculated range of estimates of us external debt accumulation under alternative rates of convergence of the trade deficit to balance4 he assumes based on the general consensus of experts that further real depreciation of the dollar of about 35 would at minimum be necessary to close the us trade gap5 he then considers two rates of convergence to this goal one occurring over 20 years with 175 nnual rate of depreci ation of the dollar it leads to an external debt gdp ratio of 118 at that size it is possible that third or more of the us capital stock would be foreign owned the second scenario hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34311crs4 6 most countries are not able to borrow in thei r own currency so fall of their exchange rate will tend to increase their net external debt this was the problem that plagued the economies caught in the asian financial crisis in 1997 when their crashing currencies ballooned their external debt to such degree that they became insolvent 7 for further details on net external debt and valuation effects see us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis us net international investment position july 2007 convergence occurring over 10 years with an annual rate of depreci ation of the dollar of about 375 it leads to an external btgdp ratio of 58 which is more than twice the size of the current historically high level of us debtgdp ratio that seems high for large re latively closed economy like th united states but perhaps plausible given the current tre nds in financial globalization guarding against an overly pessimistic outcome these computations incorporate significant constraints on the growth of the external deptgdp ratio for instance each estimate of the eventual debt to gdp ratio assumes that nominal gdp will grow at an annual rate of 55 with comb ination of 30 real gdp growth and 25 inflation rate this could be slightly optimistic assumption for the pace of real gdp growth which has averaged only 27 in the current economic expansion slower growth of gdp would make the debtgdp ratio climb faster also krugmans external debt estimate s take into account the tendency of depreciating dollar to improve the us net debt position this improvement is caused by favorable valuation effects on us foreign assets these occur because us foreign liabilities are largely denominated in dollars but us foreign assets are largely denominated in foreign currencies therefore real depreciation of the dollar increases the value of us external assets and largely does not increase the value of us external liabilities this asymmetry in the currency composition of us external assets and liabilities results in dollar depreciation reducing us net external debt6 exchange rate induced valuation effects are substantial because they apply to the entire stock of us foreign assets valued at near 14 trillion in 2006 the large scale of us foreign assets means that valuation changes can offset sizable portion of the current accounts defic its annual addition to the exis ting stock of external debt for example in 2006 the current account deficit made 81l4 billion contribution to us external debt but the total valu of net external debt in 2006 increased only about 300 billion due to an offset of ove r 500 billi on over 60 nearly half of this offset was attributable to positive valuation effects on us foreign assets caused by the dollars depreciation that year7 if rapid dollar depreciation causes significant numbers of future lenders to be onl willing to hold nondollar denominated us debt the scale of the positive valuation effects would shrink and make the debtgdp ratio climb faster in addition one could argue that the 35 real depreciation target understates what is needed to close the current account deficit for the united states the equilibrium exchange rate is probably moving target and one whose path has been uneven but on balance has fa llen over the past 30 years this secular decline is thought to be rooted in rising technolog in emerging economies that has allowedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34311crs5 them to generate steady rise in exports th at compete with us tradable goods it is difficult to predict the pace of this secular decline but during the 10 to 20year convergence period used in this analysis it is possible that reaching the equilibrium exchange rate will require more than the exercises assumed 35 real depreciation of the dollar taken together these considerations pr obably give krugmans computations of the implied rise of the debtgnp ratios bias toward understate ment nevertheless the scale of the us trade imbalance that needs to be eliminated causes the estimated ratio to soar in either lternative if these estimates are understated then even more rapid real depreciation would be needed to erase the trade deficit and keep the debt to gnp ratio below realistic upper bound based on these computations krugman ar gues that rational foreign investor would have to expect the dollar to depreciat by at least about 2 per year and very likely depreciate by 4 per year or more do holders of us ssets appear to have taken this probable depreci ation into account it appears they have not using estimates of real longterm in terest rates in the united states the euro area and japan krugman finds difference in real yield between the us and euro area assets and about 1 percenta ge point advantage for us assets over ja pans assets this lack of real interest rate spread between dollar assets and similar foreign assets indicates that investors are expec ting virtually depreciation of the dollar over the holding period therefore in the face of seemingly inevitable depreciation of the dollar at 2 or faster these invest ors are holding us assets that offer in terms of their own currency zero or negative real return when foreign investors come to realize their error and try to avoid large capital loses by moving quickly and substantially out of dollar assets the dollar will fall precipitously and the dollar crisis begins as the dollars fall gains momentum there are likely to be negative interactions with domestic financial markets and domestic economic activity that will add to this downward momentum overcoming for awhile the usual corrective mechanisms in dollar crisis it is unlikely that th current account defi cit could decrease as rapidly as foreign investors would desire to curtail the inflow of capital to the united states but the current account deficit w ill have to be fina nced this economic necessity will generate strong ec onomic forces to assure that the needed economic adjustments at home and abroad occur the necessary macroeconomic adjustments will be discussed in subsequent section of the report at this point it will be useful to consider possible counter arguments to dollar crisis happening httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34311crs6 8 paul krugman will there be dollar crisis economic policy july 2007 also examines these arguments 9 see ben bernanke the global savings glut and the us current account deficit the sandbridge lecture virginia association of economics march 10 2005 and crs report rl33140 is the us trade deficit caused by global saving glut by marc labontepossible reasons why dollar crisis wont occur over the last few years several arguments that offer reasons why the ustrade deficit is more sustainable and dollar crisis less likely than presented in krugmans analysis have received serious considera tion in policy discussions about the us trade deficit and the associated rise of us external debt this section evaluates three prominent counterarguments to th dollar crisis prediction the global savings glut argument the bretton woods ii argument and the economic dark matter argument8 global savings glut ben bernanke now chairman of the federal reserve board has argued that there exists outside of the united states large excess of global saving relative to global investment opportunities9 these large and growing flows of foreign saving are the result of the rapid economic growth of many emerging economies and large oil earnings by petroleum exporting count ries the imf estimates that developing countries had net capital outflow of about 720 billion in 2006 large share of these funds are not going to be used in the home economy and are attracted to us asset markets because they offer excellent wealth storage services this service encompasses the ability of us asset markets to offer combination of reasonable rates of return safe ty and high liquidity the resu lt has been unusually large capital inflows to the united states these inflows of capital have kept us interest rates low and have exerted strong upward pressure on the valu of dollar it is argued that this saving glut could continue to grow for many years into the future therefore it will continue to enhance the sustainability of the us trad deficit and in turn provides sustained and substantial upward pressure on the valu of the dollar this persisting inflow does not preclude depreciation of the dollar but would mode rate the depreciation and greatly reduce the risk of dollar crisis while the existence of global savings glut can help explain why the large us trade deficit has been sustained with relative ease well beyond what many experts had expected it does not avoid the loomin g reality of there being an upperbound on us net external debt and that this bt ceiling creates the inevitable need for large real depreciation of the us dollar saving glut can explain why global real interest rates are low but it does not avoi d the problem posed by those rates being as low as rates in both the united states deficit country and the surplus economies this anomaly occurs because foreign investors in dollar assets are not taking into account the impending need for sust ained and substantial real depreciation ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34311crs7 10 michael p dooley david folk ertslandau and peter garber an essay on the revived bretton woods system nber working paper 9971 2003the dollar when this risk becomes apparent to those investors they will hurry to find other destinations for their savings if that happens the dollar would plummet bretton woods ii some economists have characterized the current global monetary arrangement as bretton woods ii bwii10 the first bretton woods bwi was the global monetary arrangement in place from the end of world war ii through 1973 bwi was formal system of fixed exchange rates centered on the dollar other countries were obliged to maintain their currencies value relative to the dollar when needed this adjustment was accomplished by foreig n central banks buying or selling foreign exchange to keep their currencies value at the fixed parity with the dollar the speculative crises caused by relatively free flowing international capital that plagued the interwar years were to be prevented by strict controls on the flow of capital between economies this system worked reasonably well in the early postwar period but accumulating pressure for ma jor dollar devaluation and increasingly porous capital controls led to its breakdown in the early 1970s since 1973 most major economies have allowed their currencie s to more or less float freely on the global foreign exchange markets allowing its exchange value to be driven by the international supply and dema nd for its goods and assets capital controls were also largely abandoned by these nations bwii is not formal arrangement or orga nization it is facto arrangement whereby central banks particularly in asia amass dollar reserves so as to stabilize their currencies value relative to the dollar this stabilization is achieved by the central banks buying dollar assets sufficient to keep their currencies from rising relative to the dollar it is also supporte d by the bwii economies imposing significant controls on capital flows to and from their economies not letting their currencies rise relative to the dollar enables them to maintain the competitiveness of their exports in the us market and perpetuate successful development strategy driven by exportled growth china has been important participant in this arrangement with its central bank in recent years ama ssing well over 1trillion in foreign exchange reserves large proportion be ing various dollar assets with china at its center it could be argued that because bwii has been very successful development strategy for china and because that country still has over 300 million nonindustrial workers to absorb in to its industrial and service sectors this facto monetary rrangement will endure for many more years and continue to exert strong upward pressure on the va lue of the dollar countering any tendency towards dollar crisishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34311crs8 11 neil roubini and brad sester w ill the bretton w oods ii regime unravel soon the risk of hardlanding in 20052006 presente d at symposium sponsored by the federal reserve bank of san francisco and the univer sity of california berkeley san francisco 2005however serious questions can be raised about the stability of bwii11 one potential problem is that such large scale accumulations of foreign exchange reserves can have disruptive macroeconomic and financial effects on the accumulating economy to prevent the foreign exchan ge reserves from causing an unwanted increase the countrys money s upply its central bank must sterilize the accumulation of foreign currency assets it does this by purchasing compensating amounts of domestic assets which pulls money out of the economy sterilization of dollar inflows on such large and growing scale however will be an increasingly difficult task for china and other emerging economies they have small and immature asset markets that are unlikely to be able to continue to effectively sterilize further large scale reserve growth it is likely that this foreign liquidity will begin to leak into th eir domestic economy and push up the money supply this would in turn lead to in creased inflation and domestic lending boom that generates asset price bubbles this c ould cause significant disruptions in their weak financial markets and adversely affect their economic activity in addition the balance sheets of the foreign central banks that hold large amounts of dollar assets are exposed to larg losses if the dollar crashes collectively the bwii central banks have an incentive to hold on to their dollar assets to preserve the value of these holdings individually however the bwii central banks have an incentive to sell their dollar assets if they suspect the dollar will soon plunge therefore the stability of bwii is highly dependent on how mu ch cooperation there is among these central banks further large share of the capital inflow to the united states comes from private investors whose economic incentives are different than those of the bwii central banks perhaps foreign private i nvestors remain heavily in dollar assets because they think that bwii can prevent dollar crash but there is strong basis for such belief the efficacy of bwii would be evident if at some point it had demonstrated an ability to sustain the dollars value despite an outflow from the united states of private capital motivated by realistic expectations about the dollars future falling path but what has been occurring are large official inflows along with large private inflows that are accepting real return that is insufficient to compensate for the expected rate of fall of the dollar which realistically must occur if bwii is to offset the outflow of private capital based on realistic expectations of the dollars future path the bwii centr banks would need to increase their already huge dollar reserves by an amount that is probably not feasible and the problem posed by there being an upper bound to the us debtgnp ratio would still remain bwii seems unlikely to be seen as reliable barrier to plummeting dollar once foreign investors see the need to adjust to more realistic expectations of the dollars future path httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34311crs9 12 ricardo hausmann and federico sturzenegger us and global imbalances can dark matter prevent the big bang kennedy school of government harvard university unpublished working paper camb ridge 2005 and crs report rl33570 us external debt how has the united sat borrowed without cost by craig k elwelldark matter another perspective on the us interna tional balances has been presented by the economists ricardo hausmann and frederico struzeneggar12 it is their contention that there are large measurement errors in the us trade data that cause big understatement of us exports and in turn big ove rstatement of the size of us net external debt in their opinion this error is of magnitude that the current account balance has actually been in surplus in recent years and that the united states is an external net creditor not debtor the principal evidence of this is that despite seeming huge net external debt the unite d states has consistently run sizable surplus in the investment inco portion of the current account the unmeasured exports are not picked up in the export data because they are are services hidden within us capital outflows once abroad these assets generate an income stream that is m easured as investment income in the current account data these invisible assets have been named dark matter because they like the astronomical phenomenon have visible effect genera ting investment income that is caused by unseen service exports it is contented that the dark matter effect is large with proper accounting it transfor ms net debt position of about 25 trillion to net surplus position of about 600 billion three classes of invisible exports are said to exist global liquidity services global insurance services nd knowledge services the three exports in turn are attached respectively to three types of capital outflows us currency us sovereign debt and us fo reign direct investment liquidity services this service is derived from the us currencys special status as global source of liquidity large portion of the 700 billion federal reserve notes in circulation are held abroad estimates of the share vary from low of 30 to high of 70 the holding of th is currency by foreigne rs is equivalent to an interest free and irredeemable loan to the united states with an implicit value of as much as 25 billion insurance services it is argued that the world economy uses lowrisk us treasury securities to fill out the lowrisk end of their investment portfolios much like global bank the united states can then use these proceeds to invest in higher yielding bonds from emerging economies th is amounts to the world exchanging risky asset for safe asset nd the yield difference is the equivalent of an insurance premium the world pays the us for lowering its risk knowledge services this service is said to occur because us foreign direct investment embodies host of unmeasured assets these services are in the form of knowhow brand reco gnition expertise and res earch and development this is the form of dark matter that propone nts see as the most important httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34311crs10 the major implication of the dark matter argument for the dollar is that because the true state of the us trade position is not precarious and because the united states is not net external debtor there is n eed for dollar depreciation to keep the debt to gnp ratio within bounds foreign invest ors could be quite willing to hold more dollar assets despite their having little apparent yield advantage over foreign assets the risk of dollar crisis in this circumstance would be small although there is probably some mer it to the dark matter argument most economists would argue that the scale of the effect is vastly smaller than claimed by its proponents for that reason economic da rk matter probably doe s little to forestall the need for substantial correction of th us trade deficit and that correction must be set in motion by substantial r eal depreciation of the dollar beyond the depreciation that has already occurred and that will persist for several years the macroeconomic effects of dollar crisis in the standard macroeconomic model reduction of foreign capital inflows would have longterm effect on ggregate spending and output real depreciation of the dollar would encourag us export sales and discourage domestic spending on imports increasing net exports and shrinking the trade deficit at the same time foreigners reduced willingness to hold dollar assets will reduce the inflow of foreign capital pushing down the price of us securities and pushing up us interest rates higher interest rates would then induce decrease in interest sensitive spending such as residential investment consumer durables and business investment in the end the trade defic it would be gone the composition of us spending and output would change but ther would not be any change in the total level of spending and output the transition to this new equilibrium of trade balances however may not be smooth some argue that there could be very rough transition involving sharp slowdown in economic activity or rece ssion substantial nearterm slowing of economic activity would occur if the decreas of us domestic spending occurs more quickly then the increase of us netexports interest sensitive purchases tend to be more postponable then other domestic sp ending and would likely fall relatively quickly as interest rates sp iked net exports response c ould be significantly slower the peak effect on net exports in response to currency deprecia tion is usually about two years later however in this situation the scale of adjustment needed to eliminate the trade deficit is unusually large and will involve large sh ifts of resources into the production of tradable goods which take time this could slow the response of net exports further what aggravates this situation and significantly adds to the risk of dollar crisis triggering recession is the us econom ys ongoing burden of adjusting to the housing price crisis falling home pri ces reduce household wealth discouraging household spending and dampen aggregate spe nding as with most markets there is self correcting mechanism that facilita tes beneficial adjustment in the housing market this occurs as weaker aggregat demand also weakens the demand for credit and causes interest rates to decrease by stimulating interest sensitive spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34311crs11 falling interest rates other things equal arrest some of the downward impulse on aggregate demand of falling housing prices however if the economy must also endure the disruptive effects of plummeting dollar other things would not be equal in dollar crisis great numbers of foreign investors are atte mpting to sell large amounts of dollar assets at the same time causing dollar asset prices to fall sharply and interest rates to rise sharply interest rates will continue to rise until sufficient number of dollaraverse investors can be enticed to offer enough capital to finance the slowly shrinking current account deficit an interest rate spike like this is likely to forestall any ameliorating effect of otherwise falling interest ra tes on the housing crisis slowing aggregate demand more than would otherwise occur in this environment where two crises exert downward pressure on aggregate spending the risk rises that the shortterm adjustment of the us trade balance could involve much quicker and much larger slowing of domestic spending with so little nearterm boost from rising net exports this magnified nearterm negative impact could be sufficient to cause recession the response of economic policy the ability of conventional fiscal nd monetary policy here and abroad to counter the nearterm contractionary eff ects of dollar crisis is problematic response of us economic policy when the government budget is in defi cit it reduces domestic saving and when in surplus it increases domestic saving therefore conceptually an infusion of government saving caused by policy actions that reduce the federal budget deficit could compensate for the dwindling flow of foreign savings stemming from foreign investors move out of dolla r assets governments addi ng to the domestic flow of saving would tend to decrease interest rates and stimulate aggregate spending this would also mean that the trade balance adjustment could occur with out reduction of domestic investment an outcome that bodes better for productivity and the long term growth of the us living standard however to get to this point there would first be an initial dampening effect flowing from the governments budget defi cit reducing actions of spending less taxing more or doing both in the short r negative fiscal impulse in conjunction with the already occurring shortrun negativ effects of the housing crisis and dollar crisis would amplify the recession risk also the impulse toward lower interest rates would mute the selfcorrecting effect of rising interest differential between dollar assets and foreign ssets that would otherwise help to slow the dollars fall again conceptually the shortterm negative effects of fiscal tightening on aggregate spending could be countered by complementary shortterm monetary stimulus which spurs spending through exerting downward pressure on interest rates in practice however whether alone or in tandem with monetary policy the use ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34311crs12 budget deficit reduction as policy respons to the nearterm problems of dollar crisis is improbable the necessary tax and spending changes are unlikely to be implemented quickly enough over long er time horizon where fiscal action may be more likely increased government saving from budget deficit reduction would prevent the dwindling inflows of foreign saving from causing an undesired compression of us domestic investment with fiscal policy most likely out of consideration in the nearterm the task of attempting to counter the shor tterm contractionary effect s of dollar crisis would fall upon the federal reserve it would most likely do this by pumping liquidity into the economy and exerting downward pressure on interest rates monetary policy can be implemented quickly and its favorable effect felt with modest time lag nevertheless there are some potential constraints on the feds ability to follow stimulative monetary policy during dollar crisis one potential constraint is consequen ce of the dollar depreciation inducing increase in us inflation by causing the price of us imports to rise sharply this inflation effect will be mute d by imports relatively sma ll share of final demand also many foreign producers will to preserve market share prevent full passthrough of the exchange rate change to the pri ce of their products exported to the united states nevertheless it is still possible that the scale of dollar depreciation in crisis could lead to 1 to 2 percentage point jump in the inflation rate this inflation effect would stop once the dollar stabilized but to prevent this inflation spurt from generating an increase in inflation expect ations and causing more enduring runup of inflation the fed might be reluctant to validate those expect ations by continuing to provide monetary stimulus another possible constraint on fully pursuing policy of monetary stimulus is that if the fall of the dollar is seen by the fed to be too extreme policy action may be needed to gain some control over the fallin g currency most likely this would involve changing direction and increasing interest rates to entice foreign investors back to dollar assets even if the fed does not relent in applying monetary stimulus the traditional channel for doing this is by targeting shortterm interest rates usually the nominal federal funds rate however that rate can only be decreased to zero with the nominal federal funds rate already down to about 20 there is question of whether sufficient monetary stimulus could be applie d before this rate reaches the socalled zero bound at this point there are nontraditional wa ys that might be used to implement monetary policy these include targeting longertermed federal securities making direct loans to banks or altering inflati on expectations ie wering real rates via credible commitment to higher future inflation that could be used it is still uncertain however if these untried alternative monetary policy levers are effective and if effective whether that effect can be delivered to the economy quickly enough to counter the sharp shortterm negative impulse to domestic spending of fast falling dollar

adjustment forced by dollar crisis as discussed earlier falling dollar and rising foreign currencies is the instrument that will lead to rebalancing of world spending for ec onomies with trade surpluses the rebalancing would manifest as increase of domestic spending and decrease of net exports as was true for the united states after the rebalancing has been completed affected foreign economies total spending and level of output would be unchanged the negative effects from the decrease in netexports caused by their currencies appreciation will be counterbalanced by th positive effect from lower interest rates pushed down by increased capital inflows boosting domestic spending like the united states however the rest of the worlds nearterm transition to this new equilibrium might not be smooth and also carry an elevated risk of recession many us trading partners have relied on export sales to the american market as their principal or at least their major engine of economic growth this practice is most overt in those economies that tie their currency to the dollar so that dollar depreciation does not reduce the price competitiveness of their exports in dollar crisis there could be temptation to try to continue to prevent their currencies from appreciating against the dollar defendin g their currencies would slow the global adjustment but it is unlikely to be successful policy however in the face of global attempt to move out of dollar assets and plummeting dollar the likely aftermath of such an attempt would be that thes economies would be left holding an even larger stock of dollar assets whose value is fraction of what it was when purchased the deflationary impact of rising currency would help economies such as china that are facing an inflation problem on the other hand it could cause problems for country like japan that still teeters on the edge of deflation in general more useful policy res ponse by foreign economies would likely be expansionary economic policies sufficient to boost domestic spending and offset the nearterm negative impact of an appreciating currency on their net exports because this stimulus must be applied quickly for it to be effective the task would most likely be undertaken by the monetary authorities as was true for the united states it is problematic whether the application of stimulative monetary policy by the centr banks of the surplus economies would have sufficient positive effect on aggregate spending in the nearterm to avoid strong downward push on global economic ac tivity in economies that are already facing significant inflation problem such as china there could be reluctance to fan the inflationary flames any further by undertaking added monetary expansion in any event cooperative policy response by the united states and its major trading partners would certainly help to smooth th global adjustment to dollar crisis httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34311crs14 conclusion predicting the path of exchange rates is always an endeavor with an above normal level of uncerta inty nevertheless it seems undeni able that further sizable depreciation of the dollar is necessary in the long run to keep the united states large and growing external debt w ithin realistic bounds it is difficult however to predict how global investors who hold the us exte rnal debt will respond to the seemingly large erosion of the value of those dollar ssets caused by this inevitable depreciation of the dollar rational response to holding currency unable to perform its role as store of value would be to move quickly into assets denominated in other more stable currencies yet despite the sizable depr eciation of the dollar that has already occurred foreign investors continue to hold dollar assets there are reasons in addition to the store of value function to hold those assets safe ty and liquidity are two other important reasons both functions that the wi and deep dollar asset markets perform very well also many i nvestors pursue very long term goals and could be willing to ignore short run risk it seems unlikely however that these other reasons for holding dollar assets would continue to trump the dollars rapidly dwindling ability to provide the store of va lue function if so then sharp dollar fall could be just ahead plummeting dollar would have positive and negative effects on the world economy as well eventually the positiv and negative impacts on the level of economic activity should be offsetting but it would leave the world economy with more stable external balances but there is reason to be concerned that in the short run the negative effects may be domin ant raising the risk of recession the triggering of recession by plummeting dollar will depend on what else is going on in the economy when the currency crashes if already weakened by other forces the risk of recession would grow much larger if generally good economic conditions prevail then economic activity is likely to slow in the nearterm but avoid recession it is important to take into consider ation that the us economy is large and resilient and able to absorb substantial shocks without necessarily transmitting significant adverse effect on overall economic activity in contrast dollar crisis could send more devast ating economic blow to economies that are highly dependent on exporting to the us mark et to sustain their economic growth
