crs report rl33668 the speech or debate clause recent developments by todd b tatelman reconstruction statutes in the wake of the civil war congress enacted series of statutes most notably the civil rights act of 1866 and the civil rights act of 1871 that were intended to enforce the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments which prohibited sl avery and enshrined equal protection and voting rights in the us constitution desi gned to provide private remedies to individuals deprived of their civil rights these statutes were written in general terms that have been interpreted broadly to protect individuals from wide range of discriminatory conduct the re levant provisions as codi fied include 42 usc 1981 1982 1983 and 1985 42 usc 1981 provides in part th at all persons shall have the same right to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by whitehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33386crs8 34 1981 provides in pertinent part all persons within the jurisdiction of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory to make and enforce contracts to sue be parties give evidence and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens and shall be subject to like punishments pains penalties taxes licenses and exactions of every kind and to other 35 1983 states in full every person who under color of any stat ute ordinance regulation custom or usage of any state or territory or the district of columbia subjects or causes to be subjected any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights privileges or immunities secured by the constitution and laws shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law suit in equity or othe r proper proceeding for redress for the purposes of this section any act of c ongress applicable exclusively to the district of columbia shall be consider ed to be statute of the district of columbiacitizens34 as result 1981s coverage extends to prohibit discrimination in wide range of public and private contractual relationships including the provisi on of services and the sale of goods indeed since employment relationships are based on contracts 1981 has been interp reted to prohibit intentional discrimination on the basis of race color or c itizenship by private employers because 1981 refers to white citizens however the provision does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex religion or national origin unle ss claim based on national origin or religion has racial component under 42 usc 1982 all citizens of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit purchase lease sell hold and convey real and personal prope rty like 1981 1982 prohibits intentional discr imination in both the public and private sectors but unlike 1981 the coverage of 1982 is limited to discrimination on the basis of race and applies only to transactions involving real or personal property 42 usc 1983 which provides re medy for deprivation of rights under color of state law creates new substantive rights but rather provides relief where state law is inadequate35 thus individuals who sue under 1983 must find sour ce of rights elsewhere as result 1983 is most typically used to enforce constitutional rights such as the right to equal protec tion in general 1983 suits alleging unlawful discrimination are limited to intentional claims of discrimination involving public not private actors and may apply to discrimination based on wide variety of factors such as race sex religion or citizenshiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33386crs9 36 1985 provides in pertinent part if two or more persons in any state or rritory conspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another for the purpose of depriving either directly or indirectly any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws or for the purpose of preventing or hindering the constituted au thorities of any state or territory from giving or securing to all persons with in such state or territory the equal protection of the laws or if two or more persons conspire to prevent by force intimidation or threat any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote from giving his support or advocacy in legal manner toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an electo r for president or vice president or as member of congress of the united states or to injure any citizen in person or property on account of such support or advo cacy in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section if one or more persons engaged therein do or cause to be done any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy whereby another is injured in his person or property or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of citizen of the united states the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such injury or deprivation against any one or more of the conspiratorslike 1983 42 usc 1985 which provides remedy in cases involving conspiracy to interfere with civil rights creates new independent rights36 instead 1985 is designed to give the injured party an opportunity to recover da mages against the conspirators although 1985 may apply to privat acts of discrimination it is not clear whether it covers discrimination based on factors other than race
