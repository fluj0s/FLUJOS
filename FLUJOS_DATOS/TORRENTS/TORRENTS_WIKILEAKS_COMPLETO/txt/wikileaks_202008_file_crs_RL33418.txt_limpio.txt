2005 pl 109171 s 1932 on february 8 2006 concluded fouryear saga of legislative attempts to reauthorize temporary assistance for needy families tanf and related programs the original 1996 tanf law authorized five years of funding through september 2002 between october 1 2002 and the dras passage the program operated under series of 12 temporary extension measures efforts to pass comprehensive free standing welfare legislation during that period failed to reach fruition instead scaledback version of welfare reauthorization legislation was ultimately included in broader budget spending reconciliation legislation the dra of 2005 extends and maintains the basic tanf block grant at funding level of 165 billion annually through fy2010 increases the share of tanf families required to participate in work activities increases child care funding by 200 million per year over the fy2005 level of 27 billion for fy2006fy2010 ie total increase of 1 billion provides federal costsharing for child support passed through to tanf and former tanf families but prevents federal matching of child support incentive payments reinvested in the program provides up to 100 million per year in demonstration grants for the promotion of healthy marriages and establishes 50 million per year for responsible fatherhood initiatives the administration originally proposed its welfare reauthorization plan in february 2002 the debate that ensued was dominated by controversy over child care funding levels and the administrations proposed changes to tanf work participation standards the reauthorization debate also reflected renewed focus on noncustodial parents usually fathers and on family formation issues the dra includes responsible fatherhood initiatives and scaledback version of the presidents initiative to promote healthy marriages the dra ultimately included the same child care funding increase that was proposed in earlier housepassed welfare reauthorization measures in 2002 and 2003 1 billion in additional mandatory child care funding over five years in the 108th congress legislation introduced in the senate likewise proposed 1 billion increase over five years down from the 55 billion increase approved by the senate finance committee in the 107th congress however senator snowe led efforts pressing for larger increase the bill approved by the 109th congresss finance committee s 667 reflected those efforts with proposed increase of 6 billion over five years however s 667 was one of the freestanding welfare measures that was not taken up by the full senate and the child care funding increase was set at 1 billion in the final passage of the dra with respect to the work requirement issue while the dra requires states to increase the share of their families participating in tanf work activities it does not include the administrations original proposal to set 40hour workweek standard or revise the activities that count toward it this marks

june 30 2007 earlier the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 s 1932 budget spending reconciliation bill signed into law february 8 2006 included scaledback version of welfare reform reauthorization the act extended funding for the basic temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant through fy2010 increased the percentage of tanf families who will be required to participate in work or work activities increased funding for child care revised the child support enforcement program and established healthy marriage promotion grants and responsible fatherhood initiatives background the 1996 welfare reform law the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 pl 104193 was major piece of social legislation most known for ending the cash welfare entitlement for needy families with children creating the tanf block grant setting fiveyear time limit on aid and requiring more work from welfare recipients the law also restructured child care programs combining programs for cash assistance recipients and other working poor families modified the child support enforcement cse program restricted eligibility for noncitizens in various welfare programs restricted eligibility for disabled children in the supplemental security income ssi program and made changes to the food stamp program the goals of welfare reform include reducing welfare dependency through work job preparation and marriage reducing outofwedlock pregnancies and promoting the formation and maintenance of twoparent families tanf gives states great deal of latitude in designing their programs resulting in each state having different program with different story to tell in their tanffunded cash welfare programs many states tightened work rules requiring applicants to search for work even before being certified eligible for aid most states adopted tougher penalties on families where member refused to comply with work requirements however states also adopted features that liberalized eligibility particularly for families where recipients went to work once on the rolls for example in most states families are allowed to keep more of their welfare benefits as their earnings increase have car and accumulate more assets spending on child care has increased crs2 table 1 shows various social and economic indicators for the postwelfare reform period the period following welfare reform saw the cash welfare caseload plummet and child poverty rates drop to levels not seen since the 1970s employment of single mothers increased dramatically progress was more muted or could be less tied to changes in policy on number of other fronts the rate at which teenagers gave birth declined but that was continuation of trend that became evident before the mid1990s the percent of children born out of wedlock continued to increase though at rate slower than during previous periods further much of the progress occurred during the period 1995 to 2000 in 2001 the economy entered recession national caseloads remained steady for the 20012004 period they had begun to decline again in 2005 which is not shown in the table employment in 2004 of single mothers is down from its historical high in 2000 although is still higher than its 1995 level the number of children living in families headed by married couple decreased slightly from 2000 to 2003 child poverty rates increased again from 2000 to 20041 welfare dependency has been viewed as both result of and cause of chronic poverty welfare caseloads and child poverty simultaneously declined during the late 1990s however the welfare caseload declined faster than child poverty meaning that cash welfare touches smaller share of the poor than it did before welfare reform further despite the decline in welfare dependency children are still more likely to be poor than the elderly and nonaged adults and outofwedlock births and single parenthood remain at historical highs despite the halving of the cash welfare caseload 1 for more discussion of these trends see crs report rl32682 children in poverty profile trends and issues by vee burke thomas gabe and gene falk and crs

and state grants for abstinence education provided in the 1996 welfare law expired at the end of fy2002 september 30 2002 president bush submitted his welfare reauthorization proposals to congress in february 2002 though congress debated welfare legislation throughout the three years 2002 through 2004 final action was taken on longterm reauthorization during the 107th and 108th congresses while reauthorization legislation remained stalled congress passed measures to provide stopgap funding for the welfare programs and such was the case through 2005 as in previous years efforts to pass comprehensive freestanding welfare legislation in the first session of the 109th congress were unsuccessful however scaledback version of welfare reauthorization legislation was ultimately included in broader budget spending reconciliation legislation the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 1091712 2 for more discussion of the deficit reduction act see crs report rs22369 tanf child care marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood provisions in the deficit continued crs4 in crafting the dra s 1932pl 109171 only one of the chambers initially included welfare reauthorization provisions in

bill select reauthorization proposals that had been approved earlier by the ways and means human resources subcommittee and the education and workforce committee as part of hr 240 welfare bill although the full senate had failed to act on welfare reauthorization legislation prior to assembling and considering the dra early in the 109th congress the senate finance committee did approve welfare reauthorization measure s 667 funding the tanf and child care block grants the 1996 welfare law converted and consolidated several federalstate matching grant programs into the tanf and child care block grants most tanf funding is provided in fixed basic annual grant of 165 billion 50 states and dc this amount represents the peak federal contribution made to pretanf programs in the mid1990s the basic block grant is fixed it neither increases nor decreases with changes in the cash assistance caseload moreover it is not adjusted for inflation3 the child care block grant has two major parts 1 discretionary funding which is determined in annual appropriations and 2 mandatory funding with appropriations found in the 1996 welfare reform law the 1996 law included gradual increases in mandatory child care funding total child care funding has been essentially flat since fy20024 table 2 compares the tanf child care and transitional medicaid5 funding provisions included

congressional research service crs 7 continued rl33157 welfare reauthorization sidebyside comparison of current law and pending welfare reauthorization proposals by gene falk melinda gish carmen solomonfears and emilie stoltzfus crs6 note that while the basic tanf block grant is extended and maintained at the annual amount of 165 billion until fy2010 under the dra pl 109171 tanf supplemental grants are extended for only three years further previous welfare reauthorization proposals had included 200 million per year in grants for healthy marriage promotion 100 million per year for matching grants to states and tribes and second 100 million per year in research and demonstration funding controlled by the secretary of health and human services hhs the deficit reduction act scales back funding for healthy marriage promotion to 100 million in research and demonstration funding an additional 50 million in mandatory funding is for responsible fatherhood initiatives all existing tanf bonuses high performance bonus based on states progress toward meeting the block grants goals 200 million per year and bonus for reducing outofwedlock pregnancies 100 million per year are eliminated the level of mandatory child care funding has been contentious point of debate over the past four years the congressional budget office cbo has estimated that to maintain the current level of child care subsidies over the five years covered by the dra that is to maintain current child care caseloads and average subsidy levels and keep pace with inflation total of 48 billion in extra federal or state funds would be needed the current child care caseload includes families on the cash welfare rolls as well as other lowincome working families in fy2001 only one in five families aided by the child care block grant received tanf cash assistance the other four families were either former tanf families in the transition from welfare to work or were working poor families without connection to the cash welfare program the deficit reduction act includes an increase of 200 million per year from 2717 billion to 2917 billion per year in federal mandatory child care funding or total increase of 1 billion over five years the increase reflects twice that proposed earlier in the housepassed budget reconciliation bill 05 billion mirroring the funding level passed by the house in welfare reauthorization measures of both 2002 and 2003 the 1 billion increase stands in contrast to the proposed increase of 6 billion over five years included in the bill reported out of the senate finance committee early in 2005 s 6678 the deficit reduction acts 1 billion in additional federal child care funds requires state matching this leverages some additional state dollars for each new federal child care dollar if states draw down the full 1 billion approximately 08 billion in state child care funds will also be expended bringing the total new federal and state spending for the child care block grant to about 18 billion 8 in 2003 the senate finance committee approved welfare reauthorization bill hr 4 that included 1 billion in additional child care funding however during the committee markup of that legislation senator snowe shared her intent to offer an amendment for greater child care funding increase if and when the bill was brought to the senate floor in march of 2004 hr 4 did indeed reach the senate floor for debate and senator snowes amendment to provide an additional 6 billion in child care funding above the 1 billion already included in the underlying hr 4 was offered and approved by vote of 7820 however following the vote on the amendment the senate failed to resume consideration of hr 4 for the remainder of the 108th congress crs7 however the 18 billion in total new federal and state child care funds is estimated to be insufficient to maintain current caseloads and average child care subsidies and to keep pace with inflation as projected by the cbo in addition the deficit reduction act has tanf work provisions see below that beginning in fy2007 are likely to substantially increase the share of tanf families that will be required to work or participate in job readiness activities this too is likely to increase the demand for child care subsidies the child care and tanf block grants do not entitle families to child care subsidies therefore states could respond in number of different ways or combination of ways to inflationary pressures and the likely increase in the demand for child care subsidies caused by stricter tanf work participation requirements increase funding from other sources particularly tanf tanf has been major contributor of child care funds the second largest spending category next to cash assistance within tanf states could allocate more tanf spending to child care however number of factors are likely to limit tanfs ability to contribute more child care funds specifically 1 the block grant will remain frozen at the same levels as it was in fy1997 165 billion and inflation continues to erode the purchasing power of those dollars 2 the dra will have the likely effect of increasing the percentage of tanf families that will have to participate in work activities increasing the tanf work costs in addition to child care costs and 3 allocating additional funding to child care would mean cutting back on other initiatives that have been funded with tanf dollars for instance tanfs contribution to funding child welfare benefits and services for children who have been subject to or are at risk of abuse neglect or family breakup target more child care dollars to families receiving cash assistance as discussed above in fy2001 only one in five families receiving subsidies under the child care block grant received cash assistance to meet the higher child care costs due to the increase in tanf work participation standards states could target more child care dollars to families on tanf assistance reducing spending on subsidies for other lowincome working poor families restructure child care subsidies to reduce their average costs under both block grants states determine subsidy levels and how much family has to contribute from their own income co payments these rules can be restructured to reduce the average child care subsidy per family crs8 tanf work requirements tanf requires states to run mandatory work and job preparation programs setting participation requirements and sanctioning families reducing or ending benefits that do not comply with them mandatory participation requirements can help achieve number of different policy objectives including the following enforcing the notion that recipients are obligated to support their families through work that is they must do something in exchange for their benefits having recipients engage in activities that will enhance their ability to compete in the labor market and ultimately leave welfare for work and deterring those who have other means of support eg those already working but not reporting income to the welfare office or participating in the underground economy from applying and receiving benefits most states have generally adopted workfirst approach to implementing their programs emphasizing rapid entry into the labor force through upfront job search evaluations of such programs indicate that they do increase employment and reduce welfare receipt however these programs have generally not been found to raise the incomes of participants further tanf data show that participation in activities is not universal in fy2004 states reported that of about 14 million adult recipients of cash assistance 57 were not working or in job preparation activity for month note that these adults are not reported in an activity states may underreport activity that is not countable toward tanf work participation standards 1996 law work participation standard nominally the 1996 tanf law set participation standard that requires 50 of families with an adult to be engaged in work separate standard of 90 applies to the twoparent component of the caseload however the actual participation standards states face are usually far lower than the nominal participation standards tanf law provides caseload reduction credit which reduces the 50 standard by one percentage point for each percent decline in the cash assistance caseload that occurred since fy1995 prewelfare reform many states have had large caseload declines and in fy2004 there were 19 states with declines of 50 or more reducing the effective after credit standard to 0 on average the fy2004 national work participation rate was 329 the large caseload reduction credits have lessened the impact of the participation standards they have allowed states to have more participants in noncreditable activities eg education and perhaps led to lower overall participation 9 for more information on tanf see crs report rl32760 the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant responses to frequently asked questions by gene falk crs9 revisions to tanf work participation standards the 2002 bush administration welfare reauthorization proposals envisioned substantial rewrite of the tanf work participation standards the participation standard would have been raised from 50 to 70 the caseload reduction credit would have been replaced with credit for employed welfare leavers families would have had to participate 40 hours per week and except for three month period allowed for recipients to focus solely on job search and shortterm training minimum of 24 hours per week in work or workfare would have been required for states to receive credit for familys participation the house passed slightly modified version of the administrations work proposal three times in 2002 2003 and in the housepassed version of the budget reconciliation bill in 2005 three times in 2002 2003 and s 667 in 2005 the senate finance committee reported different modifications to the work rules though none of these proposals passed the full senate the finance committee approach was to generally expand the activities that count toward the participation standards in part by increasing the amount of education that would have been countable under tanf work standards the deficit reduction act does not overhaul tanf work participation standards it retains the current 50 and 90 standards current rules for the minimum hours that count toward the participation standard and current list of activities that are creditable for work participation however the deficit reduction act makes the following changes the caseload reduction credit is revised so that work participation standards are reduced only for caseload reductions that occur from fy2005 into the future this is effective beginning in fy2007 thus absent further caseload declines state will face 50 tanf work participation standard in contrast to the much reduced standards they would have faced under prior law will count families in statefunded separate state programs ssps in the work participation rate calculation under current law states may assist tanflike families in statefunded programs and count spending in those programs toward the tanf state spending requirement known as the maintenance of effort or moe families in ssps are not counted in the work participation rates the dra provides that beginning in fy2007 families in ssps are to be included in the participation rate calculation this prevents states from increasing their participation rate simply by moving nonparticipating families into ssps requires hhs to develop regulations to define work activities and standards for verifying work participation 2005 government accountability office gao report found that the lack of uniformity in work definitions and procedures for verifying participation means there is standard basis for interpreting states work participation rates and the rates cannot effectively be crs10 used to assess and compare states performance10 the dra requires hhs to define tanf work activities types of families that are subject to work requirements and standards for verifying worker participation hhs issued these regulations on june 29 200611 the regulations define each of the 12 tanf work activities12 require that activities be supervised for education and training often on daily basis exempt families where an adult must care for disabled member from the work requirements but include families with sanctioned adult or one removed from the assistance case because of state time limit in the participation rate calculation and require states to submit plans for verifying work activities these changes are likely to increase required participation standards significantly for states the national average work participation rate in fy2004 was 32 so requiring 50 of families to participate requires states to significantly boost their participation13 child support enforcement responsible fatherhood initiatives abstinence education and marriage promotion in 2004 children in families headed by single mother had poverty rate of 419 compared with rate of 89 for children in families headed by married couple the majority of poor children in 2004 572 of all poor children in families live in families headed by single mother welfaretowork initiatives have focused on getting such single mothers into the workforce while there has been sharp increase in work among single mothers many single mothers and their children remain poor the fifth annual tanf report states welfare reform has been very successful at getting significant portion of cases into the workplace and into second and sometimes third jobs but it has been less effective in keeping them employed full time and in achieving substantial wage or career growth the sixth annual tanf report indicates that in fy2002 the average monthly earnings of tanf recipients who were employed was 678 or 8136 per year the poverty level for threeperson family in 2002 was 1196 per month or 14348 for the year child support payments are now recognized as very significant income source for singleparent families 10 united states government accountability office gao05821 welfare reform hhs should exercise oversight to help ensure tanf work participation is measured consistently across states aug 2005 11 see federal register vol 71 125 june 29 2006 pp 3745437483 12 for description of these definitions see crs report rs22490 tanf guide to the new definitions of what counts as work participation by gene falk 13 further work participation rates varied greatly among the states some states will have to increase their participation rates more than others see fy2004 work participation data at httpwwwacfhhsgovprogramsofaparticipindexparticiphtm2004 crs11 increasingly attention has focused on the role of the noncustodial parent usually the father in the economic support and development of his children research has shown that lowincome fathers tend to face some of the same issues as do lowincome mothers such as being very likely to work intermittently andor in lowwage jobs thereby limiting their ability to help support their children these findings together with growing sentiment that noncustodial fathers are more likely to be dead broke than deadbeats have fostered more sympathetic view of noncustodial fathers beginning in 1996 congress has considered bills that would specifically authorize funding for programs designed to help noncustodial fathers meet both their financial and emotional responsibilities to their children also including components related to marriage promotion and effective parenting these programs are generally referred to as responsible fatherhood programs in recognition of the often negative longterm consequences associated with teenage pregnancy congress has provided funding for the prevention of teenage and outofwedlock pregnancies reducing nonmarital pregnancy especially among teenagers was an important focus of the 1996 welfare law in recent years funding has shifted toward abstinence education rather than comprehensive sexual education as the preferred way to reduce teenage pregnancy the 109th congress continued the debate on which approach is more effective the goals of welfare reform include reducing welfare dependency through work job preparation and marriage reducing outofwedlock pregnancies and promoting the formation and maintenance of twoparent families although the 1996 welfare reform law did reflect new interest in marriage for welfare families most of the policy changes implemented after the 1996 law focused almost exclusively on encouraging work and did not directly address the marriage goals the deficit reduction act specifically includes funding for programs exclusively designed to promote marriage among lowincome persons which is seen by its supporters as way to improve the economic wellbeing and development of children child support enforcement though much of the media focus on welfare reform in the mid1990s was on tanf and its work and time limit requirements the child support enforcement cse program has also been undergoing change14 the cse program began in 1975 as program to collect child support from the noncustodial parents of children on welfare if the child support collected on behalf of the welfare family was insufficient to lift the familys income above the states cash welfare eligibility limit the family received the welfare cash benefit and the child support payment was distributed to reimburse the state and federal government for cash welfare costs in proportion to their assistance to the family if however the welfare familys income including the child support payment exceeded the states welfare cash benefit standard the familys cash welfare benefits were ended and the family received the entire amount of child support collected on their behalf in addition to costrecovery efforts with regard to welfare families the cse program has always collected child 14 see crs report rs22380 child support enforcement program basics by carmen solomonfears crs12 support on behalf of nonwelfare families in an effort to prevent them from coming onto the welfare rolls over time the cse program has evolved from program whose primary focus was costrecovery to program that is focusing on service delivery in fy2005 total of 23 billion was collected in child support this is more than twice as much as fy2004 cash assistance with little less than half 45 collected on behalf of families with current or prior connection to the welfare system the 23 billion collected in fy2005 was nearly double prewelfare reform cse collections though the increase in child support collections shows some progress in getting noncustodial parents to help support their children collections totaled only 18 of the total obligations in support orders in the cse program according to an urban institute study on average child support constitutes 17 of family income for households that receive it for povertylevel children whose families do not receive tanf child support constitutes about 30 of family income the 1996 welfare reform law established several new enforcement collection mechanisms to obtain child support from noncustodial parents and created an array of database systems of wage and employment information to find parents delinquent in their payments the law also revised rules so as to pay more child support collected on behalf of former welfare families to the family the deficit reduction act provides financial incentives to states that send more child support collected on behalf of families on welfare to the family itself rather than retained as reimbursement for welfare costs under the new law the federal government will pay for share of support passedthrough to welfare families as long as that support does not reduce the familys welfare benefit specifically pl 109 171 allows states to pay up to 100 per month in child support collected on behalf of tanf or foster care family 200 per month to family with two or more children to the family and not require the state to pay the federal government the federal share of those payments the measure also gives states financing incentives to send to former welfare families the full amount of child support collected on their behalf ie both current support and pre and postwelfare arrearages including child support arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program in addition it revises some child support enforcement collection mechanisms and adds others the deficit reduction act includes provisions that 1 establish 25 annual user fee for individuals who have never been on tanf but receive cse services and who received at least 500 in any given year 2 reduce the cse federal matching rate for the laboratory costs associated with establishing paternity from 90 to 66 and 3 eliminate the federal match on cse incentive payments that states in compliance with federal law reinvest back into the cse program housepassed provision to gradually reduce from fy2007fy2010 the federal matching rate for child support program expenditures from its current level of 66 to 50 is not included in the final bill15 15 for more discussion of these provisions see crs report rs22377 child support continued crs13 responsible fatherhood initiatives enforcement of child support orders is only one dimension of current efforts to connect noncustodial parents usually fathers with their children in the hopes of improving the lives of children living in singleparent families government and public and private organizations support programs to promote the financial and personal responsibility of noncustodial parents which have become known as responsible fatherhood programs research has recognized that lowincome noncustodial fathers have similar problems in the workforce as do single mothers low wages and intermittent employment some responsible fatherhood programs focus on employment skills in part to help noncustodial parents meet their child support obligations in addition responsible fatherhood programs generally teach variety of social skills including parenting education responsible decisionmaking conflict resolution coping with stress and appropriate disciplinary practices responsible fatherhood programs also usually provide peer support component some programs also include funding for media campaigns to advertise to the public the importance of emotional physical psychological and financial connections of fathers to their children the tanf block grant is one potential source of funding for responsible fatherhood initiatives moreover welfare reauthorization bills would have established categorical competitive grants ranging from 20 million to 76 million per year to community and faithbased organizations for responsible fatherhood initiatives16 the deficit reduction act includes competitive grants of 50 million per year for five years in competitive grants to states territories indian tribes and tribal organizations and public and nonprofit organizations including religious organizations for responsible fatherhood initiatives currently the federal office of child support enforcement ocse provides 15 million annually to fund responsible fatherhood demonstrations under section 1115 of the social security act projects are presently being funded in the

be given the unambiguous and exclusive message that sex outside of marriage is wrong or more comprehensive message that tells teenagers that they should not engage in sexual activities but if they do they should practice safe sex is very controversial advocates of the more comprehensive approach to sex education argue that todays youth need information and decisionmaking skills to make realistic and practical decisions about whether crs15 to engage in sexual activities they contend that such an approach allows young people to make informed decisions regarding abstinence gives them the information they need to set relationship limits and to resist peer pressure and also provides them with information on the use of contraceptives and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases advocates of the abstinence education approach argue that teenagers need to hear single unambiguous message that sex outside of marriage is wrong and harmful to their physical and emotional health they contend that youth can and should be empowered to say to sex they argue that supporting both abstinence and birth control is hypocritical and undermines the strength of an abstinenceonly message17 marriage promotion research indicates that children in families headed by both of their biological parents do better on an array of child development outcomes higher academic achievement lower teenage child bearing lower levels of delinquency etc than children living in singleparent families much of this is due to the lower incomes of children in singleparent families but the statistical association between family type and child outcomes holds even when considering families of equivalent incomes however in note of caution these better outcomes hold only when child lives with both of his or her biological parents they do not apply to stepchildren further there are concerns about promoting marriage when some relationships are violent additionally there is the caveat to interpreting social science research that correlation does not equal causation the actual cause of the difference in child outcomes could be differences in characteristics and behaviors some not observed for purposes of statistical study associated with married versus unmarried parents the administration is currently funding research to address the question of whether marriage promotion programs could achieve their goals hhs is currently conducting largescale research projects to evaluate the impact of marriage promotion actual findings regarding the impacts of these programs are several years away the deficit reduction act provides up to 100 million in funding for each of five years fy2006 through fy2010 for marriage promotion research and demonstration projects additionally
