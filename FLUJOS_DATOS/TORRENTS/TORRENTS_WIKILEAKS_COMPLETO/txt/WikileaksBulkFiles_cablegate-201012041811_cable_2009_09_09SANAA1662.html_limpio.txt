looms large but footprint is small cne901257 ref state 86584 b sanaa 1628 c sanaa 876 classified by ambassador stephen seche for reasons 14b and d 1 snf summary despite repeated royg accusations of tehrans material and financial support to the houthi rebels in saada and increasingly belligerent media exchanges between yemen and iran iranian influence in yemen has thus far been limited to informal religious ties between yemeni and iranian scholars and negligible iranian investment in the energy and development sectors while iran has good strategic reasons to involve itself in yemeni affairs including yemens proximity to saudi arabia and the presence of large zaydi shiite population the only visible iranian involvement remains the iranian medias proxy battle with saudi and yemeni outlets over support for the houthis significant gaps exist in posts knowledge of iranian activities in yemen due to the sensitivity of the subject and posts very limited access to events in saada post believes that while documented influence is limited irans strategic interests in yemen merit close monitoring in the future end summary iranroyg relations 2 snf after two highprofile iranian official visits to sanaa in early 2009 the formal bilateral relationship has rapidly deteriorated as result of renewed fighting in saada governorate iran maintains an embassy in sanaa headed by ambassador mahmoud zada according to datt sources iran is not providing any military training to the yemenis and there have been announced military sales between the two countries in recent years iranian speaker of parliament ali larijani visited yemen in may 2009 to discuss iranian investment in yemens energy and infrastructure sectors and the bilateral relationship during iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottakis june visit to sanaa his second in two years both nations maintained at least public appearance of normal bilateral cooperation mottaki told local media at the time iran is pursuing an honest and friendly approach towards yemen iran wants progress security and prosperity for yemen 3 snf with the august onset of the sixth war in saada however the royg has reverted to its previous position that iran is intent on meddling in yemens internal affairs ministry of foreign affairs mfa chief of protocol abdullah alradhi who spent over decade in tehran as student and diplomat including tour as yemens ambassador to iran echoed the nearunanimous attitude of royg officials when he told the dcm on august 23 that he believes iran wants strong political card to play in yemen similar to hizballah in lebanon he said that yemen tried to normalize the relationship with the visits of larijani and mottaki but yemen cannot accept iranian attempts to convert the yemeni zaydis to twelver shiism note the royg views zaydi shiites as less extremist and closer in practice to sunnis than the twelver shiism predominant in iran end note radhi also said that the iranians are still upset about yemens support for iraq during and since the first gulf war iran and the houthis 4 snf although the royg maintains that iran is providing material and financial support to the houthi rebels in saada little evidence has surfaced to date that supports this claim president saleh told general petraeus in july 26 meeting that the national security bureau nsb had dvd showing houthi rebels training with hizballah uniforms and tactics note in followup conversation nsb deputy director ammar saleh claimed knowledge of the dvd end note in an august 17 meeting saleh told senator mccain that iran was working against yemeni stability because it believed that weakened yemen would hurt the us and saudi arabia both traditional enemies of iran in the same meeting nsb director ali mohammed alansi claimed that the royg had arrested two separate networks of iranians in yemen on charges of espionage in connection with the houthis and that one of the accused admitted to providing 100000 every month to the houthis on behalf of the iranian sanaa 00001662 002 of 004 government ansi told deputy national security advisor john brennan on september 6 that the royg was unable to share the evidence from this case because it was still in the courts comment since the outbreak of hostilities in 2004 the royg has used many different arguments including the houthis alleged ties to iran and hezballah to attempt to convince the usg to declare the houthis foreign terrorist organization fto in 2008 the royg gave post dossier of information purporting to show ties between the houthis and iran post passed on the file to the interagency community in washington analysts agreed that the information did not proove iranian involvement in saada end note 5 snf royg spokesman hassan allawzi has repeated statements throughout the three weeks of fighting in saada accusing iran of supporting the houthi rebels on september 1 foreign minister abubakir alqirbi publicly warned iran that interference in the saada conflict would have negative impact on bilateral relations and that if such interference continued yemen could be forced to make hard decisions according to media reports qirbi also lodged an official complaint with the iranian embassy in sanaa detailing yemens displeasure with iranian support for the houthis director for external financial relations at the ministry of finance fouad alkohlani told poloff on august 19 that the houthis level of organizational sophistication and military successes against government forces indicate higher level of financial resources than the houthis could attain on their own he speculated that because of its strategic interest in gaining foothold near saudi arabia iran was likely the houthis financial backer the iranians for their part continue to deny any interference in saada on august 23 the iranian embassy in bahrain stated that iran had connections to events in yemen and supports any movement that works to unify the ranks of the yemeni people according to bahraini media the iranian embassy in sanaa repeated these statements on september 7 yemeni media reported 6 snf media reports on august 22 cited royg officials claiming to have uncovered six storehouses of houthiowned iranianmade weapons including machine guns shortrange rockets and ammunition near saada city in an august 25 meeting however ministry of defense chief of staff major general ahmed alashwal told the omc chief that limited number of weapons of iranian manufacture were found in the area but would not provide information on the quantity or type and avoided direct request from emboffs to view the weapons in june royg military contacts told the datt that relations between the two countries were strained because of irans support for the houthis and denied that the royg was either communicating or in cooperation with iranian ships conducting counterpiracy missions in the gulf of aden note grpo reporting confirms royg refusals to allow iranian vessels access to aden harbor reportedly over royg concern that iran was using eritrea to ship weapons to the houthis end note according to xxxxx however the houthis do not need to receive weapons from outside of yemen because they can easily capture or purchase them from the yemeni military xxxxx who communicates on daily basis with houthis and other saada residents agreed that the houthis weapons came from the yemeni military either through capture or abandonment on the battlefield or via blackmarket arms deals by corrupt military commanders and not from an external source such as iran 7 snf the general consensus among civil society is that iranian government influence in saada is minimal but the houthis might receive some financial support from iranian groups or individuals xxxxx who travels to saada frequently told poloff on august 26 that iran had not been involved historically in the conflict in saada but with changingdomestic circumstances in iran might have become involved in the latest round of fighting he addd however that he has knowledge of any iranian nationals in saada in recent years note the royg used to grant iranians living in yemen hajj visas to travel overland to mecca but stopped issuing the visas some time ago because the royg was uncomfortable about iranians traveling through saada into saudi arabia end note xxxxx speculated that iranian groups are likely giving sanaa 00001662 003 of 004 money to the houthis but he does not know to what extent with that money the houthis buy weapons from corrupt elements of the yemeni armed forces that sell weapons and munitions xxxxx alleged civil society actors however were also unable to provide any concrete evidence of the involvement of any iranian nationals in saada 8 snf to date irans most visible involvement in the sixth war in saada has been the iranian medias proxy battle with saudi and yemeni outlets over iranian support for the houthi rebels ref b continuing tradition that dates back to the earliest stages of the saada conflict the royg has accused iran of financially and materially supporting the houthi rebels for its part iran through state media outlets including englishlanguage press tv and arabiclanguage alalam tv has claimed that saudi arabia is directly involved in the military campaign against the houthis the saada conflict has thus become propaganda war between yemen eager to enlist the support of its sunni arab neighbors and the us and iran allegedly seeking to nurture shia proxy force on the arabian peninsula on august 24 iranian alalam tv quoted rebel leader yahya alhouthi as denying iranian support for the houthis iranian media have consistently shown video footage intended to embarrass the royg including images of alleged soldiers fleeing the fighting and houthis dancing on top of abandoned royg armored vehicles iran and the south 9 snf little evidence or even debate exists regarding irans role with the southern movement the southern secessionist movement which is formally secular organization that has among its ranks former sunni jihadists has to date established connections with either the houthis or iranxxxxx told poloff in may and july that the movement had repeatedly rejected offers of collaboration with the houthis xxxxx told poloff on september 6 that the movements leaders wanted to continue peacefully advocating for separation rather than affiliating themselves with the houthis or external actors willing to advocate violence such as iran some limited evidence on the other hand indicates that iran might be more willing partner with southerners fed up with the current regime according to datt contacts the royg asked the theniranian military attache to leave yemen in 2008 purportedly because he had attempted to make contact with separatists in the southern governorates he has not been replaced former yemeni ambassador to iran radhi said that the iranian ambassador in muscat had been instructed to study the south of yemen especially hadramout and shabwa governorates irans soft power in yemen 10 snf perceived iranian influence in other arenas is limited to informal religious ties between yemeni and iranian scholars and negligible iranian investment in the energy and development sectors despite yemens 40 zaydi shiite population religiouslybased interaction between yemen and the worlds largest shia country is limited perhaps because the form of shiism zaydis practice hews closer to sunni islam than the twelver shiism of iran ambassador radhi however told the dcm on august 23 that he believes there is lot of coordination on yemen between qom and najjaf with 4050 yemenis studying islam in najjaf and some nfi studying in qom as well note given that yemen has over 9 million zaydis it appears that the number of religious students studying in iraq and iran combined is very small end note 11 snf iranian direct investment in the yemeni economy is negligible according to local iranian businessmen xxxxx and xxxxx the only recent significant iranian commercial activity in yemen involves the roygs tortuous experience hiring the tehranbased parsian hv substations development company to build the substation of the marib 1 power plant ref c royg officials at all levels told econoff that the decision to hire the iranian firm was purely political rather than economic stemming from desire in 2005 to expand relations with iran the delays caused by the technical incompetence sanaa 00001662 004 of 004 of the iranian firm have resulted in hundreds of millions of us dollars in foregone savings from switching away from expensive diesel and towards natural gas in the power sector comment post believes iranian commercial activity will remain limited in yemen absent future politicallydriven bilateral trade missions end comment the iranian government funds two hospitals in sanaa that are among the better medical facilities in the capital the management of the hospitals is iranian but the staff is largely local comment 12 snf yemens formal relationship with iran is by all accounts relatively fragile and has continued to deteriorate in recent months since the start of the saada conflict in 2004 yemen has looked to pin the houthis strength and resilience in fighting the royg on the iranians despite yemens seemingly heartfelt concerns that iran is backing the houthi rebels and the roygs desire to convince its powerful friends the us and saudi arabia of irans nefarious intentions in yemen it has to date been unable to produce any concrete evidence of what it says is widescale meddling it is posts firm belief that if yemen had any concrete evidence that the houthis had connections to either hizballah or iran it would have produced it immediately the lack of such evidence likely indicates that the royg lacks any real proof of such links on the other hand iran has clear strategic interests in gaining foothold in yemen saada and developing proxy ally in the houthis similar to hizballah in lebanon post believes that while it is worth keeping an eye on iranian activities in yemen tehrans reach to date is limited end comment seche
