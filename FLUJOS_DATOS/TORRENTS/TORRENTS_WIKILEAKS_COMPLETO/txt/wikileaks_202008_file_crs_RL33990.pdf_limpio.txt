divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33990wildfire funding summary the forest service fs and the bureau of land management blm are responsible for protecting most federal lands from wildfire s wildfire appropriations nearly doubled in fy2001 following severe fire season in the summer of 2000 and have remained at substantia lly higher levels the acr burned annually have also increased over the past 50 years with the highest in three of the past four years many in congress are concerned that wildfi re costs are spiraling upward without any discernable decline in the damage cause d with emergency supplemental funding fy2008 wildfire funding was 446 billion more than in any previous year for fy2009 the president requested 20 less money than was ppropriated in fy2008 the vast majority about 95 of federa l wildfire funds are spent to protect federal lands for fire preparedness fo r equipment baseline personnel and training wildfire suppre ssion operations including em ergency funding postfire rehabilitation to help sites recover after the wildfire and fuel reduction to reduce wildfire damages by reducin g fuel levels in addition since fy2001 fs wildfire appropriations have in cluded funds for state fire assi stance volunteer fire assistance and forest health management to supplem ent other funds for these three programs economic action and community assistance fire research and fire facilities four issues have dominated wildfire f unding debates one is funding for fuel reduction funding and acres treated ro roughly doubling between fy2000 and fy2003 and have stabilized since cu rrently about 3 million acres are treated annually however 75 million acr of federal land are at high risk and another 156 million acres are at moderate risk of eco logical damage from catastrophic wildfire since many ecosystems need to be treated on 1035 year cycle depending on the ecosystem current treatment rates are insufficient to address the problem another issue is the federal role in protecting nonfederal lands communities and private structures in 1994 federal fi refighting resources were apparently used to protect private residences at cost to fe deral lands and resources in one severe fire federal policy review recommended increased state and local efforts to match their responsibilities but federal pr ograms to protect nonfederal lands have also expanded reducing incentives for local participation in fire protection third issue is postfire rehabilitation agency regulations and legislation in the 109th congress focused on expediting such activities but opponents expressed concerns that this would re strict environmental review of and public involvement in salvage logging decisions leading to greater environmental damage finally high wildfire suppression cost s are raising congressional concerns borrowing nonfire funds for fire suppressi on historically was not problem but is now affecting other agency programs numerous recent studies have recommended actions to try to control fi re suppression costs and the agencies have taken various steps but it is unclear whether these actions will be sufficient to control wildfire suppression costs pending gislation would alter the f unding structure to insulate other agency programs from high wildfire suppression costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33990contents background 1 funding levels 4 f d r l

national fire plan in 2000 to increase funding to protect federal state and private lands congress largely enacted this re quest the severe 2002 fire season led president bush to propose healthy forest s initiative to expedite fuel reduction on federal lands in 2003 congress enacted the healthy forests restoration act to expedite fuel reduction on fe deral lands and to authoriz other forest protection programs wildfire funding has continued at relatively high levels since 2000 and now constitutes substantial nd growing portion of land management agency budgets severe fire seasons seem to have become more common see table 1 and agency authorities to borrow other unobligated f unds for emergency fi refighting efforts appear to be impinging on other land management activities the high and rising costs of firefighting are gaining attention the senate energy and natural resources committee held hearing on fire s uppression cost containment early in the 110th congress for fy2009 the president has re quested 20 decrease in wildfire funds including supplemental appropriations with increased suppression funding and decreased funding for all other wildfire accounts this report briefly describes the three cat egories of federal pr ograms for wildfire protection one is to protect the federal lands managed by the us department of agriculture forest service fs and by th us department of the interior whose wildfire programs are coordinated by th bureau of land management blm second category assists stat and local governments nd communities in protecting nonfederal lands these programs are used to reduce wildland fuels to otherwise prepare for fire control to contain and c ontrol wildfires and to respond after severe wildfires have burned thir d category of federal progra ms supports fire research fire facilities and improvements in forest health the last section of this report discusses the impact of high and rising wildfire costs background the fs was created in 1905 with the rger of the usda bureau of forestry which conducted research nd provided technical assistan ce to states and private landowners and the forestry division of the general land office predecessor of the blm an early focus was on halting wildfires in the national forests following several large fires that bur ned nearly 5 million acres in montana and idaho in 1910 efforts to control wildfires were founded on belief that fa st aggressive control was efficient because fires th at were stopped while small would not become the large destructive conflagrations that are so expensive to control in 1926 the agency developed its 10acre policy that all wildfires shoul d be controlled before theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33990crs2 1 see julie k gorte and ross w gorte application of economic techniques to fire management status review and evaluation gen tech rept int53 ogden ut usda forest service june 1979reached 10 acres in size clearly aimed at keeping wildfires small then in 1935 the fs added its 1000 am policy that for fires exceedin g 10 acres efforts should focus on control before the next burning period began at 1000 am1 under the 1000 am policy the goal in suppressing large fires is to gain control during the relatively cool and calm conditi ons of night and early morning rather than spending major efforts during the heat of the day table 1 acres burned

gaorced99233 washington dc august 1999 hereafter cited as gao cohesive strategy needed budget increases based on fs policies and subsequent study suggested that the fire control policies would increase expe nditures beyond efficient levels2 following the 1988 fires in yellowstone concerns were raised about unnaturally high fuel loads leading to catastrophic fires and spiralin g suppression costs congress established the national commission on w ildfire disasters whose 1994 report described situation of dangerously high fuel accumulations3 the summer of 1994 was another severe fire season leading to more calls for action to prevent future severe fire seasons in addition to the concerns about fuel loads concerns were voiced that federal firefighting resources on fire in washington in 1994 had been diverted from protecting fede ral lands and resources to protecting nearby private residences and communities4 the clinton administration directed review of federal fire policy and the agencies released the new federal wildland fire management policy program review final report in december 1995 the report recommended altering fe deral fire policy from priority for private property to equal priority for private property and federa l resources based on values at risk protecting human life is the first priority in firefighting the recommended change became effective after the report was accepted by the secretaries concerns about wildfire threats persis t in 1999 the general accounting office gao issued two reports recommending c ohesive wildfire prot ection strategy for the fs and combined strategy for the fs and blm to address certain firefighting weaknesses5 to address the severe 2000 fire season the clinton administration developed the national fire plan and supplemental budget request congress enacted this additional funding in the fy 2001 interior appropria tions act and has since largely maintained the higher funding see table 2 during the severe 2002 fire season the bush administration veloped the healthy forests initiative to expedite fuel reduction projects in prio rity areas through administrative and legislative changes some

for fighting wildfires appropriations for fire suppression and s upplemental contingenc or emergency funds have fluctuated widely over the pa st decade from less than 430 million in fy1999 to 250 billion in fy2008 for fy2009 the president requested 133 billion for fire suppression an increase of 1937 milli on 17 from fy2008 suppression funding but decrease of 117 billion 47 when supplemental funding is included as noted above the cr provided fy2009 funding at fy2008 levels excluding the emergency funding some of the variation results from fluctuations in the severity of the fire season in the preceding year particularly in supplemental emergency funding such fluc tuations have long been part of the agencies funding with total appropr iations in fy1997 double the fy1996 levels owing to severe season in the summer of 1996 see table 3 appropriations for fire suppression have risen steadily nd sharply for both agencies since fy2002 the fy2008 interior appropriations act pl 110161

betw een 200 and 250 million annually since fy2000 the fs generally receives fe w wildfire funds fo r site rehabilitation none prior to fy2001 and instead uses funds appropriated to other accounts such as watershed improvement and vegetation mana gement however the fs was appropriated 1417 million of w ildfire funds for site rehabilitation in fy2001 627 million in fy2002 and 1108 million in fy2008 including 1000 million in emergency supplemental funding these th ree years account for 89 of fs wildfire appropriations for site reha bilitation in the past decade for fy2009 the president

damages by wildfires the fs began its fuel management progra m in the 1960s by the late 1970s earlier agency policies of aggressive suppression of all wildfires had been modified in recognition of the enormous cost of the or ganization needed to achieve the goals of the 1000 am and 10acre policies and of the ecological benefits that can result from some fires these understandings have in particular led to an expanded prescribed burning program since 1990 recognition of unnaturally high fuel loads of dead trees dense understories of trees and ot her vegetation and nonnative sp ecies has spurred interest in fuel management activities attention and efforts have expanded with and following development of the national fire plan in 2000 table 6 shows acreage by ownership class of lands at low

situations it cant however provisions in the annual interior appropriations acts authorize the blm and the fs to borrow unobligated funds from other accounts for emergency firefighting this is in effect an openended reprogramming authority historically this borrowing authority was not significant problem prior to about 1990 the fs had several mandatory spending accounts funded from timber receipts with substantial running bala nces the knutsonvandenberg kv fund was particularly useful for borrowing the kv fund was created in 1930 to retain deposits from timber purchasers primarily to reforest the timber sale areas annual deposits were 150200 million with about threeyear lag between the deposits and reforestation expenditures leavin g running balance of about 500 million thus firefighting funds could be borrowe d from the kv fund and repaid later with supplemental or regular ppropriations without significant effect on the reforestation program the decline in timber sales has led to comparable decline in kv and other mandatory account balances and thus the forest service has had to turn elsewhere to borrow funds to pay for firefighting another reason why the borrowing author ity was not problem historically is that for fy1994fy2000 wildfire suppre ssion expenditures were only about 30 of agency discretionary appropriations 306 for the fs 290 for the blm leaving significant funds in other accounts to borrow from this is even more true for the blm since it can borrow from any interior department accounts not just blm accounts however since fy2001 w ildfire suppression expenditures have averaged 44 of agency discretionary appropriations 437 for the fs 442 for the blm and totaled 47 of agency di scretionary appropriations in fy2008 495 for the fs 426 for the blm thus ther are relatively fewer funds available to borrow and borrowing to pay for firefightin g is having relatively greater effect on those other accounts various interests ve increasingly expressed concerns about the effects of firefighting borrowing on the agencies abilities to implement other programs numerous organizations have examined wildfire suppression costs and made recommendations to the agencies for how to contain those costs16 these reportshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33990crs17 16 continued p 17 us dept of the interior and dept of agriculture federal wildland

15present three general conclusions 1 fair share of wildfire suppression be paid by state andor local governme nts 2 more better and betterfocused fuel reduction efforts and 3 better accountability for cost control several reports have noted that wildfire suppression co stshare agreements are inconsistent and inequitabl and that cost apporti onment and responsibilities among the various levels of govern ment are unclear this has led to increasing reliance by homeowners and local governments on federa l fire protection spite the relatively clear direction in the 1995 federal fire po licy review to increase local responsibility for wildfire protection and suppression for nonfederal lands and structures17 the reports note that significant local cost re sponsibility is necessary to give incentives to homeowners and local governments to take actions to protect themselves and that without such incentives federal costs will continue to escalate fuel reduction efforts as discussed above are commonly proposed as means of reducing wildfire suppression co sts however as shown in table 7 the annual fuel treatment acreage has stabilized at less than 3 million acres annually less than the amount needed to treat lands at high and moderate risk of ecological damage from wildfire see discussion above the proportion of fuel treatments in the wildlandurban interface wui has increased since fy2001 the first year for which such data area available from 37 45 for the fs 22 for the blm to about 60 from fy2003 to fy2006 73 for the fs 42 for the blm and 70 in fy2008 83 for the fs 47 for the blm nonetheless at the same hearing robin nazzaro of gao noted that the agencies still needed to18 develop cohesive strategy that iden tifies the options and associated funding to reduce fuels and address wildland fi re problems in 2005 and 2006 because the agencies had not yet developed such strategy we reiterated the need for cohesive strategy and broadened our recommendations focus to better address the interrelated nature of fuel reduc tion efforts and wildland fire response finally the reports also discussed th need for better cost control and accountability most have noted the inc onsistent cost tracking and the weak measures of the benefits of fi re suppression efforts gao noted19 the agencies need to establish clear goals strategies and performance measures to help contain wildland fire co sts although the agencies have taken certain steps to help contain wildland fire costs the effectiveness of these steps may be limited because agencies have not established clear cost

these goals or effective performance measures to track their progress the strategic issues panel noted that the high cost of large fires was the result of the unwillingness to take greater risks unwillingness to recognize that suppression techniques ar sometimes futile the free nature of wildland fire suppression funding and public and political expectations20 the panel then recommended better fire cost data and benefit cost measure as the core measure of suppression cost effectiveness21 another part of cost control and account ability is integration of wildfires and fire control efforts and eff ectiveness in land and resource planning fire planning and budgeting one aspect of this integrati on is maintaining local capacity for initial attack on new wildfires most of the repor ts assert that without that local capacity new fires could become conf lagrations if resources ar too focused on suppressing current conflagrations the administration has res ponded to some of these concerns in testimony on january 30 2007 under secretary of agricultu re mark rey noted the agencies have adopted appropriate ma nagement response for tactical decisions such that wildfire control efforts are related to values at risk22 in conjunction with this the agencies are to maintain their initial attack success the fs chief is to identify an individual to provide oversight on fires of

these actions will address concerns bout cost control and accountability legislation has been introduced to address the situation24 two senate and two house bills have been introduced to blish
