vote to terminate filibuster ie extended debate the appointments clause of the consti tution which provides that the president is to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate appoint judges does not impose supermajority requirement for senate confirmation critics of the senate filibuster argue that filibuster of judicial nomination is unconstitutional in that it effectively requires supermajority vote for confirmation although the appointments clause does not require such supermajority vote it has been argued that the senates constitutional power to determine the rules of its proceedings as well as historical practice provide the foundation for the filibuster the question of the constitutionality of the filibuster of judicial nomination turns on an assessment of whether the senates power to make rules governing its own proceedings is broad enough to apply the filibuster rule to nominations several factors have the effect of entrenching the filibuster ie making it possible to filibuster proposed amendment to the rules supporters and critics of the filibuster of judicial nominations disagree about the relative roles of the president and the senate in regard to judicial appointments about whether the senate has duty to dispose of the presidents judicial nominations in timely fashion and about whether simple majority of senators has constitutional right to proceed to vote on nomination the constitutionality of the filibuster might be challenged in court but it is uncertain whether such an action would be justiciable ie appropriate for judicial resolution standing and the political question doctrine would be the primary justiciability issues raised by court challenge to the filibuster rule note this report was

provision of the constitution expressly requires that the senate and the house act by majority vote in enacting legislation or in exercising their other constitutional powers there is provision specifying that majority of each house shall constitute quorum to do business 10 there are also few provisions dictating that the senate or house muster twothirds extraordinary majority to transact certain business of an exceptional nature11 although there is constitutional provision requiring that the senate act by majority vote in instances not governed by one of the provisions mandating an extraordinary majority the senate operates under majority rule to transact businessa majority of the senators voting quorum being presentwith the exceptions set forth in the constitution and the rules of the senate 12 9 see eg federalist 58 p 397 cooke ed wesleyan univ press 1961 madison responding to objections that the constitution should have required more than majority for quorum and in particular cases if not in all more than majority of quorum for decision asserted that such requirements would be inconsistent with majority rule which is the fundamental principle of free government id 22 p 13839 hamilton observed that equal suffrage among the states under the articles of confederation contradicts that fundamental maxim of republican government which requires that the sense of the majority should prevail one scholar leach house rule xxi and an argument against constitutional requirement for majority rule in congress 44 ucla l rev 1253126364 1997 has observed although the federalist provides compelling evidence that majo rity rule is to be the procedural norm it hardly follows that the framers intended majoritarian procedures to be the only method by which congresses could conduct themselves nor does it necessarily preclude future congresses from themselves deciding that certain issues should be the subject of supermajoritarian scrutiny for one despite the frustration the delegates d experienced with the supermajorities of the articles of confederation they resisted any temptation to explicitly prohibit them it is impossible to deny that the constitution is replete with violations of the fundamental principle of majority rule the most glaring exam ple is the united states senate which originally was not popularly elected and whose structure still allows fiftyone senators from the twentysix least populated states to defeat the will of the majority of the american people the framers had number of competing goals despite ample reasons and opportunities for imposing majoritarian requirement the framers remained silent on the subject while giving congress wide authority to make its own rules their intent can only be described as ambiguous 10 art i 5 cl 1 11 it requires vote of two thirds of the members present for the senate to convict an individual in an impeachment proceeding art i 3 cl 6 the senate or house may with the concurrence of two thirds expel member from the body art i 5 cl 2 vote of two thirds of each house is required to pass bill art i 7 cl 2 or joint resolution art i 7 cl 3 over presidential veto treaties must be approved by vote of twothirds of the senators present art ii 2 cl 2 it requires vote of twothirds of both houses to propose amendments to the constitution art v to remove the disability imposed on persons who have engaged in rebellion or insurrection requires vote of two thirds of each house amend xiv 3 and to determine that the president remains unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office requires two th irds vote of both houses amend xxv furthermore in the event that presidential election is decided in the house quorum is to consist of member or members from two thirds of the states amend xii likewise twothirds of the senate constitutes quorum for choosing vice president id 12 riddick s doc 10128 at 912 there is rule providing for consideration of

bodies is that when quorum is present the act of majority of the quorum is the act of the body except when there is specific constitutional limitation13 however the court has also found that the constitution history and judicial precedents do not require that majority prevail on all issues14 does the commitment of the framers to majority rule as general principle the fact that the senate usually operates pursuant to majority rule and the enumeration in the constitution of certain extraordinary majority voting requirements mean that any exception to majority rule other than the enumerated ones is unconstitutional is there any constitutional defense to be offered for senate filibuster g20g158g149g142g150g138g148g146g151g144g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g162g561 article i section 5 clause 2 of the constitution authorizes each house to determine the rules of its proceedings 15 the rulemaking power has been construed broadly by the courts16 it has been argued that the rulemaking power and historical practice are the foundation for the filibuster17 and that article i section 5 permits the senate to adopt procedures unless they conflict with constitutional prohibition supporters of the filibuster have contended that senate rules are not in conflict with the constitution because the rules require 60 votes to end debate on nomination not to confirm nominee 18 and that therefore the senate rules are not unconstitutional because they are not at odds with the few constitutional provisions in which the framers specified particular type of majority

applies inter alia to amendments to the senate rules vote of three fifths of the entire senate is usually required to invoke cloture vote of two thirds of the senators present and voting is required to invoke cloture on measure or motion to amend the senate rules second senate rule v par 2 provides that the rules of the senate shall continue from one congress to the next congress unless they are ch anged as provided in these rules and third because the senate is continuing body 21 its rules are not newly adopted with each new session of congress22 because the cloture rule may be applied to debate on proposal to change the filibuster rule it has been argued that the filibuster rule unconstitutionally interferes with the right of majority to exercise the constitutional rulemaking authority23 by majority vote24 however supporters of the filibuster have contended that there is constitutional directive against entrenchment25 and that the reference to each house in the rulemaking clause article i section 5 authorizing each house to determine the rules of its proceedings means the house and senate separately not the congress and does not mean that one session of the senate is barred from binding the next session 26 the entrenchment issue has given rise to suggested scenario under which simple majority might vote in favor of an amendment to the filibuster rule point of order might be raised asserting that majority vote is sufficient to cut off debate on the amendment and to pass it because the twothirds requirement is unconstitutional the matter would be referred by the vice 19 see judiciary committee hearing supra footnote 1testimony of dean douglas kmiec cf id testimony of professor steven calabresi 20 entrenchment has been defined as the enactment of either

section 5 clau 2 is textual commitment of authority to each house to make and interpret its own rules of proceedings69 notwithstanding this textual commitment the political question doctrine will not preclude judicial review where there is constitutional limitation imposed on the exercise of the authority at issue by the political branch70 it might be argued that the political question doctrine bars judicial review of the constitutionality of the filibuster rule because the rulemaking clause permits the senate to make its own rules and the constitution does not expressly limit debate71 on the other hand it might be argued that the political question doctrine does not preclude judicial review because the exercise of the rulemaking power is restricted since the entrenchment of the
