frequently asked questions regarding recess appointments it will be updated as events warrant what is the purpose of recess appointment the constitution states that the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate by granting commissions wh ich shall expire at the end of their next session article 2 section 2 clause 3 the records of debate at the constitutional convention and the federalist pa pers provide little evidence of the framers intentions in the recess appointment clause opinions by later attorneys general however suggested that the clause was meant to allow the president to maintain the continuity of administrative government through the tem porary filling of offices during periods when the senate was not in sessi on at which time his nominees could not be considered or confirmed1 this interpretation was bolstered by the fact that both houses of congress had relatively short sessions nd long recesses between sessi ons during the early years of the republic in fact until the beginning of the 20th century congress was on average in session less than half the year throughout the history of the republic presidents have also sometimes used the recess appointment power for political r easons for example recess appointments enable the president to temporarily install an appointee who probably would not be confir med by the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21308crs2 2 for more see crs report rl33310 recess appointments made by president george w bush january 20 2001january 31 2008 by henry b hogue and maureen

recess appointment last how long must the senate be in recess before president may make recess appointment the constitution does not specify the length of time that the senate must be in recess befo re the president may make recess appointment over the last century as shorter recesses have b ecome more commonplace the department of justice has offered differing views on this issue most recently in 1993 justice department brief implied that the presiden t may make recess appointment during recess of more than three days9 on at least three occasions the senate has used procedural tools to prevent the occurrence of recess of more than three days for the stated purpose of preventing such appointme nts the 2007 thanksgiving holiday period10 the period between the first and second sessions of the 110th congress11 and the 2008 presidents day holiday period12 in each of these cases the senate met in pro forma sessions during which busine ss was to be conducted every three or four days over the course of what otherwise would have been longer senate recess the president made recess appointments during these periods although president theodore roosevelt once made recess appointments during an intersession recess of less than one day the shortest r ecess during which appointments have been made during the past 20 years wa s 9 days appointment s made during short recesses less than 30 days have sometimes aroused contr oversy and they may involve political cost for the president controversy has been particularly acute in instances when senators perceived that the presiden t was using the recess appointment process to circumvent the confirmation process for nominee who was opposed in the senate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21308crs4 13 for further discussion of this controvers and list of related opinions see crs report rl33009 recess appointments legal overview by tj halstead 14 compare staebler v carter 464 f supp 585 1979 and wilkinson v lsc 865 f supp 891 1994 15 see mackie v clinton 827 f supp 56 1993what constitutes vacancy historically questions have arisen about the meaning of the constitutional phrase vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate does happen mean exist or occur the first meaning would allow the president to make recess ppointments to any position that became vacant prior to the recess and continued to be vacant during th recess as well as positions that became vacant during the recess the second mean ing would allow recess appointments only to positions that became vacant during the recess although this question was source of controversy in the early 19th century attorneys general and courts have now long supported the first broader interpretation of the phrase13 second question regarding the meaning of vacancies arises in connection with recess appointments to fixed term positions such as those often associated with regulatory boards and commissions in orde r to promote continuity of operations congress has often included hol dover provisions in the statutory language creating such positions the question then arises whether or not position is vacant for the purposes of recess appointment if an individual is continuing to serve unde r holdover provision past the end of his or her term the courts have varied in their rulings on this matter and it has not been settled definitively by an appellate court based on decisions to date however the answer appears to hi nge on the specific language of the holdover provision for example if the langua ge is mandatory the officeholder shall continue to serve after the expiration of his term rather than permissive may continue to serve the position has been seen by the courts as not vacant and therefore not available for recess appointment14 when the provision includes specific time limit for the holdover such as one year the position has also been seen as not vacant15 how long does recess ppointment last recess appointment expires at the end of the senates ne xt session or when an indivi dual either the recess appointee or someone else is nominat ed confirmed and permanently appointed to the position whichever occurs first in practice this means that recess appointment could last for almost two years if the president makes recess appointment between sessions of the same or successive cong resses that appointment will expi re at the end of the following session if he makes the ppointment during recess in the middle of session that appointment also will expire at the end of th following session in this case the duration of the appointment will include the rest of the session in progress plus the full length of the session that follows comparison of two recess appointments during the 108th congress illustrates the difference in recess appointme nt duration that results fro m the timing of appointments during the recess between the first and second sessions president george w bush appointed charles w pickering to an app eals court judgeship several weeks later during the first recess of the second session president bush appointed william h pryor to judgeship on another appeals court pi ckerings appointment expired after less thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21308crs5 16 pryor was subsequently confirmed by the senate and appointed to the position permanently 17 congress placed limits on payments to recess appointees as far back as 1863 the current provisions date from 1940 ch 580 54 stat 751 5 usc 56 revised and recodified at 5 usc 5503 by pl 89554 80 stat 475 for legal hist ory and overview of recess appointments see crs report rl33009 recess appointments legal overview by tj halstead11 months at the end of the second sessi on pryors recess appointment would have expired after approximately 22 months at the end of the first session of the 109th congress16 although the pickering and pryor recess appointments were only several weeks apart pryor could have served nearly twice as long because his appointment was made during an intrasession recess must recess appointee be nomi nated to the position as well the president is not required to nominate the r ecess appointee to the appointed position the president will sometimes use recess appointment to f ill position while different nominee to the same position is going through the senate confirmati on process under certain conditions however provision of w may prevent recess appointee from being paid from the treasury if he or she has not been nominated to the position see below are there any legal constraints on the presidents recess ppointment power what is the difference between the authority and pay of confirmed appointee and those of recess appointee confirmed appointee and recess appointee have the same legal author ity and receive the same rate of pay however two provisions of law may unde r certain circumstan ces prevent recess appointee from being paid see below re there any legal constraints on the presidents recess ppointment power are there any legal constraints on the presidents recess appointment power there is qualification on the presidents power to fill up all vacancies in the constitutional provision neither is there statutory constraint on this power there are however two provisions of law that may prevent recess appointee from being paid under 5 usc 5503a if the position to which the president makes recess appointment became vacant while the senate was in session the recess appointee may not be paid from the treas ury until he or she is confirmed by the senate the salary prohibition does not apply if 1 the vacancy arose within 30 days of the end of the session 2 nomination for the office other than the nomination of someone given recess appoin tment during the preceding recess was pending when the senate recessed or 3 nomin ation was rejected within 30 da ys of the end of the session and another individual was gi ven the recess appointment recess appointment falling under any one of these three exceptions must be followed by nomination to the position not later than 40 days after the beginni ng of the next session of the senate17 for this reason when recess appoin tment is made the presiden t generally submits new nomination to the position even when an old nomination is pending in addition although recess appointee whose nomination to full term is subsequently rejected by the senate may continue to serve until the end of th recess appointment provision routinely included in an appropriations act may prev ent him or her from being paid after the rejection see below what happens if the nomination of recess appointee is rejectedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21308crs6 18 pl 110161 div d 709 19 5 usc 5503a2 20 15 op olc 93 1991 see also

by louis fisherwhat happens if the nomination of recess appointee is rejected rejection by the senate doe s not end the recess appointme nt however recurring provision of the appropriations act funding the department of the treasury and specified other departments and agencies may prevent an appointee from being paid after his or her rejection the provision reads hereafter part of any appropria tion contained in this or any other act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person18 similar provision has been part of th is annual funding activity for at least 50 years as practical matter nominations are rarely rejected by vote of the full senate can the president make successive recess appointments to the same position the president may make successive recess appointments of the same or different individual to position paymen t from the treasury to the appointee may be limited however under 5 usc 5503 as disc ussed above this s ection provides that if the position to which the president make s recess appointment fell vacant while the senate was in session the r ecess appointee may not be paid from the treasury until he or she is confirmed by the senate of the three exemptions to this pay prohibition the first and third would not apply here the second ex emption however provides that if at the end of the session nomination for the office other than the nomination of an individual appointed during the preceding recess of the nate was pending befo re the senate for its advice and consent the prohibition would not apply19 the clause other than the nomination of an individual appointed during the pr eceding recess of the senate probably would prevent payment in the cas of most successive recess appointments this interpretation has been supported by the department of justice which stated in 1991 although its language is far from clear section 5503a has been interpreted as prohibiting the payment of compensa tion to successive recess appointees20 can recess appointment be used to fill vacancy on the federal bench

have been only thr ee recess appointments to fill article iii judgeships president william j clinton r ecess appointed roger l gregory to the fourth circuit on decembe r 27 2000 step that met some
