library of congress performance management and budgeting in the federal government brief history and recent developments summary the government performance and results act of 1993 pl 10362 known as gpra or the results act sought to promote greater efficiency effectiveness and accountability in federal spending by establishing new framework for performance management and budgeting in federal agencies gpra represents the latest in series of initiatives in the last 55 years attempting to link budget levels with expected results so that spending decisions can be better aligned with anticipated performance an approach commonly referred to as performance budgeting on april 9 2001 president bush transmitted his budget for fy2002 in which various steps to strengthen the linking of budget and management decisions to performance were endorsed this was followed in august by the presidents management agenda for improving performance one of five governmentwide initiatives identified was budget and performance integration on february 4 2002 president bush transmitted his budget for fy2003 which introduced management scorecard to measure agency progress on the initiatives the fy2003 budget also contained initial efforts at performance analysis of over 100 programs that were used to inform funding decisions constituting the first time presidents budget submission attempted formally to link budget requests with program performance new program assessment rating tool part was developed in 2002 and used by agency program managers and omb staff to evaluate over 200 programs during the course of formulating the fy2004 budget the part reviews have continued and expanded covering 40 of programs in the fy2005 budget and 60 of programs in the presidents fy2006 budget submission in congress interest continues in monitoring the part process as well as in the administrations budget and performance integration initiative and ongoing implementation of gpra in the 108th congress hr 3826 to provide statutory mandate for partlike reviews was reported favorably by the government reform committee and similar measure hr 185 has been approved by the committee in the 109th congress the extent to which performance information will influence budget deliberations in congress remains to be seen adopting performance budgeting will not remove controversy from the budget process since budgeting entails the allocation of limited resources among competing priorities performance information may make positive contribution to the federal budget debate but performance

management and budgeting in the federal government brief history and recent developments introduction the government performance and results act of 1993 pl 10362 107 stat 285 known as gpra or the results act sought to promote greater efficiency effectiveness and accountability in federal spending by establishing new framework for performance management and budgeting in federal agencies gpra establishes three types of ongoing planning evaluation and reporting requirements for executive branch agencies strategic plans covering six years but to be revised at least every three years annual performance plans and annual reports on program performance in complying with gpra agencies must set goals devise performance measures and then assess results achieved1 gpra represents the latest in series of initiatives undertaken during the past 50 years attempting to link budget levels with expected results so that spending decisions can be better aligned with anticipated performance this general perspective is commonly referred to as performance budgeting and is intended to be viewed as an evolving rather than static approach2 recent definitional effort suggests performance budget is an integrated annual performance plan and annual budget that shows the relationship between program funding levels and expected results it indicates that goal or set of goals should be achieved at given level of spending3 past attempts in the aftermath of world war ii the first hoover commission charged with promoting economy efficiency and improved services in the executive branch included among its many recommendations call for performance budgeting in the 1 for further background see crs report rs20257 government performance and results act brief history and implementation activities by genevieve knezo 2 this conception of performance budgeting is further discussed in general accounting office report on the subject the brief review here of past efforts relies heavily on that

planningprogrammingbudgetingsystem ppbs was introduced in the defense department and subsequently mandated governmentwide by president johnson ppbs attempted to integrate planning and budgeting functions through modern systems analysis and costbenefit analysis to review alternatives costs and consequences in 1973 president nixon initiated management by objectives primarily management improvement effort seeking to hold agency managers responsible for achieving stipulated outcomes and linking the agreedupon objectives to the agencys budget request still another reform effort followed in 1977 when president carter brought zero base budgeting zbb to the federal government with zbb agencies were to prepare series of decision packages to reflect alternative funding levels the intent was to link directly the expected program results with the level of spending experiences with gpra during the clinton administration successful implementation of gpra requires direct linkages between an agencys goals and objectives and its budget justification in its annual performance plan each agency is to align performance objectives with the program activity structure contained in the presidents budget the law also called for performance budgeting pilots to provide information on the direct relationship between proposed program spending and expected program results and the anticipated effects of varying spending levels on results in august 1999 two years behind the original gpra schedule5 the office of management and budget omb formally designated five projects to serve as performance budgeting pilots6 shortly before the end of the clinton administration in january 2001 then omb director jacob lew transmitted gprarequired report to congress which sought to examine governmentwide implementation of gpra from 19972000 to report on the results of the performance budgeting pilots and to address the need for any statutory changes in the law the report concluded over time measures will improve and better information will become available however these improvements do not require or depend on statutory changes therefore omb would not recommend legislative changes some examples of difficulties encountered in the pilots and identified by omb in the january 2001 report included the following 4 formally known as the commission on the organization of the executive branch the commission was established in 1947 61 stat 246 5 in may 1997 omb announced delay in the start of the performance budgeting pilots so as to allow agencies to concentrate on the more immediate task of developing their performance plans 6 the projects and agencies represented included military recruitment programs department of defense food and drug administration health and human services severely distressed housing programs housing and urban development diplomatic security programs state and continuing disability reviews social security administration crs3 budgeting is often based on the structure of funding requests to the appropriations committees and the structure does not always correspond to performance goals in many instances measuring the effects of marginal annual budget changes on performance is not precise or meaningful as general matter we are working to move from our almost total reliance on output measures to outcomes however it is much more difficult to associate specific resource levels with outcomes particularly over short periods of time the ability to establish clear linkages between program outcomes and funding levels varies depending on the nature of the program and the number of relevant external factors delays in collecting data on programs sometimes because of necessary reliance on program partners for data collection present challenge to synchronization of budget and performance data7 despite such difficulties and the continuing need for improvements in performance measurement it is well to keep in mind that gpra differs in important respects from past efforts at performance management and budgeting previous formulations such as ppbs and zbb were executive branch initiatives in contrast gpra has statutory base with its requirements set in law unlike past efforts which generally lacked congressional linkages gpra provides for mandatory consultation with congress and the linking of management planning and budget preparation processes evidence of growing congressional involvement with gpra during the clinton administration was suggested by crs study8 which identified and analyzed provisions in public laws and committee reports from the 106th congress 1999 2000 relating to gpra and its implementation comparisons to similar provisions in the 104th and 105th congresses were also noted9 the research identified 42 public laws from the 106th congress containing statutory language relating to gpra and performance measurement two of these laws were omnibus measures containing gpraassociated provisions from 10 separate bills arguably better counted as 10 items rather than two for total of 50 enacted measures from the 106th congress 7 executive office of the president office of management and budget report to the honorable j dennis hastert from jacob j lew jan 18 2001 np 8 see crs report rl31678 government performance and results act overview of associated provisions in the 106th congress by virginia mcmurtry 9 online databases were used to identify language of potential interest in committee reports and in the public laws from the 106th congress the resulting electronic files were examined and then pruned with the remaining relevant excerpts captured for further analysis it should be noted that this approach covered specific citations to gpra as well as provisions that are or might be deemed associated with gpra such as performance measures and strategic plans the study sought to review ways in which congress and its committees engage in oversight of gpra and more generally monitor its implementation in respective agencies crs4 with gprarelated provisions previous crs studies identified 14 public laws with performancerelated provisions enacted during the 104th congress and 28 in the 105th in addition to statutes with gpraassociated provisions search of committee reports identified 24 additional public laws from the 106th congress that contained gpraassociated passages in accompanying reports compared with 17 laws so identified in the 105th thus total of 74 laws enacted in the 106th congress were determined to have gprarelevant provisions in statutory language or in committee report language compared with total of 45 public laws from the 105th congress with gprarelevant provisions in statute or accompanying reports10 bush administration activity and the 107th congress on april 9 2001 president bush transmitted his budget for fy2002 in which various steps to strengthen the linking of budget and management decisions to performance were endorsed11 on july 11

followed in august by the presidents management agenda for improving performance one of five governmentwide initiatives identified was budget and performance integration13 on november 1 2001 two proposals for management reform previously developed by omb were introduced in the 107th congress as s 1612 managerial flexibility act and s 1613 freedom to manage act14 title ii of s 1612 budgeting and managing for results reflected the performanceoriented perspective of gpra by seeking to link total cost of resources used with results specifically it sought to charge to the budgets of each federal agency the full accruing costs for retirement systems and retiree health benefits without however making any changes in benefits provided or employee contributions on march 19 2002 hearing was

2003 crs6 in statement submitted for the record of the september hearing senator fred thompson conveyed some thoughts on the future of gpra observing we still have long way to go in implementing the results act and in making the federal government more resultsoriented and performancebased we are at the point after all these years of implementing the results act where we need to start using performance information to make decisions or we might as well give up on the act22 senator thompson then voiced some optimism regarding the future of gpra noting that he was encouraged by the presidents unprecedented interest in and the office of management and budgets new focus on integrating performance review with budget decisions in similar vein representative stephen horn chairman of the subcommittee on government efficiency financial management and intergovernmental relations observed in his opening statement that many agencies have made significant progress in using their gpra plans and reports to measure their performance however he said the connection between performance results and funding decisions has been lacking and until decision makers firmly establish that linkage the results act will remain largely paper exercise fortunately the current administration is intent on establishing this link representative deborah pryce chairman of the rules subcommittee on the legislative and budget process likewise noted that she was encouraged by recent efforts to establish more meaningful link between gpra and the budget process and concluded her opening statement by saying that as government performance rating tools and measures become more and more reliable congress will be finally responsible for using and integrating this information into our budgetary and fiscal decisionmaking23 developments in the 108th and 109th congresses on february 3 2003 president bush transmitted his budget for fy2004 the budget and performance integration initiative strengthening the linkage between dollars spent and results achieved reflected two complementary approaches first about half of the agency submissions progressed toward performance budget format showing programs in relation to the strategic goals they are intended to achieve these early performance budget justifications reveal efforts to link full cost to program activities and to explain how program activities work together to achieve the agencys goals24 the other approach focuses on using performance information in the making of budget decisions in this regard the fy2004 budget

the budget fraud elimination act of 2003 contained relevant provisions in title iii budgeting and managing for results full funding for federal retiree costs suggesting language reminiscent of title ii of s 1612 107th congress as discussed above these provisions sought to charge to the budgets of each federal agency the full accruing costs for future obligations to federal retirees this ties in with performance budgeting by seeking to link total cost of resources used with results continuing concerns in 2004 report assessing gpra after decade of implementation gao concluded that the statutory requirements under gpra have established solid foundation of resultsoriented performance planning measurement and reporting in the federal government38 in addition gao said gpra had also begun to facilitate the linking of resources to results although significant implementation challenges remained gao reviewed thencurrent strategic plans and annual plans and reports for six selected agencies and noted general improvements over their initial efforts however gao indicated that the evaluation component continued to be major weakness in agency strategic plans while the subject was generally addressed gao said that the strategic plans lacked critical information required by gpra such as discussion of how evaluations were used to establish strategic goals or schedule of future evaluations39 as noted already bill to provide statutory mandate for partlike reviews was reported by house committee in the 108th congress and similar measure hr 185 in the 109th congress has been approved by the government reform committee supporters of assert that the bill would build on the gpra framework and is necessary to ensure the continuation of systematic program assessments in the future some criticism has been voiced however that part as currently formulated is not well integrated with gpra40 despite the emphasis placed on performance and budget integration as component of the presidents management agenda along with the preexisting framework of gpra tensions may remain between the traditional and reform approaches to federal budgeting the traditional perspective of incrementalism whereby budgetary decisions about funding levels and program priorities are typically driven by shifting political concerns and objectives with marginal adjustments to the prior years funding level arguably is contrary to the more 38 us general accounting office resultsoriented government gpra has established solid foundation for achieving greater results gao report gao0438

rationalist reform41 orientation of performance budgeting in which budgetary decisions are to be guided by assessment of performance measurement data and evaluation of program results the stipulations of omb circular a11 first required agencies to prepare performance budgets for fy2005 under ombs guidance the part reviews as well as information from other program performance measures increasingly are factored into budget decisions in the executive branch the adoption of performance budgeting however will not remove controversy from the budget process since budgeting entails the allocation of limited resources among competing priorities performance information may make positive contribution to the federal budget debate but performance budget will not eliminate the need for difficult political choices the extent to which performance information influences budget deliberations in congress remains to be seen anecdotal evidence suggested that as of mid2003 at least some senior appropriations committee staff were unfamiliar with the part reviews42 in november 2003 omb official robert shea designated owner of the budget and performance integration initiative acknowledged this situation noting another major challenge facing the initiative is getting congress to use performance information in its deliberations and as the basis for its decision making in an effort to facilitate mutual awareness between the branches omb arranged series of lunches on capitol hill to bring together select agency personnel with their authorizers and their appropriators major intent of these sessions according to mr shea was for agency officials to gain better understanding of the needs of congressional staff especially the need for information about the performance of programs congress funds and authorizes and the form such information should take43 nearly year later in an update on the initiative mr shea reiterated that getting congress to make more of its decisions based on performance generally and the part specifically remains priority for the bush administration for congress to pay more attention to performance he further advises congress and their staffs must be consulted on agency use of performance information in the budget requests and legislative proposals before you agency 41 for further discussion of rationalist reform as compared with incrementalism
