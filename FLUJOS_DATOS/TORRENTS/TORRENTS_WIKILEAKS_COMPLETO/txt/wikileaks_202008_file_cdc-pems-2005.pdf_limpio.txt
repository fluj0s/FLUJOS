policy requirements ta king due care and reasonable precautions when handling system data or using system resources and in the management and protection of system authentication contro ls passwords certificates etc when in doubt administrators are strongly encouraged to contact the pems service support center for assistance 14 expectation of privacy cdc or local agency administrators may periodically monitor both the system and user activities for purposes includ ing but not limited to troubleshooting performance assessment usage patterns in dications of attack or misuse and the investigation of complaint or suspected incident users are provided system access for the purpose of facilitating f ederal state local and agency public health missions only 15 penalties for noncompliance system administrators who do not comply with the prescribed rules of behavior are subject to penalties that can be im posed under existing policy and regulation including reprimands suspension of sys tem privileges suspension from duty termination and criminal prosecution 2 system administrator responsibilities 21 ethical conduct pems agency system administrators shou ld be held accountable for their use of the pems system and the data using system resources to copy release or view data without authorization is prohi bited altering data improperly or otherwise tampering with the system is prohibited system administrators have sensitive but unclassified sbu page 4 of 14 sensitive but unclassified sbu access to clientspecific data and are ther efore responsible for the protection of confidential information and must report any breaches 22 authentication management access to pems files and software must be restricted to authorized users system administrators will establish user accounts limiting activities within the system and terminating access when employees leave change jobs or breach agency policies users who share the same computer must ve separate logins and digital certificates 221 granting access the system administrator grants access to staff requiring us of pems software or data the steps in this process for cpems grantees are as follows application for sdn digital certificate include letter from agency refer to pems security summary this is done in writing through the users supervisor and should include description of the users duties related to pems once digital certificate is granted the system administrator then tablishes an account in the system for that user specifying in the system which permissions and levels of access the user will have which should only be those necessary to perform the duties required by the job this is called ro llbased access users are assigned user id and means of authenticating who they are such as password users of pems who have access to confidential dat or secured areas should sign binding nondisclosure agr eement before being given access to pems other trainings in the policy and procedures concerning security and confidentiality are also recommended 222 levels of access the system administrator is responsible for restricting access to various parts of pems these restrictions are based on t he roles of the user all users do not need access to all parts of the system access to the various parts of pems should be restricted based upon the role of t he user for example typical roles include data entry generating reports system administration and viewing information some people may need to read information about clients but not enter data others may need to analyze aggregated data but not view case specific information the system admini strator assigns the roles for users of pems please refer to chapter 2 sect ion 5 of the pems security summary for pems roles and access level table sensitive but unclassified sbu page 5 of 14 sensitive but unclassified sbu 223 terminating access the system administrator will modify or rminate users access as soon as it becomes known that the individual is changing duties within the agency or leaving the agency it shoul d be part of the jobtransition protocol of the agency to notify the pems system adm inistrator immediately of any change in employee status so that the proper actions can be taken to protect the system and its data 224 use of passwords passwords must be used to confirm the i dentity of user to access the system separate passwords may also be used to protect specific data sets or applications within the system for exam ple user may need to enter their individual password to get access to t he system but then may need to enter second different password in order to get access to information about certain set of clients the pems password poli cy is that the passwords should be at least 8 characters long contain mix of at least three of the four types of keyboard elements upper case letters lower case letters numerals and punctuation marks and can not be the i ndividuals name refer to chapter 2 section 4 of the pems security summary for password details suggestions are to use the first letters from phrase or abbreviations of series of words and intersperse or replace letters with asso ciated symbols or numerals in order to make the password easily remembered the grantee agency should establish policies for passwords that incorporat the pems minimum requirements above they then can also make more stringent password policies passwords should be required by the system to be changed per iodically at least every 90 days and staff should be trained not to divulge pa sswords the number of attempts to gain access to the pems system is limit ed locking the user out after three unsuccessful attempts to login to pems system administrators can reset passwords if users forget their password 225 proxies pems will have the ability to identify and assi gn proxies ie the ability to assign one persons permissions to someone else although multiple users can be granted proxies for an individual only one us er can log in at time as proxy user of another user only system administrators have permission to grant and delete proxy the system administrator should see that all users comply with the rules of proxy administration only users who have signed rules of behavior for pems agency users may be given proxy sensitive but unclassified sbu page 6 of 14 sensitive but unclassified sbu 23 information management and document handling at the local level data collection fo r pems may not only exist on the pems servers it may also be on data collection forms or counselor notes client files floppy disks cdroms personal digital assistants pdas or other information storage media since all these media ma contain confidential information the agency must develop policies and procedures for the use storage and disposal of data on each medium used to record or store pems data the computers desktop and laptop pdas servers and other electronic equipment used to collect enter copy store analyze or report pems data should be under the control of the grantee the use of equipment related to pems including internet connections ema il photocopiers facsimile machine and other equipment that might be used to copy transmit or process pems data should be regulated by written policie s and procedures the policies should require that computers have screensaver locks that automatically engage when the computer is not used for set time period and should require that personnel electronically lock their computers when t hey leave their desk in windows this is done by depressing the ctrl alt and delete keys simultaneously then depressing the enter key 231 storage the grantee agency should establish polic ies and procedures for outlining when it is appropriate to export pems data to storage media other than the pems system all media containi ng pems data whether paper or electronic must be stored under lock and key in secure area all storage media should be labeled any pems data that is exported to remo vable media such as floppy disks zip disks cdroms etc must be sanitized before the st orage media is reused removable media used for pems data should not be shared or used for other purposes removable media whether paper or electronic containing pems data should be stored in secured area in locked container cleaning crews maintenance personnel and other unaut horized personnel t hat are allowed access to secured areas must be adm itted only during working hours when authorized personnel are presen t escorted by designated staff or under other conditions where the data are protected by security measures specified in the written security policy encryption of data during storage is recommended 232 disposal many states have laws or regulations c oncerning how long client records must be stored and also when and how they must be destroyed agencies must develop policies and procedures that comply with these state regulati ons when client records are to be destroyed this should include not only the paper records but the electronic records as well it should be noted that deleting file or record does not actually remove the data from the system overwriting or reformatting sensitive but unclassified sbu page 7 of 14 sensitive but unclassified sbu may not suffice to sanitize file and make it longer ccessible special sanitization programs or physical des truction of the storage media may be required agencies must also be sure to sanitize or destroy hard drives of computers that are being dispos ed of or transferred to staff not authorized to use the pems system 233 release of data agencies must develop written policy and procedure for releasing client and deidentified data these policies should be periodica lly reviewed and modified to improve the protection of confidential information reporting to cdc reporting to cdc should be done according to the schedule specified in the pems guidance while data may be entered in the pems system at any time it is not repor ted to cdc until the appropriate files are submitted to cdc by the authoriz ed personnel of each grantee there should be policies and procedures developed to specify the data quality assurance process that should be implemented and the administrative approval process t hat should be followed prior to reportingsubmitting to cdc releasing data to partners data release agreements in order to assist other agencies in tracking referrals or other purposes agencies may enter into agreement s with other agencies to share limited information about specific c lients data sharing should be based upon written agreem ents and should be clearly spelled out to clients as to how their confident ial information will be treatedshared with other agency partners agencies must also develop policies and procedures that comply with state regulations releasing data to the public data release agreements only authorized staff members who have signed binding non disclosure agreement and have need to know should be allowed access to identifying data except under conditions specified in writing such as memoranda of agreement with other agencies and explained in assurances of confidentiality prov ided to clients however agencies should have policy and protocol fo r releasing deidentified data and aggregate data for use in analysis grant applications reporting to stakeholders administrative functions and other purposes this policy should specify what data may be rel eased in what form to whom the data may be released and who may approve the release of data sensitive but unclassified sbu page 8 of 14 sensitive but unclassified sbu 234 encryption agencies should develop policy for when data should be encrypted pems data is sensitive confidential informati on that may have legal implications for clients and should be protec ted from unauthorized acce ss pems data should always be encrypted during transmission nd often should be encrypted during storage such as during collection in t he field transmission of data to cdc through the secure data network sdn is made secure through the use of secure socket layer ssl to secure cdc database server the use of digital certificates to restrict access and identify users of the secure data network further secures access to the pems applicati on and pems data transmission however it is the responsibility of the grantee to assure security until the data is submitted to cdc this includes counseling and testing data using the readsoft scanning solution which is not encrypted by the scanning software but is encrypted in the process of transferring data to cdc in addition to being encrypted with ssl dur ing transit some information remains encrypted within the database visible only to the agency that entered it the system encrypts all sensitiv clientidentifying vari ables and includes in the online help an encryption indicator for each variable the online help also includes warning to users that informa tion entered in specific fields will not be encrypted the following is list of cli ent variables that will be encrypted in pems r20

yet transmitted eit her because it has not yet been entered in the system or because the data is not being stored on cdc servers dpems xpems must be backed up periodically by the grantee frequency of backup should depend upon how often the data changes and how significant those changes are but should be done based on fi xed schedule that is part of the normal maintenance of the system back up copies should be tested to make sure they are actually usable and stored under lock and key in secure area and separate copy of data kept at secu re offsite location if possible 24 system access and usage as system administrator you will revi ew all grantee accounts yearly to make sure they are appropriate and current as system administrator you agree to only access the system when authorized as system administrator you have the authority to create and manage all administrators for all of you directly funded agencies as system administrator you have t he ability to manage permissions to all modules and submodules both administra tive and nonadministrative for your users 241 portable equipment while the use of portable computers such as laptops and pdas has many advantages such as llowing direct input of data in the field or telecommuting it also creates additional security risks such as loss or th eft of the computer and its data in addition to unencrypted transmission of sensitive data grantees should establish policies regarding restricting dialup access to onl staff with absolute necessity for such access maintaining physi cal security of computers in the field such as removing diske ttes or removable hard drives and keeping them separate from the computer when not in use keeping all equipment locked up when not in use and working from hom removing pems data from secure office space is not recommend except for backup storage purposes if computers are used outside the office unauthorized access to the data should be prevented through using separate pa sswords for the operating system and the various data files encry ption of data files and sanitization of storage disks after the data has been transferred to t he main storage system digital certificates should be put on lapt ops or other portable equipment sensitive but unclassified sbu page 10 of 14 sensitive but unclassified sbu 242 physical security of equipment grantee system administrators should ma intain an inventor of all system hardware and software provided to system users for the execution of their duties equipment should be checked periodically to ensure that all equipment is accounted for equipment not assigned to an individual should be stored in secure area to prevent theft or vandalis m visitors or unauthorized personnel should not be allowed access to areas containing computers holding pems data without an escort all computer equipment should be protected by surge suppressors and emergency battery power to prevent data loss in case of fluctuations in the power supply all computers and other equipment used for pems should be housed or stored in secu re areas at all times and if possible physically attached to an immovable object 243 dialup access the grantee must develop pol icy regarding dialup or other external access to their work location computer system for the purposes of accessing pems or pems data since the pems system contains sensitive confidential information dialup or other access to the system from outside is strongly discouraged as this creates more opportunities for unauthorized in trusion into the system if external access is permitted it should be restrict ed to the fewest per sons possible and additional security measures should be taken to ensure identification and authentication to obtain access in addition to restricting access to as few as possible 244 locking workstations all users should lock their workstations when they are away from their desk if the computersworkstations have that c apability automatic screen saver locks should be set to engage whenever the system is not used for preset number of minutes suggestion is 15 minutes of inactivity it should require at least entry of the user id and password to unlock the system 245 disable browser password caching all pems users will be accessing the application through web browser ie internet explorer and should disable the ability of their web browser to cache save their passwords this will prohibit others who use your computer to have access to passwords and other personal fo rm information that the web browser has cached for you please refer to c hapter 2 section 4 of the pems security summary for directions on how users can disable browser password caching sensitive but unclassified sbu page 11 of 14 sensitive but unclassified sbu 25 incident reporting breach of confidentiality is any failure to follow confidentiality protocols whether or not information is actually released all suspected breaches of confidentiality or security eg possible viruses hackers password divulgence mislaying of diskettes shoul d be reported immediately to your security steward breaches of confidentiality must be imm ediately investigated by the security steward to determine causes and implement corrections sanctions for violations of confidentiality protocol s should be determined in writ ing as part of the agency policies and should be enforced 251 unauthorized intrusions any computer attached to the interne t such as pems system computer is subject to unauthorized intrusions ch as hackers computer viruses and worms in addition authorized users may attempt to access par ts of the system for which they do not have access authority grantees must ta ke all reasonable precautions to protect their system s from these types of unauthorized penetrations plan must be developed and implemen ted to prevent and if necessary recover from changes to the system caused by unauthorized penetrations of the computer system typical precautions include using effective passwords installing firewalls dpems and xpems and antivirus software making backup copies of software d pems and xpems saving data at regular intervals so that the system can be restored to previous state dpems and xpems and training staff in basic com puter security such as keeping passwords secret and not downloading mate rials from the in ternet or other unauthorized software onto computer s that have pems access 26 training and awareness personnel are as much part of data collection and reporting system as computer hardware and data collection forms people are usually the weakest link in any security system all per sonnel dealing with pems data should be trained on the policies and pr ocedures established by the agency on the legal aspects of the data collection and on the ethics of their res ponsibility to the clients they should also be aware of the penalties associated with breaches of confidentiality or security each user with access to pems data must receive training on confidentiality and security this training must be documented in the employees personnel file training should cover the state regulatio ns concerning confidentiality the basics of computer security the agencys c onfidentiality and security policies and procedures the roles and res ponsibilities of various us ers regarding protecting confidentiality and security contingency plan s for breaches of confidentiality or security common threats to confidentiality and security legal obligations under sensitive but unclassified
