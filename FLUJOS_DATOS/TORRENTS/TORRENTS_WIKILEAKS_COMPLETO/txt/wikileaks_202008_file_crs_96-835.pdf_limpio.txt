analyst in latin american affairs foreign affairs and national defense division summary the acrimony surrounding nicaraguas recent elections has raised new concerns for political conciliation and stability there nicaraguans voted for president the legislature and other offices on sunday october 20 1996 it was more than month later however before rightist arnoldo aleman was officially declared the winner of the presidential race rightist aleman mayor of managua from 19901995 defeated leftist daniel ortega head of the sandinista national liberation front fsln and president from 19851991 and 21 other candidates by wide margin after highly polarized race ortegas refusal to concede defeat and call for annulling the vote generated enormous political tension after the elections other concerns about the electoral process included the effectiveness and fairness of two different registration processes the distribution of voter identification cards and numerous mistakes on election day both domestic and international observers described the elections as flawed but fair background on nicaragua and usnicaraguan relations1 nicaragua was essentially ruled by the somoza family for over four decades 1936 1979 until dictator anastasio somoza debayle was ousted in july 1979 by coalition of forces led by the fsln guerrillas when the prosoviet sandinistas gained control of the government and pursued increasingly radical social policies including redistribution of land and wealth the opposition contras organized and financed by the united states launched an eight year war 19821990 against the sandinista government decade of social revolution and civil war left nicaragua impoverished and severely polarized nicaragua has an agriculturebased economy with population of about 44 million people httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96835crs2 in 1990 violeta chamorro heading broadranging coalition defeated ortega in internationally monitored democratic elections president chamorro pursued policy of national reconciliation ending the civil war and promoting coexistence with the sandinistas who despite their loss of the presidency still retained significant bases of power in the last two years of her term chamorros economic reform program stabilized the economy transforming it from staterun to free market system and spurring growth for the first time in decade nonetheless nicaragua remains one of the poorest countries in latin america nicaraguaus relations in the last few decades us policy toward nicaragua has been heatedly debated in the 1970s the controversy was primarily over how much assistance the united states should provide to the somoza dictatorship in the 1980s the controversy focused on whether the united states should provide aid to the contras attacking the sandinista government in the early 1990s the controversy centered on the extent to which the united states should support president chamorros national reconciliation policy which sought cooperative relations with the defeated sandinistas in the last couple of years congress has restricted us aid to nicaragua pushing for greater progress to be made in areas such as prominent human rights cases resolution of property claims and military and judicial reform many observers believe that us aid to nicaragua will face fewer obstacles from the us congress than if sandinistaled government were in place nonetheless both democratic and republican politicians have urged aleman to drop his plan to seek 500 million in foreign aid to pay off landowners whose land was confiscated by the sandinistas previous nicaraguan elections the 1996 elections were the third held since the 43year dictatorship of the somoza family was overthrown by the sandinista revolutionaries in 1979 although debate over electoral schedules and procedures began soon after the revolution political parties law was not passed until 1983 and an electoral law was not passed until mid1984 the first elections were held on november 4 1984 due in part to international pressure through the central american peace plan after five years of sandinista rule nicaragua was in turmoil the economy was in dire straits because of sandinista policies and the us economic boycott and the country was torn by civil war with usbacked contras fighting the sandinista government some opposition groups refused to file candidates and urged boycott of the elections these groups believed that fsln domination of the government and media made truly fair election impossible at that time and the reagan administra tion agreed nonetheless other foreign observers generally characterized those elections as fair fsln leader daniel ortega was elected president the second elections took place on february 25 1990 under the watchful eyes of the organization of american states oas the united nations and group headed by former us president jimmy carter despite less well organized campaign violeta chamorro resoundingly defeated the incumbent daniel ortega in what were generally considered the fairest elections in nicaraguan history the national opposition union she led was coalition of 14 parties ranging from conservative to communist to many nicaraguans her election represented chance to end nicaraguas civil conflict and revive the nations economyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96835crs3 2robelo millionaire banker was disqualified because he had acquired italian citizenship lacayo chamorros soninlaw and until recently presidency minister was disqualified because the constitution prohibits close relatives of the president from running for president the third disqualified centrist candidate was eden pastora former sandinista heroturnedopponent who had acquired costa rican citizenship while in exile there1996 elections the 1996 elections were seen by many as an important if shaky step in nicaraguas continuing transition to democratic state from its lengthy authoritarian past nicaraguans elected new president all 90 members of the national assembly the mayors of all 143 municipalities representatives to the central american parliament and all members of the regional councils of the two autonomous regions on the atlantic coast president aleman took office on january 10 1997 and will serve fiveyear term presidential race twentythree candidates were on the presidential ballot aleman former mayor of managua and leader of the conservative liberal constitutionalist party defeated ortega former president and leader of the fsln by margin of 51 to 378 the other 21 presidential candidates split the rest of the votes with none getting as much as 5 the winner needed at least 45 of the vote to avoid runoff election during the campaign the two leading candidates portrayed each other as polarizing force in nicaraguan politics ortega was painted as the revolutionary leftist whose government confiscated property pursued socialist policies instituted hated military draft and whose contentious relations with the united states brought about us support for the contras and civil war 19821990 and us trade embargo 19841990 aleman was portrayed as militant supporte r of the somoza dictatorship who would reverse the advances in agrarian reform made under the sandinistas and rule as an authoritarian in favor of the wealthy three centrist candidates were disqualified on july 5 two of whom alvaro robelo and antonio lacayo had placed third and fourth respectively in the polls2 their disqualification had the effect of polarizing the race into twoman contest with ortega on the left and aleman on the right many nicaraguans praised the electo ral tribunals disqualification process because constitutional law was obeyed rather than deals being struck among politicians as has been common in the past nonetheless many also predicted that the polarization of the process would lead to increased political tension after the elections instead of further national reconciliation which more centrist candidate might have promoted perhaps in response to such concerns or to capture the votes of the centrist candidates followers both aleman and ortega moderated their positions aleman an ardent antisandinista longer suggested that all property expropriated in the sandinista land reform initiatives would be returned he is however still talking about modifications to the current laws passed under both the ortega and the chamorro administrations to allow more land to be returned to past owners than is currently provided for his supporters point to his record of completing public works as mayor and contend that his conservative economic approach will attract the investment needed to reverse nicaraguas economic decline since his election aleman has called for an era of reconciliation and economic renewal in nicaraguahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96835crs4 ortega and the sandinistas especially softened their image and their rhetoric on the campaign trail ortegas running mate was juan manuel caldera wealthy conservative cattle rancher whose property was expropriated by the sandinista government hardline sandinista leaders such as tomas borge and ortegas brother humberto the former chief of the sandinista army were virtually unseen in the campaign assuring his audiences that the problems of the past sandinista government would not return ortega pledged to promote free market rather than socialist economy and to cultivate good relations with any us administration the sandinistas infamous anthem which sang of the yankee united states as the enemy of humanity was replaced by beethovens ode to joy ortega has said he respects the legality but not the legitimacy of the aleman government and will lead the sandinistas as an opposition force because nicaraguan law allots seats in the legislature to presidential candidates winning certain percentage of votes ortega will retain the seat in the national assembly which he garnered after losing the previous presidential election legislative race party gained an outright majority of the 93 seats in the unicameral national assembly alemans liberal alliance won 42 seats five short of majority followed by the sandinistas with 36 seats nine minor parties won one to three seats each in the new legislatures first session in january alemans choice ivan escobar was elected head of the assembly but only after members of alemans own party were thwarted in an attempt to ally themselves with the sandinistas to seize control of the assembly escobar will face the challenge of trying to push through the assembly controversial economic reforms that aleman is expected to propose the settlement of land disputes also promises to be controversial issue facing the new government with aleman pushing for more land to be returned to its previous owners and ortega whose current home was expropriated from alemans top advisor seeking to protect advances made in agrarian reform under the sandinista and chamorro governments procedural concerns regarding the elections 1 election day flaws serious procedural mistakes occurred on election day nationwide most polling places opened late and about 30 lacked adequate ballots and other materials in managua poll officials failed to appear at twothirds of the precincts and results from 204 precincts were disqualified because ballots or tally sheets had disappeared complaining of serious irregularities ortega refused to concede and called for new elections in two of nicaraguas 17 provinces although domestic and international observers also criticized the management of the elections they said the flaws did not represent fraud and that the elections were basically fair alemans 132 point lead was also sufficient to outweigh the significance of technical errors 2 registration process nicaraguas supreme electoral council consejo supremo electoral or cse carried out two different voter registration processes for the 1996 elections which created controversy new process in which voters applied for national identity card or cedula to be received months later took place in 117 municipalities in the pacific region including managua and the atlantic coast region the process used in previous elections known as ad hoc inscription in which voters immediately receive card good for voting but not for other purposes took place in 26 less populous municipalities in the central and northern regions of nicaragua because the ad hoc registration was to occur only over two weekends as stipulated by electoral lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96835crs5 many observers were concerned that the system discriminated against voters in those regions many of whom had supported the nicaraguan resistance or contras the cse said that because the identity card process was more timeconsuming complex and expensive it would be too difficult to complete in the more mountainous and isolated central regions before the elections the identity card process had already begun in the two coastal regions as part of an effort to update the countrys civil registry and was to be undertaken elsewhere after the elections the cse also argued that providing security was simpler for the more limited ad hoc process security is greater concern in the central and northern regions because kidnappings and attacks on government officials occur regularly there four cse officials were kidnapped in september 1995 candidate alemans entourag was attacked at gunpoint in january 1996 and 30 local election officials were taken hostage and one us agency for international development usaid observer was kidnapped in june 1996 during the voter registration drive with financial and technical support from the united states and international election support organizations the cse extended the ad hoc registration process one additional weekend in june throughout the affected area with fourth weekend in july in some areas the ad hoc registration process was generally seen as successful between 90 and 100 of the voting age population reportedly registered to vote and received their cards 3 distribution of voter identification cards the identity card process proved more problematic over 95 of the voting age population in the coastal regions were reported to have applied for national identity cards to be used for voting because of the complexity involved in processing these cards for the first time however 11 of nicaraguans on either coast who applied for them still did not have their cards or supplementary voting documents which were provided if identity cards were not ready the night before elections the cse authorized yet another document to give to voters whose official documents had not arrived the problem is especially serious on the atlantic coast according to the state department as of october 11 1996 33 of applicants in the northern and 30 in the southern autonomous regions still had not received identity cards or voting documents these areas are rural remote and in october which is in the rainy season even harder to get to than usual in the past these areas have tended to be antisandinista and informal charges were made that voting cards were being deliberately kept from those voters other observers maintained that the incomplete distribution of cards was logistical problem not deliberate political ploy but problem that nonetheless could have favored one party over another election observers many analysts saw the emergence of domestic election observation group as one of the most important developments of the 1996 elections in april 1996 wide range of civic groups and individuals created nicaraguas first nonpartisan election monitoring organization grupo civico etica transparencia 96 or civic group ethics and transparency 96 et after receiving training from various international democratization organizations the group monitored the voter registratio n process and had about 3000 domestic election observers on election day some 900 internation observers monitored the elections as well international organizations sending groups included the oas and the european parliament us observer groups included the carter center of emory univers ity the center forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96835crs6 democracy the international foundation for electoral systems ifes the international republican institute iri and the national democratic institute ndi us assistance the united states provided 9 million to support the 1996 nicaraguan elections most of it since january 1996 the assistance included 45 million for the cse to support election logistics including pollwatcher training and transportation 15 million for us election observer groups 12 million for oas election support and observation 10 million for the ad hoc registration process and 08 million for ongoing civic education programs
