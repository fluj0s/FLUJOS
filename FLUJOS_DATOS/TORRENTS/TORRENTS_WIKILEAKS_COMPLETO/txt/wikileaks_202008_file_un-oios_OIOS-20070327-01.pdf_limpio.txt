the jos training academy the ability of the academy t continue with its regional law enforcement training centre activities is also ques tioned if ecowas does not provide financial assistance to sustain the activities afte r the duration of the project in project rafr60 the sustainability of the trafficking in p ersons unit also depends on the future contributions financial and staffing from ecowas for which commitment exists project nirg50 had to suspend the prison component which was an important component of the project due to lack of funding the partnership in development branch pdb and the nigeria country office conig have already beg revising the current strategic programme framework spf that would address specif ic concerns such as future project ideas its fund raising strategy and projects susta inability and was submitted to the ex com it is to be completed in august 2007 partnerships the overlapping mandates between unodc agencies and other international organizations result in competition for funding and projects fundraising and operational efforts are not adequately coordinated and streamli ned with those of its partners that negatively affect unodcs ability to deliver techni cal assistance in nigeria project planning conig has limited expertise in key thematic areas nd with only one national project officer the office is not able to develop balance d programmeproject portfolio the spf should be revised to set the direction for future p roject ideas that are based on needs the likelihood of funding and available resources withi n conig since the project coordinators are in the midst of implementing their project acti vities they have limited time available to actively proceed on project ideas with the arrival of the new conig representative i t was agreed that this area of concerns will be addressed in the spf revision project implementation there is low absorption capacity of the recipient government that hinders timely implementation and inadequate local counterpart com mitment and participation projects should be designed to increase absorption capacity and government partnership based on realistic assessment and embedded in the programme project strategy and included in the spf conig projects paid local consultants rates that ra nged from 150 to 300 per day the rate of 300 is 30 per cent more than the highest rate f 228 as determined by undp apart from government officials local participants recei ved daily subsistence allowance dsa according to international rates which are some 60 per cent more than the undp rates in addition to dsa conig paid honorariums to particip ants this practice should not be allowed conig stated that that the operation management tea m of the country team in nigeria had established human resources networ k to harmonise all local human rights issues in nigeria in 2003 project niri24 gave funds to the ndlea to upgrade the jos training academy this later proved not to be good arrangement beca use the ndlea could not account for all items purchased since 2004 conig and undp procur ed for the ndlea but conig did not conduct physical verifications of the items pur chased and did not systematically verify inventories conig did not comply with unodcs policy regarding the ownership and transfer of assets to partners standard transfer agreement is in u in unodc but it was not used by conig project monitoring and evaluations with the exception of project ngas08 the narrativ reports of projects were not linked to financial reports and therefore not adequate for mo nitoring purposes in some instances projectcoordinators did not have access to financi reports all projects provide for final evaluation but final evaluation only is in most cases inadequate for projects with durations of two years or more interim evaluations provide the opportunity to discover and correct failures during implementation project ngas08 the projects budget of 273 million that represe nts almost 80 per cent of conigs total project portfolio oios found the accountability rrangements to be adequate at the date of the audit however considering the inherent risks within such large project especially those relating to financial accountability it was suggested that unodc assure that the project review and or evaluation team include unodc finance staff to review the accounts and supporting documents financial management and administration conig strengthened its control over petty cash fund s travel arrangements and vehicle usage as well as keeping of logbooks but oios views the working arrangements between undp and unodc as essential to ensure accountability pecially procurement processes banking arrangements and human resources management consi dering the results

to operational and financial management and assessed internal control systems in place also discussions with project personnel and counterparts were held as discussed in the next section oios also used risk self assessment furthermore the g eneral administration at unodc conig was also subjected to audit 3 iv assessment of internal control 12 oios assessed unodc conigs internal control enviro nment and determined its risks through selfassessment approach compleme nted by traditional audit on the basis of selfassessment survey containing 35 questions broken down into the five coso components answered by staff risk selfassessment by each project and finance and administration traditional audit work included review of available documentation analysis of applicable data testing of transaction s incurred within the period 2004 to 2006 and interviews with project staff an analysis of the findings of prior reviews evaluations investigations and audits 13 following these abovementioned exercises comments and areas that require attention from the management and staff of unodc conig are pr esented in the table below component comment and area for improvement office culture good teamwork and commitment and p ositive perception of unodc staff perceived their colleagues and management to be com petent and professional some questioned the fair and transparent treatment of in dividuals in the office and viewed personnel decisions not to be fair andor transpare nt some were not satisfied with the security arrangements while performing their tasks objectives and risks staff members are aware of programmeproject object ives and performance targets are realistic the policies and procedures in place ar generally adequate to support the achievement of objectives but risks are not system atically assessed main concern is funding and the high turnover of staff policies and procedures staff members view that the policies and procedures of the office support their functions they strongly felt that wrongdoers are not discovered and there are consequences some felt that supervisors do not mo nitor the application of rules and regulations in the office monitoring and evaluation the quality of outputsresults relative to programm objectives are measurable and supervisors measures performance some identified weaknesses in the monitoring tools to monitor activities of implementing partner s also that complaints and concerns of the partners are not followed up in t imely manner furthermore audits are not conducted at regular intervals project ev aluation reports are available some improvements are needed in project performance moni toring information and communication information systems and communication channels were viewed as adequate there was good interaction with management and sufficient inf ormation required to perform functions the staff strongly felt that there is n communication channel to communicate suspected improprieties 14 main areas for improvement were considered in the r isk assessment exercise and recommendations formulated to mitigate the risks an d address weaknesses there are however some concerns that need to be addressed by the partnership in development branch although they relate to perceptions that aff ect the work of unodc conig 15 some unodc conig staff questioned the fairness and transparency within the office and viewed personnel decisions not to be fai r andor transparent they strongly felt that wrongdoers are not discovered and there are consequences also that there is communication channel to communicate suspected impr oprieties recommendation head2right unodc partnership in development branch should req uest the human resources management service to develop n 4 action plan for unodc conig to address the followin g perceptionsconcerns in their office ii the view that personnel decisions are not fair andor transparent ii the feeling that wrongdoers are not discovered and ii the lack of communication channel to communi cate suspected improprieties rec 01 unodc agreed in principle with the recommendations these and other staffing issues will be addressed by the new unodc representative w ith the support of the pdb and hrms at headquarters it is understood that these i ssues will take time to address and that the action taken in this regard cannot all be set out in formal written action plan the perception from the survey conducted in novembe r 2006 may be linked to the tension caused by changes in management at that time in dc conig coupled with the anxiety which arose from negative media publication s in october and november 2006 in the past few months more transparent and open ma nagement style has been established with regular consultations with pdb and hrms oios will record this recommendation as implemented upon receipt of the satisfactory ac tion plan by unodc conig and unodc hrms in this matter v risk assessment findings and recommendations risk inventory and profile 16 the review of the risk registers submitted by the p rojects and finance and administration as well as the results of the audit work identified comprehensive list of risk categories and areas that require followup ac tion by unodc conig the identified risks are grouped in 6 categories ie mandate fulfilment partnerships project planning project implementation project r eporting and evaluation and financial management 17 oios assigned numerical values to each risk categor based on the impact and likelihood of the underlying risks based on these numerical values the risk categories were then plotted on graph with the xaxis repre senting likelihood and the yaxis representing impact conigs risk profile is as per the graph below 5 18 the plots on the graph representing the risk catego ries are just an approximation of the combined level risk in each risk category the fol lowing matrix shows the overall risk level in each risk category using highmediumlow rating risk category perceived level of risk mandate fulfilment high partnerships high project planning high project implementation medium project reporting and evaluation high financial management medium human resources management medium b mandate fulfilment 19 since 1999 donors mainly contributed towards crime projects with only one donor giving money for drug abuse projects contribution s from the nigerian government had also been limited and where contributions were made it was mainly in kind apart from project ngs08 support to the economic and financi crime commission efcc all projects face the risk of not being adequately fund ed 20 project niri24 upgrade of the jos training academ to regional law enforcement training centre requires further fundi ng totalling more than us 600000 to complete phase two also questioned is the ability of the centre to continue with its regional law enforcement training activities if the economic community of west african states ecowas does not provide financial assistan ce to sustain the activities after completion of the project 21 in project rafr60 the sustainability of the opera tional trafficking in persons 6 coordination unit within the legal department of th ecowas secretariat also depends on the future contributions financial and staffing from ecowas for which commitment exists project nirg50 had to suspend the prison component which was an important component of the project due to lack f funding recommendations head2right unodc conig should in consultation with the partnership in development branch pdb develop strategy to mobilize resources in nigeria that shou ld be linked to current niri24 nirg50 and rafr60 an d pipeline projects that require additional funding nd document the strategy in the strategic programme framework and future workplans starting 2007 rec 02 head2right unodc conig should in consultation with pdb acti vely and formally followup on informal pledges rec 03 head2right unodc conig should formally communicate to ecowas its concerns regarding the sustainability of the activities at the ndlea jos training academy and th trafficking in persons coordination unit if fundin g and staffing is not forthcoming rec 04 unodc accepted the recommendation unodc conig and the pdb have begun revising the spf which would incorporate the specif ic fund raising strategy for unodcs technical cooperation programme in nigeria the rev ision is planned for completion by august 2007 as to recommendation 3 pdb cps and c onig have been actively following up on informal pledges the unodc regiona l office for west and central africa rosen has already communicated with the ec owas secretariat as regards to ecowas human trafficking coordinating unit for th training academy in jos joint approach of unodc and the nigerian government is planned oios will record these recommendations as implemented upon receipt f the revised spf information on the results of the followup pledges and copy of the plan of action on the jos training academy c partnership 22 unodc conig felt that there was not enough stakehol der andor local counterpart support for initiativesideas that hindered funding arrangements or hampered project implementation also fundraising and operational efforts are not adequately coordinated and streamlined with those of its partners negativ ely affecting unodcs ability to deliver technical assistance in nigeria 23 many efforts had been made to overcome lack of st akeholder support but they do not necessarily result in risk avoidance in this regard unodc conig was of the opinion that there is single control mechanism to adequately mitigating the risk other than to plan carefully and to embark on initiatives where stakeholder support is present oios agrees with the aforementioned but is furthe r of the opinion that unodc conig should make deliberate efforts to obtain stakeholde r support and include it as an additional programme activity in the annual workplans these could include and unodc senior level interventions meetings with stakehold ers and other influential partners and holding advocacy events with major donors 7 24 since the arrival of the new unodc conig representa tive the annual work plan includes the support to be provided to rosen and it s major stakeholders regional and national organizations activities it was also conf irmed that stakeholders full support to the project would be taken before the new project comme ncement 25 the overlapping mandates between unodc other ag encies and other international organizations result in competition f or funding and projects discussion paper is under development that will serve as bas is for discussions on strategic partnership between unodc and undp this should inc lude clarification of working relationsdivision of labor between undp and unodc to enhance coordination and cooperation this is good initiative but more is needed to overcome overlapping mandates between unodc and other agencies and in ternational organizations worldwide recommendation head2right unodc when developing the discussion paper should ensure that the paper adequately addresses the conc ern of overlapping mandates between unodc and other agencies this measure should provide the unodc division for policy analysis and public affairs dp with the opportunity to address the matter of overlappin g mandates between unodc and other agencies at oth er field offices rec 05 unodc conig accepted the first part of the recommen dation but the mandates question should be referred to the general assembly oios will record the recommendations as implemented upon receipt of the decision by the dc division for policy analysis and public affairs dpa in this matter d project planning 26 unodc conig has limited expertise in key thematic reas and with only one national project officer the office is not able to develop balanced programmeproject portfolio and to complete project ideasdocuments i n timely manner the future development of project ideasdocuments in current t hematic areas in which unodc conig is already involved such as hivaids prevent ion regional projects on trafficking in persons and capacity building may n ot necessarily be the best way forward however without engaging expert advice unodc ig will not be in position to determine whether there are other options andor ar eas in which it should broaden or expand its operations the spf and work plan of th office should provide for this oios also agrees that law enforcement expert shou ld be engaged but is further of the opinion that unodc conig should first revise the sp f which should set the direction for future project ideas that are based on needs t he likelihood of funding and available resources within the office unodc conig indicated need for consultant to handle this activity 27 the new unodc conig representative with the suppor t of unodc pdb upon review of the current portfolioprogramme has devel oped road map on project formulation with specific responsibilities includin g securing technical inputs from unodc hq therefore this action plan will be refle cted in the revision of the spf 8 recommendation head2right unodc conig should develop strategies for the development of project ideasdocuments and b the subsequent funding of the projects the strategies should be documented in the strategic programme framework re c 06 unodc conig accepted the recommendation the planne d spf would address oios concerns unodc conig has already developed road map on project formulation with specific responsibilities oios will record the recommendations as implemented upon receipt of the revised spf 28 oios found the project documents to be well written and the documents address the matters as required by unodc ie justifications goals and activities to be carried out but it lacked important information in its budgetin g process in most cases needs assessments were planned as an activity within the project and therefore the quantities and their estimated costs to be included in the bu dgets were not known therefore the cost estimates could hardly be taken as benchmark during implementation 29 workplans were prepared and they provide in detail the activities that tieup with those stipulated in project documents but not all were costed also and as monitoring tool the workplans did not include the actual cost s incurred with the exception of project ngas08 the latter projects workplans should be duplicated for other projects it is method that is not complicated and the document ser ves as monitoring tool as well 30 oios recommended that the project costing and coste d work plans be formulated unodc conig accepted both recommended actions addre ssed in the two preceding paragraphs and confirmed its implementation by foll owing practices in the ngas08 project project implementation delays 31 some projects experienced delays in implementation in two projects the delays were partly due to the delay in the appointment of the p roject coordinators and assistants there is low absorption capacity that hinders timel implementation and inadequate local counterpart commitment and participation also ch anges in key officials andor government priorities affect project implementation priorities are discussed at all levels and taken into account in programme development c apacity building components are built into project design to limited extent projects should be designed to increase absorption capacity and should be based on realisti c assessments of the expected level of commitment and participation and embedded in the pr ogrammeproject strategy and included in the strategic programme framework 32 matter of concern is the difficulties experienced in getting timely administrative support from undp the administrative arrangements with undp strengthen accountability but the services should be quality services and delivered in timely manner to ensure that unodcs project implementatio n is not hampered the cases reviewed could be isolated cases and should be deal t with as such 9 33 however and for current projects assessments were conducted during implementation and the lists of items to be procured travel plans and training schedules were not submitted to undp at the outset of the projects n eeds assessments should be conducted at the formulation stage if not possible the ass essors should be identified during the formulation stage to ensure that the assessments ar conducted at an early stage of implementation thereby allowing for the timely sub mission of procurement and other requests to undp recommendation head2right unodc conig should starting 2007 compile lists f items to be procured tentative travel plans and tr aining schedules as early as possible and formally informs undp of the workload involved and expectations rec 07 unodc conig accepted the recommendation oios will record the recommendations as implemented upon receipt of the list of activiti regional projects 34 the reporting lines are not clear in project rafr6 0 the project is managed and supervised by unodcs regional office for west and central africa based in dakar senegal unodc rosen and ecowas but the implemen ting modality in the project document is not clear as to the reporting lines and b monitoring and reporting requirements separate reports needs to be prepare d and the operational requirements ie travel authorisations differ 35 oios recommended that unodc conig clarify the r eporting lines and b the monitoring and reporting requirements in project ra fr60 with rosen and ecowas unodc conig accepted the recommendation and confirm ed that the project was under the overall supervision of rosen for operational ffectiveness unodc conig ensured project implementation on behalf of rosen ecowas secretariat as counterpart works closely with unodc conig and rose n consultants and participants 36 conig projects paid local consultants rates that ra nged from 150 to 300 per day the rate of 300 is 30 per cent more than the highe st rate determined by undp at 228 per day 37 government officials received dsa rates as determin ed by undp when attending workshops however all other participants received dsa according to international rates which are some 60 per cent more than the undp rates 38 in addition to dsa unodc conig paid honorariums to participants this practice should not be allowed recommendations head2right unodc conig should standardise and issue guideli ne for the procedures to be followed by project staff when engaging consultants or arranging training and trav rec 08 10 head2right unodc conig should apply the undp rates for local consultants and participants and cease paying honor ariums to participants rec 09 unodc conig accepted the recommendations and confir med that within the context of the reform the operations management team of th country team in nigeria had established human resources network which wo uld harmonise all the human resources issues including consultants unodc coni g also confirmed that the undp rates for local consultants and participants would be applied henceforth oios will record the recommendations as implemented upon rece ipt of the result of the operation management team study on this matter oios also requests copies of guidelines and rates for local consultants and participants as well as memorandum on stopping the payment of honorariums to participants procurement 39 some projects advanced funds to partners to underta ke their own procurements in 2003 project niri24 gave funds to the ndlea to up grade the jos training academy this later proved not to be good arrangement beca use the ndlea could not account for all items purchased since 2004 unodc conig and u ndp procured for the ndlea more accountable arrangement would have been for unodc conig to conduct physical verifications of the items purchased and s ystematically verify inventories also unodc conig did not comply with unodcs policy rega rding the ownership and transfer of assets to partners standard transfe r agreement is in use in unodc but it was not used by unodc conig 40 project nirg50 provided advances to universities the requirements shopping lists were discussed during workshops and ct entered into with the universities according to which the universities procured the it ems financial reports and supporting documentation were submitted to unodc conig but tr ansfer agreements were not entered into and items procured were not physically verified 41 oios recommended that unodc conig should not provid advances to partners to procure items but instead to procure through undp andor general support section in vienna to prevent irregularities in procurements ios further recommended physical inventory taking of assets procured for partners b ut not yet formally transferred to the partners unodc conig accepted the recommendations recommendation head2right unodc conig should comply with unodcs policy regarding the ownership of assets purchased under p rojects and the transfer thereof to the partners rec 10 unodc conig accepted the recommendation it was exp lained that the transfers of equipment to partners are carried out on regular basis outstanding transfers will be done as soon as possible oios will record the recommendations as implement ed upon receipt of the list of the official transfer of ite ms to the partners concerned 11 f project monitoring and evaluation 42 project documents do not stipulate how projects s hould be monitored or which tools should be used nonetheless project implementation is monitored but oios is of the opinion that unodc conig could benefit from proje ct monitoring committee to monitor the implementation of projects in more sy stematic manner 43 project coordinators report according to unodcs re porting requirements which are narrative reports semiannual and annual and when required by management these narrative reports are not linked to the financial r eporting they report progress per activity whereas profi reports on financials per c ategory of expenditure therefore the reports are not linked and not adequate for monitor ing purposes the two types of reporting narrative and financial should be linke d information required is the budgeted and actual costs per activity to provide birdse yeview of the implementing status of activities without having to prepare separate repor ts project ngas08 has such monitoring tool costed work plan that is updated w ith technical and financial data which is living document recommendations head2right unodc conig should introduce project monitoring steering committee to systematically monitor the implementation of projects rec 11 unodc conig accepted the recommendation and confirm ed that that the existing projects already have monitoring committees such as the project steering committee for ngas08 and the technical advisory committee for rg50 in january 2007 unodc conig established project review committee unodc conig would establish steering committee in march 2007 oios will record the recommendations as implemented upon receipt of information on the blishment of the project monitoring steering committee 44 oios recommended also that unodc conig duplicate th monitoring tool of project ngas08 costed work plan updated with tech nical and financial data in all projects because the narrative and financial repor ts used by other projects are not adequate for monitoring purposes unodc conig accepted the recommendation and added that all project coordinators would comply 45 as required all projects provide for final evalu ation final evaluation only is in most cases inadequate for projects with durations f two years or more interim evaluations provide the opportunity to discover and correct failures during implementation and are particularly useful when the impact of the project is not measured during implementation 46 oios recommended an interim evaluation for projects with implementation periods longer than two years especially for projects wher impact is not measured during implementation unodc conig accepted the recommendation and confirm ed that all ongoing projects had been evaluated except ngas08 which could be due in the third quarter of 2007 12 g project ngas08 47 the project provides support to the efcc and the bu dget totalled 273 million relatively large project representing almost 80 per cent of unodc conigs project
