6105c26 shspec4 on auditing before you can change people you have to increase their tolerance for change change is pain because its fundamental is shift of location in space on mechanical level change is time time is temperature the hotter the faster this is discovery in physics it goes along with the discovery that the speed of light is not constant but depends on the velocity of emission and that zero is variable not an absolute zero time is change on mechanical level rate of change is measured by rate of change not by time but one pretends that it is measured by time if you find the right temperature you can speed time up or make something timeless for instance after the atomic bomb exploded nothing moved for twenty minutes not even the twenty minutes temperature alteration caused this there is zero there is nothing but nothing of what this is variable society at present doesnt know that it doesnt know this is dangerous scientology points this out to society which is painful to society the best approach to study is always to find out what you dont know and then to remedy the situation one should not start out study by finding out something new the gradient approach is 1 not knowing that one doesnt know 2 knowing one doesnt know but not knowing what one doesnt know 3 finding out what one doesnt know 4 remedying the situation the only thing wrong with ones case is the vast area of ones beingness that one doesnt know one doesnt know about things you do reactively produce the opposite result from what you intend gradient of states of case 1 release release is person who knows he wont get any worse he has low state of case but he is better than nonrelease since he knows he isnt there yet on meter he would give whole dial drop on lowsensitivity can squeeze and the ta would be fairly near clear read he would also have reality on scientology as way to improve the communication help and control buttons are in good shape he can asis certain things by inspection 2 stable release this is tested release he has adverse needle reactions on help communication or control life can still mess him up but he will come through better 3 mest clear this individual has an fn at sensitivity one and doesnt react to routine questions he reads at the clear read for his sex 4 stable clear this is mest clear who has run lots more sop goals where they start blowing by inspection for this individual engrams have persistence he can erase engrams or mock them up at will his healing rate is fantastic thinkingness can have an effect on the bank before clear but clear has more effect on the bank in all case states up to clear thinkingness has varied effect on the bank the lower the case state the less effect ones thought has on the bank psycho is total effect of the bank and can produce effect on the bank then we go up to more and more effect of person on the bank up to bank memory trouble is withholdingness withholding from people results in withholding from self the pc lessens the overt and pushes it out of sight if you increase his responsibility he becomes aware of more overts the overts unlessen and one starts to feel bad for instance when you discover that you have been committing overts against the org that has been so nice to you this is what happens when you process person towards greater responsibility without pulling withholds the person will cave in again therefore you must pull these overts and withholds and get the charge off them as they become available this is the rationale behind interspersing sec checks with other auditing otherwise the pc becomes unwilling to make case gain and is likely to blow
