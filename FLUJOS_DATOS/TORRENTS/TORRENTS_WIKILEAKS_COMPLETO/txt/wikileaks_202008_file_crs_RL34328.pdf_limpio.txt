competes act hr 2272 which the president signed into law pl 11069 on august 9 2007 the act responds to concerns that the united states may not be able to compete economically with other nations in the future due to insufficient investment today in science and technology research and science technology engineering and mathematics stem education and workforce development similar concern had led president bush to announce the american competitiveness initiative aci in january 2006 during his state of the union address the america competes act authorizes an increase in the nations investment in science and engineering research and in stem education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education the act also establishes the advanced research projects agencyenergy arpae and discovery science and engineering innovation institutes appendix provides summary of the acts programs the act authorizes increases in funding for the national science foundation nsf national institute of standards and technology nist laboratories and the department of energy doe office of science over fy2008fy2010 if maintained the increases would double the budgets of those agencies over seven years the administ rations aci also proposes doublingpath but for over ten years for physical sciences and engineering research at the three agencies within doe arpae is designed to support transformational energy technology research projects with the goal of enhancing the economic and energy security of the united states based on the defense advanced research projects agency darpa the administration and others support the conceptual goal of arpae but ques tions whether or not the darpa model can be used for the energy sector and has concerns about it potentially redirecting funds from current doe research activities arpae proponents counter that arpae is needed to facilitate the energy marketplace by accelerating research that will bridge the gap between basic research and industrial development at the heart of the america competes act is the goal of maintaining the united states as the leader in the global economy three broad trends influence todays globalization of the economy the first is technology which has sharply reduced the cost of communication and transportation that previously divided markets the second is dramatic increase in the world supply of labor producing goods and services traded internationally the third is government policies that have reduced barriers to trade and investment an issue for congress is whether to fund america competes act programs at authorized funding levels fy2008 appropriations did not for fy2009 the federal agencies that manage america competes act programs are funded through an interim continuing resolution until march 6 2009 at the fy2008 level funding for the remainder of fy2009 and all of fy2010 remains to be determined httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34328g3g150g142g155g146g140g138g561g5

to meaningfully promote excellence in technology edu cation and science act or the america competes act hr 2272 which the president signed into law pl 11069 on august 9 2007 the america competes act had substantial bipartisan support passing 36757 in the house and by unanimous consent in the senate the america competes act is intended to increase the nations investment in science and engineering research and in science technology engineering and mathematics stem education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education the act is designed to focus on two perceived concerns believed to infl uence future us competitiveness inadequate research and development funding to generate sufficient technological progress and inadequate numbers of american students proficient in science and mathematics or interested in science and engineering careers relative to international competitors the act is an authorization act so new programs established by the act will not be initiated unless funded through subsequent appropriations 1 similarly increases in the authorization level of existing programs may or may not translate into increased funding this report provides an

maintain economic growth and high standard of living the united states must be competitive in global economy to be competitive us companies must engage in trade retain market shares and offer high quality products processes and services scientific and technological advances can further economic growth because they contribute to the creation of new goods services jobs and capital or increase productivity such advances can compensate for possible disadvantages in the cost of capital and labor faced by firms by enhancing the quality or efficiency in the production of existing goods and services scientific advances government activity the organization and management of firms and serendipity can all influence technological progress regardless of economic conditions in addressing us competitiveness two policy approaches have primarily been used one relies on direct measures that include budget outlays and the provision of services by government agencies the other uses indirect measures such as financial incentives and legal changes 3 since world war ii the united states has used combination of direct and indirect approaches to enhance current and future us competitiveness4

is certain to confront us with competition from other national economies of sort we have not hitherto had to meet5 interest in the competitiveness issue perhaps reached its peak in the 1970s when some experts became concerned that japan europe and newly industrialized countries were becoming major competitors with the united states the united st ates had lost market share in autos cameras stereos television sets steel machine tools and microelectronics some also expressed concerns that us technological superiority as exhibited by the balance of trade in hightechnology products was declining as the us share of world exports on research and development rd intensive goods fell while the japanese share rose other indicators were lower productivity growth in the united states than japan narrow ing in the gap of the production in the number of scientists and engineers graduating from us universities and those engaged in rd in the united states compared to japan and west germany the relative proficiency of us high school students in science and mathematics and decline in the number of patents granted to americans while those to foreign inventors doubled the cause some believed was due to us expenditures for civilian rd falling behind that of europe and japan or some european countries and japan deriving more economic benefit from their rd expenditures 6 congress responded by taking number of actions including passing the stevensonwydler technology innovation act of 1980 pl 96480 the patent and trademark act amendments of 1980 known as the bayhdole act pl 96517 the federal technology transfer act pl 99 502 the national cooperative research act pl 98462 and the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 in addition the semiconductor manufacturing technology or sema tech consortium an onsite test facility and conduit for new technological advances for the us semiconductor industry was created 7 additional congressional actions also focused on increasing corporate spending on research and development in response to competitiveness concerns included the 1981 economic recovery tax act pl 9734 and the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 which provided for research and experimentation re tax credit the small business development act pl 97219 pl 99443 established setaside of federal rd funds to support work in innovative small firms 8 the competitiveness concerns continued until the mid1990s when the united states economy and technological innovation improved actions were taken by us manufacturers to improve their quality and efficiency universities and national laboratories increased their linkages to us companies and the united states was successful in many innovationbased industries such as continued

japanese economy was in decline9 now that the nation has entered the 21st century todays competitiveness concerns tend to be focused on issues related to globalizationthat is global economyalong with some of the same concerns discussed in previous competitiveness debatesthese include whether or not federal science and engineering research funding is sufficient questions about stem education quality and the number of americans obtaining science and engineering degrees much of what americans consume or buy is produced in other countries and much of what americans produce is exported abroad for example growing number of the largest us companies rely on international markets for over 50 of their sales and employ more foreign workers than domestic this globalization has growing impact both positive and negative on the economic futures of american companies workers and families increasing integration with the world economy can make the united states more productive leading to increases in living standards and real disposable incomes however rising tr ade with lowwage developing countries increases workers concerns about job loss lower wages and benefits as american companies take actions to compete in global economy the informa tion technology revolution has expanded these competitiveness concerns to us white collar jobs 10 three broad trends influence todays globalization of the economy the first is technology which has sharply reduced the cost of communication and transportation that previously divided markets the second is dramatic increase in the world supply of labor producing goods and services traded internationally the third is government policies that have reduced barriers to trade and investment11 the america competes act includes policies that address each of these trends the act addresses these issues by authorizing primarily direct measures in each of these policy areas in addition the act authorizes two committeesone inside government and the other outside governmentto look at indirect policy mechanisms with respect to technology some believe that todays federal funding of basic science and engineering research is inadequate to generate the technological progress needed to create new industries and the associated jobs the act responds to that concern by increasing federal funding of basic research at the federal agencies primarily responsible for funding physical sciences engineering mathematics and computer sciencefields that are considered to be major contributors to competitiveness due to their potential for innovation and job creation in addition the america competes act renames and refocuses an existing program that helps fund highrisk research and development at small and mediumsized businesses with respect to labor the act takes actions that are intended to make the us labor pool more competitive with the world supply of labor currently some believe that inadequate numbers of american students are proficient in science and mathematics in addition the number of americans pursuing postsecondary stem degrees is considered to be low relative to students in 9 george r heaton jr christopher t hill patrick windham

postsecondary stem degrees with respect to government trade and investment policies the act authorizes meetings studies and committees to identify possible actions the united states might undertake this includes for example studying and reviewing the costs faced by us businesses engaged in innovation compared with foreign competitors beyond the america competes act other recent legislative initiatives propose federal efforts that encourage industry to spend more on research and development promote joint research activities between companies foster cooperative work between industry and

employment and the wages received from employment in the economy22 the united states is both the largest recipient of foreign direct investments as well as the largest investor abroad23 investment by us firms abroad was 249 billion in 2006 see figure 1 24 while some view these investments as an economic gain others express concern about displaced us workers and lower wages seventy percent of us foreign direct investment however is concentrated in highincome developed countries and the share of investment going to developing countries has fallen in recent years as result most economists conclude that direct investment abroad is due to broad restructuring of us manufacturing industries and does not lead to fewer jobs or lower incomes overall for americans 25

result of science and engineering is challenging task nsf identifies five broad categories of science and engineering occupations computer and mathematical scientists life scientists physical scientists social scientists and engineers this classification however does not account for all those with science and engineering degrees who use this knowledge in their occupations for example chemist who teaches high school chemistry and an engineer who manages manufacturing plant are classified as teacher and manager respectively and are not included in nsfs analysis of the science and engineering workforce in addition there are those who are in science and engineeringrelated occupations who use science and engineering know ledge in their jobs but who may or may not have degrees in science and engineering for example patent attorney or physician some also use their training in nominally nonse occupations such as writers salesmen financial managers and legal consultants as the need for science and engineering knowledge has increased for growing number of occupations traditional accounting of such occupations provides less understanding of the science and engineering workforce and it could be considerably larger perhaps two to three times than provided in government analyses by the nsf the bureau of labor statistics bls and the us census bureau 26 according to the national science board nsb depending on the definition and perspective used the size of the science and engineering workforce varied between approximately 50 million and 214 million individuals in 2006 nsb suggests that the most relevant number may be 170 million which in 2006 was the number of individuals who had at least one degree in science and engineering field or 214 million which also

these numbers reflect the many ways science and technical knowledge is used in the united states this is quite different from that of nsfs science and engineering occupation data 50 million in 2006 the us census bureaus data 39 million in 2005 or bls data 54 million for and 74 for stem occupations27 in may 2006 third option is provided by nsfs data that is based on workers own reporting of their need for at least bachelors degree level of science and engineering knowledge 129 million in 2003 28 statistical analysts also find challenging accounting for the need of all workers to have basic understanding of stem and of the workers whose employment is related to new technologies figure 2 provides an analysis that shows how the skills needed for employment have changed due to computerization this computerization has reduced the need for routine manual and cognitive tasks and replaced them with highlevel tasks this analysis found that translating task shifts into education demand the model can explain sixty percent of the estimated relative demand shift favoring college labor during 1970 to 1998 task changes within nominally identical occupations account for almost half of this impact 29 the most longterm analysis of workforce tr ends is that of the us census bureau as shown in figure 3 the number of workers in science and engineering occupations grew significantly77 times larger in 2000 than in 1950 this growth rate is higher than that of the total labor force which grew 23 times and that of all managers and professionals which grew 49 times the stem growth rate in the 1990s was little more than three times that of the overall labor force 30 27 the nsb defines stem occupations as science and engineering occupations plus technicians programmers technical

incorporated into todays assessment of the nations competitiveness the council on competitiveness also suggests that due to the global economy assessing nations trade balance is not as useful measure as it once was today competition is not as much domestic companies competing with foreign companies as captured in trade balances but world where value is created through intangible assets flowing

of its influence on us economic growth current science and engineering basic research funding particularly in the physical sciences engineering mathematics and computer science is insufficient compared to other countries with whom the united states competes additional federal funding of basic science and engineering research will make the nation more competitive by creating whole new industries and the related jobs and enhancing existing ones these assumptions are based on variety of analyses for example in k12 stem education 39 the organization for economic cooperation and developments oecd program for international student assessment pisa compared the scores of us 15yearold students in science and mathematics literacy to the scores of their peers internationally in 2006 american students scored an average of 489 points on science literacy lower than the oecd average of 500 points and 474 points in mathematics literacy lower than the oecd average score of 49840

between 1959 and 2004 and 7 between 1995 and 200444 these are illustrations of the many analyses available that emphasize such themes some however question these fundamental assumptions they question for example if the united states invests in federal research programs to what extent can the us exclusively benefit from those investments since research is international could not any country benefit from these investments at what point is the nations research investment sufficient to reach its goals in stem education is this not state and local issue can the federal government really have any major influence in this policy area will stem education investments take too long to reach fruition relative to other investments will federal investments in research and stem education provide jobs for all americans as opposed to just scientists and engineers others question whether or not the actions in the act are by themselves sufficient to enhance us competitiveness as many other factors beyond stem research and education contribute to us competitiveness 45 further some question the fundamental premise that any action is necessary at all regarding us competitiveness they question whether or not science and engineering research and stem education are problems at all46 these analysts express doubts as to whether additional scientists and engineers in the united states are needed given current workforce projections and why if the demand is so high salaries for those in stem occupations are not higher47 other analysts 41 william schmidt et the preparation gap teacher education

assuming that policymakers concerns about us competitiveness are sufficient for response both direct such as increased funding and indirect measures such as tax policy are proposed by proponents the act focuses on direct measures while studying possible indirect measures that can be taken when looking at technology development those favoring direct government assistance contend that the governments scarce resources should focus on technologies that have the greatest promise as determined by industry and indicated by industrys willingness to match funds those favoring indirect measures contend that the market is superior to government in deciding which technologies are worthy of investment and worry about potential political interests influences on an agencys decision to assist one technology in preference to another indirect policy mechanism proponents instead support policies that enhance the markets opportunities and abilities to make such choices those who prefer direct measures contend that indirect measures are wasteful ineffective and can compromise other public policy goals 51

stated the bill creates over 30 new programs that are mostly duplicative or counterproductive including new department of energy agency to fund latestage technology development more appropriately left to the private sectorand also provides excessive authorization for existing programs accordingly the president will request funding in his 2009 budget for those authorizations that support the focused

administrations aci also proposed increases in funding as exhibited in the fy2007 fy2008 and fy2009 budgets but at rate that would provide doubling path over 10 years instead of 7 years many organizations have advocated increasing research funding for the physical sciences engineering mathematics and computer science the specific rate of increase in the america competes act is based on the national academies58 rising above the gathering storm report59 which called for the federal government to increase its investment in longterm basic research by 10 annually over the next seven years the national academies committee that developed the report concluded that this rate of change was necessary particularly in the physical sciences engineering mathematics and information sciences because federal funding in these fields has remained relatively flat for 15 years according to the national academies agencies are less likely to support highpotential highrisk research when funding is stagnant in addition this type of research tends to be overlooked when there are inadequate funds to support all proposals that independent external reviewers rate as very good or excellent corporations are unlikely to fill this need according to the national academies they fund little basic research as it typically offers greater benefits to society than its sponsor and is riskier than shareholders are willing to tolerate 60 the national academies committee reviewed proposals from wide variety of organizations before determining that 10 annual increase over sevenyear period would be most appropriate in particular the nsf authorization act of 2002 pl 107368 authorized doubling nsfs research budget over five years the committee took this into account and expanded it to other federal agencies in sum the committee believes that this rate of growth strikes an appropriate balance between the urgency of the issue being addressed and the ability of the research community to apply new funds efficiently 61 the administration has not indicated why it selected 7 annual rate that would provide doublingpath for these research activities over 10 years as an appropriate rate of increase for these agencies the administration has indicated however that the amount of funding available is limited wide consensus exists on the importance of federally funded science to our nations long term economic competitiveness the national academies 2005 report rising above the gathering storm was an important expression of this view and echoed findings of many other reports notable among its recommendations was increased funding for basic research in the physical sciences mathematics and engineeringareas that had stagnated while the 57 for additional information see crs report rl34048

recommended that investment in these areas should increase ideally through rea llocation of existing funds but if necessary via new funds that statement is rare recognition of the fact that federal

research and development and in the promotion of stem education consistent with nasas mission the act also expresses the sense of the congress that robust funding of nasa at the levels authorized in the national aeronautics and space act of 2005 pl 10955 and subsequent years would allow nasa to contribute significantly to us innovation and competitiveness enable fair balance of funding among its science aeronautics education exploration and human space flight programs and allow full participation in any interagency efforts to promote innovation and economic competitiveness 63 the senate and house appropriations committees have expressed concern that the presidents fy2008 budget is not appropriately balanced and that insufficient funds are requested for both the presidents vision for space exploration and the other important initiatives at nasa64 similarly national research council report indicated that nasa is being asked to accomplish too much with too little65 the report recommended that both the executive and the legislative branches of the federal government need to seriously examine the mismatch between the tasks assigned to nasa and the resources that the agency has been provided to accomplish them and should identify actions that will make the agencys portfolio of responsibilities sustainable others also question if nasa has the right priorities66 although

some researchers concerns that current federal research funding review mechanisms are not as open as they could be to new unproven ideas70 the national science board nsb found that transformative research frequently does not fit comfortably within the scope of project focused innovative stepbystep research or even major centers nor does it tend to fare well wherever review system is dominated by experts highly invested in current paradigms or during times of especially limited budgets that promote aversion to risk 71 further investigators are reluctant to submit radical or

if fully funded arpae would be new federal organization in doe as outlined in the america competes act the goal of arpae is to enhance the economic and energy security of the united states through the development of technologies that reduce foreign energy imports reduce energyrelated greenhouse gas emissions improve energy efficiency in all economic sectors and ensure the united states is technical leader in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies arpae is intended to achieve this goal through energy technology projects by identifying and promoting revolutionary advances in fundamental sciences translating scientific discoveries and cuttingedge inventions into technological innovations and accelerating transformational technological advances in areas that industry by itself is not likely to undertake because of technical and financial uncertainty arpae is based on the darpa research management model used by the department of defense currently darpa seeks to sponsor revolutionary highpayoff research that bridges the gap between fundamental discoveries and their military use 77 although the concept for arpae in the act was based on that in the national

initiatives have been proposed for example number of initiatives including an advanced civilian technology agency were proposed in the 100th and 101st congresses79 in 1992 national academy of sciences report recommended that the government consider ci vilian technology corporation or civilian technology agency in limited areas including energy research80 similar action was proposed by the progressive policy institute in 199381 at the time presidential candidate bill clinton and senator gore proposed the creation of civilian advanced research agency to support research on renewable technologies and renewable fuels82 in congressional testimony members of the committee that wrote the national academies report indicated arpae should have four objectives 1 bring freshness excitement and sense of mission to energy research that will attract many of our best and brightest mindsthose of experienced scientists and engineers and especially those of students and young researchers including those in the entrepreneurial world 2 focus on creative outofthebox potentially transformational research that industry cannot or will not support 3 utilize an arpalike organization that is flat nimble and sparse yet capable of setting goals and making decisions that will allow it to sustain for long periods of time those projects whose promise is real and to phase out programs that do not prove to be productive or as promising as anticipated 4 create new tool to bridge the troubling gaps between basic energy research development and industrial innovation it can serve as model for how to improve science and technology transfer in other areas that are essential to our future prosperity 83 the report proposed that funding for arpae start at 300 million the first year and increase to 1 billion per year over five to six years at that point the programs effectiveness would be evaluated and appropriate actions taken regarding the funding of arpae national academies committee members testified that it was critical that arpae funding not jeopardize the basic research supported by the does office of science the national academies committee did not believe it appropriate to specify the organization and mission of arpae in great detail but rather th at those details should be worked out by the 79 during the 101st congress 2nd session these included s 1978 hr 3833 hr 4715

rapid but intense consultation with experts from the scientific and engineering communities84 what type of research would arpae fund member of the national academies committee has provided two illustrations of what arpae might fund the first is new class of inexpensive efficient and long lasting solar cells created using novel materials manufactured with thinfilm technologies or nanoparticle devices that convert sunlight arpae could also fund the creation of new plants to be grown for energy by incorporating number of genes introduced into plants or make plants selffertilizing and drought and pestresistant so less energy is used in agriculture 85 after final passage of the act raymond orbach doe under secretary for science stated that although the goal of the newly authorized agency is laudable its structure needs to be developed he also indicated that although the act required that director be named for arpae president bush will not seek appropriations for the new agency 86 between the release of the gathering storm report and the passage of the america competes act there were number of congressional hearings on arpae87 proponents of arpae indicate that additional science and technology would help respond to the nations need for clean affordable and reliable energy others question whether arpae is necessary to develop new technologies when existing energy technologies are not fully utilized due to insufficient policies to encourage their implementation some witnesses also indicated that the problems arpae is trying to solve are unclear these concerns addressed whether the challenge is lack of privatesector investment in basic research or federal funding for innovative highrisk research failure to effectively transfer new energy technologies to the marketplace or some combination of these in particular they question the lack of direct customer as the energy market is broad and diverse public and private market while darpa has dod as primary customer to create demand witnesses supporting arpae testified that it will focus on breakthrough research using emerging basic research in areas such as nanotechnology to develop totally new technologies as opposed to existing programs that have already identified paths forward and tend to focus on incremental advances further it is designed to bridge the gap between basic research and industrial developmentnot to get products to the marketplace but to transform the marketplace by accelerating research 84 ibid 85 testimony of dr steven chu in us

funds from does office of science to arpae while funding for the office of science is goal of both aci and the america competes act they also questioned if the authorized funding for arpae is enough to support the research necessary for arpae to reach its goals and expressed concern that lack of acceptance by doe of arpae might impede its success supporters of arpae testified that funds for arpae should not be redirected from the doe office of science they maintain that arpae will also create freshness excitement and sense of mission to attract the best scientific minds so that its goals have high potential of being reached further proponents argue arpae will address organizational problems at doe by being sufficiently small and flexible to work across and around riskaverse parochial organizational stovepipes some have proposed providing an advance appropriation supporting arpae for several years rather than the usual oneyear appropriation another option is to identify dedicated

the america competes act directs doe to establish multidisciplinary discovery science and engineering innovation institutes at doe nati onal laboratories to apply fundamental science and engineering discoveries to technological innovations the institutes along with their higher education and private industry partners would support science and engineering research on emerging technologies determined by the secretary of energy to be critical to global competitiveness in addition the institutes are intended to train undergraduate and graduate science and engineering students develop innovative undergraduate and graduate educational curricula conduct research with highereducation partners and develop innovative technologies with industrial partners 96 in the discussions leading up to the america competes act the administration opposed the institutes stating the administration strongly objects to using doe funds to support state and local economic development activities in addition to diverting funds from priority research areas such focus on commercialization is not priority of the federal government and could result in putting the government in the position of competing with private investment and influencing market decisions in potentially inefficient and ineffective ways 97 those supporting the institutes believe it will provide an opportunity for doe national laboratories to work with universities to train engineers in such areas as nanoscience and microsystems98 the training of those engineers and the tasks they perform proponents indicate require reshaping of the nations engineering research education and practices to respond to challenges in global markets national security energy sustainability and public health they contend that the changes are not only technological but also cultural and they will affect the structure of organizations and relationships between institutional sectors of the country this task 95 for more

universities was to link fundamental scientific discoveries with technological innovations to create products processes services to meet the needs of society the nae committee recommended that these institutes play role similar to that of academic medical centers and agricultural experiment stations that combine research education and professional practice to drive transformative change and

doe scientists and engineers actively conducting research105 the doe specialty schools for math and science are to be public secondary schools whose students reside in the state where the school is located these schools are intended to offer students highquality comprehensive stem curriculum designed to improve the academic achievement of students in science and mathematics the administration contends that establishing or expanding k12 schools should not be doe responsibility 106 supporters state that such schools will be important because states that have similar specialty schools have been nucleus of excellence in math and science that attracts and inspires the best students and teachers 107 the america competes act authorizes summer internship programs at doe national laboratories for middle and secondary school stud ents to provide them with experiential hands on learning in science technology engineering and mathematics the administration advocates that resources instead should be focused on identifying what works and improving the effectiveness of existing efforts before starting new program for which the administration believes that there is clear and compelling need108 proponents counter that the few weeks students spend in such programs makes remarkable difference in the quality of education109 doe national laboratory centers of excellence in stem education are designed to assist teachers and allow them to use national laboratory equipment to teach courses located in at least one highneed public secondary school in the region served by doe national laboratory in partnership with local higher education institution the administration believes that establishing schoolbased centers is not proper role for doe and would divert national laboratory resources that currently benefit their surrounding communities 110 proponents counter that such programs inspire teachers and students and provide them with necessary resources111 104 us president

programs at the nsf and authorizes one new program the administration has opposed two provisions in the act increasing funding for an existing program the robert noyce teacher scholarship program and establishing funding for new program the laboratory science pilot program the consolidated appropriations act 2008 explanatory language states the following regarding nsf stem education programs and the noyce program nsf not only includes research but also shares in the responsibility for promoting quality math and science education as intertwining objectives at all levels of education across the united states math and science educators play major role in keeping the us competitive in the 21 st century increasing the number of highly qualified k12 math and science teachers is critical to the creation of new generation of innovators recommendations included in the national academies rising above the gathering storm report discussed the importance of expanding programs to enhance the undergraduate education of the future science and engineering workforce within the amounts provided an additional 5000000 for total of 15000000 shall be provided for the robert noyce scholarship program the robert noyce scholarship program encourages talented science technology engineering and mathematics stem undergraduate students and postgraduate professionals to become k 12 mathematics and science teachers the noyce program awards grants to higher education institutions to recruit and prepare undergraduate students majoring in science technology engineering and mathematics to become elementary and secondary mathematics and science teachers students receive scholarships and stipends in exchange for 26 years of service as mathematics or science teacher in highneed k12 school district 112 this program is related to another activity in the america competes act the ed baccalaureate degrees in stemforeign languages with concurrent teacher certification program that provides funds to institutions of higher education to manage these programs the program is considered by some to be radical because academic research institutions have traditionally trained science and mathematics teachers in education departments rather than in science and mathematics departments in addition many of the current programs use master k12 classroom teachers to educate students in the program and serve as role models rather than relying solely upon the education department faculty further universities involved with the program have had to change their traditional viewpoi nt that they are preparing students just for research careers but also for education careers and that these students are not washouts but some of their best science engineering and mathematics undergraduates

evaluation of the noyce program is needed to determine its impact on improving th efficacy or retention of teachers who are program graduates and that the program is too new to conduct this evaluation therefore the administration maintains that it is unreasonable to increase the funding at the pace and magnitude called for in the america competes act proponents contend that both the uteach114 and california teach115 programs which use the same model as the noyce program have been successful in better preparing teachers for the classroom116 the nsf laboratory science pilot program will awar d grants to partnerships of higher education institutions highneed local educational agencies businesses eligible nonprofit organization and others to improve school laboratories and instrume ntation as part of comprehensive program to enhance the quality of stem instruction the program would provide professional development and training for teachers purchase rental or leasing of equipment instrumentation and other scientific educational materials develop instructional programs to integrate laboratory experiences with classroom instruction and design and implement handson laboratory experiences the administration has stated that supporting the acquisition of laboratory equipment when that equipment is linked to the development and implementation of novel curricula professional development or teaching methods is already part of an existing nsf program further routine purchase of consumable supplies and construction renovation or maintenance of physical facilities should remain the responsibility of the recipient institution or state and local education agencies according to the president 117 proponents counter that national research council report118 on the state of americas high school labs found that the current quality of laboratory experiences is poor for most students and schoo ls with higher concentrations of nonasian minorities and schools with higher concentrati ons of poor students are less likely to have adequate laboratory facilities than other schools119

the actions authorized in the america competes act how will the nation know if it is successful the purpose of the act is to invest in innovation through research and development and to improve the competitiveness of the united states see the earlier discussion on issues related to the definition of competitiveness many policy actions and other factors influence these indicators beyond the act so cause and effect is difficult to analyze but such indicators can provide some understanding of how the overall us economy is faring relative to other countries the united states currently ranks first on the international competitiveness rankings availabl as stated in the legislation the goal of the act is to maintain this ranking even as other nations increase their science and technology investments and activities there are evaluation mechanisms within the act as well as longitudinal analysis conducted by international organizations that assess competitiveness by ranking the ability of the united states to compete compared with other countries th mechanisms use combination of inputs outputs and outcomes to make their assessments in assessing the nations competitiveness and the evaluation mechanisms discussed in more depth below it is important to keep the following caveats in mind there are direct measures of innov ation or competitiveness numerous indicators of innovation activity are available these indicators are quantitative assessments of actions that play role in the innovation process but adding these indicators together is not necessarily an accurate assessment of innovation or nations competitiveness other factors such as necessity or serendipity may also play critical role the ability to evaluate the quality of an innovation its contribution to improved quality of life and its value to economic growth is limited and can differ depending on company or individuals perspective there is guarantee that inputs such as increased spending for research and development will lead to new or enhanced technologies and should technologies result or improve there is guarantee that they will be innovative or used in the marketplace or by society further innovation may occur regardless of research and development due to market demand perceived need or minor alterations in existing products and processes the federal government the industrial sector and universities all play major role in funding rd and innovation innovation measures often focus on research and development funding with out differentiating between the two while federal funding of basic research is the primary focus of the america competes act the industrial sector also plays critical development role in technological innovation and advancement in both the public and private sector universityindustry cooperation is also critical component serving as liaison between basic research and industry through the education and training of scientists engineers and managers

important to keep in mind that while much of us rd funding is for defenserelated research that is not the case in other countries analyzing nondefense rd may provide different picture than all of rd in examining industry rd the nature of the investment may be an important factor such as the degree of funding spent on research versus development and the degree of funding spent in particular industrial sectors for example more industry funding might be spent on electronic equipment research in one country while another may spend more of its industrial rd funding on transportation although patent data can be an indicator of the state of innovation not all that results from rd such as new ideas are able to be patented and some companies and individuals choose not to patent in order to prevent disclosure of an idea or plans for an activity or because of the time needed to obtain timely patent relative to marketplace needs the number of scientists and engineers may or may not reflect nations innovative capacity as new industries have been developed by individuals with and without college degrees in sum there are guarantees that any partic ular action will result in innovation or enhanced competitiveness instead the focus of government policy is on creating an environment where innovation has an opportunity to flourish with the result that the united states is competitive with the other nations who are also taking steps to increase their innovation environment both international and us government monitoring and assessments of the effect of us policies is important so that policy adjustments can be made as these other nations take policy actions of their own

number of mechanisms within the act are designed to measure its effectiveness at both the general and program specific level for example the act calls for presidents council on innovation and competitiveness whose members include the secretary or head of departments of independent agencies linked to science and innovation the council is to monitor implementation of public laws and initiatives for promoting innovation provide advice to the president with respect to global trends in competitiveness and innovation identify opportunities and make recommendations to improve innovation including monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the recommendations and develop metrics for measuring the progress of the federal government in improving conditions for innovation including through talent development investment and infrastructure improvements in addition there are provisions to evaluate specific research and education programs for example in research arpae is to be evaluated after it has been in operation for four years by the national academy of sciences to determine how well arpae is achieving its goals and mission similar provision is in place for the discovery science and engineering innovation institutes current white house guidelines also require federal research programs to be evaluated using the criteria of quality relevance and performance in response to the government performance and results act of 1993 pl 10362 meritbased competitive process is used by agencies in an attempt to determine which research activities graduate students distinguished scientists etc to fund
