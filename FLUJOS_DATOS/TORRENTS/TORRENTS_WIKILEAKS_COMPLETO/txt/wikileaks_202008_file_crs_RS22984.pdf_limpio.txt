expected to be very severe noting that towns and cities would be able to provide only 12 million new jobs 5 imf survey magazine what the numbers show october 17 2007 6 some analysts contend that chinas policy of keeping the value of its currency low against the dollar and large purchases of us debt may have been contributing cause to the current global financial crisis 7 chinas central bank manages its currency the renminbi or yuan against basket of major currencies largely the us dollar by heavily intervening in interna tional currency markets to maintain targeted exchange rates see crs

chinas sovereign wealth fund by michael f martin states the eu and japan could have si gnificant negative impact on chinas export sector and industries that pend on fdi flows there are indications that the chinese economy is already slowing down chinese real gdp growth for january through september 2008 was 99 which was 23 percentage points lower than growth in the same period in 20072 global insight an international forecasting firm projected in october 2008 that chinas gdp growth would slow from 119 in 2007 to 94 in 2008 and to 73 in 20093 some analysts contend annua l economic growth of less than 8 could lead to social unrest given that every year there are 20 million new job seekers in china4 according to the international monetary fund imf china was the single most important contributor to world economic growth in 20075 thus chinese economic slowdown could also have global implications chinas exposure to the global financial crisis the extent of chinas exposure to the curre nt global financial cr isis in particular from the fallout of the us subpr ime mortgage problem is unclear6 on the one hand china places numerous restrictions on capital flows particularly outflows in part so that it can maintain its managed float currency policy7 these restrictions limit the ability of chinese citizens and many firms to invest their savings overseas compelling them to invest those savings domestically such as in banks the stock markets real estate and business ventures although some chin attempt to shift funds overseas illegally thus the exposure of chinese private sector firm s and individual chinese investors to sub prime us mortgages is likely to be small on the other hand chinese government entitie s such as the state administration of foreign exchange the china investment corporation 200 b illion sovereign wealth fund created in 20078 state banks and stateowned terprises may have been more exposed to troubled us mortgage securitie s chinese government entities account for the lions share of chinas legal capital outflows much of which derives from chinas large and growing foreign exchange reserv these reserves rose from 403 billion inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22984crs3 9 chinas large and growing reserves are larg ely the result of chinas currency policy which requires the government to intervene in cu rrency markets to prevent the renminbi from appreciating large levels of fdi and large trade surpluses 10 st debt includes treasury agency corporate nd equity debt with less than one year maturity 11 although the chinese government does not make public the dollar composition of its foreign exchange holdings many analysts estimate this level to be around 70 based on this estimate chinas holdings of such securities may have risen to about 13 trillion as of september 2008 12 china was the largest foreign holder of us agency debt accounting for 29 of total 13 according to the treasury department chin was not among the top 10 global investors of us corporate mortgage backed securities 14 financial times september 11 2008 15 according to caijingcom chinese banks held 670 million worth of bonds issued by us investment bank lehman brothers wh it went bankrupt in september 20082003 year end to 19 trillion as of september 20089 in order to earn interest on these holdings the chinese government invests in overseas assets large portion of chinas reserves are believed to be invested in us securities such as longterm lt treasury debt used to finance the fede ral deficit lt us agency debt such as freddie mac and fannie mae mortgagebacked securities lt us corporate debt lt us equities and shortterm st debt10 the treasury department estimates that as of june 2007 chinas holdings of us securities totaled 922 billion making china the 2nd largest foreign holder of such securities after japan11 of this total 467 billion were in lt treasury securities 364 billion were in lt us agency securities12 29 billion in lt equities 28 billion in lt corporate s ecurities and 23 billion in st debt if china held troubled subprime mortgage backed securities they would likely be included in the corporate securities category and certain us equities which include investment company share funds such as openend funds closedend funds money market mutual funds and hedge funds which may have been invested in real estate however these were relatively small share of chinas total us securities holdings13 chinas holdings of fannie mae and freddie mac securities though not their stock were likely to have been more substantial but less risky compared to other mortgagebacked securities especially after these two institu tions were placed in conservatorship by the federal government in september 2008 and thus ve government backing the chinese government generally does not release detailed information on the holdings of its financial entitie s although some of its banks have reported on their level of exposure to subprime us mortgages14 such entities have generally reported that their exposure to troubled subprime us mort gages has been minor relative to their total investments that they have liquidated such assets andor have written off losses and that they the banks continue to earn high profit margins15 for example the bank of china one of chinas largest st ateowned commercial banks re ported in march 2008 that its investment in assetbacked securities supported by us subprime mortgages totaled 106 billion in 2006 accounting for 35 of its investment securities portfolio in october 2008 it reported that it had reduced holdings of such securities to 33 billion 14 of its total securities investments by the end of september 2008 while its holdings of debt securities issued or backed by freddie mac and fannie mae were at 10 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22984crs4 16 fitch ratings press release january 24 2008 17 although chinese banks have claimed to have earned large profits in recent years many analysts contend the banking system may be weaker than reflected in their reported data large share of bank loans go to stateowned firms nd risk management remains relatively weak slowing chinese economy could produce new wave of nonperforming loans 18 new york times october 23 2008 19 china xinhua news agency october 14 2008 20 south china morning post october 24 2008 21 china xinhua news agency november 4 2008 22 chinaview september 27 2008fitch ratings service reported that the bank of chinas exposure to us sub primerelated investments was the largest among asian financial institutions and that further losses from these investments were lik ely but went on to state that the bank of china would be able to absorb an related losses w ithout undue strain16 however chinese banks are not immune to financial problems17 there are several indicators that chinas economy is slowing which could present difficult challenges for the banking system in the years ahead such as sharp increase in nonperforming loans for example the real estate market in several chinese cities has exhibited signs of bursting bubble including slow down in c onstruction falling prices and growing levels of unoccupied buildings this has increased pr essure on the banks to lower interest rates further to stabilize the market but has raised concerns that doing so could result in higher inflation18 in addition the value of chinas rgest stock market the shanghai stock exchange composite index fell by 67 from january 1 to october 27 2008 chinas media reports that export orders in 2008 have declined sharply from january to august 2008 toy exports were 208 lower than they were during the same period in 2007 and from january to july more than half of chinas toy exporters shut down19 t h federation of hong kong i ndustries recently estimated that 25 million chinese workers employed by hong kong firms in the pear l river delta region could soon lose their jobs20 on november 3 2008 chinese premier wen jiabao warned that 2008 would be the worst in recent times for chinas economy21 chinas response to the crisis china has taken number of steps to re spond to the global financial crisis on september 27 2008 jiabao reportedly stated that what we can do now is to maintain the steady and fast growth of the national economy and ensure th at major fluctuations will happen that will be our greatest contribution to the world economy under the current circumstances22 on october 25 chinese foreig n affairs official was reported by chinas media as saying that china supporte d effective and comprehensive reforms of the global financial system on october 30 another official st ated in the future we are also willing within the ambit of our ab ilities to continue positively considering participating in range of rescue plans on november 14 china reportedly offered 500 million aid package to pakistan on november 15 2008 chinese president hu jintao participated in the summit meetin g of the group of 20 g20 countries inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22984crs5 23 china xinhua news agency special report financial crisis 24 the us treasury department reported on november 19 2008 that in september 2008 china overtook japan to become the largest foreign holder of us treasury securities at 585 billion 25 inside us trade china trade extra september 24 2008washington dc to discuss the current crisis many analysts have urged china to boost its funding to the imf to help stabilize troubled economies in october 8 2008 chinas central bank announced cut 50 basis points to its benchmark interest ra and the reserverequirement ratio which coincided with rate cuts by the us federal reserve and several other major central banks china cut its rates again by 27 basis points on october 29 followi ng the federal reserves cut by 50 basis points china has also indicated plans to make greater efforts to shore up its own economy to promote greater domestic mand boost living standards in the poorer sections of the c ountry achieve more balanced economic growth eg lowering dependency on exports and ddress number of economic and social issues such as boosting energy efficiency lowering pollu tion narrowing income disparities and improving the social safety net such as health care education pensions and social security number of initiatives were nnounced by the government in october 2008 including plans to implement new economic stimulus package including an acceleration of construction projects new export tax rebates tax and interest rate cuts on housing transactions increased agriculture subsidies and new loans for small and mediumsized enterprises and elimination of taxes on interest income from stocks and savings23 on november 9 the chinese gove rnment announced it would implement twoyear 586 billion stimulus package main ly dedicated to infrastructure projects chinas potential role and impl ications for the united states analysts debate what role china might pl ay in responding to the global financial crisis given its huge foreign exchange reserves but its relative reluctance to become major player in global economic affairs and its tendency to be cautious with its reserves some have speculated that china would in order to help stabilize its most important trading partner the united states boost purch ases of us securitie s especially treasury securities in order to help fund the hundreds of billions of dollars that are expected to be spent by the us government to purchas troubled assets and stimulate the economy24 additionally china might try to shore up the us economy by buying us stocks on september 21 2008 the white house indicated that president bush had called chinese president hu jintao about the financial cris is and steps the administration was planning to take an unnamed chinese trade official was reported as statin g that the purpose of that call was to ask for chinas help to deal with this financial crisis by urging china to hold even more us treasury bonds and us ssets the official was further quoted as saying that china recognized that it has stake in the health of the us economy both as major market for chinese exports and in terms of preserving the value of usbased assets held by china and that stabilized us economy was in chinas own interest25 some contend that taking an active role to help the united states and other troubled economies would boost chinas image as positive contributor to world economic stability similar to what occurred during th 1997 1998 asian fina ncial crisis when ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22984crs6 26 for example in june 2007 chinas sovereig n wealth fund bought 3 billion worth of shares from blackstone lp us private equity firm at 31 each but the value of those shares fell to below 8 as of october 2008 27 chinas currency has appreciated by about 19 to the dollar since reforms were made in july 2005 but many us policymakers contend that it remains significantly undervalued 28 most chinese firms that have been allowed to invest overseas are stateowned enterprises 29 for example efforts by chinese stateowned oil company cnooc in 2005 to purchase us energy company unocal was widely opposed in congress and eventually led the chinese company to drop its bid in 2007 chinese firm huawei attempted to buy stake in us technology company 3com but dropped its bid after number of national security concerns were raised in review by the us committee on foreign investment in the united statesoffered financial aid to tha iland and pledged not to devalue its currency even though other east asian economies had done so move that was highly praised by us officials on the other hand there are number of reasons why china might be reluctant to significantly increase its us investments one concern could be whether increased chinese investments in the us economy would produce longter m economic benefits for china some chinese investments in u s financial companies have fared poorly and chinese officials could be reluctant to put additional money into investments that were deemed to be too risky26 secondly sharp economic downturn of the chinese economy would likely increase pressure to invest money at home rather than overseas many analysts including some in china have questioned the wisdom of chinas policy of investing large volume of foreign exchange reserves in us government securities which offer relatively low rate of return when china has such huge development needs at home many chinese officials contend that maintaining strong economic growth in china is the most effective action china can take to promote global economic growth while additional largescale chinese purch ases of us securities might provide shortterm benefits to the us economy nd may be welcomed by some policymakers they could also raise number of issues and concerns some us policymakers have expressed concern that china might try to use its large holdings of us securities as leverage against us policies it opposes for example various chinese government officials reportedly suggested on number of occasions in the past that china could dump or threaten to dump large share of its holdi ngs in order to counter us pressure such as threats of trade sanctions on various trad issues such as chinas currency policy in exchange for new purchases of us debt china would likely expect us policymakers to lower expectations that china will move more rapidly to reform its financial sector andor allow its currency to appreciate more substantially against the dollar27 some analysts have suggested that china could c hoose to utilize its reserves to buy stakes in various distressed us industrie s such as autos however this could also raise concerns in the united states that china was being llowed to buy equity or ownership in us firms at rock bottom prices that technolog and intellectual prope rty from acquired firms could be transferred to chinese business tities boosting their comp etitiveness visavis us firms and that becoming large stak eholder in major us companies would give the chinese government enormous new political influence in the united states28 us policymakers in the past ve sometimes opposed attempts by chinese firms to acquire shares or ownership of us firms29
