return will effectively be paid in taxes these rates can differ significantly from average tax rates measured by dividing tax liability by income because they are affected by timing effective tax rates fell from the early 1950s through the mid1960s rose until the early 1980s and then dropped they have stayed about the same until relatively recently when they fell to an alltime low with bonus

november 24 2006 crs report for congress received through the crs web historical effective marginal tax rates on capital income jane g gravelle senior specialist in economic policy government and finance division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21706 effective marginal tax rates on investment are forwardlooking estimates that project over the lifetime of an investment what share of the return will effectively be paid in taxes these rates can differ significantly from average tax rates measured by dividing tax liability by income because they are affected by timing effective tax rates fell from the early 1950s through the mid1960s rose until the early 1980s and then dropped they have stayed about the same until relatively recently when they fell to an alltime low with bonus depreciation relief of double tax on dividends and lower marginal tax rates the end of bonus deprecation and higher inflation rates increased the tax rates in the past two years this report will be updated as warranted the tax rates which determine investment activity are marginal tax rates on new investment they are calculated by projecting the path of new investment and discounting the flow of income and taxes they take into account the effects of statutory tax rates depreciation rules investment subsidies and inflation the method is to compare the internal rate that discounts the flow to the current value of investment with taxes the aftertax return and the rate without taxes the pretax return the difference between these rates divided by the pretax return is the effective tax rate table 1 shows the estimated tax rates from 1953 to 2005 column 2 presents estimates of the corporate firmlevel tax if depreciation were allowed at economic rates and there were subsidies this rate would equal the corporate statutory tax rate column 3 reports estimates of the total rate on corporate investment accounting for the deductibility of interest at the firm level and the taxation of interest dividends and capital gains at the individual level as well as depreciation and subsidies column 4 presents the estimated rates for unincorporated business proprietorships and partnerships these business tax rates reflect investments in equipment structures and inventory column 5 presents estimated tax rates for owneroccupied housing which is normally close to zero because of the exclusion of implicit net rent from income column 6 provides weighted economywide tax rate congressional research service the library of congress crs2 table 1 marginal effective tax rates on capital income percent corporate

depreciation investment credits and lower statutory tax rates rates rose towards the end of the 1960s with the repeal of the investment credit which was restored in 1971 and led to lower rates rates then began to rise in the mid1970s as inflation resulted in smaller value of depreciation deductions by firms inflation also caused the penalty for not deducting mortgage interest for non itemizers to become more severe increases in depreciation and lower rates adopted in 1981 which were followed by more restrictive depreciation but lower corporate and individual rates in 1986 and slowing inflation led to lower tax rates in the 1980s and 1990s the most recent reductions in tax rates arose from the lower tax rates adopted in the 20012003 legislation the adoption of bonus depreciation in 2002 which was expanded in 2003 and the lower rates on dividends and capital gains adopted in 2003 these changes resulted in historically low tax rate1 the tax rate rose in 2004 due to higher inflation rates and rose again in 2005 due to the end of bonus depreciation lower rates on capital gains are technically temporary expiring in 2010 but may be made permanent the tax rates in table 1 do not account for the tax benefits to investments through httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21706 pensions and individual retirement accounts where tax rates are generally effectively zero about half of passive income interest dividends and capital gains on stock is received in tax exempt form these provisions affect marginal tax rates only if they affect the return to the marginal saving decision many investments in these forms are made up to the maximum contribution limit many pension plans are not under individual control and even where investments are not at the limit all marginal investments may still not flow through the taxfavored account all of these factors suggest not including these tax benefits in marginal calculations however there is probably some marginal effect and if the individual income tax rate on these passive forms of income is set to one half of its value to reflect the share of nontaxed investment returns tax rates would be reduced substantially by about eight percentage points without the lower rates particularly on dividends and capital gains enacted recently about six percentage points otherwise2 methodology for calculating effective tax rates the basic formula for calculating the effective tax rate is r r r where r is the pretax return or internal discount rate for an investment with taxes and r is the after tax discount rate that discounts all flows to the cost of the investment with taxes for business depreciable investment the relationship between r and r with r the firms discount rate derived from an investment with geometric depreciation and continuous time is the standard formula 1 r r 1 uz k 1 auz 1 u 1 for more detailed discussion of the recent tax revisions see crs report rl32099 capital income tax revisions and effective tax rates by jane g gravelle 2 see discussion in crs report rl32099 crs5 where u is the firms statutory tax rate either the individual or corporate rate is the economic depreciation rate z is the present discounted value of depreciation deductions k is the investment tax credit and is determinant of the basis adjustment set at one 05 and zero if there is full basis adjustment ie depreciation allowed only on cost net of the credit half basis adjustment or basis adjustment respectively the formula in 1 is applied to obtain firmlevel tax rates the firmlevel corporate rate in column 2 and the noncorporate rate in column 4 with r weighted average of the aftertax real interest rate i 1 u where i is the interest rate and is the inflation rate and the required real return on equity before individual tax debt is weighted onethird in the case of total corporate tax rates in column 3 the pretax return r is derived from equation 1 but is compared with the return after personal taxes to individuals the same discount rate used for noncorporate business weighted average of the aftertax real return on debt i 1 t where t is the individual tax rate and the aftertax return on corporate equity which is net of taxes on capital gains and dividends in the case of the firm level corporate tax rate in the second column of table httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21706 1 r is the discount rate of the corporate firm before personal level taxes the tax rate for owneroccupied housing omits the effect of depreciation and taxes on profit the pre tax return is simply r f 1 n t ntp where f is the debt share n is the share of investments with individuals who itemize on their tax returns p is the property tax rate and r is the aftertax discount rate if all mortgage interest deductions were allowed but property tax deductions the tax rate would be zero because there is tax on the imputed net rent slight positive or negative tax may arise because of the inability to deduct mortgage interest by nonitemizers and the ability to deduct property taxes by itemizers the mathematical formulas and assumptions used to calculate tax rates including depreciation methods and lives investment credits inflation rates and statutory tax rates as well as the tax rates themselves for 19531989 can be found in jane g gravelle the economic effects of taxing capital income cambridge mit press 1994 appendix b pp 287301 the statutory tax rates interest and inflation rates for 19531989 are in table 21 p 203 tax rates for 19902005 incorporate number of assumptions and tax law changes these include the increase in the tax life for structures from 315 to 39 years in 1993 the lowering of the capital gains tax rate to 20 in 1997 the introduction of bonus depreciation expensing of share of investment at 30 for 2002 and 50 for 2003 and 2004 and the reduction in the tax rate for capital gains and dividends from 20 and the regular tax rate respectively to 15 individual and corporate statutory tax rates and inflation and interest rates are reported in table 2 for 19902005 the pattern of change in individual tax rates is based on the rate reported for the nber simulation model which can be found at httpwwwnberorgtaxsimmratesmrates3html visited november 3 note that this table inadvertently reports the values for 1959 in the row for 1960 and omits the 1960 values of 28 52 20 and 52 for the individual tax rate corporate tax rate inflation rate and interest rate crs6 20 2003 tax rates are assumed to continue at the current years rate slightly lower rates would occur for 2001 and 2002 if the permanent long term rates enacted in 2001 were assumed although rates might also rise due to real bracket creep as well inflation rates are 13 weight of the prior year and
