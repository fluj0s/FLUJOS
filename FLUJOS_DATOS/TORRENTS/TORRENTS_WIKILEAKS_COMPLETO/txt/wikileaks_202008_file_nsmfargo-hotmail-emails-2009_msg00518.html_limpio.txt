more httpwwwthemaneatercomstories200899deniedpermitnationalsocialistmovementplansho denied permit the national socialist movement plans to hold rally during football game denied permit the national socialist movement plans to hold rally during football game by daniel rameysept 9 2008 despite being denied permit to hold parade local neonazi group said it still intends to hold rally in columbia during an upcoming mu home football game but police said they are trying to reach an agreement with the groupw in letter addressed to interim columbia police chief tom dresner the midmissouri chapter of the national socialist movement stood firm on its right to march in columbia on nov 8 the columbia police department denied the groups request for parade permit last week because mu is scheduled to host home football game against kansas state on that day the department said in news release that the two events would overburden police resources on that date we do intend to come on nov 8 with or without permit nsm national director jeff schoep said in the letter it is our legal right and we can do walking picket on city sidewalks according to law schoep said the group would seek legal injunction against the city of columbia if the group was not allowed to march if the nsm is forced back into the courts to challenge violation of our rights once again i will free up every last dime we have at our disposal to hire the absolute best attorney we can find in the state of missouri he said in the letter schoep then cited instances when the group had taken legal action against the cities of orlando and toledo ohio and had earned permit to march after originally being denied one representatives from the nsm met with cpd on monday as part of an appeal to the denial of their request according to statement released by dresner on monday discussions are continuing between the nsm and the department and dresner said it would not comment on the issue until they are recontacted by the nsm regarding their intentions and an agreement is reached between the two parties lt charles wilson leader of the nsms stormtroopers division estimated that there were already 120 people who had booked plane tickets or were planning to drive to the event on nov 8 the groups goal with the march is to protest illegal immigration wilson said we will be there he said schoep also attacked how the police department handled the denial he contested the validity of football game as reason to deny the permit and attacked the manner in which the group was informed of the denial it has been noted that your department informed the press of the initial denial of our permit schoep said in the letter yet we had not been informed by your department if the permit was approved or denied the media informed us so we assume that it may not even be true schoep wrote that the letter was being sent by us postal service on monday to the police department but was released to the media via email beforehand despite the groups criticism with how the denial was handled it said it is still willing to compromise with the city if you are willing to negotiate with us on the terms of the rally and time we are open to amend within reason schoep said in the letter one change the group was willing to make he said would be to cut down the march from the original five hours it requested dresner said the two sides were supposed to meet to discuss the matter on monday httpblogscolumbiatribunecomgovernment200809no_neonazi_fanfarehtml previous entry bocomo buzz home september 08 2008 neonazi fanfare i know our cops reporter joe meyer has already posted on his blog that the neonazis members of the national socialist movement plan to march in columbia nov 8 but since i wrote the three stories last week i wanted to share some things expressed to i got some angry phone calls some people were furious that the paper printed the news on the front page concerned about their kids reading it and finding out what neonazis were many people said our city should simply ignore the group and its efforts and stage an alternative event to show opposition some said more needs to be done such as citizens taking action by signing up for membership with organizations the neonazis oppose such as the antidefamation league and the naacp i did get one call from person who wanted to know where to get more information about the group which he is interested in possibly supporting as journalist i think the media must remain objective to fully serve our readers but i found an interesting approach while researching communitys responses to hate groups i was reading about the effort of citizens in billings mont to combat hate crimes occuring in their city after one incident in which jewish people were attacked the paper ran fullpage ad of menorah which residents tore out and posted everywhere as symbol of unity now i realize this is different because marching is certainly not crime the nsm is as welcome to demonstrate as any other group and as person who lives off the assurance of the first amendment and freedom of speech i respect that but as interim police chief tom dresner pointed out there is point where media coverage helps certain groups more than others the more sensational or outrageous the group the more coverage usually journalistic principles will most likely give the event lots of coverage that will try to reflect both the nsms viewpoint and the viewpoint of others last year that amounted to the nsm rally as the top story and the douglass park picnic as the secondary story but since readers help decide whats newsworthy i was curious to see what kind of coverage you all would like to see filed under hot topics posted by kat hughes at 0248 pm tv news nbc channel 8
