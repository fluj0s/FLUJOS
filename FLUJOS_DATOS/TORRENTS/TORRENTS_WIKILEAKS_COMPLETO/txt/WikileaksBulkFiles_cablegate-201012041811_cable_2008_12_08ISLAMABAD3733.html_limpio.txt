received readout from the uk embassy on their meetingscalls over the weekend high commissioner brinkley and uk cos met president zardari on sunday november 30 during the meeting fm miliband called zardari uk passed the same lashkaretaiba let info to zardari that they previously had passed to isi 9 s zardaris response was positive he said isi had to follow up and this was an opportunity he criticized the indians for statements that pushed islamabad to make defensive response and made my job harder zardari said he thought it was not possible that terrorists could have launched attack boats from karachi and the operation could not have been implemented without insider help from indians 10 c in the conversation with miliband zardari said he saw the attacks as an opportunity to strike at my enemies the attack he said was aimed as much at pakistan as at india but india had reacted in an unfortunate way miliband said that public messaging would be particularly important to link the mumbai atrocity with zardaris own campaign against militants 11 c zardari told miliband that my people had not brought specific information to him about the individuals named in the information passed to isi on the day before miliband said that let needed to feel the full force of the law zardari responded by saying he was setting up special courts was contacting all political parties and would take action nfi immediately 12 c miliband described isi mg pasha as welcome new broom and expressed uk support for isi reform zardari said the new isi leaders were straightforward and their roles were proscribed by the constitution but it would take time for real conversions brinkley and miliband pressed for islamabad 00003733 002 of 002 pasha to go to india zardari gave brinkley long answer about various levels of directors in isi but finally confirmed that the army had vetoed the decision to send pasha zardari told miliband that it might be possible to send nsa durrani as he outranked pasha it would not be possible said zardari to send pasha immediately as zardari needed to work public opinion first 13 c zardari commented that he had gut reaction that the attacks were the beginning rather than the end and went on to talk about muslimhindu differences and attempts to split india he urged the uk to push back on new delhi and calm the situation miliband said they would do so but india needs to see real action from pakistan india was asking for shortterm actions and this could buy some time for the gop 14 c miliband later called fm qureshi and said the uk would be sure he saw the intelligence passed to isi he pressed that india needs actions not words from pakistan qureshi said he would follow up on the intelligence but reiterated the gop request for the uk to counsel restrain on the part of the indians 15 c high commissioner brinkley also called on chinese ambassador to islamabad hui over the weekend zardari had called hui and hui said he had met with kayani but did not share much in the way of information gleaned from the meeting hui was cagey on how much or what kind of assistance china has provided to help with pakistans economic crisis on the friends of pakistan hui expressed continuing skepticism that the group did not have clear enough mandate is not focused and will turn into talk shop hui was noncommittal when brinkley raised concern about chinas reported decision to assist pakistan build two additional civilian nuclear reactors chasma ii and iii 16 c see septel for special media reaction overall the pakistani public remains in denial about any culpability for the mumbai attacks and believes india is unfairly and prematurely accusing pakistan patterson
