of the new department of homeland security there has been widespread interest in reorganizing the house and senate committee systems to handle homeland security issues more effectively some changes to the committee systems have already been made but there are calls for still more comprehensive action recommendations of the 911 commission among the many issues discussed in the report of the commission were group of reco mmendations intended tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21360crs2 1 the 911 commission report fi nal report of the national commission on terrorist attacks on the united states p 421 http wwwgpoaccessgov911indexht ml visited aug 12 2004strengthen congressional oversight of intelligence and homeland security concerning homeland security the commission recommended establishment of standing committee in each chamber to assume responsibility over the topic congress should create single principal poi nt of oversight and review for homeland security congressional leaders are best able to judge what committee should have jurisdiction over this department and its duties but we believe that congress does have the obligation to choose one in the house and one in the senate and that this committee should be permanent standing committee with nonpartisan staff1 two house homeland security committees the house created temporary select committee on homeland security that was directed to coordinate recommendations on the bill made by half dozen different house standing committees the homeland security committee compiled comprehensive proposal led house floor debate on the bill and served as the central negotiating team in resolving differences between the house and senate versions of the bill when pl 107296 was signed into law the select committee on homeland security was abolished but not before the new law included language in s ection 1503 stating it is the sense of congress that each house of congress should review its committee st ructure in light of the reorganization of responsibilities within the executive branch by the establishment of the department the house deferred immediate action cr eating in january 2003 new select committee on home land security this new committee was to serve during the 108th congress as the house focus for legislativ and oversight coordination for homeland security issues while other house committees retained their more limited legislative and oversight authority over homeland security most significantly the select committee was directed to report by september 30 2004 its recommendations for changes in the house committee system by comparison the senate in the 108th congress has continued to consider homeland security issues within its existing committee structure appropriations subcommitt ee for homeland security the structure of the house and senate appropr iations committees have been changed to account for the creation of the new department in ear ly february 2003 the house appropriations committee approved an internal reorganization plan which abolished the former subcommittee on treasury and postal serv ice appropriations and transferred its responsib ilities to renamed subcommittee on tran sportation treasury and independent agencies appropriations with this cons olidation new thirteenth subcommittee on homeland security was established and it wa s assigned jurisdic tion over appropriations for the new department and for bureaus in othe r departments transferred to it the senate appropriations committee shortly thereafter followed suit to ensure that the subcommittee structures of the two committees were parallel calls for further change many members have already endorsed further changes to the committee system number of proposals have been offered in the house and senate to establish new temporary select permanent select or standing committee on homeland security to alter the appropriations process or to make other changes in congressional structures

for additional information see crs report rs21643 house committee system jurisdiction and referral reform options by judy schneider and paul rundquistobserved in 2002 that creation of the new depa rtment probably will require at least reorganization of the current committees senator active in crafting the final version of the homeland security department bill stated it is hard to see how congress could do decent job of authorizing and overseeing what the new department does without new committee of homeland security on the other hand number of members have publicly opposed any alteration of house or senate committee structures while others have endorsed or opposed such action at different times2 from the perspective of the executive branch reduction in committee jurisdiction fragmentation limits the number of panels to which officials of the new agency will be answerable although the house and senate have undertaken some initia l steps to revise their committee structures the report of the 911 commission may add additional pressure for congressional action this report examines various options for the house and senate individually or jointly to consider in reorga nizing its structures dealing with homeland security and discusses possible adva ntages and disadvantages of each options for congressional organization3 timetable for reform not only is there discussion about what changes should be made in congressional struct ures but there is also discu ssion about when such changes should be made with the 911 commissions recent recommendations and the september 30 2004 deadline for committee syst em reform proposals from the house homeland security committee some say reforms are so vital that they should be adopted before congress adjourns for the election these advocates can point to the 1974 house committee reforms which were passed just before the elections that year other say it would be best to defer such action until the beginning of the new congress in january after the election the voters will have supplie d fresh mandates and the house and senate will have time in january before the inauguration to consider more comprehensive reform options thoroughly the house adopts its rules for the new congress on the first session day and these re forms could include substantial changes to its committee structure the senates rules are deemed to be in place automatically at the beginning of new congress however some believe there will be attempts on the first day of the new congress to change the senate s cloture rule and other rules relating to the consideration of executive nominations these efforts could open the door to consideration of committee system changes as well retain current structure congress could decide that the current system is sufficient to monitor the work of the new department chan ges would be made in either jurisdiction or referral procedures some may argue that it is too soon to know howhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21360crs4 4 joint committee on the organization of congress background materials s upplemental information provided to members of the joint committee

would enable the chambers to also address other committee jurisdiction and organization issues for example press reports have indicated the possibility of recreating house committee on merchant marine and fisherie s see ben pershing cubin joins chase for resources roll call apr 25 2002 p 1 in addition because of the shifting majority in the senate most senators now hold more committee and subcommittee assignments than the rules permitmuch legislative workload the new department will cause house and senate committees in the immediate aftermath of the 2001 terro rist attacks all congressional committees sought involvement in terrorism matters more recently the involvement of committees with only minor claims to jurisdic tion seems to have tapered off historically there has been necessary connection between an executive reorganization and congressi onal committee reorganization several hous and senate committees were combined to create the new armed services committees in 1947 at about the same time that the department of defense was created the armed services committees promptly created subcommittees that closely matched the former standing committees that had been merged in the committee reorganization on the other hand the department of energy was created after the senate had consolidated energy jurisdiction in its committees but before the house completed realignment of its energy jurisdictions in 1980 the creation of the partment of health education and welfare now health and human services was not accompanied by any change in house or senate committee jurisdictions reorganize entire system either chamber or both chambers acting separately or jointly could undertake an extensive reorganization of the committee system substantial house committee reorganization took place in 1995 but it has been quarter century since the senate comprehensively reorganized its committees the joint committee on the organization of congress in the 103rd congress considered numerous options for such reorganization but did not dir ectly address the issue of terrorism or anti terrorism jurisdiction4 comprehensive reorganizati on could allow both chambers to address other jurisdiction issues which have emerged in recent years5 nevertheless comprehensive reorganization is normally c ontroversial and rarely contemplated under very short deadlines realign committee jurisdiction within the existing system either or both chambers could choose to realign their committee jurisdictions within the existing structure that would entail changing cham ber rules past experience indicates that members generally have been loathe to overhaul the committee system especially during congress rules changes are traditionally adopted at the beginning of new congress in the senate because there is need to r eadopt senate rules at the beginning of new congress committee reorganization would have to be considered separately httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21360crs5 in either chamber it would be possible to add jurisdictional aspects of certain homeland security topics to the jurisdicti on of specific committees without altering the existing subject jurisdictions of committees over other topics for example jurisdiction over national energy policy ge nerally was assigned to the house energy and commerce committee in 1980 without significant altera tion to other committees jurisdictions change referral system both chambers typically refer measures to single committee by determining primary jurisdiction in the house and predominant jurisdiction in the senate in the house most multiple referrals are sequential although joint referrals were permitted until 1995 changing the referral system could enable all interested committees to maintain legisla tive and oversight jurisdicti on for example the speaker of the house who has the discretionary authority to impose time limits on referrals could be required to impose one on all committees i nvolved in multiple referral of homeland securityrelated bill in addition for legi slation on homeland security the house could allow joint referrals in the 108th congress house rule s allow referral without designation of primary committee under exceptional circumstances in the senate which generally requires unanimous consent for multiple referrals party leaders could invoke their littleused au thority to recommend re ferrals to several committees by debatelimited moti on however major changes in house or senate bill referral rules could complicate action on homel and security matters and could be nearly as controversial as jurisdictional realignment create new standing committee over homeland security new standing committee could be created in either or both chambers such panel could have legislative responsibility over all aspects of the department of homeland security questions regarding whether the new committee would absorb jurisdiction from existing panels or overlap with them would need to be decided would special oversight authority broader in scope than the committees legislative jurisdiction be granted to it create select committee over homeland security the house has created two temporary select committees to deal with homeland security in the wake of the 2001 attacks select committee with the same or revised jurisdiction could be established in the 109th congress with or without the creati on of companion select committee in the senate if such new panel we re created would it have legi slative authority for example in the same manner as do the current intelligence select committees if it were limited to conducting oversight how and through what process would its findings be converted into legislative recommendations in vi ew of the recommendations of the 911 commission about the house nd senate permanent sel ect committees on intelligence will the views of the house and senate bout creating such select committees on other subjects change create joint committee on homeland security the house and senate could create joint committee to oversee the work of the new department however only one joint committee in the last halfcentury s been granted legislative jurisdiction if such joint panel were created the question of sequential referrals to existing standing committees could still be raised the house and senate acted separately in the 107th congress to permit the two intelligence committees to hold an inquiry into intelligencefailures prior to the terrorist attacks nothing in house or senate rules would preclude existing house or senate committees from holding joint hearings in the interests ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21360crs6 6 such action is not unprecedented the house cided in 1977 to extend the life of the ad hoc committee on the outer continental shelf for an additional period to allow it to monitor the implementation of the law the consideration of which had caused its initial creation 7 for further information see crs report rl31572 appropriations subcommittee structure history of changes from 19202003 by james v saturno greater efficiency some view joint committees as means to permit more efficient congressional review of policy areas while others believe that separate committees help preserve chamber autonomy and enc ourage independent committee initiatives create leadership committee small committee comprised of members named by chamber party leaders could act to coordinate homeland secu rity legislative and oversight work among other committees in the chamber the 107th congress house homeland security select committee was just such leadership panel and similarly constituted panel could be reestablished on more permanent basis6 use less formal means to coordinate policy in both the house and senate many committees claiming res ponsibility for specific policy areas have entered into memoranda of understanding or agr eements among the concerned committees reflecting each panels appropriate jurisdiction over disputed policy area these memoranda serve as guidance to the parliamentarians offices in making bill referrals and may obviate the immediate need for formal revision in committee jurisdictions the senate also makes use of temporar standing orders unanimous consent agreements typically in force for the current congress only that modify the standing rules of the senate one or more temporary st anding orders could be used to allocate jurisdiction among senate committees over homeland security issues subject to renewal or modification at the beginning of each succeeding congress if successful the temporary orders could be c onverted into more permanent changes in senate procedure if not other realignmen ts could be attempted further realign appropriations committees subcommittees the house and senate appropr iations committees adapted their st ructures in 2003 to create new subcommittee on homeland security7 additional recommendations by the 911 commission include proposal to set out intelligence appropriati ons in separate appropriations bill or to combine author ization and appropriations for intelligence activities in only one panel in each chamber additional changes may be required in the appropriations committees structures and the procedures through which they draft both regular and supplementa l appropriations bills
