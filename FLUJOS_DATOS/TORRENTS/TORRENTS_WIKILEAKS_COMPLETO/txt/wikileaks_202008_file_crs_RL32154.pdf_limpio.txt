natural resources policy resources science and industry division httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32154marine protected areas an overview summary there continues to be congressional interest in limiting human activity in certain areas of the marine environment as one response to mounting evidence of declining environmental quality and popul ations of living resources the purposes of proposed additional limits would be both to stem declines and to permit the rehabilitation of these environments and populations one method of implementing this concept is for congress to designate areas where activities would be limited often referred to as marine protected areas mpas translating the mpa approach into national program however would require that c ongress resolve many economic ecological and social dilemmas the complexity of creating program is compounded by controversy over the uses that would be allowed curtailed or prohibited in mpas the purposes of system of mpas and the location size nd distribution of mpa units one possible way to get past some of these complexities is to think of mpa designations as form of zoning in the ocean experiences rela ted to designating mpas in other countries also may be instructive however questi ons have arisen about the effectiveness of administration and enforcement the benef its and costs of mpas and the evaluation of outcomes at some sites numerous marine sites have been designated by fede ral and state governments for some kind of protection perhaps the bestknown federal site s are units in the national marine sa nctuary system the national marine sanctuaries act authorizes the secretary of commerce to designate areas of marine and great lakes environments to protect cultural and natural resources the bush administration also has supported the mpa concept it designated the papah naumokukea marine national monument northwe stern hawaiian islands ma rine national monument in 2006 as one of the worlds largest mp as and has supported the activities of the national marine protected areas center in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration it has continued most of the clinton administration initiatives to coordinate protection of marine resources at designated sites including implementing executive order 13158 may 2000 which endorsed comprehensive system of mpas additional actions by congress would be needed to create an mpa system that could be characterized as integrated or comprehensive some issues that would likely be raised in congressional discu ssions include whether new legislation is desired or needed what the basic characteristics of units in any mpa system should be how mpas might be used to resolve use conflicts and whet her adequate funding would be authorized and ppropriated to both enforce the protected status and evaluate the ecological and social impacts of mpas over the last three decades congress has examined the concepts behi nd mpas and experiences with protected areas as it considered appr opriations and proposals to r eauthorize coastal and marine resource protection laws the 110th congress has consider ed some mparelated activities such as enhancing coral reef conservation modifying boundaries and protections for three nationa l marine sanctuaries and reauthorizing the national marine sanctuary act httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32154contents m r i n p r t c

zinnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32154marine protected areas an overview many coastal and offshore ecosystem s continue to be degraded by anthropogenic causes despite efforts to control or limit them the causes of degradation are numerous and can include pollutants runoff carrying sediment and chemicals from land coastal development introduction of nonnative or invasive species overfishing and bycatch habitat alteration and rising sea level and climate change the public is becoming aware of degraded marine areas because of widely publicized incidents and trends including large seasonal dead zone in the gulf of mexico the environmental effects of oil spills population declines of many popular fish species to levels that can longer sustain commercial or even recreational harvests and deterioratin g coral reefs reef bleaching current approaches to managing resources in th marine environment often appear to be ineffective because of continuing population and environmental qua lity declines thus prompting search for alternatives marine protected areas mpas are generally defined as areas reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environment some observers often including scientists and environm ental advocates recommend designating mpas to achieve management and conservation goals from their perspective the designation of mpas is not panacea that responds to all causes of degradation or leads to quick recovery for all degraded environments but in many cases they contend that mpas are necessary for protecting and restoring the marine environment policy makers are looking at how this tool has worked alternative ways that mpas can be designed and whether and how mpas might be broadly applied li ttle opposition has been expressed bout the overall concept of establishing mpas but some of the mo re specific discussions about which uses would be limited or prohibited have been controversial oil and gas development the fishing industry and othe r marine industries have cons istently expressed concerns with the use of mpas these industries question whether the use of mpas would afford the proper balance between conservation and economic activities the 110th congress has considered reaut horization of the national marine sanctuary act nmsa 16 usc 1431 et seq with introduction of hr 6537 and by holding several hearings but gislation has been passed many hold that nmsa comes closest to authorizing mpas it authorizes the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to desi gnate specific sites for

provide spatial protecti on in marine areas it then c onsiders some of the key issues and potential benefits and co sts of designating additiona l mpas it concludes by summarizing current congre ssional interest in the t opic and legislation proposed during the 110th congress existing federal laws related to the use of mpas are summarized in the appendix the concept of marine protected areas the term mpa has been used to characterize spatial protection of marine resources but ambiguities exist regarding the level of protection that qualifies an area as an mpa protection might be cons idered on continuum from protection to complete protection where all human activities within an area are prohibited those areas afforded complete protection would certainly quality as mpas but areas closed to specific use or to protect species might not virtually all of us waters are protected in some manner but all us waters are not considered mpas often the definition depends on the context such as the characteristics of the resources at risk and the extent of associated threat s the following section provides basic definitions of mpas but application of the concept is likely to evolve with improvements in scientif ic understanding of the marine environment and development of associated institutions definition mpas have been defined in many ways definitions usually include three criteria 1 geographically defined and bounded places 2 approaches that manage systems rather than indivi dual resources or species and 3 programs that take longterm perspective on res ource management the definition currently being used in this country found in section 2 of eo 13158 on marine protected areas defines mpas as any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by federal state territorial tribal or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natu ral and cultural resources therein the eo 13158 definition is very similar to what is probably the most widely used definition in the world develope d by the international union for the conservation of nature iucn it states that an mpa is an area of intertidal or subtidal terrain together with its overl ying water and associated flora fauna historical and cultural featur which has been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environment1 each designated area must be minimum of 1000 hectares 2471 acres this definition is then applied to distinct categories of areas that reflect wide range of possible management objectives the iucn specifies that sites meet this definition only when at leasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32154crs3 threequarters of designated mpa is managed for the primary category and management of the remaining area is not in conflict the iucn categories are category 1 strict nature reservewilderness area managed mainly for science or wilderness protection category 1a strict nature reserve managed mainly for science category 1b strict nature reserve managed mainly for wilderness protection category 2 national park protected and managed mainly for ecosystem protection and recreation category 3 national monument managed mainly for conservation of specific natural features category 4 habitat species management area managed mainly for conservation through ma nagement intervention category 5 protected landscapeseascape managed mainly for landscapeseascape conservation and recreation category 6 managed resource protected area managed mainly for the sustainable use of natural ecosystems as one becomes more specific about po ssible goals and objectives for an mpa the question of how mpas would be define d quickly grows complex they could involve state and federal jurisdiction each with different go als and responsibilities they could emphasize either some species perhaps the commercially most valuable or the rarest ones over others or the ge neral health of the entire ecosystem over individual components among the questions currently receiving the most attention are 1 would certain activities or uses be automatically prohibited at all pl aces designated as mpas such as automatically closing them to all resource extractive activities or would list of permitted and prohibited ac tivities be developed for each designated area or category of areas nd 2 would environmental conditions or resource uses beyond the boundaries of mp as be managed to limit adverse effects on resources within mpas definitions are one way to convey expect ations about an mpa program for example one could conclude that most of the gulf of maine is protected by an impressive web of areas designated for variety of reasons however closer examination shows that most of these designations protect single commercial fish species or group of species or limit speci fied activity some want mpas to be based on broad definition to include designations where protections are limited to few resources or uses while others will want it to apply only to sites where resources are strictly protected between these two possibilities are many intermediate approaches this debate over definition continues because the mpa concept has been used in many different ways several narro wer terms are being used to describe types of places that provi high levels of pr otection and they also have been used with different meanings these places might also be called mpas although they are often expressed as if they were alternatives to mpas these terms include marine reserve where uses that remove resources are generally prohibited these areas may also be called ecological reserveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32154crs4 2 although many of these areas have been in existence for decades in 2007 the mpa center completed its inventory of mpas in the united states that was based on its mpa definition 3 for example less than 3 of total mpa ar ea in the united states is notake prohibits fishing or less than 1 of all us watersocean wilderness like the terrestrial concept for wilderness areas on federal lands where alterations or activities that leave lasting impacts are permitted but lowimpact recreational activities may be permitted fully protected marine area generally notake area where wide variety of extractive and consumptive usesactivities are prohibited national marine sanctuary specific designation created in federal legislation more than 30 years ago to ensure conservation and management for areas of special national significance marine managed area managing for multiple objectives where protection is not the only and ma not even be the main objective and marine park similar to the terrestrial concept for park where recreational activities are allowed and resource conservation is also goal of the designation administrative actions according to the mpa center defi nition approximately 1700 mpas are managed by federal state and territorial agencies in us waters2 these areas cover 34 of us marine waters and vary widely in level of protection restrictions on human uses and overall purpose3 less than 30 of mpas are managed by federal agencies but because of the large size of several federal mpas nearly 85 of the total mpa area in us waters is under federal jurisdiction about 90 of mpas permit access and multiple use including fi shing most are permanent providing protection throughout the year and most have been established since 1970 noaa manages mpas for fisheries management national marine fisheries service units of the national estuarine research reserve system coastal programs in national ocean service and the national marine sanctuary program national ocean service the department of the interior manages marine areas that are part of the national wildlife refuge system fish and wildlife service national parks national park service and national monuments fish and wildlife service and national park service num ber of federal laws and pr ograms already exist and they have been summarized in the appendix it is thus apparent that the protecti on of marine resource areas through mpas is not new concept but what is relatively new is the increasing interest in developing coordina ted nationwide system of marine protected areas this interest has been heightened by actions initiated by the clinton administration and continued by the bush administration this concep t has diffuse roots and has been most evident among scientists and so nongovernmental organizations president clinton responded to growin g concerns about marine resource degradation in several ways he issued executive order 13089 on coral reefhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32154crs5 4 the first plan turning to the sea americas ocean future was announced by cabinet level task force created at the national ocean conference in 1998 it was released september 2 1999 the second was the national action plan to preserve coral reefs prepared by the

marine protected areas7 mpa center activities in 2000 the national mpa center was created to implement eo 13158 to develop framework for national system of mpas and to provide federal state territorial tribal and local governments with the information technologies and st rategies to support the system8 in 2003 the center established 30member mpa advisory committee that has provided broad representation of marine regi ons including the great lakes and the us territories the committees main purpose is to provide advice to the secretaries of commerce and the interior on developing national system of mpas in march of 2008 the center released revised draft framework containing set of recommendations for developing national system of mpas the framework deve loped after numerous workshops and advisory committee meetings proposes guiding principles goals and objectives and definitions for national system9 the mpa center has built domestic inventory of federal state local and tribal mpas to inform the development of the national system called for in eo 1315810 the inventory may be used to pr ovide information for environmental assessments to lay foundation for objectiv analysis in designing national mpa system and to provide centralized source of information that can be used to help protect marine resources the inventory contains info rmation such as management authority for nearly 1700 sites other initiatives of the center include virtual library and education projects to increase knowledge and awareness about mp as the center provides educators

improve management efficiencies increase joint planning efforts enhance public education and improve law enforcement and rescue capabilities states have also been engaged in deve loping and using mpas with california being perhaps the most active californi authorities have been working to reach consensus on comprehensive program of mpas in state coastal waters under the 1999 marine life protection act assembly bill 993 in april 2007 the california department of fish and game adopted regulations to establish 29 marine reserves along the central california coast from pi geon point in san mateo county to point conception in santa barbara county11 the central coast is the first of five regions to complete the planning and implement ation process the reserves include 204 square miles or approximately 18 of state waters with 85 square miles designated as notake marine reserves recreational and commerc ial fishing interests opposed the proposal because of the reduced harvest opportunities it imposes while environmental interests view this as good start to more extensive protection other states have also taken action for exam ple hawaii enacted legislation act 306 in 1998 to establish network of marine aquarium reserves along the konakohala coast of the island of hawaii potential benefits issues and challenges motivation for designating mpas appears to be generated by the expectation that the intensity of human activities in the marine environment will continue to grow and that this growth will exacerbate use conflicts and further degrade ecosystems the benefit most often cite d by proponents of mpas is protection and restoration of ecosystems ge nerally and more specifically valued fish populations additional benefits may include new educational and recreationa l opportunities expanded tourism protection of cultural resources shipwrecks for example and contributions to basic science and to improved envir onmental conditionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32154crs8 while debate about the bene fits and costs of mpas focuses most frequently on the role mpas might play in the recove ry of fish populations they could provide other benefits mpas could be source of baseline scientific data about current and changing conditions in the marine environment and serve as system so that baselines and changes could be compared among locations particularly as climate change alters marine ecosystems in this capacity mpas would provi set of benefits not unlike one of the purposes that was articulated in legislation creating the national estuarine research rese rve system component of the federal coastal zone management program discussed below mpas could serve as education destinations providing opportunities for diving to observe the marine environment related onshore support centers could be developed to inform larger segment of the general public about resources prot ected in an mpa and the benefits that accompany the protected designation mpas could provide other envi ronmental services such as sequestering carbon providing impr oved habitat for corals and expanding mangroves that coul d dampen possible damages from hurricanes and other coastal storms mpas could protect cultural artifacts such as shipwrecks and other places of historical significance including places held sacred by native peoples the first national marine sanctuary was designated to protect the site where the remains of the civil war ironclad monitor came to rest after sinking in 1862 off north carolina mpas could become an attraction that makes them destinations for tourists and recreation activity activities may take place in mpas or in nearby shore facilities such as aquaria or museums unit in the national park service system buck island reef national monument with its snorkeling trail is an example of such place commercial interest s have responded that many of these benefits can be generated under current laws and programs these in terests assert that new initiatives should not duplicate other marine related legislation such as the magnuson stevens fishery conservation and manageme nt act msfcma or the coastal zone management act czma they also maintain that the benefits of additional protection must be weighed against the costs of constraining or prohibiting commercial activities fisheries the strongest and most vocal support of mpas often is based on the potential role for mpas in protectin g and restoring fish populations by limiting the activities of commercial and recreational fishermen not only does overfishing reduce populations of desirable species but interactions with fishing gear can result in the mortality of nontarget species bycat ch and degrade habitat the benefits of mpas identified in these studies includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32154crs9 12 stephan r palumbi marine reserves tool for ecosystem management and conservation prepared for the

odiversity more generally within mpa boundaries managing fishery populations by controlling commercial and recreational harvest ra tes and protecting locations where populations congregate at critical points in their life cycles such as spawning grounds and nursery habitats reducing damage to habitat protecting rare threatene d or endangered species preserving or restoring the viability of representative habitats and protecting portions of larger ecosystems from overharvesting12 considerable scientific and social bate continues on the potential merits of mpas some of the strongest opposition to mpas is raised by fishing interests that could be hurt by designation in this debate fishing intere sts question whether mpas would have unacceptable socioeconomic consequences when compared to the benefits that would be generated an important element in this discussion of possible tradeoffs is the recognition that mpa designations can displace resource use from protected areas to nearby areas either transferring or raising new management issues by displacing fishing effort mpa proponents assert that some fish are likely to stray into adjacent unprotected areas where they might benefit fishermen however without other management ac tions protecting one area may lead to overuse or excessive harvest in other ar eas moving or concentrating rather than resolving the biological management issu among the most contentious aspects of designating and managing mpas for fishery management are deciding whether and where mpas might be appropriate for restoring fish populations deciding whether certain fish ing techniques should be limited or prohibited because they capture nontarget species and damage marine habitat determining how mpa protection w ould be integrated with other management measures both with in and outside the mpa and understanding the effects of mpas on the economic social and cultural wellbeing of nearby coastal communities fishing disproportionately removes larger and older fish often because they are more highly valued by recreationa l and commercial fishermen and because of regulations protect smaller and fastergrowi ng fish to increase stock yields older females produce greater numbers of eggs th an the same biomass of younger females because egg production is gene rally proportional to fish volume for some species larvae produced by older females are more likely to survive because older females produce eggs with greater amount of food reserves13 mpas could be beneficial if fish remain in the protected area and grow to relatively larger sizes thereforehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32154crs10 14 pisco partnership for interdisci plinary studies of coastal oceans the science of marine reserves 2007 at httpwwwpiscoweborg 15 dr robert l shipp take marine protected areas mpas as fishing management tool programmatic perspective report to the fishamerica foundation alexandria va 2002 protected areas such as mpas appear to be most beneficial to sedentary reef associated species or more generally to sp ecies which strongly associate with certain habitat features that cause these species to restrict their movement in these situations species would also benefit if unique habitat can be identified and protected for all the discussion of how protected areas would benefit fisheries there remain large uncertainties bout the effects of mpas on the size and characteristics of fish populations and on ecosystem com ponents more generally studies of mpas show that population biomass size of fi sh density in given area and species diversity have increased within mpas14 others counter that improvements were often inevitable because of previous management failures that resulted in extremely low population levels some fishery expe rts conclude that consistent use of traditional approaches to fisheries management such as size limits catch limits or seasons are more effective management tools than establishing places where all fishing is permanently prohibited15 challenges to mpa siting and design translating the concept of mpas into an extensive system would present multiple challenges many of these can be documented by tracking the experiences and issues addressed both at noaas mpa center and at other organizations ar ound the world charged with mparelated responsibilities or by reviewing the types of controversies that have been raised when national marine sanctuaries have been proposed an initia l set of challenges centers on selection of sites the approach to establishing mpas often reflects the answers to several questions what criteria representative habitats ecological integrity social acceptability degree of degradation diversity of species presence of endangered species and so forth should determine mpa locations sizes and boundaries should particular species or ecosyst ems be protected if protection is based on ecosystems can only portions be protected both because it is almost impossible to protect an entire ecosystem in such dynamic setting and because migra tory species move across many ecosystems should boundaries of an mpa be decided based on geographic areas or on ecosystems which are often fragmented if an mpa is adjacent to the coast could it also include waterways that drain into it or associated terrestrial areas should sites that are already prot ected under other designations with purposes that are similar to mpas be given higher priority to receive an mpa designation or lower one since they are already protectedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32154crs11 16 s j fiske sociocultural aspects of establishing marine protected areas ocean and coastal management v 17 1 1992 2546 17 nautical mile nm 6076 feet is equal to 115 statute miles 5280 feet these challenges represent only fraction of potential siting issues many of the areas that are likely to be considered for mpas already ve had extensive human use and effects of this use are freque ntly the reason for proposing designation proposals to designate units under the fede ral national marine sanctuaries program have generated controversy because of opposition from inte rests who may have their activities curtailed the designation process which has lasted several years in some cases has resulted in protract ed debates among interests or stakeholders and some proposals have been rejected because of an inability to resolve these conflicts the success or failure of mpa designations is far more likely to reflect socioeconomic cultural and political factors than to reflect biological considerations perceptions are likely to be positive for st akeholders including resource users if designations are viewed as based on fair equitable and transparent process for establishing and managing sites clearly stated goals for the site and expanding benefits while containing costs in one example study compared successful national marine sa nctuary designation in american samoa with an unsuccessful one in puerto rico and attributed much of the difference in outcomes to the attention given to local cultural social and economic circumstances and institutions one such difference was that success required retaining local voice in management decisions16 marine jurisdiction mpas of various sorts have been established in range of aquatic habitats in cluding open ocean coastal areas in tertidal zones estuaries and the great lakes in these areas states and the federal government assert varying degrees of authority over activities ffecting living and nonliving resources ownership and control also are viewed differently in marine areas where there is little private ownership although submerged nds especially in nearshore areas are sometimes leased generally the degree of control increases as one moves toward shore from the seaward extent of the ex clusive economic zone eez 200 nautical miles nm17 from shore to the baseline line that generally follows the shoreline governments also protect environmental qua lity and lease the surface and subsurface for numerous activities most notably oil nd gas extraction zones or areas defined in ocean and coastal areas include state waters shoreline to 3 nm territorial sea shoreline to 12 nm contiguous zone 12 to 24 nm exclusive economic zone 12 to 200 nm and the high seas beyond 200 nm the range of marine organisms and ssociated ecosystems seldom conform to these political and national boundaries this presents management challenges when activities harmful to an mpa occur outside jurisdictional boundaries of the agency managing the mpa or when organisms m ove into other jurisdictions potential benefits of mpas are likely to be di ssipated unless agreements can harmonize protection efforts beyond mpa and jurisdictional boundaries zoning an mpa designation might not require that an entire site be administered under one set of rules many proponents have advocated zoninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32154crs12 18 garry russ and dirk zeller from mare liberum to mare reservarum marine policy v 27 2003 7578 19 statement of william p dubose

1991approach subdividing site into subunits with different levels of protection or protection for different purposes zoning would allow managing agencies to achieve multiple policy objectives zoning of protected marine area to provide different levels of protection was probably first implemented by the great barrier reef marine park authority in australia in the early 1980s and has more recently been adopted elsewhere such as the florida keys national marine sanctuary subdividing designated areas may be especially useful in areas where use pressures and activities are most concentrated the notion of zoning is welldevelope d on land but there is little experience with what adjustments might be needed to apply it effectively in an aquatic environment one reason is that this cept is at odds with the traditional view that the ocean is free to all and boundless able to accommodate all uses in its vast expanse this view was more widely accepted when technology to gain access to deep water resources was limited and before claims of 200mile eezs become an accepted international practice national management of areas beyond the relatively narrow territorial sea is relatively r ecent development and is still evolving in recent years zoning of ocean areas has been getting more attention18 the goal of these efforts is to reduce spillover effects among competing uses that result in

column ocean floor and subsurface resources at the same time scientific research is developing more accurate accounting of baseline conditions in th marine environment and effects of technologies on these conditions other issues another widely discussed issue is the desire of some to limit or prohibit offshore energy activities includi ng extraction and transport this issue is highly visible because of marine damage from oil spills around the world often accompanied by birds or animals soaked in oil during the 1980s and early 1990s oil and gas development interests stressed the need to recognize multiple uses of the marine environment they expressed concern that attempts to designate national marine sanctuaries were being used to promote political agenda directed toward prohibiting oil and gas development in offshore areas19 several recent proposals to locate wind farm s in offshore areas have raised the same kind of not in my backyard nim by responses that have been voiced for

be considered in any decision process national reports number of recent national reports ve studied and made recommendations concerning marine conserva tion and the potential use of mpas in particular the 2003 pew oceans commission report and the 2004 us co mmission on cean policy report provide recommendations on ocean policy issues intended for policy makers these reports as well as the 2001 report on mpas from the national research council view the current pi ecemeal approach to marine resource management as contributing to the decline in marine environmental health many supporters of the mpa concept draw from th reports as they encourage congress to replace the current approach with mo re systematic and coordinated response many of these supporters have endor sed the pew oceans commission and us commission on ocean policy recommendati ons as startin g place for policy discussions the 2001 nrc report on mpas20 did not make recommendation about whether additional legislation might be sirable or whether new law addressing mpas is needed although it did recognize the fragmented nature of current efforts it discussed the costs and benefits of mpas in comp arison to more conventional management tools explored the feasib ility of implementati on and assessed the scientific basis and adequacy of techniques for th design of mpas and marine reserves among its conclusions the re port recommended that mpas can be most successful if all stakeholders are enlisted to pa rticipate in developing management plans effective planning and sign are provided and integral components include re gular monitoring assessment enforcement and community education the nrc report endorsed using marine reserves as resource and fishery management tools in combination with traditional management measures it asserted that federal and state agencies need to pr ovide resources exper tise and coordination for integrating individual mpas into framework to meet coastal and

restor and maintain healthy marine ecosystems these reserves would play critical roles in zoning areas of the ocean under sovereign control based on desired patterns nd intensities of uses this report also recommends establishing regiona l ocean ecosystems councils and new independent federal oceans agency the pew commission viewed reserves as sites that would transcend federalstate boundari it calls on congress to enact mandate to establish such system and provide the necessary institutional structure and legal authorities to implement it it also recommends that federal agencies should use existing authorities to establish re serves within areas that have already been designated for protection until such mandate is enacted the us commission on ocean policy22 also endorses mpas but its report is more wideranging than the pew effort and mpas play much smaller role in its recommendations the report from the us commission on ocean policy may have the greatest impact on congressional consid erations since congress created this commission in legislation nd it reported to congress nd the administration the commissions recommendations include reference to mpas in the fisheries chapter that discusses coordinated management in federal wate rs and calls for uniform process to designate design and monitor mpas23 the commissions recommendations also include an indirect reference to mpas related to pursuing an ecosystem approach to identify and designate essential fish habitat that uses current efforts to identify important habitats and locate optimumsized areas recent congressional action currently the national marine sanctuar program is the closest to providing comprehensive approach to using mpas administrative action to establish national monuments in marine areas is ga ining greater attention but these actions appear to be opportunistic rather than deliberate movement to comprehensive approach legislation proposed during the 110th congress appears to make incremental progress in this direction but not on the scale that most mpa advocates would prefer the 110th congress has considered mpas bot h directly and indirectly but not extensively the most direct treatment of mpas is proposed in the sanctuary enhancement act of 2008 hr 6537 introduced in july 2008 hr 6537 would reauthorize the national mari ne sanctuary act that was last reauthorized in

1205 also would apply provisions of the national marine sanctuary act to liability for costs and damages to coral reefs even when outsi national marine sanctuaries congressional considerati on of new and more comprehensive approaches to protect marine areas is likely to pit economic interests who oppose mpas because designation would place limits on the use or extraction of ocean resources against environmental and research interests who would like to see more widespread or systematic protection of ocean resources mpa advocates favor resource protection over revenuegenerating activities and believe that quick congressional action is needed to prevent further destruction or deterioration of livin g marine resources mpa opponents respond that the benefits of such designations are far from proven but limitations on commercial activities are almost certain to be costly new industries such as aquaculture and alternative energy may be especially difficult to establish if environmental interests believe they threaten marine resources one of the main challenges for policy makers is to balance the needs for profitable private commercial activities with public concerns related to environmental quality it is still an open question as to whether more extensive use of mpas will assist in achieving this balancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32154crs17 25 for more detailed review of

federal laws are sufficien t for this purpose regardless it appears that most of these laws could play significant roles if more comprehensive effort is implemented this discu ssion does not include state laws and programs which vary widely and would beco important for mpas that include nearshore areas or have some interaction with activities in areas under state jurisdiction the following laws allow designatio n of protected areas in the marine environment most apply to coastal sites but they were enacted for different purposes and take different approaches25 if congress chooses to authorize an mpa system it might conclude that one or some combination of these programs can provide the basis for such system or it might conclude that it should enact entirely new authorizing legislation national marine sanctuaries act nmsa the nmsa 16 usc 1431 et seq comes closest to authorizin g what many proponents envision as mpas it authorizes noaa to design ate specific sites for comp rehensive and coordinated management and conser vation the broad nmsa mandate allows noaa to designate areas to preserve or restore conservation ecological aesthetic or recreational values of the designated areas it requires the development and implementation of management plans which serve as the basis for prohibiting or limiting incompatible activities26 noaa has designated 13 sanctuaries rang ing in size from less than square nautical mile to more than 100000 square mile s each site was designated for specific reason ranging from protecting cultural artifacts to protecting entire ecosystems at most of these sites particularly contentious questions when developing or amending management plans have centered on which activities are incompatible with the purposes of the signation and how in compatible activities will be limited since the management plans and regulations have been developed individually for each sanctuary and each sanctuary was established for specified reason they vary widely in how uses are managed and what uses are permitted the florida keys sanctuary is cited as one location where the mpa concept is being applied within this sanctuary 24 sites amounting to 6 of the total area have been fully protected where harvesting marine life is greatly restricted however this is an exception as few of the existing sanctuaries restrict fishing shipping or

mpa inventories are concentrated in coastal and nearshore waters these areas are among the most productive and diverse marine environments and are sites of the most concentrated and intensive uses and

reserves have integrated them into their coastal manageme nt efforts although the research reserves do not play identical roles the 27 national estuarine research reserves that have been designated were federally approved in part because they each represent one of the diverse estuarine ecosystems of the marine coast including the great lakes the system is viewed as both providing laboratory for research and education programs and creating network that permits research for comparing biological or other characteristics across units of the system incompatible uses that would compromise the

federally owned land where many activities are restricted or prohibited to minimize human alterations although the extension of this acts authority into marine waters is questioned by those who envision the ocean as common property marine areas under federal jurisdiction beyond state boundaries but within 200 miles of the coastline could be eligible for designation as wilderne ss by congress although none has been designated to date goals of the wilderness act are to allow unfettered ope ration of natural processes and provide for only those human uses such as primitive recreational activities that do not affect those processes the act generally prohibits commercial activities permanent facilities and use of motorized equipment or motorboats landing of aircraft unless the use had
