options summary increasingly congress and the bush administration are looking to utilize nonproliferation assistance programs includi ng cooperative threat reduction to help reduce the risk of terrorist access to wea pons of mass destruction wmd in the fy2004 national defense authorization act pl 108136 sec 1308 congress authorized the bush administration to spend 50 million of unobligated funds from the cooperative threat reducti on program in states outside the former soviet union as of september 2006 the administration had spent such funds only in albania 385 million for the purpose of eliminating chemical weapons stockpiles the report of the 911 commission called for continued support for threat reduction assistance to keep wmd away from terrorist groups this report which will be updated as needed analyzes the range of possible applications of ctr funds the kinds of assistance that might be supplied and describes legal financial technical and political constraints on possible assistance key underlying issue is that the countri posing the greatest risks may be the least amenable to cooperative approaches second issue is that there is an array of us domestic and international legal re strictions on the most useful kinds of cooperation both the executive branch nd congress may need to consider domestic and international lega l and political restrictions on coope ration with states outside the nonproliferation regimes low levels of transparency exhibited by most of the potential recipient states and the lack of in centives for many of these states to pursue threat reduction measures in addition congress may wish to consider whether potentially expanding the geographic scope of ctr may have negative effect on existing programs one school of thought

are relatively new tool in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction1 the cooperative threat reduction ctr programs funded by th department of defense dod are the most visible of these programs begun in 1991 ctr initially aimed to help russia meet its start obligations to reduce strategic nuclear weapons2 within decade however ctr took on the goal of reducing the threat of terrorist access to weapons of mass destruction wmd3 experts realized that russia needed to protect its cold war overhang of wmd materials scientists nd equipment from those who might exploit insider opportunities and who had incentives particularly financ ial to sell wmd technology to anyone now however ma ny analysts support expanding cooperative threat reduction programs beyond russia to other geographic areas the bush administration stated in early 2003 that it had expanded the strategic focus of the ctr program to support the war on terrorism4 in the fy2004 national defense aut horization act pl 108136 sec 1308 congress authorized the bush administration to spend 50 million of unobligated funds from the cooperative threat reduction program in states outside the former soviet union as of september 2006 the administration had spent 385 million in albania for the purpose of elimina ting chemical weapons stockpiles5 the report of the 911 commission called for continued s upport for threat reduction assistance to keep wmd away from terrorist groups this report surveys options for applying ctr programs to states that pose wmd and terrorism threat it describes pot ential recipients of such funding those states with wmd programs and terrorism pr oblems the kinds of assistance that may be possible potential legal political and technical constraints on assistance and potential costs and benefits to the united st ates of providing such assistance thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32359crs2 6 at the national defense university presiden t bush unveiled six other initiatives to

review of why ctr programs might be considered applicable to the threat of wmd terrorism and then takes more detailed look at the threat of wmd terrorism it reviews how certain kinds of ctr assistance might help defuse the threat and presents some options tailored for specific countries the report also looks at constraints involved in pr oviding assistance and broader implications of such assistance connecting ctr and wmd terrorism the belief that terrorists were growing more interested in wmd grew after the 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states despite obvious link and continued to grow as us policy statements drew furt her linkages in his january 2002 state of the union address president bush highlighted iraq iran and north korea as axis of evil states those that support terrorism and also have wmd later that year both the national security strategy and the national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction prolifer ation highlighted the connection between terrorists and wmd in 2003 the us went to war with iraq justifying this action primarily on the grounds that iraq had wmd and connec tion to terrorists associated with 911 more recently the exposure of the aq khan nuclear network in pakistan which provided sensitive nuclear w eapons technology including bomb design to libya iran and north korea has raised concer ns not just about what could be traded clandestinely but also about potential rrorist access to wmd khans sale of technology to three state sponsors of terro rism allegations of ties to terrorist organization and the pakistan government s precarious relationship with terrorist groups on its soil have prompted some to ca ll for assistance to pakistan to reduce the threat of terrorist access to wmd key strategy in limiting the risk of rrorist access to wmd is to cut off access at the source for some russia should continue to be the main focus of efforts to prevent and deter terrorists from acquiring wmd because of russias vast cold war overhang of wmd technologies material and personnel others see september 2001 as watershed after wh ich cooperation should be ex tended to problem states such as pakistan syria libya and ira n still others see nonproliferation assistance programs as way to bring states outsi the nonproliferation regime like north korea and pakistan unde r some restraints the bush administration has advocated the use of traditional and new tools to counter wmd proliferation including interdiction preemption diplomacy and assistance in key nonproliferation speech on february 11 2004 president bush introduced seven new initiatives including expanding ctr in particular bush noted that such funds could be used for re training weapons scientists in iraq and libya or for reducing uranium enrichment levels in foreign research nuclear reactors6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32359crs3 6 continued plutonium reprocessing by ensuring reliable acc ess at reasonable cost to fuel for

north korea china iran and iraq as potential recipients of ctr assistancein fact however programs to retrain such scientists have used state department nonproliferation and di sarmament fund monies few underlying issues may influe nce the ultimate success of ctrlike approaches one is the cooperative element in the us relationship with the state in question states willingness to c ooperate may hinge on calculations of the wmd programs importance to its security and other geopolitical considerations second issue may be that states perception of ctr assistance is this just another name for arms control us unilateralism or bribery more broadly there is the question of whether globalizing ctr may spread resources thinly at time when there is still significant work to be done in russia and the form er soviet states congressional role since 1991 congress has authorized ctr funds specifically for use in the soviet union and later in russia and fo rmer soviet union f states before fy2004 agencies used other sources of funding for nonproliferation assistance programs applied outside of russia and the fsu in fy2004 the bush administration was able to use 50 million of unobligated ctr funds outside the fsu the nunnlugar expansion act wa s passed as part of the fy2004 national defense authorization act p l 108136 to assist the united states in resolution of critical emerging proliferation threat s and to permit the united states to take advantage of opportunities to achieve long standing nonproliferation goals the final language of the act requires the president to determine and notify congress in writing within 10 days after obligating funds that the projectactivity will help the united states in the resolution of critical emerging proliferation threat or permit the united states to take advantage of opportunitie s to achieve longstanding nonproliferation goals b partment of defense is th government agency most capable of carrying out the projectactivity and c projectactivity will be completed in short period of time conferees noted that they expected the president to assign projects to the most appropriate agencies7 on february 8 2005 senator lugar introduced s 313 the nunnlugar cooperation threat reduction act of 2005 which sought to remove restrictions associated with using ctr funds outside of the fsu in brief the legislation

the provisions in s 313 only the repeal of certification requirement s was adopted as an amendment in the senates fy2007 national defense authorization bill section 1304 s 2766 however this provision was not incorporated in the bill agreed to in conference on september 20 2006 hr 5122 background the threat of terrorist access to wmd is relatively new concern for nonproliferation experts first the nonpro liferation regime has always focused on controlling ingredients at the source as the most effective first line of defense such an approach already addresses two kinds of terrorist threats that an insider might collaborate to sell or give terrorist some materials and that terrorists might seek to steal materials themselves from facilities second the regime has controls for transfers to anyone not just states outside the regime third apart from aum shinrikyos use of sarin gas on the tokyo subway few nonstate actors have conducted or attemp ted to conduct an attack with functional nuclear chemical or biological weapon8 on the other hand the perception of an in creased threat of terrorist use of wmd has grown since the september 2001 attacks on the united states there is evidence that qaeda assigned high priority to acquiring wmd capability and some observers believe that ch emical and biological w eapons cbw capabilities are increasingly available the central intelligence agency cia estimated that the threat of terrorists using chemical biol ogical radiological and nuclear cbrn materials remained high in 2003 note the use of the word materials not weapons the cia also concluded that terrorist groups probably will continue to favor longproven conven tional tactics such as bombings and shootings9 by february 2006 the director of national intelligence john negroponte told congress that today we are more likely to see an attack from terrorists using weapons or agents of mass destruction than states although terrorists capabilities would be much more limited in fact intelligence reporting indicates that nearly 40 terrorist organizations insurgencies or cults have used possessed or expressed an interest in chemical biological radi ological or nuclear agents or weaponshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32359crs5 10 john d negroponte annual threat assessment of the director of national intelligence for the senate select committee on intelligence

httpwwwwhitehousegovnscnsshtml 12 cia wmd technology acquisition januaryjune 2002many are capable of conducting simple smallscale attacks such as poisonings or using improvised chemical devices10 however negroponte provided furthe r evidence to support those claims the threat nexus of wmd and terrorism according to the 2002 national security st rategy rogue stat are those that brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers display regard for international law threaten their neighbors and callously violate international treaties to which they are party are determined to acqui re weapons of mass destruction along with other advanced military technology to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes sponsor terrorism around the globe and reject basic human values and hate the united states and everything for which it stands11 the cia has reported growing concern that traditional state recipients of wmd technology may follow north korea s practice of supplying specific wmd related technology and expertise to other countries or nonstate actors12 when those states are desi gnated state sponsors of terrorism there is the possibility they may provide the terrorist organizations that they support with wmd materials or weapons while there is very little evid ence to support this assumption it cannot be ruled out because these countries tend to be pariah states however they may offer few footholds for cooperation nonethel ess some of the ne w and reinvigorated cooperation in counterterrorism since 2001 ma help spur cooperation in other areas equally risky is the category of states that have terrorist activity on their soil and wmd programs these pose different kind of risk that terrorists may gain access to wmd without the authority or knowledge of the host government either through insider ties or through instability engendered by terrorist activity table 1 below

nuclear reprocessing at laboratoryscale level but did not c onclude that egypt violated its safeguards agreement39 how significant is the nexus two factors should be considered in ssessing the severity of threat of terrorist access to wmd intention and oppor tunities first terrorists operating in certain countries that have wmd programs do not necessarily ve an interest in acquiring wmd most of the terrorist groups with an interest in wmd tend to be more internationally rather than domestically focused40 to date the kurdistan workers party pkk hamas qaeda and aum shinrikyo have demonstrated interest in developing weapons of mass destruction although the following countries have terrorist ac tivities on their soil terrorists active on their soil have not demonstrated wmd intentions algeria india thailand and yugoslaviakosovo second the states in question present different opportunities for terrorists to gain access in some cases facilities may be remotely located w ith good surveillance capabilities and g ood security in addition so facilities ma be under military control the level of security in count ry like north korea or israel may be much higher than for example in algeria or egypt even in country like russia which many observers believe presents sign ificant opportunities for stealing nuclear material the ability of terrorists to acquire material is not given the cia has judged that none of the sixteen seizures of russian weaponsusable nuclear material since 1992 was connected to terrorists41 on the other hand the inability of state to control either its people or its territory which may or may not be defined as failed state may present opportunities for terrorists to move freely within country and take advantage of available resources the dualuse nature of many materi als and technologies associated with wmd may present terrorists with the ability to enhance their wmd capabilities in countries that do not have an obvious wmd program in

several existing programs to reduce this threat in large part revelations about irans nuclear program and the role of pakistan in supplying uranium enrichment equipment and technology to iran libya and north korea has revived decadesold debate bout whether or not certain processes and materials should be controlle d internationally or banned altogether not since the atoms for peace program in the 1950s has international storage of plutonium or enriched uranium or international control of enrichment and reprocessing facilities been in vogue however the director ge neral of the iaea dr mohamed elbaradei suggested just such an approach in 2003 and c onvened an experts group to study options for multilateral management of the nuclear fuel cycle43 the basic objective of these options would be to restrict sens itive technology in the hands of few states while providing assured fuel supplies for nuclear reactors to other states in 2004 president bush proposed that enrichment and reprocessing technology should not be spread any further than it already is and that export controls national and multilateral agreements should be tight ened to eliminate this possibility44 the g8

material security was radical in 1991 but so too was the prospect of russias wmd infrastructure unraveling the circumstances surrounding ctrs inception were unique th ere was previous agreement under the start treaty to destroy nuclear weapons agreement on both sides that those legitimate weapons needed to be secured be fore they were destroyed and absence of international inspections because of russias status as nuclear weapons state russia had already agreed to destroy w eapons the only questions were how to implement those reductions quickly and who would pay for them that soviet nuclear weapons had been targeted at the united states for so many years presented compelling reason for the united states to help the same situation arose years later when russia signed the cwc and ctr funds were used to help destroy those weapons an issue that could arise in the context of expanding ctrs scope is whether states with stocks of chemical weapons that are bound to destroy them by 2007 under the cwc india and one anonymous state will see this as an opportunity to have their obligations paid for by the united states kinds of assistance ctr assistance to states outside the fs u might use four types of programs those that help secure weapons sites ma terials and personnel these correspond roughly to the ctr missions of weapons struction ensuring transportation safety verifiably safeguarding against prolifera tion and preventing dive rsion of scientific expertise few differences stand out from the soviet case 1 not all of the countries of concern here have actual weapons 2 some th at do have weapons programs belong to treaties that they may be currently violating and 3 others that have weapons programs have international restricti ons on them and may not have any interest in giving up their weapons these differences will affect the kinds of assistance the united states might want to provide to those countries and possibly also the kinds of assistance it can legally provide weapons security us assistance to most states is likely to emphasize weapons security as it did with russia and the fsu primarily because potential recipient states will not be as highly armed as russia in the nuclear area measures to improve the chain of command and custody and secure transpor tation for nuclear warheads would likely be highly controversial if extended to state outside the npt nonetheless some observers have advocated assistance to imp rove nuclear weapons security with the objective of ensuring that weapons coul d not be stolen or detonated by an unauthorized person the simplest measures would be funding and training armed guards however potential recipient states are likely already aware of the advantages of protecting their nuclear weapons

exhausted public sources of information on th at topic but north korea may not have measures to ensure that command and control systems work would also help ensure unauthorized use but could possibly enhance operational capabilities and therefore may be undesirable assistance in destroying nuclear biological or chemical warheads is different matter it is assumed that the priority for bw and cw

focused on helping guard against the theft of weapons or material s by insiders or outsiders site security with respect to chemical weapons has fo cused primarily on struction of weapons capabilities finally site security fo r biological weapons has focused on dismantlement safety and security at facilities for biological pathogens measures include perimeter security such as gates and other barriers like barbed wire and personnel id entification systems which can help minimize the risk of unauthorized entry sensors to detect unauthorized actions movement tampering can help against both insider and outsider threats measures to protect against inside theft include checks on pe rsonnel leaving facilitie s typically onerous without technical detecti on measures for material or components cameras in sensitive areas and accounting and access pro cedures armed guards could help as would operational and ad ministrative controls in russia us officials toured site s and conducted vulnera bility assessments in other cases even perimeter visits could be viewed as too sensitive however the united states could offer information or briefings on how security is conducted at sensitive facilities in the united states such information would need to be presented in general terms not specific to particular facilities to protect us national security ideally assistance could cover types of requirements for personnel vetting and training and development of security cultu re assistance of this kind in the nuclear area is beginning to be provided under iaea auspices to india and pakistan if the united states wanted to install cameras or sensors at sensitive facilities licenses might be required for some of them given restrictions on materials going to sensitive sites

technical and legal constraints on us assistance to some of the states mentione d above above all these countries have to be willing to negotiate with the united states on reducing the wmd threat in the best possible world that would mean abandoning their wmd programs like libya has done less desirable would be for them to curtail ch programs and in some cases it may even be difficult for countries to admit they have such programs states would need to calculate the value of such wmd programs to the states national security prestige and regional stature the potentia l benefits for abandoning such programs and the likelihood of punitive actions by the united states andor the world community if it does not abandon such prog rams such political constraints may pose the most formidable hurdles to us assistance technical hurdles are clearly secondary constraints but they can lead to questions about the effectiveness of ve rifying threat reduction programs ctr programs in the former soviet union spite political willingne ss to participate in the ctr program have been dogged for year s by questions about their effectiveness for both political and technical reasons technical constraints stem primarily from incomplete knowledge of countrys wm d program which makes it difficult to scope and prioritize the proliferation problem s lastly there may be legal hurdles in providing assistance both because of us treaty obligations and domestic laws prohibiting assistance to proliferator s and state sponsors of terrorism political constraints in some cases amount of pressure from the united states is likely to convince some states to give up certain wmd programs for example the nuclear programs of india pakistan and israel these states percei ve nuclear weapons as crucial to balancing regional security and ultimately to their own survival barring change in the regional balance of power that would make nuclear weapons unnecessary there likely will be strong

difficult to overcome in the case of other states on the other hand prof essional pride on the scientific or military levels may provide for some cooperation other countries may perceive direct and

one of th last major concessions required before lifting us sanctions in addition however libyan leaders may have perceived their wmd programs as longer vital to liby as national security regional stature or prestige some might argue that libya gave up its wmd precisely because they were not very successful programs this is ex actly the kind of costbenefit analysis us nonproliferation efforts seek to promote assuming whether coerced or pers uaded country has ended its wmd programs some constraints may still arise in the case of iraq the us search for wmdrelated items and to pr ovide for site material nd personnel security has been hampered by the chaos caused by the wa r and decade of d eception for example there is significant gap in information about midlevel iraqi wmd scientists

willingness to accept assistance did not extend to all areas of russias wmd programs for exam ple us officials have never gained access to the four military fac ilities associated with russias biological wea pons program with respect to nuclear ma terial protection control and accounting programs most of the material according to one report remains outside of the program because the united states ca nnot gain access to sensitive facilities60 it is not difficult to imagine that the same leve ls of secrecy encountered in the case of russia might be encountered in other states it is possible that more secrecy may be attached to biological and nuclear wea pons programs than for chemical weapons programs in addition it may be possible to know about some ki nds of sites dual use facilities like chemical production s ites uranium enrichment or plutonium reprocessing but not others for exampl weapons machining or assembly sites if country has made decision to end one but perhaps not other wmd programs eg pakistan decides to gi ve up chemical weapons but not nuclear weapons the need to preserve secrecy about the other wm d programs may

2006transparency if country accepts some assistance for an ongoing wmd program eg pakistan accepts security assistance for its nuclear warheads but does not give them up providing such assistance could raise the question of whether the united states tacitly accepts that wmd program in fact some kinds of assistance like permissive action links to make nuclear weapons safe from unauthorized use could be viewed as actively helping wmd pr ogram and would likely be prohibited by us and international laws see gal constraints discussion below the existing level of cooperation between the united states and some of these countries will likely affect some aspects of assistance country that has not been cooperating with the united states on counterterrorism may be less likely to cooperate on nonprolifer ation on the other hand c ountry like pakistan which has been cooperating closely with the united stat in the war on terrorism may be given free ride on proliferation for fear of eroding antiterrorism cooperation and jeopardizing delicate political balances in the region technical constraints there are two basic technical constraints in providing assistance getting accurate information and being able to verify it and ensuring that assistance does not aid or benefit wmd capability that will continue to exist information about weapons of mass dest ruction programs is closely held even in the most open of societies while us intelligence assets can pick up remarkable details about wmd programs the recent us government assessments of wmd capabilities in iran iraq north korea and libya point strikingly to the fact that what we know is just small fraction of the entire picture even for advanced wmd programs that have existed for years deta ils are few for example senior bush administration official described on pakistan s nuclear program saying its what we dont know that worries us including th critical question of how much fissile material pakistan now holds and where it holds it 61 more recently the washington post reported that pakistan was building new plutonium production reactor sparking debate about how much us officials really knew about the reactor62 although the united states is certain that north korea has uranium enrichment program it has only been able to narrow down the location of an enrichment plant to three sites for ch emical and biological weapons programs which rely on extensive dualuse materials and facilities there may be even fewer details on which to base assessments information from the defector ken alibek revealed far more extensiv soviet bw program than previously thought and even though the us ctr program has elements for bw site material and personnel security there are few who would agree that we know the full extent of the program even todayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32359crs28 63 us general accounting office wmd reducing the threat from the former soviet union an update gaonsiad95165 june 1995in general it may be possible to know more about materi production sites than about weapons productiona ssembly or weapons storage sites without knowledge of where vulnerab ilities lie it will be difficult to target even the most rudimentary assistance in the case of russia and the nis us government officials have complained for years that russia s not provided the kinds of access necessary for the united states to ensure that its goals are being met with respect to the material protection contro l and accounting programs most of the material according to one report remains outsi of the program because the united states cannot gain access to sensitive facilities63 second technical hurdle is ensuring that us assistance does not improve wmd capabilities some kinds of assistance do not run this risk for example providing physical security barriers for facilities or improving personnel reliability testing improving weapon transportation and storage security however might run such risk some innovations may have unintended consequences for example permissive action links whic h were developed by the united states in the 1960s were designed so that unauthorized user s would not be able to produce nuclear yield from the weapon at the same time however it was recognized that weapons with pals on them are more deployable such devices if given to india and pakistan in the name of decreasing the po ssibility that such weapons could be stolen and used could also increase t hose weapons operational readiness legal constraints treaty obligations treaty obligations may play role in limiting assistance both from the perspective of us obligations and for the states in question the relevant treaties are the nuclear nonproliferation treaty n pt the chemical weapons convention cwc and the biological and toxin weapons convention bwc the united states is party to all three treaties each of these treaties contains language that generally prohibits transferring such wea pons assisting encour aging or inducing any other state under the npt nonnuclear w eapon states to manufacture or acquire weapons for the text of the relevant language in each treaty see appendix in addition the united states is prohib ited by the npt from helping nonnuclear weaponstates control nuclear devices with the term c ontrol left undefined and prohibited under the cwc from engaging in preparations to use chemical weapons which could be br oadly interpreted in general questions of treaty complia nce were not publicly raised by us assistance to russia and the fsu nuclear assistance to the soviet union because it was nuclear weapons state by the terms of the npt was never questioned in the cw area most of the assistance to ru ssia has focused on helping russia comply with the cwc primarily in destruction while some cw scientists may have participated in the international science centers there has been public criticism that assistance has helped the russian cw program with respect to russias biological weapons program there has been some uncertainty about whether assistance to bw scientists in certain institutes could benefit the russian

other nuclear explosive devices article ii of the treaty on th nonproliferation of nuclear weaponsprogram but one has publicly suggested that the united states has not complied with its bwc obligations64 nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt under article i of the npt the united states is prohibited from transferring to any state nuclear weapon state non nuclear weapon state party or nonparty to the treaty nuclear weapons nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or devices directly or indirectly it is not readily apparent what is meant by control over such weapons narrow interpretation would focus on the ability of another state to use such weapon65 broader interpretation might conclude that be tter safety security or command and control measures would provide another st ate with improved control of its nuclear weapons perhaps violating this obligation not to indirectly transfer control the second part of the obligation lie s in not assisting encouraging or inducing nonnuclear weapon states to ma nufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive vices or control over such weapons or explosive devices the negotiators of the npt reportedly intended to interpret manufacture broadly from the beginning of the acquisition cycle to the end66 nonnuclearweapon states party to the npt ar obligated not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of such weapons under article ii67 presumably this would cover assistance that enhanced command and control of weapons including permissive action link pal technology i ndia pakistan israel and north korea would not be bound by such an obligation since they are not parties to the npt iran on the other hand would be bound by that obligation the us state department has not made public finding on what might constitute violation of artic i under the npt but its gal advisors have examined precedents in the application of us domestic law in general they have advised that the closer assistance is att ached to the nuclear weapons programs the more likely it could run afoul of us gal obligations both under inte rnational treaty obligationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32359crs30 and domestic law thus some kinds of ai d eg food or humanitarian aid could be considered in the extreme to be assistin g or encouraging nuclear weapons program because they free up resources that the target government can put towards nuclear weapons program but are pe rmitted in practice because they do not have close association with nuclear weapons prog ram if assistance took the form of transferrable funds however the possibility of linkage to nuclear weapons program might be considered to be greater chemical weapons convention cwc there are two provisions in article i of the cwc that might affect us assistance first the prohibition on engaging in any military preparations to use chemical wea pons and s econd the prohibition on assisting encouraging or i nducing in any way anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to state part under this conven tion alt hough us assistance clearly would not aim to contravene the treaty some actions even temporary could be interpreted as violating that obligation if they resulted in greater security of chemical weapons and not imme diate destruction if weapons security measures were implemented eg security from terrorist access they would need to be accompanied by demilitarization meas ures separation from weapon launchers etc as evidenced by delays in the destruction of the us chemical weapons stockpile destruction could take years any such ac tivities with non cwc parties egypt iraq north korea and syria fo r purposes here could be interpreted as falling under the prohibition against assi sting encouraging or inducing anyone to engage in any activity prohibited under the convention biological weapons convention bwc as in the cases of the npt and cwc key provision here may be the prohibition on assistance encouragement or inducing of any state group of states or international organization to acquire agents toxins weapons equipment or means of delivery prohibited by the convention measures that included just assistance to scientists but not bw destruction or measures that included wea pons and site security but destruction might fall into that category the likeli hood is small but future recipients may be just as reluctant as the russians have b een to allow access to the most sensitive bw related sites accepting assistance at lesser sites legal constraints

sanctions selected current law and crs report rl31559 proliferation control regimes background and status in brief the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended 42 usc 2053 et seq ensures that us nuclear technology will not go to proliferators for the most part it is unlikely that the kinds of assist ance the united states might offer under an expanded ctr program for weapons site material or personnel security would fall under the categories covered by these ws the foreign assistance act and the arms export control act punish proliferat ors by prohibiting us military sales and economic or military assistance the ex port administration act of 1979 restricts exports of goods and technologies incl uding dualuse technologies for foreign policy and national security reasons and the exportimport bank act of 1945 includes restrictions on the extension of cr edit for proliferation and terrorism reasons it should be noted that all proliferationre lated sanctions agains t pakistan and india stemming from the 1998 nuclear explosive tests have been lifted many of these constraints can be lifted by presidential waiver in 2005 the energy policy act pl 10958 section 632 amended the

27 2006 the house passe d hr 5682 which authorizes the president to create an exception for india from curre nt restrictions on nuclear cooperation perhaps the most salient legislation is what has become known as the state sponsors of terrorism list as provided for in section 6 j 1 of the export administration act of 1979 50 usc app 2405jl states can be removed from that list in two ways first the president could submit report to congress certifying that 1 there has been f undamental change in the lead ership and policies of the government of the country concerned 2 the government is not supporting acts of international terrorism and 3 the government has provided assurances that it will not support acts of internationa l terrorism in the future the second option is for the president to submit report to congress at least 45 days before the proposed recision will take effect justifying the recision and certifying that 1 the government concerned has not provided any support fo r international terrorism during the preceding sixmonth period and 2 the gove rnment has provided assurances that it will not support acts of interna tional terrorism in the future both iraq and libya have been removed from the list in the last few years in addition however two other terrori sm lists may apply the first is section 40 of the arms export control act which prohibits the export of munitions to governments that repeatedly provide support for international terrorism and section 620a of the foreign assistance ac t of 1961 which prohibits most assistance to countries supporting inte rnational terrorism section 40 of the aeca has specific procedure for congress to consider joint resolution to block the presidents removal of country from the terrorism lis t both section 40 of the aeca and section 620a of the faa include presidentia l waiver authority for national security interests or humanitarian reasons it is lik ely that sweeping lift of sanctions would occur only in the context of overall imp roved relations and with congressional concurrence that the sanctions regime ought to be undone nuclear cooperationnucl ear weapons cooperation the atomic energy act aea governs nuclear cooperati on and restricts sharing of information related to nuclear weapons it is unlikely that the united states would include significant nuclear cooperation with any of the states in question under an expanded ctr program eg sales of nuclear reactors nuclear material or major reactor components71 significant nuclear cooperati on with states such as india pakistan israel or north korea would require that they abandon their nuclear weapons programs and adopt fullscope safeguards72 moreover section 129 of the aea states that nuclear material and equipment or sensitive nuclear technology shall be exported to 1 any nonnuclearweapon state that is found by the president to have at any time after march 10 1978 detonated nuclear explosive device or b terminated or abrogated iaea safeguards or c materially violated an iaea safeguards agreement or d engaged in activities involving source or special nuclear ma terial and having direct significance for the

use these include i nuclear material ii nuclear reactors and equipment therefor iii nonnuclear material for r eactors iv plant and equipment for the reprocessing enrichment and conversion of nuc lear material and for fuel fabrication and continuedfailed to take steps which in the pres idents judgment represent sufficient progress toward terminating such activities some states are additionally subject to countryspecific re strictions on nuclear cooperation agreements for example the north korea threat reduction act of 1999 stipulated that significant nuclear cooperation could occur with north korea unless relevant congressional committees were informed that north korea was in full compliance with its nuclear safeguards agreement b gave the iaea full access to nuclear sites c took steps to implement the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the korean peninsula d had enrichment or reprocessing activities and made signif icant progress in acquiring testing producing or deploying nuclear explosive device and had nuclear weapons in addition the president must notify congress that th transfer of key nuclear components was in the national security interests of the united states some of these requirements are already contained in existing laws but ot hers are not for example implementing the joint declaration in the event that the united states contemplates sharing sensitive nuclear information eg informati on related to safety and s ecurity of nuclear weapons section 144 of the aea stipulat that the secretary of ergy may release restricted data on various aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle except those related to the design or fabrication of atomic weapons the secr etary of defense may exchange restricted data if it is necessary to develop defe nse plans b train personnel in employing and defending against nuclear weapons c evaluate the capabilities of potential enemies in employing nuclear weapons d develop compatible delivery systems for nuclear weapons the president can authorize the secretary of energy with the assistance of the department of defense to exchange restricted data on atomic weapons with another country provided that communica tion of restricted data is necessary to improve that nations nuclear weapon desig n development or fa brication capability and b that nation has made substantial progress in the development of atomic weapons when the language on substa ntial progress was added in 1958 the only nation that met the qualification was the ited kingdom in general most weapons related data including some on safety security fuze and firing are classified as restricted data or formerly restricted data it is unlikely that the president would authorize such an exchange of restrict ed data under this provision of the atomic energy act particularly to stat such as india and pakistan dualuse exports transfers of nuclearre lated equipment or nuclear material that do not meet the requirement for an agr eement of cooperation could possibly still require fullscope safeguards as condition of supply under the nuclear suppliers group nsg guidelines ce 1992 nsg member states have required fullscope

safeguarded and unsafeguarded activities to produce special nuclear material through reprocessing or enrichment produce heavy water or fabricate nuclear fu that uses plutonium section 7442 of the export administration regulations provides eight criteria for assessing license applications potentially th most significant of these criteria is the nonproliferation credentials of the importing country which include whether the state adheres to the npt has fullscope safegu ards and has an agreemen t for cooperation with the united states and whether the actions stat ements and policies of the state support nuclear nonproliferation74httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32359crs39 75 bush says pakistans arsenal is secure washington post january 2 2004costs and benefits of assistance the united

these multiple problems and do bilatera l approaches under mine the multilateral nonproliferation regime two potential costs of unde rmining international institutions are decreased global pressure on proliferators and possibly decreased international support for us policy objectives in other areas bilateral approach may risk capturing the easy proliferation problems like libya and undermining

need to be waived hardcore nuclear proliferators pose different challenge these states have remained steadfastly outside the treaty regime and are unlikely to dismantle their arsenals with the possible exception of north korea if assistance were accepted would this confer acceptance of their nuclear weapons status would such acceptance be good or bad for the nonprolifer ation regime for

policy that seeks to eliminate the nexus of terrorism and wmd confronts more than few challenges one particular challenge is obtaining active cooperation from diverse group of states around the world many of which are not traditional allies of the united states according to one observer the united states hasnt made really clear howa former state supporter of terrorism stands with th united states and with the rest of the international community in dealing with that common scourge76 libya may provide an unfolding example of how former state supporter of terrorism can be redeemed an equally challenging stion may be how states that were considered former proliferators stand with the united states and the rest of the international community here libya may not offer th best example although longtime successful supporter of interna tional terrorism albeit with waning activity in the last decade libya was at best mediocre proliferator and decided to give up both activities in exchange for the lifting of burdensome economic sanctions more troubling example is states that retain their wmd programs but not the stigma of being proliferator pakistan raises the largest issue for the bush administration in its matrixed war against terrorism and wea pons of mass destructi on proliferation has one goal assumed priority ove r the other there have been ample statements from administration officials since 2001 to the eff ect that pakistan has not been pressed on its proliferation activities becau of its strong support in the war against terrorism despite evidence of sales of uranium

security challenges facing the united states emphasis added focusing on the terrorism axis has shifted policies to combat wmd proliferation away from global approaches at least rhetorically to

programs appropriations act 2006 pl 109102 th comprehensive peace in sudan act of 2004 pl 108497 and the sudan peace act pl 107245 the 109th also considered legislation that c ould affect third party states or any state that could potentially receive ctr assistance to the extent such states are considered for these initiatives for ex ample section 542 of the fy2006 foreign operations bill pl109102 pr ohibited assistance to count ries that provide lethal military equipment to state sponsors of rrorism other exampl include pl 109267 which extended the iranlibya sanc tions act the iran nonproliferation amendments act pl 109112 which added syria to that act and the north korea nonproliferation act of 2006 s 3728 wh ich added north korea to the iran syria nonproliferation act costs in its oversight capacity congress ma wish to consider whether or not expanding ctr assistance could have snow ball effect particularly if the united states insists on using its own resources rather than existing multinational inspectorates costs of assistance are likely to be minimal the first one or two years but these could escalate depending on the obj ectives of the program in the nuclear area the nuclear programs of india pakistan israel and north korea are far smallerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32359crs42 than russias and unlikely to incur the kinds of costs that the ctr program has thus far incurred on the other hand data are scarce on the state of nuclear materials in those countries so it is difficult to dete rmine the scope and timeframe of such program at minimum however such program is likely to be incrementally implemented costs could be minimal if quickfix lowtechnology information oriented approach is taken or they could be more substan tial if sophisticated high technology approach is taken that woul d incorporate cameras encryption remote monitoring and other means the same is true in the bw and cw areas the scope of the undertaking in russia greatly out weighs the combination of programs of relevant states however the management of multiple programs could present particular difficulties certifications in 1991 the legislation that created th nunnlugar program stipulated that us assistance in destroying nuclear and other weapons may not be provided to the soviet union any of its republics or ccessor entities unless th president certifies to the congress that the proposed recipient is committed to making substantial investment of its resources for dismantling or destroying such weapons forgo any military modernization that exceeds legitimate defenserequirements or is designed to replace destroyed wmd forgo the use of fissile materials and other components fromdestroyed nuclear weapons in new nuclear weapons facilitate us verifica tion of weapons destruction that uses us money comply with all relevant arms control agreements and observe internationally recogni zed human rights including the protection of minorities certifications according to some administration officials allow the united states to hold the recipient states feet to the fire providing source of leverage in the view of others however they pos unnecessary and even dangerous delays in implementing ctr programs in the fy 2006 national defense authorization act pl 109163 section 1303 of title x iii extended the threeyear authority to waive certification requirements inde finitely section 1304 of s 2766 the senates version of the fy2007 national defense authoriza tion act would have repealed all certification requirements however the version of the defense authorization act passed in conference hr 5122 does not incl ude provisions to repeal restrictions other considerations congress may wish to consider the impli cations of providing us assistance to countries that are not democratically governed section 508 of the foreign operations bill pl109102 in the 109th congress prohibited di rect assistance to the government of any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by decree or military coup most of the six state sponsors of terrorism would fall in this category in addition pakistan has been subject to such restrictions pl 107httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32359crs43 77 see crs report rs20995 india and pakistan current us economic sanctions57 which exempted pakistan from existing restrictions prohibiting foreign assistance to any country governed by military that overthrew democratically elected regime requires the president to determine that foreign assistance facilitates the transition to democratic rule in paki stan and is important to ited states efforts to respond to deter or prevent acts of international terrorism77 pakistans exemption was to run out by october 1 2003 but this was extended through the end of fy2004 by language in the emergency supplementa l bill pl 108106 and then through subsequent foreign operations bills curre ntly it is extended through the foreign operation fy2006 appropriati on bill pl 109102 until the end of fy2006 and would be extended through fy2007 if th foreign operation fy2007 appropriation bill passes congress in its current form h r 5522 the law raises two pertinent issues will president musharraf restore democracy to pakistan and if not how would continued military leadership in pakistan ffect us cooperative efforts particularly if new military leadership emerges in the absence of regime change similar questions might be raised about fforts conducted with cuba and syriahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32359crs44 appendix relevant treaty texts
