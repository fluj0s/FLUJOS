6408c04 shspec33 summary of study there has not been technology of education or study there was school technology but it didnt have much to do with education education seldom has much to do with school education as opposed to schooling takes into account the relative importance ie the applicability of the data being taught schooling has real thought of applicability for instance there are people in art who think that knowing names and dates is knowing something about art when they couldnt tell you what picture was painted with in education mass and significance must be balanced dont get too much significance for the mass when you get into significance vs mass you get into action action could be defined as significance versus mass of some kind the reason why one engages in action is that one has purpose of achieving or avoiding something in education when the significance is never added to the mass you get jammed curriculum there is doingness significance that has nothing to do with the mass that you are now confronting is disrelated datum all it does is to throw you curve school is expert at doing this you could have school system that would teach but that wouldnt educate anyone or train anyone for anything because it failed to add any mass or doingness to the significance the data in such school system is all curiosa it is not of any use that is why you almost never turn an artist out of university universities separate significance from action so that the student gets introverted with confront of the subject you cant have education if you detach doingness from significance if you do this you get highly impractical person who never leaves school professor for someone to teach who cannot do is terrible mistake instructors in scientology should be able to audit any trouble an instructor has in teaching has at least little to do with inability in the area person merely writing reports of people who can do is too far removed from the mass to write good textbook when you have thoroughly learned something you can use your textbook knowledge to think and you will get better result than the pure textbook approach would give lrh also found that the pure darkroom training that he had had wasnt enough in itself to make good photographer there is ample evidence of this fact in the daily newspaper pictures which are mostly by untrained photographers photography has the common denominator of the public taste it is new subject only little over century old it hasnt had time to get snobbish when subject is all mass and significance it also fails professionalism has to do with significance doingness and mass you need all three to get final result education would treat these three things equally this isnt new thought but the photography course confirmed it for lrh professionalism is sweated for professionals work hard dilettantes dont you dont have to have done everything that has been done to be pro you dont have to have made human mind to fix one up or to have built an emeter to know how to operate one this would be an overstress on doingness the way to keep things in balance is to design the course such that if someone isnt going to do something you strip the significance out of it doingnesses become converted to significances if one isnt going to perform them you should never thus convert doingnesses to only significances ie never take something that is never more to be performed and describe it far beyond necessity you can work it in the other direction and convert significance to doingness if you take something that has been done but isnt currently being done and teach someone to do it eg bromoil prints the doingness and mass of subject that should be taught are the currently applicable doingnesses and masses of the subject the significances that should be taught are enough background so that the individual doesnt get stuck in the doingness so that the doingness has framework and the principles behind it are clear and understood this is little more significance than you would expect that is why you show the student how the subject evolved what other doingnesses there have been and the principles behind the doingnesses then he can think as well as perform mechanical act that is the difference between pro and practical man when doingness changes the guy who has grounding in the subject can understand why and evaluate it properly professional therefore can advance where practical man without theoretical grounding would become antiquated or obsolete mere theoretician could be welltaught but he is seldom educated since his doingness would be missing he might have some other doingness that would be useful eg he could be an art expert who knows nothing about art but whose doingness is the detection of the age of canvasses or whatever most of the protest of the young is that they are being schooled not educated an instructor could think someone was doing simply because he was in motion but if the motion has nothing to do with what the student will be doing it reacts like significance and the student will feel bored and stuck as though he was up against something that he couldnt move through education should be the activity of relaying an idea or an action from one being to another in such way as not to stultify or inhibit the use thereof it permits the recipient to think on and develop the subject and not to become antiquated on the subject the information is loose and flexible in his head not fixed in such way that it relates to only one thing the basic thing wrong with education has been that it never defined what it was trying to do it got confused with schooling education got in trouble the second it started to do something that it didnt define by starting with the thetan as the basis of our theory we exceed the reach of other subjects we have to process someone to get him to understand because the thetan is relatively incapable of understanding in degraded state there appears to be close relationship between miseducation and aberration you could get resurgences in many areas of case just by getting someone to find and define misunderstood words from life
