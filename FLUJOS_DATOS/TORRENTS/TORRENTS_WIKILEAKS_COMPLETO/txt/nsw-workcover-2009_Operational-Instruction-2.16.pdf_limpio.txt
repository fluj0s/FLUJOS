may arise where there is normally intention to employ workers this cl assification is available to employers who do not wish to carry the risk of being uninsured should they need to engage driver at short notice should an unforeseen event arise which may preclude them fr om incepting policy eg hospitalisation or other emergencies for planned absences where the owner operator norma lly employs other drivers such as during holiday breaks there is therefore an intent to employ and the appropriate class and plate rate should be applied an employer with tc plates must as minimu m supply the following information for the scheme agent to consider an application for tc plate rate the policy number of the employer b confirmation that the owner is sole trader andor partnership c description

witnessed statement to that effect must be supplied by the owner 24 adjustment during the policy period if an employers business circumstances change duri ng the period of insurance the premium must be amended upwards to reflect the situation for instance if an employer who has plate rate on the basis that they do not hire workers for more than two shifts per week averaged throughout the policy year finds that they must employ for additional shifts the premium must be amended to reflect the change in circumstances the policy is to be amended to reflect the higher usage classification and amended premium demand issued to cover the gap in premium prorata amounts do not apply for the period of the policy year where the higher us age requirement did not exist the following example illustrates how the premium would be amended tc plate has previously been authorised fo r plate rate of 984 ipo 20062007 for up to an average of 2 shifts per week the employer advises that due to change in circumstances they require coverage for more than 2 shifts per week this would increase the premium to plate rate of 1470 the employ er must pay the difference in this case further 48600

necessary downward adjustment may be affected to have downward adjustment applied documentary evidence for the period must be supplied operational instruction 216 document name opearational
