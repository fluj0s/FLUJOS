safe harbor from copyright and trademark infringement liability for movie filtering technology such as that currently sold by clearplay that skips overhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22042crs3 7 the requirement that filtering not result in fi xed copy of the edited version should distinguish clearplays skipping technology from practices of other businesses which edit films without authorization from copyright holders to offer family friendly versions of movies for rental to the public 8 17 usc 1062 9 see eg hr 4586 the family movie act of 2004 hearing before the house subcomm on courts the internet and intellectual property 108th cong 2d sess 2004statement of marybeth peters register of copyrights that the legislation is not needed because it seems reasonably clear that such conduct is not prohibited under existing law 10 151 cong rec s495 daily ed jan 25 2005 statement of sen hatchdialogue and scenes deemed offensive but does not create fixed copy of the altered version7 it emphasizes that the filtering tec hnology must be used for private household use in order to avoid liability for trademark infringement the manufacturer must ensure that the technology provides notice that the edited motion picture w ill be altered from the performance intended by the movie s director or copyright holder with respect to copyright law the law s sponsors have indicated an intent to preclude manufacturers liability for the unauthorized preparation of derivative work8 however it is not clear that manufacture sa or use of the skipping technology does in fact violate copyright holde rs exclusive right to prepar derivative work based upon the copyrighted work9 litigation is currently pending with respect to both filtering technology and the offering for rental of m ovies edited without permission of copyright holders the law is silent on the issue of ad ski pping the housepassed version in the 108th congress specified that the exemption from copyright infringement for filtering technology did not apply to ad skipping the law however omits this express exclusion from the exemption because the permissibility of adskipping devices and technology is generally unsettled and the law is not intended to resolve the question that this change in way affects the scope of the exemption is clear when considering that the new section 110 11 exemption protects the making imperceptible limited portions of audio or video content of motion picture an advertisement under the copyright act is itself motion picture and thus product or service that enables the skipping of an entire advertisement in any media would be beyond the scope of the exempti on moreover the phrase limited portions is intended to refer to portions that are both quantitatively and qualitatively insubstantial in relation to the work as whole where any substantial part of complete work such as commercial adver tisement is made imperceptible the new section 11011 exemption woul d not apply the limited scope of this exemption does not however imply or show that such conduct or technology that enables such conduct would be infringing this legislation does not in any way deal with that issue it means simply that such conduct and products enabling such conduct are not immunized from liability by this exemption10 title iii the national film preservation act of 2005 t h i s t i t l
