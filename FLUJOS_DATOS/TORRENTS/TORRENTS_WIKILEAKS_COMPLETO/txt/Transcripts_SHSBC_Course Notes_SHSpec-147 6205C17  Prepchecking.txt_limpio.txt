6205c17 shspec147 prepchecking rudiment is that which is used to get the pc in shape to be audited in that session the body of prepcheck session has the purpose of letting the pc live in that lifetime you are after duration so you have to have thoroughness rudiment has to be clean but not permanent the processes you are using are insufficiently fundamental to do permanent job end rudiments are simply to get the pc back to the world of the living and smoothly out of that session middle ruds are even more evanescent in the body of prepcheck session we are going to do something that will change the pcs attitude towards living and improve his ability to confront life in this lifetime so we will do anything we can to straighten out some point that is askew in his attitude what is an overt all things are contained in the concept of interiorization into and exteriorization from there is beingness in this universe that is bad there is also none that is absolutely good but there is badness and goodness about beingnesses and that is an individuals ability to interiorize into or be something or exteriorize out of and not be something when an individual longer has power of choice over that fact he can be considered to be aberrated on that point there are vias by which you enter certain beingness steps of becoming that beingness there can be degrees of freedom of choice about entering or leaving something for instance there is difference between the position of career officer and the drafted private or slave war and slavery reduce power of choice that is what people object to in them not the blood and gore after all one really campaigns against highway deaths which are greater than the total world war i toll not to mention racing deaths you can almost evaluate practices and beingnesses relative to peoples power of choice over being them or not being them where an individual has high degree of freedom we find fairly highscale activity there is another activity going on reactively beneath this cycle of beingness notbeingness beingness see fig 9 the pc has decided to be something then for some reason he has found that he cant unbe this thing easily so he uses mechanism of committing overts against this thing in order to cease to be it he commits these overts and withholds himself from this beingness on repetitive cycle and his overts will get worse and worse and his effort not to be it will become more and more violent until he stretches out to maximum distance after reaching that point he will still commit overts against it but every new overt and withhold will bring him closer to becoming the thing again this is grim so he has beingness tries to postulate himself out of it and for some reason it doesnt work then he will commit overts against that beingness and that type of beingness he will think he is really separating himself from it to midpoint after which every overt and withhold brings him closer to totally enforced beingness which is complete overwhelm now he doesnt even think he has ever tried to unbe it all knowingness on the subject of unbeing it vanishes as well he becomes it on an inversion that is what is the matter with overts and that is what thetan is trying to do with overts he is trying to unbe 242a figure 9 the cycle of enforced beingness 1 an individual assumes beingness 2 he doesnt want to be it any more 3 he tries to postulate himself out of it 4 he fails to postulate himself out of it 5 he tries to unbe it by committing overts 6 he withholds himself from it 7 he alternates overting and withholding escalating up to point of maximum separation 8 continued overts and withholds bring him closer to the beingness again 9 he goes into total overwhelm and becomes the beingness enforcedly on an inversion 10 all knowingness on the subject of unbeing it vanishes he doesnt even think that he has ever tried to unbe it this cycle takes place on all dynamics on the second dynamic it is very apparent overts and the feeling of being unable to get out are very apparent in this area similarly on the third dynamic one can try to individuate from group to the point where one is being group and damning all individuals as in communism which results from an overwhelm by the group back down the track somebody has been god one day he decides to stop being it commits overts becomes it enforcedly and then one day you will find that it is terminal spiritualists are obsessively being spirits however the spirits they are being are other than themselves so in handling ow with prepchecking you are working with the mechanisms that bring about routine 3 bank remember that if the individual is being any one of the items you get in routine 3 he was it then wanted not to be it and couldnt unbe it and started using the ow mechanism to separate himself from it and ended up getting into it obsessively because that cycle takes place in this lifetime note that the pc has certain beingness and connections with all dynamics the item you are trying to handle is his current identity if you held the pc to this lifetime in the prepcheck you might well recover material that would otherwise be lost to this identity going backtrack in prepchecking would just be handling free track in other identities this might be better handled with routine 3 most of the chains can be deadended in this lifetime though not all this lifetime is not pure identity it is colored by beingnesses he has had in the past in order to straighten out this lifetime you must be pretty good and you cant be superficial you will get nowhere taking nothing but the pcs criticism of someone since criticism is just the last shadow the total defeat he can longer be this thing he can only criticize if he is so unhappy being it what did he do to it to make it such an unhappy thing to be getting overts is the mechanical statement what your goal is is to find out how he joe doakes made mary lou such miserable person to be because obviously he was being mary lou in this lifetime he has been every one of the eight dynamics in this lifetime to some degree he will discuss them all with you if you unplowed him from the one he was trying most obsessively not to be he would be free to be it and it would blow off in smoke you would have returned to the individual his power of choice of beingness hence the pts rundown question who would you really hate to be if you can return to the individual his power of choice of beingness you will get tremendous resurgence on the case you could go at it this crudely who havent you liked recently you get reading terminal you are trying to solve how did you make _______ horrible thing to be another way to put it is what have you done to _______ it must be chain because you have to get to the first part of the cycle as you run this his opinion of the terminal will change he will stop being unwilling to be it and there is now sector of existence from which he is not retreating so his reachingness into it is improved his doingness in that sector can occur because his beingness of that sector has been reoriented you cant reach into or affect any area from which you are retreating also person will not do anything that certain beingness can do when the person cannot be that beingness so you could find the thislifetime person who could do the things that the pc wishes he could do run off his overts on that person and at the least the pcs worry about not being able to do those things will cease perhaps he will now even be able to do the thing ie you could ask what do you wish you could have done who could do that then run ow or you could ask who couldnt walk who couldnt go anyplace who was terrific runner who went everywhere etc aunt chrysalis was crippled the pc wanted to kill her he gets into being aunt chrysalis prepchecking will at least improve the pcs condition even though his whole track needs to be straightened out you do need to get actual overts not thinks about what he would like to do or wanted to do that only tells you that he has been wanting not to be whoever the thoughts are about thinking about something is an harmonic of wishing someone who tells you that he has had unkind thoughts about his father is just telling you he wishes he werent his father getting off these unkind thoughts is not therapeutic to spring him out of his enforced beingness you must break up the system that got him there you must get at the ows that he has been using in order not to be his father criticism wish not to be disagreement disagreement is what the meter reads on if one is willing to be something that thing wont read on meter what the pc is trying hardest not to be is what he has done the most to also the identities he is totally overwhelmed by wont read you will get change as long as you take his thoughts and alreadyknowns and criticisms that is what he has been telling everybody for years with change the pc has to cease to fight being it and get to where he can comfortable become it at which point he will cease to be it
