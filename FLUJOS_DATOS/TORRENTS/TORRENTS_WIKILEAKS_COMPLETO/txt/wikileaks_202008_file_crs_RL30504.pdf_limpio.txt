department of veterans affairs congress appropriated 47 billion for department of veterans affairs va programs for fy2001 55 million more than the president requested the house recommended 46910 billion hr 4635 for va for fy2001 the senate in amending the house bill adopted its appropriation committees recommendation of 46966 billion and then subsequently amended the bill to incorporate the version agreed to in preliminary conference between the two houses that version was the final one agreed to by both houses and signed by the president as pl 106377 mandatory spending for va entitlement programs is proje cted to rise by 12 billion for fy2001 most of the proposed increase in discretionary spending for va programs is intended for medical care the president requested both houses approved and the final enacted bill provides 203 billion for va medical care nearly 13 billion more than approved for fy2000 which was 17 billion above the freeze level congress had previously approved for fy2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30504crs4 congress provided 443 billion for va for fy2000 an increase of 17 billion above fy1999 and 18 billion above the administrations request subsequently the across theboard cut of 038 mandated by pl 106113 reduced the medical care appropriation by 795 million for additional information on va programs see crs report rl30099 veterans issues in the 106th congress by dennis snook va cash benefits spending for va cash benefit programs is mandatory and amounts requested by the budget are based on projected caseloads definitions of eligibility and benefit levels are in law for fy2001 246 billion is estimated to be required for these entitlements mostly serviceconnected compensation meanstested pensions and montgomery gibill education payments the entitlement programs were estimated to cost 234 billion during fy2000 the balanced budget act of 1997 included language that ended the long standing va practice of paying compensation and pension benefits on friday when the 1st day of the month occurred on weekend october 1 2000 the start of fy2001 fell on sunday and the administration proposed that the payments be made the previous friday pl 106246 repealed the 1997 language clearing the way for the payment due in october 2000 to be paid on septembe r 29 this change shifted 1832 billion in mandatory spending from fy2001 to fy2000 veterans housing benefits historically the opportunity for veterans to have home loans guaranteed by the federal government was significant contribution to the national goal of increasing the number of families who owned their own homes because of the guarantees lenders are protected against losses up to the amount of the guarantee thereby permitting veterans to obtain mortgages with little or down payment and with competitive interest rates these guarantees and certain direct loans to specific categories of veterans are obligations of the federal government that constitute mandatory spending administrative expenses are discretion ary appropriations transferred from the home loan progra ms to the general operating expenses account guaranteed transitional housing loans for homeless vetera ns program account pl 105368 the veterans programs enhancement act of 1998 established pilot project to expand the supply of transitional housing for homeless veterans the program was authorized to guarantee up to 15 loans with maximum aggregate value of 100 million with more than five loans guarante ed during the first 3 years these housing plans must enforce sobriety standards as well as provide various supportive services such as substance abuse counseling and job readiness skills workshops residents pay reasonable fee to reside in the project homes pl 10674 resulted in an estimated 4825 million for program costs for the program during fy2000 based on the loan limitation of 100 million the program is not expected to require further funding

pl 106377 contains 203 billion for va medical care programs for fy2001 an increase of nearly 13 billion over fy2000 and the same amount requested by the administration and approved in both the house and senate versions of hr 4635 congress approved 19 billion for fy2000 after adding 17 billion to the administrations request of 173 billion pl 106113 reduced that level by 795 million increasing patient load and expanding access for several years va has been expandi ng access to medical services by transferring medical personnel slots from inpatient settings to more efficient outpatient care venues as result the unique patient count is projected to increase by 285000 from fy1999fy2001 va estimates that it will eliminate 1304 staff slots during the same period nevertheless va continues to accept all veterans who apply for enrollment in its health care plans additional sources of medical care funding in addition to funds directly appropriated to va for medical care the administration estimates that 639 million more in medical care funding will be provided in fy2001 from the medical care cost collections fund mccf the amount estimated to be recovered during fy2000 was 608 million the mccf collects payments from insurance companies with joint coverage of veterans receiving care in va facilities and from veterans obligated to share in the cost of their va medical care the millennium health care act pl 106117 authorized va to increase prescription drug copayments 2 monthly per prescription for veterans ineligible for free prescriptions while establishing maximum annual and monthly copayment for veterans with multiple prescriptions the new law also authorized va to modify the outpatient copayment for higher income veterans funds collected through the new authorizations are to be deposited in the health services improvement fund hsif which the act authorized va to establish to receive these additional copayments as well as reimbursements from the department of defense dod for certain military retirees served by va and funds collected under arrangements in which the leasing of va facilities and services yields income to va facilities as with the funds of the mccf the hsif proceeds can be used to furnish additional medical services thereby expanding the number of veterans served by the va medical care system in addition pl 106117 authorized the creation of third fund called the extended care revolving fund ecrf for the receipt of per diem and copayments from certain higher income veterans receiving extended care serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30504crs6 from va one of the purposes of the millennium health care act is to expand the availability of extended care and the act expects to offset some of the additional costs of such expansion by increasing the charges for extended services for veterans who are assumed to have greater ability to pay for their care the house did not adopt the presidents budget proposal for fy2001 that the hsif and the ecrf be consolidated with the hccf which would have combined collection estimated by the administration to be 958 million in fy2001 the administration proposed that onehalf of base of 700 million 350 million of the consolidated funds proceeds be transferred to the general fund of the treasury and the remainder be made available for va medical care services thus under the administrations budget proposal the 639 million estimated to be made available to medical care from the mccf under current law would continue to be made available if va collected the amount estimated but the first 350 million collected would be transferred to the treasury table 4 appropriations department of veterans affairs fy2000fy2001 budget authority in billions

most of the appropriations for hud address the housing problems faced by households with verylow incomes or other special housing needs programs of rental assistance for the poor elderly or handicapped housing assistance for persons with aids varying types of shelter for those who are homeless all deal with the issue of the availability of affordable rental housing the two large hud block grant programs also help communities finance various efforts to address these housing issues while funding for these programs has increased in recent years evidence suggests that the problem of the availability of affordable housing is nevertheless increasing even faster adding to the difficulty of addressing this issue are evaluations of huds management and accounting systems finding that the department could do better job of administering housing programs congressional appropriators will continue to monitor the performance of huds major housing programs summary appropriations for hud programs pl 106377 provides 3062 billion for hud about 185 billion less than the administrations request the bill requires that almost that amount be recaptured from previously approved section 8

units to be built rents for these new dwellings are often out of the range of lower income families restrictive zoning building codes and local opposition can make it difficult to construct basic nofrills rental housing affordable to lowerincome families the tight rental market has not escaped the attention of landlords participating in federallyassisted rental programs for lowerincome families with more profitable alternatives available some are deciding not to renew their federal contracts older apartment buildings with lower rent units are often either being torn down or renovated for an upscale market as the rental market pressures generate more profitable alternatives for investors in rental housing tenants with housing vouchers are finding fewer apartment owners in the suburbs of metropolitan areas willing tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30504crs10 rent to subsidized tenants either because the owners want to avoid program red tape or because the value of the voucher is not sufficient for subsidized tenants to afford the units hud study presented to the congress on march 21 2000 rental housing assistance the worsening crisis reports that record 54 million unassisted very lowincome families pay over half of their income for housing or live in substandard housing in june 2000 the center for housing policy released report housing americas working families it emphasized that having job does not guarantee family decent place to live at an affordable cost among its findings more than 220000 teachers police and public safety offices across the country spend more than half their income for housing and the problem is growing worse congressional appropriators respond to the housing issues according to the admin istration the 1413 billion requested for the housing certificate fund up 275 billion over the previous year would be sufficient to renew all section 8 contracts establish housing production program provid relocation assistance vouchers and also add 120000 new section 8 rental housing vouchers the added voucher proposal was particularly contentious area of budget discussions this year the house version of hr 4635 included 1328 billion for the housing certificate fund but did not include funding designated specifically for the 120000 incremental vouchers the administration said were vital to deal with the rising housing costs related to the strong economy however the house bill did approve 66 million for about 10000 additional vouchers that would work in tandem with the lowincome housin g tax credit program and funds for another 10000 limited distribut ion vouchers the senate version of the bill provides 1317 billion to the hcf however citing study by the council of large public housing agencies that finds one out of every five vouchers are now being returned unused the senate version of the bill also provides funds for incremental vouchers the conferees dropped the house provision for 10000 tax credit vouchers after long hiatus congress had appropr iated money for 50000 additional housing vouchers in fy1999 and 60000 in fy2000 however at house vahud appropriation subcommittee hearings in march 2000 hud was asked why so few of the 110000 incremental vouchers approved in the past 2 years had been put in use estimated to be only about 10000 at that time hud acknowledged the slowness and said that the department was developing proposals to help voucher holders pay security deposits counsel housing authorities on how to be more aggressive in reaching out to landlords and provide landlords more incentives to participate in the rental program both the house and senate appropriations committee reports on the fy2001 budget hrept 106674 and srept 106410 express concern with the increasing difficulty that lowincome families are having in using housing vouchers both reports contend that it would be inappropriate to put more vouchers into the pipeline until hud resolves the delays in getting vouchers to qualified families and until qualified families exhaust the current supplyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30504crs11 referring to the limited value of vouchers in many tight rental markets the senate appropriations committee expressed its concerns that families with vouchers often have little choice in their rental decisions leaving them often in lowincome and very lowincome neighborhoods and living in substandard housing to increase the chances of families being able to use their vouchers the senate bill allows public housing authorities to increase their payment standard for assisted rents under section 8 up to 150 of the existing fair market rent or payment standard the tight housing market situation has prompted discussions about how best to add to the production of rental housing along with renewed determination to preserve the existing stock of affordable rental housing while small number of new apartments have been built for the elderly in recent years hud has largely been out of the business of subsidizing new construction since the 1970s the senate committee report srept 106410 concluded that balanced approach to rental housing assistance is needed not just vouchers and recommended the use of 1 billion of excess section 8 funds for production program for fy2001 however the conferees dropped this provision from the final version of the bill the conferees do revise the 1998 quality housing and work responsibility act to allow larger number of projectbased vouchers than currently permitted and add more flexibility in their use these projectbased vouchers will have continued assistance option that will allow families to move from the assisted building after one year of residence and retain federal assistance this promotes more projectbased assistance which should improve voucher utilization while at the same time reducing one of the negative features of projectbased assistance the lack of tenant mobility pl 106377 funds several hud programs above the administration request in part these additional funds are offset by the recapture of excess section 8 reserves feature common to hud appropriations in recent years these recaptured funds are primarily obtained from unobligated spending authority in the moderate rehabilitation program and from undistributed housing vouchers the house bill and the senate committee version of hr 4635 both assumed 275 million in recaptures and their reuse elsewhere the conferees increased this by about 15 billion to total of 183 billion pl 106377 added 770 million for the housing certificate fund compared to the senate committee bill and 680 million more than in the housepassed version also included were funds for about 79000 incremental housing vouchers at cost of 453

house and senate appropriations committee hearings and in their reports accompanying recommended hud budgets has been the inadequacy of huds management information systems these systems provide data that help congress oversee the department and improve the ability to make informed judgments on funding levels but are necessary to huds own program management huds accounting practices for identifying excess section 8 contract reserves as well as excess projectbased section 8 assistance have been criticized in the past few years an estimated 15 billion of section 8 rental program reserves has been recovered from various local housing assistance accounts since 1995 these amounts have alerted the appropriations committees to the need to upgrade information systems and improve financial management and budgeting hud claims that the problem of excess reserve balances has been resolved but appropriators continue to examine the section 8 program for additional recaptures pl 106377 transfers appropriations from number of hud programs to working capital fund for the development and maintenance of information technology systems for example 43 million of fy2001 appropriations is transferred from the public housing capital fund 17 million from the home program and up to 15 of the funds appropriated from homeless assistance grants srept 106410 also expressed concern that hud has not collected adequate data from phas on public housing operating costs to determine an appropriate level of funding and to assess the financial and physical conditions of the public housing stock from an even wider perspective the ongoing question is whether hud public housing authorities and perhaps state housing finance agencies which arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30504crs14 responsible for managing various hud monies at the local level are adequately adopting readily available new technologies to improve management reduce costs

to phas that have 97 utilization rate hrept 106674 notes that some phas have been slow to award section 8 assistance and as result appropriated funds have been recaptured in previous years the house

willing to renew expiring contracts and the hcf includes funding for tenant protection and assistance for affected families when contract renewal does not take place according to the administration hud requested 266 million for tenant protection and assistance for fy2001 including 199 million to cover the added costs to residents when optouts and portfolio reengineering occurs and 67 million for

million more than huds request homeless assistance grants the presidents fy2001 budget requested 12 billion for homeless assistance programs an 18 increase over last years appropriation s the 12 billion included 1095 billion for homeless assistance grants approximately 90 of which would be awarded competitively to states local governments nonprofit organizations and public housing authorities this is an increase of 75 million over the fy2000 appropriation and would provide projected additional 14500 transitional beds and 11000 permanent beds all linked to supportive services the other major component of the 12 billion request was 105 million for an estimated 18000 incremental section 8 vouchers for permanent housing for families and individuals program area that was not funded for fy2000 these vouchers arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30504crs26 intended to assist graduates of the continuum of care approach comprehensive homeless programs and services linked together in finding permanent affordable housing after fy2001 hud proposes to renew these homeless vouchers as part of the baseline section 8 program to free up these funds for other homeless grant activities last year 102 billion was appropriated for homeless assistance grants virtually the same as the administrations request congress endorsed the continuum of care concept and the view that it encourages permanent and stable housing for the homeless appropriation committee reports from both houses have given special notice of the assistance the concept gives to persons with mental disabilities by helping them avoid the revolving door syndrome that many homeless exhibit by moving in and out of temporary facilities the fy2000 bill required that at least 30 of the appropriations be used for permanent housing in addition grantees were required by the bill to match 25 of the funded amount to maintain balance between homeless service s and the development of transitional and permanent housing however s rept 106410 expresses displeasure with the formula that hud now uses to allocate funding to local continuum of care recipients of funds the committee expressed concern that funds distributed using modified allocation formula based on the community development block grant program have real nexus to homeless needs the report also concludes that the use of the cdbg formula means that local recipients are assured of receiving minimum amount of funds whenever grant application meets certain minimum requirements regardless of the actual assistance for the homeless needed by the jurisdiction the committee supports efforts of the senate and house banking committees to develop separate block grant program to address homeless needs both the house and senate approved 102 billion for fy2001 for homeless assistance grants the same amount enacted for fy2000 but 180 million less than the administrations 12 billion request for fy2001 conferees agreed to 1025 5 million more than last years appropriation however pl 106377 includes an appropriation of 100 million for the shelter plus care renewals this compares with the 105 million descri bed above for vouchers for permanent housing for the homeless that the administration included in its 12 billion request for homeless assistance grants the 100 million shelter plus care renewals provision provides for the annual renewal of contracts expiring

acting to combat the practice pl 106377 appropriates 101 million to the general and special risk program account to subsidize insurance costs in these housing programs these subsidies would permit up
