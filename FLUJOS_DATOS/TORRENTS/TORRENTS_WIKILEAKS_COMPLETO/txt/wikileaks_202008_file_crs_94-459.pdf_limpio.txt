background in the early twentieth century haiti ffered from tumultuous political life and from chronic financial mismana gement eighty percent of the haitian budget went to debt service and us govern ment officials were concerned that financial obligations to its own citizens might not be met there was greater fear also that one among the warring european countries especially france or germany might establish position of influence in the country leading to naval bases that could endanger access to the newly constructed pa nama canal these concerns were heightened after the outbreak of world war i when haitian authority collapsed into bloody factional struggles in the summer of 1915 the administration of woodrow wilson determined to take action in july 1915 admiral william b caperton then embarked on the battleship washington was directed to land forces to establish or der and assume respons ibility for administering the customhouses with virtually resistance landing pa rty of some 330

12001400 marines were assigned garrison duty w ith some patrolling of the countryside establishing control once firmly established in the major population centers us officials quickly ensured the election by the haitian national assembly of an amenable president philippe sudre dartiguenave who had served as the president of the haitian senate as result of continuing unrest admiral caperton so established censorship and promulgated martial law these emergency measures were not rescinded for over n years in another move to ensure an orderly government the united states presented the haitians with treaty that permitted usnominated official to collect taxes and make debt repayments and other disbursements the treaty1 ratified by haiti in nove mber 1915 and by the us senate the following february also created constabulary or gendarmerie composed of native haitians under ameri can direction to serve both as haitis military and police force the treaty was to remain in force fo r ten years and could be extended for another ten if the purpose of this treaty has not been fully accomplished in march 1917 the duration of the 1915 treaty was offici ally extended to twenty years despite the treaty the haitian nati onal assembly was uncooperative in its relationship with us officials the state department drafted new haitian constitution which would have validated the occupation and allowed fo reigners to own property in haiti the assembly unwilling to ratify the document was dissolved when ltcol smedley d butler us marine officer serving with the haitian gendarmerie entered the capitol in june 1917 to read dissolution or der that dartiguenave had been pressured to sign unwilling to risk the election of another assembly us authorities effected the approval of the new constitution by pleb iscite only 769 votes out of 100000 were negative in june 1918 the new constitution created council of state whose members were appointed by the haitian president to perform all legislative functions until an assembly could be reconstituted at time to be determined although the united states occupied the principal towns of the country guerrilla bands remained in the mountainous in terior of the country known as cacos named after haitian bird of prey these bands had long played significant role in haitian politics fighting at times on behalf of one or more factions within the dominant francophone elite renewed attacks by guerrilla s commenced in october 1918 and persisted for number of months including raid on portaupr ince in october 1919 until the marines and the gendarmerie were able to ne utralize them by frequent pa trolling paying bounties for weapons turned in and by eliminating th eir leaders after 1920 there were only occasional outbreaks of caco violencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94459crs3 2 conducted by the select committee on haiti and the dominican republic chaired by senator medill mccormick of illinois 3 us congress senate

gradually us officers were repl aced by haitians process that was accelerated after 1929 historians otherwise critical of the occupation ac knowledge that haitians had more security in their persons and prope rty than they had ever previously known and that the gendarmerie during the occupation functioned as an ffective and impartial agency after us forces departed in 1934 haitian officers would become much more involved in political activities throughout the occupation us forces suffered minimal cas ualties totaling 10 killed and 26 wounded with 172 ot her casualties complaints of brutality against native haitians led the us congre ss to conduct hearings on iti and the dominican republic in 19222 the special committee rejected the more serious charges and concluded that most of the abuses occurred dur ing the effort to put down the caco insurrection in 1918 1919 the counterin surgency effort resulted in the deaths by some estimates of over 2000 cacos 3 although affirming that cruelty was not officially countenanced the committee noted that there were at least ten instances of illegal executions by americans once the caco rebellion was suppresse d there were virtually physical attacks by haitians on us marines or civilians after the 1922 congressi onal investigation cr iticized lack of coordination among us officials in haiti us civilian and military authority was

russell described as conscientious and somewhat imperious officer became the most powerful figure in the country he was later appointed commandant of the us marine corps end of the occupation the onset of the great depression and declining markets for haitian products especially coffee produced economic hardsh ips and contributed to increased unrest among population long denied political role

haitians subsequent inci dents were ended without ss of life but the hoover administration was concerned that it might become involved in hos tilities that us public opinion would not

1930 vol iii washington government printing office 1945 pp 217237in early 1930 president hoover appointed bipartisan commission headed by w cameron forbes formerly the governor ge neral of the philippines to investigate conditions in haiti4 after several weeks in the count ry during which testimony was taken from all sectors of the society the commission submitted report that argued that the united states could not relinquish its res ponsibilities for ensuring the financial stability of haiti but made seve ral proposals for changes especia lly the separation of civil and military responsibilities increasing the numbe r of haitians in the government and in general for less intervention in haitian domestic affairs5 in november general russell was replaced by state depar tment official dana g munr who was appointed minister rather than high commissioner an executive agreement was negotiated in 1932 providing for the complete haitianization of the garde by october 1934 and for the withdrawal of the marine brigade two year s prior to the expiration of the extended 1915 treaty washington was nonetheless termined to pull out of haiti at an earlier date arrangements were made for the election of temporary haitian president and the subsequent holding of nati onal elections in october 1930 that returned strongly nationalistic majority the complete haitianization of the garde was completed president franklin roosevelt paid an official visit to caphaitien in july 1934 and the last marines departed the following month none theless us fina ncial adviser would remain until 1941 to oversee pa yments on the haitian debt accomplishments and shortcomings of the occupation the us occupation in large measure acco mplished its goals of stabilizing haitian finances security for investors was key c oncern of the us government and to large extent became the justification for the occupation once the potential threat of european intervention disappeared with the conclusi on of world war i 16million us loan was negotiated in 1922 to cons olidate haitis outstanding foreign debts efficient collection of duties and prompt even advance payment of debts owed to us banks soon restored the countrys financial standing eventually some 60 of haitian revenues were expende d under us supervision the greatest percentage going to debt repayment some critics including the forbes commission argued that monies used for dvance repayment of debts could have been more usefully allocated to domestic projects there is consensus however that haitian finances were honestly handled during the occ upation and that steps were taken to insurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94459crs5 6 the 1930 forbes commission noted that financial transactions had been described in reports published annually in english and french and that the us comptrollers office had made thorough analysis of financial transactions without finding sign ificant problems foreign relations 1930 iii p 228that foreign interests did not take advantage of the country6 in the 1920s annual haitian government revenues of 8 10 million were double that of the preoccupation period coffee production and small bus inesses grew significantly but little progress was made in establishing sound permanently economic base for the country the occupation also resulted in the completion of significant number of public works projects mostly after 1920 most im portant was the constr uction of roads and bridges throughout the country some of wh ich was completed through highly unpopular system of forced labor or corvée although mo st of the 800 miles of roads were not hardsurfaced they greatly facilitated transportation between coastal areas and the rural uplands at time when automobiles and tr ucks were being in troduced into haiti in significant numbers number of port facilities were erected lighthouses were constructed and number of harbors were dredged efforts to improve agricultural productivity were complicated by the small si ze of land holdings and lack of accurate legal titles the united states undertook major effort to provide access to modern health care to the mass of the haitian population that in so cases had never come into contact with trained doctors and nurses national public health service was created with network of some 153 rural clinics and 11 hospitals supervised by u s navy doctors and efforts were made to provide basic medical instruction to the population this effort was financed by the haitian government at us encouragement the united states did not assume res ponsibility to build democracy and us officials did not devote significant efforts towards the encouragement of local self government prior to the occupation the haitian government had been largely the province of narrow elite consisting of bout 5 percent of the population the haitian presidents who served during most of th occupation dartigue nave 19151922 louis borno 19221930 and eugene roy who rved as temporary president from may november 1930 were elected by the council of st ate at the instigation of us authorities they in turn appointed members of the council of state there were national elections held until october 1930 and local elections that produ ced unsuitable winners were invalidated newspa pers were censored and ffending editors jailed inattention to efforts to promote democr acy stemmed in part from knowledge that any election might produce results hostile to us interests and probably from racial attitudes that considered haitians unsuited for selfgovernment the years of the haitian occupation coincided with widespread racial segregation in the united states and opposition by ma jority of us whites to political role for blacks these attitudes brought to haiti by the occupation led to soci as well as political discrimination against haitians even the educated and politically active elite that was bitterly resented and undercut wellintentioned development projects to larg extent us racial attitudeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94459crs6 7 modern reader is struck by the derogatory terms used in correspondence by senior american officials in describing haitian people for whose government and welfare they had responsibility see hans schmidt the united states occupation of haiti 19151934 new brunswick nj rutgers university

haiti had been traditionally divided be tween francophone instruction fo r the elite and very few rudimentary elementary schools for others little effort to change this situation was undertaken the mass of the population remained illiterate and the lite continued to seek an education that did not lead to careers in commerce and industry efforts to provide technical training to develop the agricultural and industr ial potential of the country the service technique were not warmly received and did not reach large number of students
