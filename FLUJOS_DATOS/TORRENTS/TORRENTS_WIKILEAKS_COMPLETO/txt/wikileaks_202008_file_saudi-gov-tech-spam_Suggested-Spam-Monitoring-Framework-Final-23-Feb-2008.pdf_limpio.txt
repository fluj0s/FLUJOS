ongoing basis this document also recommends key responsibilities for spam monitoring in the kingdom spam statistics collection framework final version page 6 of 13 confidential internal use only 2 our approach the approach to defining the approach was to focus on three key aspects 1 the definition of spam and related spam indicators 2 the identification of sources for spam related stat istics in saudi arabia 3 the definition of the manner in which the spam stat istics would be gathered spam statistics collection framework final version page 7 of 13 confidential internal use only 3 background this document covers the approach suggested to be u sed by citc for monitoring spam in saudi arabia on an ongoing basis 31 document map the following diagram shows where this document fit s in the project spam statistics collection framework final version page 8 of 13 confidential internal use only 4 proposed framework for gathering spamrelated stati stics in the kingdom 41 definition of spam and related spam indicators spam is defined in the kingdom of saudi arabia as f ollows any unsolicited electronic message that contains commercial or objectionable content transmitted without prior consent through any commu nication medium including but not limited to emails mobile messaging fax bluetoo th and instant messaging services spam is typically reported as percentage of the t otal number of received messages and is referred to as spam rate use of the same indicator to report spam in saudi rabia is recommended in order to compare and contrast the vel of spam in saudi arabia in comparison to other countries accordingly we will use three indicators to report spam in the kingdom email spam rate spam emails received in ksa on ave rage as percentage of all emails received it should be noted that the spam r ate is usually calculated at or before the point where email is filtered using an ntispam filtering tool not after the mail is filtered while taking into consideratio n the connections that are dropped on the routers or other devices due to the deployment of rbls realtime black lists as such it is assumed that every dropped connectio n corresponds to spam email therefore the spam rate is calculated while adding the number of dropped connections to the total and to the number of spam messages this method of calculating email spam is elaborated in an article published by maawg titled email metrics program the network operators pers pective similarly many organizations use the spam rate approach in reporti ng spam for example symantec and message labs sms spam rate spam smses received by mobile phone users in ksa on average as percentage of all smses received for the purp oses of this study all bulk smses are considered to be spam unless they are sent by provider with whom the subscriber has an ongoing business relationship fo r instance if subscriber has opted in to receive smses as part of certain prod uct smses sent by the provider promoting for other related products are not consid ered to be spam as such smses sent by providers to their subscribers in momt mo bile originatedmobile terminated services are not considered to be spam fax spam rate spam faxes received in ksa on averag as percentage of all faxes received for the purposes of this study all unsolicited faxes are considered to be spam unless the receiver has directly or indirec tly opted to receive these fax messages unless they are sent by provider with wh om the company has an ongoing business relationship 42 identification of sources for spam related statisti cs key sources considered relevant in the gathering an d reporting of spam related statistics were identified as follows email spam spam statistics collection framework final version page 9 of 13 confidential internal use only organizations using antispam filtering tools and re able to report on the spam mail filtered by the tool as percentage of total mails organizations that do not use antispam filtering t ools and are able to report on the spam mail received as percentage of total ema ils isps using antispam filtering tools and are able t report on the spam mail filtered by the tool as percentage of total mails organizations and isps using rbls on their routers or dedicated appliances to drop connections from known spammers organizations such as solution providers who use sensors on their antispam tools sold to customers as well as other devices ch as honeypot mail addresses to track and report on the spam mail filtered by th tool as percentage of total mails sms spam mobile service providers who own the gateways and or servers through which spam sms messages are delivered fax spam organizations who receive spam faxes 43 suggested approach for gathering spam statistics it is possible to track and monitor spam data using both primary and secondary research methods primary research methods rely on data gath ering using honeypots or from anti spam filterstools secondary research relies on da ta gathered from published sources such as reports published by security solution providers as well as bodies like maawg and spamhaus email spam reporting email spam rates based on primary researc h data in order to gather primary data it is suggested to use two step approach i setting up panel it is critical that citc gathers email spam related data from variety of sources following clear selection criteria for the participants in th panel the criteria include geographical distribution sector size etc ideally none of th selected participants should have their mail filtered by another filtering point eg isp filte r before mail reaches their gatewayserver examples of the participants are isps universities large companies like saudi aramco or sabic most of these sources are characterized by the larg amount of email received by subscribers employees students or other personnel within its domain number of these sources tend to have deployed antispam tools and accordingly will be able to provide data on the amount of spam mail trapped by these tools as percentage of mail received spam statistics collection framework final version page 10 of 13 confidential internal use only it is recommended that citc will gather set up pa nel of such organizations which would include mix of isps universities and large comp anies operating in the kingdom it would be preferred to have as many organizations as possi ble on the panel the more the number of mailboxes represented by the organizations on the p anel the more statistically accurate the spam rate will be these panel members will be requ ested to provide monthly report on total number of mailboxes represented by the organi zation total mail received spam mail trapped or tagged by the tool number of dropped connections it is suggested that citc request each of these org anizations to send the required data by email by the 7th of every month to designated person within citc in order to facilitate suitable collation and analysis citc should monitor the response quality and timeli ness of each of the selected panel members on an ongoing basis and be prepared to eith er work with the members to improve the responses or change the members ii calculating the email spam rate having obtained the required data it is suggested that citc calculates the spam rate for each of the respondents using the formula spam rate spam mail trapped or tagged by the too l number of dropped connections total mail received num ber of dropped connections the spam rate is typically expressed as percentag it should be noted that it has been assumed in the above calculation that each dropped connection is the equivalent of one spam mail blocked by the antispam tool in order to calculate the average across all organi zations the above calculation should be done using the sum of each field across all organiz ations thus the value of the total mail received would be the total of all mail received ac ross all organizations and the value of the number of dropped connections would be the sum of ll dropped connections across all organizations iii reporting the email spam rate having calculated the email spam rate in the kingdo m citc should post this rate on its website as well as include it in any security alert reports sent out periodically to subscribers if applicable it should be noted that the email spam rate reporte d by such means does not represent spam accurately as it does not account for optin r optout considerations included in the spam definition instead the spam rate calculated here represents the abusive mail that seek to exploit the enduser this approach is consistent with the approach used by organizations like maawg for tracking email spam metrics reporting email spam rates based on secondary resea rch data in addition to the above method it is recommended that citc coordinate with security solution providers and other parties engaged in mon itoring spam rates on global basis including saudi arabia spam statistics collection framework final version page 11 of 13 confidential internal use only number of such organizations including messagela bs and symantec publish such spam rates on country basis on regular basis while such data may occasionally be available free it is possible that such data may only be pro vided by these service providers against fee which would have to be mutually agreed between citc and the relevant body additionally citc should coordinate with bodies li ke maawg and spamhaus which periodically publishes the names of the worst spam offenders as well as countries and citc could provide such information to its subscribers i n order for them to take suitable precautions fax spam since there is very little published secondary data on fax spam rates the only way in which citc can keep track of such spam rates is to use pr imary research data reporting fax spam rates based on primary research data in order to gather primary data it is suggested to use two step approach iv setting up panel it is recommended that citc set up panel of 20 rge organizations eg universities and companies that have significant operations in the kingdom and have publicized their fax details on their websites andor other prominent pu blications these panel members will be requested to provide monthly report on total number of faxes received on designated fax nu mbers number of faxes received that are considered to be spam including unsolicited marketing messages it is suggested that citc request each of these org anizations to send the required data by email by the 7th of every month to designated person within citc in order to facilitate collation and analysis each of the organizations w ill have to implement suitable measures to record the number of faxes received each day on des ignated fax numbers citc should monitor the response quality and timeli ness of each of the selected panel members on an ongoing basis and be prepared to eith er work with the members to improve the responses or change the members v calculating the fax spam rate having obtained the required data it is suggested that citc calculates the spam rate for each of the respondents using the formula spam rate number of spam faxes received total number of faxes receiv ed the spam rate is typically expressed as percentag in order to calculate the average across all organizations the above calculation should be done using the sum of each field across all organizations thus the value of the total fax mai l received would be the total of all fax mail received across all organizations and the value of the number of spam faxes would be the sum of all spam faxes across all organizations vi reporting the fax spam rate having calculated the fax spam rate in the kingdom citc should post this rate on its website as well as include it in any security alert reports sent out periodically to subscribers if applicable spam statistics collection framework final version page 12 of 13 confidential internal use only given the low levels of fax spam rate identified du ring the study this is not considered major issue presently in the kingdom and can there fore monitoring and reporting of the fax spam rate can be accorded lower priority by citc sms spam rate calculating the sms spam rate in the kingdom is mor complex than the email and fax spam rates this is especially so since most of the mobile operators follow the gsma definition of spam based on which not all unsolici ted commercial messages are considered spam unless they meet other criteria like being abu sive or contain reference to premium rate numbers etc it is therefore suggested that citc request all mob ile sms service providers in the kingdom to report on the sms spam rate as detected by their filters using the gsma spam rate definition the sms spam rate accordingly is provided by the fo llowing value sms spam rate total sms spam detected using the gsma definition of spam total number of sms messages 44 responsibility for monitoring spam rates given the nature of the role involved and the assoc iated responsibilities it is recommended that the cert team within citc is given the respons ibility of tracking and reporting the email sms and fax spam rates on monthly basis thus the cert team will be responsible for setting up suitable panels for each of the spam rates and will work with each panel to obtain the r equired data on monthly basis spam statistics collection framework final version page 13 of 13 confidential internal use only 5 conclusion it is important that suitable monitoring and report ing mechanism be set up to track spam rates in the kingdom on an ongoing basis it is rec ommended that combination of primary and secondary research data be used as the basis fo r collating analysing and reporting such data it is recommended that the cert team within citc be responsible for the collation and analysis of spam data in the kingdom using the app roach provided the spam rates obtained using primary data must be compared and co ntrasted with secondary data in order to analyze the possible reasons for major deviations if any it must be recognized that while these spam rates d provide good idea of the level of spam in the kingdom the reported rates will never fully reflect the actual reality given constraints around the sample size nature of filte ring spam as well as the statistical accuracy limitations of the data gathered through t he primary research
