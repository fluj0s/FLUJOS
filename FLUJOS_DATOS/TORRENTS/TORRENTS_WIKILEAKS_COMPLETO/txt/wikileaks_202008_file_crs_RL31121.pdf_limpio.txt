yards of soil was removed enough to fill 53000 dump trucks above ground the former asphalt parking lot located adjacent to the east front of the capitol was replaced by plaza of broad lawns granite paving stones stone benches reflecting pools and tulip poplar trees visitors enter the center through doorways located at the bottom of two gently descending pathways centered on the east facade beneath two large fountains that were part of the original olmsted design visitors are also able to access the center by broad stairway or an elevator the major structural work on the center was completed in december 2004 construction workers then focused on finishing work inside the structure including the mechanical electrical and plumbing systems number of factors pushed back the projects completion date and increased its cost unusually wet weather in 2003 the discovery of asbestos in the part of the capitol that is connected to the center and an unknown centuryold well under the construction site were all unanticipated added expenses were incurred because of higherthanexpected bids several design changes security upgrades following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 an unplanned air filtration system fitting out house and senate expansion space extra expenses associated with working around the capitol such as security screening for thousands of construction workers and thousands of construction vehicles that entered the construction site and millions of dollars in outside consultant fees while the center was being constructed it was not without its detractors opponents expressed concern over its cost the destruction or relocation of dozens of trees on the east front grounds of the capitol design said to destroy the visual and spatial relationships of the east lawn the disruption caused by such large project and the loss of parking spaces at the base of the capitol 2 just prior to the official opening of the capitol visitor center however it was praised in new york times editorial as offering magnificent way to enter one of the great living monuments to american democracy although the opening of the center was long overdue and cost an eyepopping 621 million the times concluded for that money the american people will get firstclass experience it deserves to be used and celebrated and does honor to history of accomplishment

factor was an increased concern about the security and safety of the capitol itself as well as those who work in or visit it almost one among the parliaments of the world the us capitol has consistently remained the peoples house open to all visitors surrounded and enhanced by grounds designed by frederick law olmsted sr the father of american landscape architecture as the 20 th century drew to close concerns about security were dramatized by an increasing incidence of attacks on civilian targets especially those possessing historic or symbolic value by terrorist groups and rogue states all these developments contributed to the eventual decision that the need for facility for visitors to the us capitol had passed from desirability to necessity the arguments favoring visitor center were detailed in the mid1970s when the architect of the capitol issued toward master plan for the united states capitol which recommended construction of building to improve security and accommodate the increasing number of visitors to the us capitol it was deemed necessary not only to meet the physical needs of visitors to the capitol but also to meet the changing nature of visitor expectations and their desire to witness the legislative branch in action4 the center is intended to provide secure environment for managing large number of visitors while protecting the capitol building its occupants and guests it is expected to also offer visitors new educational opportunities through exhibits displays of historical documents and documentary presentations and more accessible resources and amenities the capitol alan hantman former architect of the capitol observed has continually evolved for more than 200 years to meet the needs of congress as the nation as grown the center hantman felt will meet the needs of the millions of visitors who come to the capitol each year and have not been properly accommodated in the past 5 at september 10 2002 hearing of

the capitol aoc received funds from the house and senate appropriations committees to develop design concept which was subsequently approved by the appropriations committees and the senate committee on rules and administration in 1993 the united states capitol preservation commission allocated 26 million to translate the concept into formal design which was prepared by rtkl associates inc in

purposes 1 enhance the visitor experience by providing structure located under the east front plaza of the capitol which would afford improved visitor orientation other related programs and support services 2 strengthen capitol security while ensuring the preservation of an atmosphere of public access and 3 integrate the design concepts of the center with aesthetically and functionally appropriate improvements to the east front plaza14 the overall intent of the visitor center the architect explained in the 1995 is to create visitorfriendly environment by providing educational opportunities with wide range of choices together with amenities such as adequate rest rooms eating facilities telephones and ample weatherprotected queuing space now regarded as expectations of an increasingly well traveled and sophisticated public15 also included in the plan were full accommodation for persons with physical or sensory impairments16 and relocated security screening for visitors to point far removed from the capitol there is recognized concern the report emphasized to enhance facilities for dealing with the security needs of the capitol which are now addressed in way that detracts from the dignity of the capitol and cannot provide the optimum treatment of security needs17

mental illness killed two us capitol police officers stationed near public entrance to the capitol in july 1998 however did the idea gain momentum the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks at the pentagon and in new york and the subsequent discovery of anthrax in congressional office buildings highlighted concerns regarding the potential vulnerabilities of the capitol and the need for improved security on capitol hill these developments influenced congressional discussions concerning the necessity of spending money on the center and the final funds needed to begin construction were made

association of america the architect of the capitol decided for the first time to engage an outside construction management firm to supervise capitol construction at the request of the architects office gsa developed the documentation needed for the qualificationsbased selection process which eventually drew the interest of 22 firms46 the best value source selection process used to select the construction management firm evaluates proposals with predefined criteria which mandates more than consideration of price alone and is used by gsa department of fense dod and others the source selection process provides standard to differentiate and rank competitors by analyzing past performance and technical management abilities to solve the specific cvc needs thus allowing selection of contractor who will give the aoc the best value to construct the cvc47 in january 2001 according to press accounts gilbane building company providence rhode island construction management firm was selected to monitor and inspect the general construction process of the center gilbane was also given responsibility for historic preservation measures including repairs and alterations to the existing capitol and modifications that help facilitate the operation and meet revised codes in addition gilbane performed security analysis of the project to better control schedules and costs

to relocate the utility lines which had been installed at various times during the last 100 years prior to beginning construction of the center due to the fact that many of the utility lines were poorly or inaccurately documented on available drawings relocating them proved to be delicate and by far the most difficult preconstruction task as it became increasingly apparent that existing drawings were potentially unreliable much of the utility work was shifted to nights or on weekends and to extent possible work was executed around the legislative calendar in an effort to minimize disruption to the capitol and its occupants during the fall of 2002 the relocation of utilities was completed and the projects footprint was ready for excavation 49 46 debra k rubin and william j

little more room to be creative in how they can meet our requirements fontana did however emphasize that the east front plaza would be substantially complete for the basic activities of the 2005

committee was particularly troubled by the lack of timely communication receipt of conflicting information and inadequate and inaccurate reporting on the project and its financial status as consequence the committee had serious reservations about providing additional funding under the control of the architect of the capitol given the track record of the architects organization and inability to manage to address these issues the committee told the architect that he personally must take immediate action to remedy this situation and ensure the completion of the center without delay and in fiscally responsible manner 92 some members of the house appropriations subcommittee on legislative anticipated that the senate would include additional funding for the center in its legislative branch bill and at that point the issue might well be revisited house supporters according to congressional quarterly attributed the centers rising costs to unforeseen

appropriating an additional 478 million for the cvc project the senate language stipulated that the architect of the capitol could not obligate any of the funds however without an obligation plan

corporation financial consulting firm to evaluate the cvc costs95 tishman submitted its cost analysis in midmay 2003 soon thereafter the general accounting office reviewed the tishman methodology assumptions and support for the analysis including contingencies scope items not included in the estimates and risks and uncertainties gao also conducted supplemental analysis to identify potential future costs due to additional risks and uncertainties not included in the tishman estimate while gao found that tishmans analysis was generally reasonable given the scope and assumptions provided by the aoc it identified cost adjustments to tishmans analysis of the base project totaling 7 million that need to be added these adjustments gao comptroller general david m walker reported in prepared statement for july 15 2003 house hearing incr eased tishmans estimated cost at completion for the basic project from 3443 million to 3513 million 96 walker also told the house appropriations subcommittee on legislative that an estimated additional 70 million might be needed to complete the house and senate expansion space and 35 million for enhanced security97 walker went on to emphasize in his prepared statement that due to the nature of the uncertainties still surrounding the projects estimated cost to complete and the limitations of information available there would likely be events occurring in the future that could further materially affect the projects cost at completion these additional risks and uncertainties gao had determined could potentially raise the estimated cost at competition of the base project to between 380 million and 395 million while these potential additional costs of between 30 million to 45 million do not now need to be added to the base project budget gao cautioned that numb er of actions needed to be taken to mitigate known risks and there is continual need of the aoc to align customer expectations with the projects scope quality

fully integrated schedule for all of the centers projects activities and longleadtime procurements and develop plan to mitigate risk factors in addition he encouraged the architect and congress to 1 expeditiously address the current funding gap between the amount provided for the project and the updated estimates 2 consider how best to address potential costs associated with the risks and uncertainties 3 determine whether to establish and fund reserve account for any additional costs that cannot be priced or estimated at the current time 4 implement controls for approving changes work toward achieving single and standardized budget and reporting format and 5 expeditiously develop comprehensive integrated master project schedule 99 architect of the capitol alan m hantman who also testified at the july 2003 house hearing stated that unforeseen site conditions had significantly impacted the cost of the project these costs when combined with the higher award amount for the sequence 2 contract prompted the aoc to request review of the overall costtocomplete also hantman said it is already evident that the expected cost of number of line items in the project cost estimate such as utility relocation tree preservation temporary visitor screening facilities and historic preservation will be exceeded these issues he explained had in april 2003 prompted full and independent review of the costtocomplete all the remaining work related to the center and in midmay the independent costtocomplete report was turned over to gao on june 9 2003 gao presented its findings to the capitol preservation commission 100 despite the challenges enumerated earlier and pending the appropriation of the additional funds identified in the costtocomplete funding reques t the architect felt the project team was on schedule to meet project completion milest ones also hantman emphasized that cvc communications initiatives most specifically efforts to keep members and staff informed about

total of federal funds that can be obligated or expended for the tunnel connec ting the center with the library of congress 3 prohibiting the architect of the capitol from obligating funds for the

project will continue including expected delay costs120 by the november 2005 hearing dorn was able to tell the subcommittee that gaos pr eliminary work now indicated that the cvc project is likely at minimum to cost 5429 million this figure he explained does not provide any more funds for the remaining risk and uncertainties that may materialize or cover the cost of delays that may occur it also could change again if the construction schedule changes 121 also gao pointed out during the hearings that while majority of the delays and cost increases associated with the construction of the center were beyond aocs control weaknesses in aocs schedule and contract management activities have contributed to portion of the delays and cost overruns to help prevent further schedule delays control cost growth and enhance worker safety gao reasoned that the aoc urgently needs to give priority attention to managing the projects construction schedules and contracts including those contract provisions that address worker safety such actions are imperative if further cost growth schedule delays and worker safety problems are to be avoided aoc also needs to see that it reports accurate information to congress on the project additionally decisions by the congress will have to be made regarding the additional funding needed to complete construction and to address any related risk and uncertainties that may arise 122 during the next several months gao concluded aoc is likely to face competing demands for funds that can be used for either cvc construction or operations given this reality it will be important for aoc to ensure that the available funds are optimally used additionally gao was concerned that aoc may incur costs to open the facility to the public in september 2006 that it would not incur if it postponed the opening until after the construction work is more or fully completethat is in march 2007 according to aocs estimates 123 at the may and june 2005 hearings architect of the capitol alan m hantman told the subcommittee that he felt the cvc could be completed by september 2006 except for the expansion space which is to be completed in march 2007 hantmans projection was

the subcommittee that cvc contractors had taken number of actions to promote and manage site safety124 on september 15 hantman told the subcommittee that aoc and its contractors were creatively and responsibly striving to meet the scheduled completion date but there may well be items relating to commissioning to finetuning of mechanical systems and punch list items that might postpone the cvcs public opening as conse quence for planning purposes it would be prudent to aim for december 2006 this adjustment would not affect the completion date for the house and senate expansion space month later hantman once again emphasized that december 2006 remains more prudent date for public opening than the september 2006 date125 gao stressed in its september testimony however that unless the projects scope is changed or extraordinary actions are taken the base project is more likely to be completed sometime in the spring or summer of 2007 this opinion was reiterated in gaos october testimony also at the october hearing marvin shenkler representative of gilbane building company the visitor centers construction management contractor told the subcommittee the competition date was overly optimistic and not likely to be accomplished126 by the midnovember 2005 hearing the opening date for the center seemed even less firm because of continuing lack of adequate wall stone deliveries these delays had been prompted by an ongoing legal dispute in federal court between pennsylvaniabased annandale sandstone and the wisconsinbased quarry stone co the companies responsible for supplying and fabricating stone for the project 127 124 testimony of alan m hantman architect of the capitol and bob hixon cvc project manager us congress senate committee on appropriations

the 2005 senate hearings focused on the overall construction and cost of the cvc considerable portion of th discussion at may 3 2005 house appropriations committee hearing focused on the specifics of the unfinished house office space in the center representative david obey ranking minority member of the committee expressed concern that the space we are getting seems to be almost all show and very little workspace he questioned that mix and asked whether the house was getting the amount of working space it needed and even at this late date isnt there any way that we can get more usable space as he saw it the house was getting only one room that was public hearing room 128 other house members expressed concerns over the escalating cost of the center which aoc hantman testified is expected to reach 517 million by the time the structure is completed129 although the aoc at several points during the hearing stated that the current plans had been reviewed and received the approval of the house office building commission which includes the speaker house majority and house minority leaders representative obey made it clear that he intended to oppose the project unless changes were made130 by virtue of provision included in fy2002 legislative branch appropriations act representative obey could have blocked this phase of the project as enacted pl 10768 prohibited the aoc from obligating funds for the house expansion space within the center without the approval of the chair and ranking minority member of the house appropriations committee 131 in subsequent action the house on may 5

on june 16 2005 the house committee on appropriations marked up and ordered reported its version of the fy2006 legislative branch funding bill on voice vote the panel approved draft spending bill that provided 369 million for the cvc project the house figure was considerably less than the 722 million requested by the aoc and did not provide any of the 35285 million originally requested by the architect for the centers operations133 the house appropriations committee also included in its draft bill 341 million in fy2006 for the house portion of expenses related to the cvc this figure represented 6555 million reduction from the requested amount of 9965 million these funds were to used for carpeting furnishings wiring and audiovisual requirem ents in addition the house bill contained provision establishing capitol visitor center governing board to address the issue of daily operations of the visitor center134 the bill was reported to the house on june 16 2005

operations senate appropriators reporting hr 2985 emphasized that because gao fe lt the amount requested by the architect 369 million is unlikely to be sufficient to complete the cac the committee had added 5 million to the budget based on gaos recommendation also since the schedu led september 2006 opening of center was likely to be delayed well beyond the time frame on which budget estimates for operations were predicted senate appropriators reduced the budget for center operations from the requested 353 million to 23 million the senate version of hr 2985 did not contain the house provision for capitol visitor center governing board but did include provision authorizing the architect of the capitol to appoint an executive director of the capitol visitor center 135

appropriations subcommittee on the legislative branch held series of hearings on the progress of the cvc these sessions focused primarily on factors affecting the projects construction schedule and cost at the first three hearings architect of the capitol alan hantman and cvc project director robert hixon told the senate appropriators that they anticipated the cvc would be completed by march 2007 with fo rmal opening month later by the june 28 hearing however hantman conceded that opening of the cvc would be delayed until mid or late july 2007 and the house and senate expansion spaces would be available month later143 prior to the architects announcement the government accountability office had consistently questioned the architects optimistic completion dates at the february 2006 hearing gao indicated it felt the cvc could be opened to the public with temporary cap on visitor occupancy in may 2007 gao felt the house and senate expansion spaces could be opened beginning in midaugust to early september 2007 and congress might even be able to begin occupying the expansion spaces earlier if aoc implements phased opening plan it is considering the center however could also be finished even later if aoc experiences major problems completing construction such as with installing interior stone or testing major building systems during the subsequent oversight hearings in april and may 2006 gao expressed similar sentiments regarding possible completion date for the cvc 144 141 us office of management and budget budget of the united states government fiscal year 2007

on the projected opening of the cvc pending further reassessment gao stated at the june 2006 hearing the aocs new july and august 2007 time frames appear to be reasonable tentative targets for opening the cvc and house and senate expansion spaces gao went on to explain in some detail the various issues that had pushed the cvc opening back to july 2006 and why they concurred with the adjustment when risks materialized between the june and august hearings especially in connection with the cvcs fire protection system and as consequence of delays in number of important activities there was lessening of gao confidence in the likelihood of the cvcs teams meeting the targeted completion dates 145 by late september 2006 however the architect and gao were once again projecting different completion dates the architect had pushed back the completion date to september 2007 while gao felt that the project is much more likely to be completed in november to december 2007 146 in november 2006 gao told the subcommitte the cvc completion day could slip to early 2008147 gao told the subcommittee in ap ril may and june 2006 that about 530 million had already been provided for the construction of the cvc it estimated that the total cost to complete the entire cvc project is about 556 million without an allowance for risks and uncertainties and 584 million with such an allowance148 although gao

14 2006 house hearing on the fy2007 legislative branch appropriations bill representative david obey ranking minority member of the house appropriations committee questioned architect of the capitol alan hantman at some length regarding the escalating cost of the center and frequent changes in its projected completion date despite having to overcome significant hurdles hantman told the committee weve been making tremendous progress and predicted that the center should be ready for formal opening in april 2007 hantman went on to say that the house and senate office spaces flanking the center would be unveiled during the summer of 2007 obey countered by reiterating earlier concerns that even with its additional house and senate office space the center does not provide enough additional working space for members and staff because of his overall concerns about the project obey said he would refuse to vote for another spending bill that included additional funds for the center and was unwilling to identify himself in any way with the mistakes associated with this boondoggle 154

day after architect of the capitol hantman appeared before house appropriators he met with the senate appropriations committee which used the hearing to conduct its monthly review of the cvc project once again gao officials as they had at committee oversight hearing month earlier expressed concerns over continuing delays in the project they did concede however that some of those delays were prompted by redesign resulting from the cvc teams misunderstanding of congressional requirements for certain spaces as well as securityrelated design changes gao assistant director of physical infrastructure terrell dorn reiterated earlier concerns that the aocs projected completion dates for the project were too optimistic and did not allow enough time for several critical activities to take place or for risk and uncertainties that continue to affect the project hantman however remained convinced that the center except for the house and senate expansion spaces would be completed in march 2007 with formal opening month later at the hearing gao estimated that the final cost of the project would range from 556 million to as much as 584 million previously the estimated range had been between 555 million and 584 million 155 153 us congress senate committee on appropriations subcommittee on the legislative branch capitol visitor center hearings 109th cong 2nd sess aug 2 2006

subcommittee on legislative branch learned that the completion date for the cvc would be delayed an additional six months the previous november former architect of the capitol alan hantman whose 10year appointment ended just few days before the subcommittees hearing told congressional appropriators that the center would be completed by end of 2007 reasons for the delay were explained to the subcommittee by stephen t ayers who is serving as acting architect of the capitol until new architect is appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate although the construction phase of the project was now 90 complete and major construction activities would begin to wind down in march several important aspects of the project remained the tasks now left to do ayers said largely involve aesthetics and functionality of the space such as painting installation of carpet and light fixtures handrails as well as the tiein of the building systems the final and most complex challenges ahead are the acceptance testing of the fire security and lifesafety systems and the commissioning of the sophisticated building systems unfortunately th complex tasks were not built into the current schedule or into the fire and lifesafety acceptance testing plan after carefully evaluating past contractor performance schedules and the nature of the issues that remain ayers felt more realistic schedule would result in the issuance of certificate of occupancy in the spring of 2008 following the issuance of the certificate an additional two to three months would be needed to install furniture and furnishings train staff and conduct dry runs of tours as well as other operational training scenarios 166 164 pl 1105 121 stat 38 february 15 2007 165 us office of management and budget budget of

explained that additional money would not be needed to complete the project above the 20 million in construction funds already requested for fiscal 2008 terrell dorn di rector of physical infrastructure for gao was not as optimistic about the final price tag for the facility gao estimated that the center would cost in excess of 600 million and the cvc would probably need an additional 15 million above its current fiscal 2008 request subcommittee chair debbie wasserman schultz called the prospect of having to revise aocs fiscal 2008 budget request because it had failed to meet unrealistic deadlines disturbing scenario and added she expected aoc to develop more realistic monthly goals to track progress of the project 167 in her opening remarks the chair wasserman schultz accented the point that she and the ranking subcommittee member zachary wamp agreed we cant do lot about what happened up to now but we do need to make sure that we engage an aggressive oversight and accountability for what comes next and see this project through to fruition she also stressed the importance of focusing on the present and making sure that we dont continue to have interminable

capitol visitor center in march 2007 acting architect of the capitol stephen t ayers again emphasized that aoc continued to believe that certificate of occupancy will be issued in spring 2008 and did not foresee the need for additional fy2008 funds to complete cvc construction ayers did say however that it was not uncommon for contractors to submit claims for contracts of this size and aoc expects the contractor to submit additional claims when the project nears completion since at this point they could not determine the va lidity or cost of any potential claims if any prior to their being received and evaluated additional funds to cover these potential claims would not be needed until fy2009 170 ayers told the subcommittee that aoc was aggre ssively implementing all actions identified in the action plan which covers all elements of construction including the house and senate expansion spaces and the library of congress tunnel and increasing oversight of critical activities recent billing statements ayers explained indicated that the project was 91 complete and at the current pace construction would be substantially completed early in the summer of 2007 this would allow the final fire and lifesafety acceptance testing to commence as scheduled exterior work including final landscaping activities removal of the perimeter fencing security trailers and other temporary security elements will continue into the fall 171 march 2007 testimony by terrell g dorn gao director of physical facilities issues reconfirmed both the agencys projected cost and completion dates problems in completing the installation integration operation and testing of complex building systems including the fire alarm security and hv ac systems dorn explained remain the most significant risk facing the projects schedule barring future construction delays the house and senate expansion spaces would be completed before the cvcs construction but both the cvc space and expansion spaces will be available for occupancy at the same time because aoc is planning to test the fire protection and other major building systems in both facilities concurrently 172 april 2007 further delay in completion of the cvc was announced by acting architect of the capitol stephen t ayers at house legislative branch subcommittee oversight hearing on april 24 ayers told the appropriators that aoc anticipated receiving certificate of occupation in june 2008 and the cvc should be opened to the public three months later with very little time to assess aocs disclosure terrell dorn emphasized in his testimony that gao could not thoroughly assess aocs new scheduled project completion date or the projects estimated cost at completion dorn did say however that given the projects history the risk of additional communication and coordination breakdowns betwee n the aocs chief fire marshall and the cvc team remains and such breakdowns could affect the projects overall completion date 173

subcommittee on june 27 2007 he told the panel that construction of the capitol visitor center was 95 percent complete and testing of the fire and lifesafety systems was scheduled to begin in the fall an operations transition team had begun working to transition the cvc from construction project to fully staffed and equipped visitor services operation and it was anticipated that certificate of occupancy could be issued in june 2008 one of the top priorities now is to recruit chief executive officer for visitor services ceovs who will be responsible for the overall operation of the cvc and the implementation of the policies and programs that fulfill the cvcs mission of security visitor comfort and education once that person is hired other cvc operations staffing could begin 174 aoc ayers further explained had begun to hire staff to attend to the facilitys maintenance which will report to the capitol superintendents office and awarded the cvc food service contract to restaurant associates effective may 31 2007 in the immediate future aoc would be working with the congressional leadership on an advanced reservation system developing cvc web site stocking and staffing gift

completion date if the cvc team promptly made significant improvements in its execution of the project and the projects schedule because the projects expected completion date remained uncertain gao

ranking subcommittee member zach wamp in their remarks stressed the importance of making sure that the center was open in time to accommodate preparations for the 2009 presidential inauguration 177 september 2007 acting architect of the capitol stephen t ayers and terrell g dorn gaos director of physical infrastructure issues announced at the subcommittees oversight hearing on september 26 2007 that they had reached agreement on november 2008 opening date for the cvc and an updated costtocomplete figure of 621 million ayers testified that an additional 39 million in appropriated funds would be needed to finish the cvc figure dorn said gao believed was reasonable provided there are unusual delays the revised estimate of 621 million dorn explained reflects among other things the cost associated with extending the date for completing sequence 2 work and is consistent with our report at the july 31 2007 cvc hearing that the total cost of completing the projects construction was likely to exceed 600 million the new 621 million estimate includes contingency amounts for delays change orders and remaining uncertainties among other things related to the projects fire alarm testing our review of this estimate indicates that it is reasonable given the information available at this time provided there are extraordinary lays in the future although there is still considerable uncertainty about th cost impact of earlier construction delays and future fire alarm testing we believe reasonable budgetary allowances have been made 178 november 2007 at the

marshal to refine the scope and approach for completing the remaining phases of the fire and lifesafety acceptance tests in addition ayers provided updates on the finishing touches being made to the congressional auditorium orientation theaters exhibition hall cvc restaurant radio and tv gallery house and senate atriums plaza deck and signage 180 us capitol police chief phillip d morse told the subcommittee that between 21 and 143 new officers would be needed to adequately man the cvc depending upon how many days week it would be open and whether capitol tours were funneled exclusively through the new center since he did not anticipate that the new officers would be hired and trained by the projected november 2008 opening date current officers would be temporarily called upon to work extra hours at cost of between 26 million and 156 million chair debbie wassermanschultz said there were number of different ways to ensure adequate police staffing once the center opened and suggested that the subcommittee would explore the issue at future hearing relatedly several subcommittee members expressed concern that staffled tours entering the capitol through the tunnels from the cannon house office building and the russell senate office building might be scaled back or eliminated once the visitor center opens an approach chief morse said would reduce police staffing demands 181 the subcommittee was told that the center was still scheduled to open in november 2008 and the 621 million cost estimate remained unchange d terrell g dorn gaos director of physical infrastructure issues however cautioned that delays in the complicated fire alarm acceptance testing which is critical to obtaining certificate of occupancy for the cvc and preparing for operations could still

actually get to the entrance of the center and whether there will there will be sufficient funding to staff the center since september 11 2001 the capitol police have prohibited unscreened buses from driving close to the capitol currently as previously disc ussed tour buses drop their passengers off at the bottom of capitol hill on the west side the capitol considerable distance and uphill walk from the entrance of the cvc which is located on the east side of the capitol several plans including one to have trams take visitors to the cvc from union station have been proposed to transport tourists to the cvc once they get off tour buses each of these ideas however would add considerable additional cost to the already expensive project when capitol police chief phillip morse was asked whether buses could be prescreened and emptied of luggage before coming to the capitol morse indicated that he was preparing report on options for prescreening buses which was due to be released on

visitors traveling on private tour buses to get to the capitol complex by walking from dropoff point on the west front of the capitol or by riding special circulator bus from union station which would cost 100 and drop people off directly at the site chief morse maintained that with security needs paramount and little space available near the capitol the transit plan for the cvc was sound moneme shared the districts plans to enhanced transit service to the capitol complex217 pantuso however raised several concerns regarding the circulator bus proposal he argued that 1 union station did not have adequate space to accommodate the 1000 private buses that bring as many as 55000 visitors each day during the peak season into the district of columbia 2 circulator buses were smaller than most private tour buses thus making it more difficult to keep larger groups together and for chaperones to keep track of members of their group and 3 the assumption that dc circulator buses were more secure than private motorcoaches and therefore 215 testimonies of phillip d morse chief of the us capitol police and terrie s rouse cvc chief executive officer for visitor services us congress house
