of the company operations in stability operations and support operations newsletter series our focus in volume iii is companylevel patrolling int and information operations io all three are so intertwined in stability operations and support operations as to be inseparable the primary source for int at the company level in stability operations and support operations is patrolling the primary delivery means for io at the company level is the patrol situational awareness at the company level begins with int preparation of the battlefield ipb that is to say company operations should begin with ipb by the company leadership we also offer extracts from call handbook 0320 stability operations and support operations n developing situational understanding through collection and analysis of information i am especially pleased to highlight in this volume contribution from our british allies on their approach to counterinsurgency operations this article concentrates on patrolling int and io other areas of particular note in this volume are training materials on patrolling the situational training exercise stx lane concept for combat patrols at the joint readiness training center jrtc the highlights from those lanes in recent rotations and an article on how best to tackle the challenges of patrolling we finish with considerations on io at the company level before proceeding with chapter 1 let again emphasize that this newsletter is one of multivolume series on company operations in stability operations and support operations although this volume can be read and used in stand alone it is best used in the context of the other volumes for example patrol mission requires planning briefing executing and debriefing followed by analysis volume i in this series concerns company command and control specifically tactics techniques and procedures ttp on setting up company command posts to handle patrolling and other related stability operations and support operations missions so as you read this volume understand that there are related threads in the remainder of the series stability operations and support operations are complex subjects with many overlapping and intertwined themes for official use only iiicompanylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3chapter 1 intelligence preparation of the battlefield ipb and the infantry company in stability operations and support operations maj brian williams jrtc call cell chief d3 the company has been conducting operations in their company sector for three days earlier in the day the company had been in directfire contact with anticoalition forces the company missions for today are escorting water trailer to the villagers in jabr nahr hufton and also escorting iraqi civil defense corps icdc personnel from the village of wadi tarif jetertown to the tiertwo sites within the company sector headquarters section and elements from 2nd platoon are delivering the water trailer to the villagers as part of company sweatms sewage water electricity academics trash medical and security initiative program to the village the platoon is traveling north along maddox road at approximately 1110 hours as the platoon turns north onto fullerton an explosion erupts destroying the companys 5ton truck and water trailer and killing the two soldiers in the vehicle at the same time1st platoon is traveling along the trail network south of wadi tarif the platoon turns northeast onto the trail leading into the southwestern sector of wadi tarif at approximately 1124 as the platoon crosses lowwater crossing an explosion erupts killing three soldiers and destroying their high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle hmmwv as company senior observercontroller the past year i have had the opportunity to see variety of units not typically seen at the joint readiness training center jrtc i have covered down on mechanized infantry light infantry and armor companies all tasked with stability operations and support operations missions to facilitate the transfer of power to the iraqi people each company with varying degrees of success accomplished their assigned tasks by the time they departed jrtc they were ready to take the fight to the enemy nonetheless the training deficiency common to all the companies observed was mission analysis specifically the estimate of the situation and the int preparation of the battlefield ipb process to identify the most likely enemy course of action coa according to fm 34130 intelligence preparation of the battlefield the four steps of ipb are the following 1 define the battlefield environment 2 describe the battlefield effects 3 evaluate the threat 4 determine threat coa 1 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedfm 34130 further states the following the ipb process is continuous you conduct ipb prior to and during the commands initial planning for an operation but you also continue to perform ipb during the conduct of the operation emphasis added fm 720 the infantry battalion states the following though the information flows from the s2 who also prepares the various overlays and templates the ipb is the commanders decisionmaking tool finally fm 710 the infantry company paragraph 214 states the following once the company commander has full appreciation of the situation from the ipb process he then develops several coa that will accomplish his mission ipb is an important tool that company commanders must understand and use it is even more important in the contemporary operational environment coe company commanders today are given tasks and responsibilities previously outside the scope of companylevel leadership today companies execute combatoriented tasks such as cordon and search even as they perform stability operations support operations and information operations io within their company sector how then can commanders accomplish their assigned tasks the short answer is ipb to illustrate the four steps of the ipb consider the above scenario unfortunately this was not the first time that the unit had experienced an improvised explosive devise ied attack the day prior the unit struck an ied wounding two soldiers and damaging vehicle that same day the unit was also held up at lowwater crossing due to the discovery of an ied that explosive ordnance disposal eod personnel later destroyed within the battalion as whole ied attacks were not new in the previous two days the battalion had suffered two ied attacks within the battalion area of operations ao step one of the ipb is to define the battlefield environment characteristics or categories the commander needs to consider include the following the terrain and weather of the area the population demographics including ethnic groups religious groups age and income the political andor social economics and the infrastructure transportation and telecommunications for simplicity the two primary religious groups within the company sector are sunni and shiite muslims within the village of jabr nahr the population ratio is generally 90 sunni and 6 shia the remaining 4 is mainly kurdish the majority of whom are sunni outside the company ao but within the area of influence the town of wadi tarif is 96 sunni and 4 shia political and tribal elements in the company and battalion sector are as follows the asim tribe throughout the battalion sector the wahabbis fundamentalist sunni anticoalition sect in wadi tarif and foreign fighters in the vicinity of jabr nahr for official use only 2companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3there are three primary roads within the company sector jetertown road jetertown cutoff and fullerton road together they form triangle numerous trails generally running eastwest bisect these primary roads jarbr nahr and wadi tarif each have propane pumping facilities and there is bank and medical clinic in the village of wadi tarif the terrain in the area is generally flat with gentle slopes the foliage consisting of white pines is generally sparse with wideopen areas in the low ground and along the streams the underbrush becomes denser big brushy creek running primarily north to south bisects the company sector smaller intermittent streams running northeast to southwest are in the eastern half of the company sector step two of the ipb is to describe how the terrain affects threat and friendly forces step two always considers terrain and weather factors the acronym ocoka observation and fields of fire cover and concealment obstacles key terrain and avenues of approach is used to describe the effects of the terrain accordingly observation and fields of fire within and around the village of jabr nahr are limited to 75 to 100 meters which allows virtually 360 degree unobserved access to the village cover and concealment around the village of jabr nahr is excellent with dense trees surrounding the area the intermittent stream beds foliage and wood terrain benefit friendly and threat forces allowing unobserved movement into and out of the two villages existing obstacles in the area are big brushy creek and the intermittent streams reinforced by the dense foliage along their banks key terrain includes the primary road intersections lowwater crossing points the propane facilities and the bank the lowwater crossing points and road intersections allow both the threat and friendly forces to restrict movement either by friendly traffic control posts tcps or opposition use of ieds or rocketpropelled grenades rpgs the limited number of primary gravel roads in the companys area allows friendly forces to quickly consolidate and control the primary road network the limited number of roads also restricts the avenues of approach into the villages by the threat forces low ground on the west side of both jabr nahr and wadi tarif allows unobserved movement between the two villages additionally the water purification facility is within the companys area of influence protecting this facility and other utility stations allows the population to receive purified water strong psychological benefit to the coalition forces alternatively opposition forces see that damaging such facilities and limiting the populations water propane or electricity supplies undermines the coalition and benefits the insurgency step three of ipb is to evaluate the threat this step involves examining the threats disposition composition and capabilities within the companys area of responsibility aor there are small numbers of former regime elements fre and foreign fighters ff who are extremely dedicated to an antiuscoalition forces ideology the fre and ff personnel operating in the companys aor are organized into cell structure operating in cell structure makes it difficult to dismantle the entire organization at one time and allows individuals in the cells the greatest opportunity to blend into the surrounding areas of jabr nahr and wadi tarif these anticoalition cells were capable of employing small arms mortar fire and ieds to interdict and 3 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedharass coalition forces and to intimidate the local population the asim tribe can also influence the population within the area anticoalition forces could also use or threaten the use of violence toward the local population to ensure its cooperation the fourth step of ipb is to determine threat coas this is the step that company commanders fail to appreciate or fully understand they fail to give their subordinates viable task and purpose for their plan based on the intentions of the enemy to have platoon leaders execute combat or reconnaissance patrols for the sake of clearing routes or gathering int is unacceptable it is imperative that company commanders base their missions on the possible coas that the threat is capable of executing to arrive at that level of situational understanding commanders must grasp the conditions of the environment in which they are operating in addition commanders must understand that the coe or any operational environment is not top driven that is to say int data and analysis is not oneway flow from the brigade s2 to the battalion s2 to the company company commanders must allocate resources within the company to collect and analyze as best as possible in the example given in the introduction the company suffered an ied attack that destroyed hmmwv and killed two soldiers as stated later this was not the first ied attack unfortunately between the first and second attacks the commander failed to try and analyze the threats capability and the enemys most likely coa by examining the information in the above three steps one can deduce the threats more probable coa and then plan on how to best counter the oppositions actions this examination would have forced the company commander toward understanding that second ied attack after an initial successful attack under similar circumstances was likely focusing on the threats capability to use ieds against coalition forces situational understanding can be realized using the ipb reviewing step one shows that the asim tribe is potentially important political force in the village the infrastructure in the companys ao is very limited there are three gravel roads propane filling station in the village of jabr nahr and the water purification facility just outside the companys aor to the north see figure 11 for official use only 4companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3at first glance the company sector is relatively large roughly 20 square kilometers but further study under step 2the limited roads and intersectionshows the likely areas for ied placement are limited along the primary roads there are only six likely areas where ieds could be placed the first is the intersection of maddox and fullerton road the second area is the intersection of fullerton and carnis road the third is the intersection of fullerton and jetertown road the fourth is the intersection of jetertown cutoff and jetertown road at all three of these intersections vehicles must slow to near stop when turning the fifth area for the possible placement of an ied is just north of jabr nahr the road leading into the town from the north makes an s curve uphill approximately twohundred meters outside of the village the sixth location for possible ied is the lowwater crossing point indicated on the grid see figure 12 5 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned water purification station propane station gravel road 3 dirt track gravel road 1gravel road 2cemetery jabr nahr fob anvil wadi tarif figure 11to place these ieds at any of these locations the opposition must first reach the location more importantly they need to be able to return to their safe havens of jabr nahr or wadi tarif again outside of the companys aor but within its area of influence reviewing the key terrain information gathered in step 2 suggests that the opposition would most likely use the wooded low ground areas to the east and north east of jabr nahr as illustrated in the diagram these are the shortest covered and concealed routes from jabr nahr they are the likely areas for the placement of an ied and for travel between the villages of jabr nahr and wadi tarif see figure 13 for official use only 6companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3 cemetery jabr nahr fob anvil wadi tarified 1ied 2ied 3 ied 4ied 5 ied 6 figure 12highlighted information from step three shows that the opposition forces in jabr nahr consist of cell with three to five men possibly squad the cell is capable of employing ieds and rpgs as well as mortar fire to maintain the cells low signature the cells weapons cache is most likely located outside of the village but close enough to support hasty attack or opportunities the cell is either covertly or forcibly sustained by the local population see figure 14 7 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned cemetery jabr nahr fob anvil wadi tarif figure 13compiling the above illustrations gives the commander doctrinal template on how the opposition forces in jabr nahr may possibly operate based on this template one can arrive at most likely coa that the threat will use to place ieds to disrupt coalition efforts to avoid detection threat elements will most likely operate during limited period of visibility or they will take several days to place planned ied during this time threat elements would either manufacture the ied inside or outside the village if the material to manufacture the ied is located outside of the village the anticoalition forces will have to move to the location and either assemble the material there or at another location there are two likely areas for the threat to hide their material outside the village of jabr nahr and still keep it readily at hand the first is the cemetery that is located 150 meters to the northwest of the village and the other is the intermediate stream bed 100 meters to the west see figure 15 for official use only 8companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3 cemetery jabr nahr fob anvil wadi tariflikely area 2likely area 1 figure 14both locations are in areas that allow covered and concealed movement in and out of the village but also along routes identified in step two after placing the ieds the insurgent will have to be in position to overwatch the target area likely areas for the threat to overwatch the identified ied are as follows for area number 1 the wooded area to the west and northeast of the intersection for areas 2 and 3 the wooded area to the south of fullerton run which allows an individual to overwatch both intersections for the fourth fifth and sixth areas the route is wooded on both sides the woods limit the distance approximately 200 meter an individual can be from the intersection to effectively overwatch the ied having identified the enemys most likely coa the commander can now more effectively assign the assets that are available to him from the above the assigned mission could be tasked to the platoons in the company route clearance _______ platoon will clear routes maddox fullerton and jetertown by clearing named areas of interest nai 1 2 3 4 and 5

to assign only combatoriented missions as identified in step one the asim tribe was depicted as potentially influential element the commander nested with the battalions io plan can assign platoons specific individuals and then tailor the operations priority int requirements pir beyond specific individuals being targeted the company commander can also assign specific pir to the platoon to gather as they patrol through the village the above does not necessarily reflect threat tactics techniques and procedures ttp or actions but what it does is illustrated in that the ipb process is powerful tool that will allow company commanders to better utilize their limited assets in timeconstrained environment to borrow phrase commanders should analyze the mission versus conduct mission analysis by continually applying the four steps of the ipb process define the battlefield environment describe the battlefield effects evaluate the threat and determine threat coa commanders will better analyze

processing tactical information extract call handbook 0320 stability operations and support operations introduction stability operations and support operations are common entry point for conventional forces into the new world of asymmetric warfare in the contemporary operating environment coe americas adversaries are attempting to take our overwhelming conventional strengths and turn them into crippling weaknesses superior technology firepower and mobilitythose things that on the conventional battlefield give us amazing strengthbecome the targets of our enemies additionally our foes attempt to seize upon the presence of the media and the natural american concern for troop welfare by conducting attacks that impact domestic support actions to preserve our conventional strength protect our forces and facilitate the rapid transition from the defense to the offense must be taken in stability operations and support operations our units suffer from disadvantage in situational understanding the enemy has an immediate tactical understanding of the battlespace it is his home and he has spent years studying it the high signature ie obvious presence of our forces facilitates the enemys targeting effort in contrast his low signature enables him to conceal his location and movement and to gather int from sympathetic or unwitting members of his own culture so long as our units lack situational understanding mission accomplishment in stability operations and support operations will be difficult such ignorance may lead to mission failure situational understanding is gained through constant relentless and thorough process of educating every member of the unit about the battlespace in which he operates this education is gained through combination of tactical actions that spans the spectrum of operationsfrom civil affairs to security patrols to open combat the experiences and information gained through the execution of all these operations increases understanding of the battlespace the actions suggested in this section are intended to enable small unit leaders to better understand their battlespace b collecting tactical information tactical information facilitates tactical operations the battlespace is full of information much of it is useful and helps the unit to develop situational understanding but much of it is also useless noise and can overwhelm the unit leader to successfully develop situational understanding the unit leader must use methods that systematically screen out useless information and enable him to focus on pertinent data c vigilance in stability operations and support operations the soldiers primary tool is not his weapon but his mind and the ability to remain alert on and off duty the unit leader must take actions to increase his units vigilance suggested actions are the following make frequent visits to all static posts to observe soldiers actions and make onsite corrections to deficiencies in security procedures and alertness levels 11 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedquiz the soldiers about their assigned sectors ask them questions about houses vehicles and individuals within their sector soldiers who demonstrate familiarity with the routine of life within their sector are demonstrating vigilance ask the soldier about recent changes to the routine if different squads patrols or platoons are rotated through the sector ask the soldier what he was briefed about during the reliefinplace task patrols and observation posts ops with specific questions to answer during their patrols or watch shifts during debriefing the patrol or watch standers should provide answers to these questions care should be taken not to levy questions that are too general such as how were things in town today nor should single op or patrol be given too many questions to answer the following example is suggested collection task today you will be patrolling through the shaheed masoud neighborhood along mansour street note the buildings on all four corners of the intersection of mansour street and jalal street and provide details on their height and the number of street front windows and entrances over time as more of these questions are asked and answered the unit leader will be able to develop very detailed picture of the assigned sector in his headquarters or patrol base this information will aid in the planning and execution of operations within his sector d engaging the locals situational understanding is not developed by passively observing the activities within the sector an important part of the education is getting to know the local populace in detail professional interaction with the populace not only helps to communicate the purpose for being there and to gain support but also to provide information to achieve mission objectives significant efforts should be made by leaders at all levels to make contact with the local populace regular meetings between company commanders and local neighborhood or village leaders should be held keep in mind that even less than supportive local can provide useful information variety of sources can confirm the veracity of information collected the use of linguists andor trained interrogators based on availability of resources and coordination of armyjoint assets is highly encouraged but the use of phrase cards or electronic language translation devices is also beneficial for interaction on patrols or at ops and checkpoints care must be taken to ensure that the interaction is culturally appropriate for example it is unacceptable in some cultures for males to address females who are not related to them in any event the local populace can be significant asset if relationship can be established tactical interrogation civilians and captured enemy combatants hold wealth of information that is useful to the small unit leader due to the rapid tempo of operations however the usefulness of this information is highly perishable and fleeting tactical interrogation of these individuals allows the unit leader to glean those pieces of information that can be critical to success trained interrogators are lowdensity asset that may not be available for support to the tactical commander the small unit leader should review the records of his personnel to identify individuals who have proficiency in foreign languages and have them tested to determine their true capability larger commands may offer survivallevel language training leaders should take advantage of these opportunities and request missionoriented language training that will enable his unit to collect basic facts related to his mission for official use only 12companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3f recording information soldier can remember everything that happens on daily basis much less weekly or monthly to capture important information the unit must have record of what has occurred in the area of responsibility aor patrol logs each patrol leader should maintain written record of events during his patrol this record should include any noticed changes to the environment in the sector patrolled when this information was reported to higher headquarters the tactical operations center toc or the patrol base and any information gathered from locals during the patrol if patrol log is too difficult to write during patrol then the patrol leader can use voice recorder the use of small video devices may also be helpful in recording information depending on the situation many current video cameras come with builtin screen that is sufficient for reviewing the video clips many also have still photograph mode the video and still photography are useful tools during reliefinplace for bringing the relieving unit up to date on activities in the assigned sector company platoon or patrol base logs the maintenance of journals is standard procedure in battalion tocs smaller units such as squads or platoons should also keep logs of all events that occur in their sectors if company or platoon has ops or patrols running from central headquarters then both the ops and patrols should have logs as well as the headquarters these headquarters logs should contain record of all transmissions from ops or patrols in the sector as well as information regarding the situation passed down from higher headquarters or from adjacent units when the headquarters logs and patrolop logs are set side by side they should provide clear picture of significant events that take place in certain sector over period of time g analyzing information recording events is not sufficient to give the unit leader solid understanding of what is occurring around him the information must be analyzed to identify any trends that stand out by doing this analysis the leader will accomplish two important tasks 1he will educate himself and his soldiers over time on the characteristics of his sector learning the rhythm of the community if any and get to know the locals who live in that area and 2 due to this increased understanding he will then be able to notice unusual patterns that may be indicators of activity such as surveillance smuggling or guerrilla attack operational debriefing the unit leader must see to it that thorough debriefing of all patrols ops and tactical actions is conducted this debriefing is more than an afteraction review aar good debriefs include not only review of friendly actions and recommendations for improved tactics techniques and procedures ttp but also review of the information collected on the sector itself debriefings are thought to be difficult and timeintensive this assessment may be true in the early stages of operations in the assigned sector as the soldiers become familiar with the area however much of the information on the terrain and people will be briefed only by exception the unit leader conducts the debriefing for the benefit of his unit but he may find it helpful to request or invite representative from the battalion s2 to attend or perhaps even assist higher headquarters may bring with them information that gives better context to events occurring with the company or platoons sector debriefs should occur immediately after the patrol is completed or the watch is rotated 13 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedidentifying patterns once the information is recorded by the leaders and debriefed regularly the next task is to identify patterns in the sector the pattern of events in all societies is generally cyclical days weeks months and years bring with them specific events that take place at regular intervals leader and soldier alike must learn these patterns knowing these patterns will be key to both operational planning when is the best time to conduct cordon and search operation in my sector and surveillance detection why is this new car parked across from our compound everyday at 0800 all of the sudden the following are two suggested tools to track patterns calendars an excellent way to track these patterns is to use blank daily and weekly calendar in the beginning of operations in an assigned sector each platoon commander patrol leader and op should keep calendar with the events of the local area that are observed after the first couple of weeks these can be consolidated into single unit calendar to be kept in the companyplatoon headquarters or patrol base higher headquarters can provide information on exceptional events such as holidays and important anniversaries when demonstrations or riots are likely to occur leaders can consult this calendar when planning patrols or other operations radial daily activity chart this chart consists of radial graph divided into 24 sectionsone for each hour of the day this tool is used to track the daily events in the sector such as rush hour daily religious observances and dry goods delivery the following figure shows an example of simple radial graph for plotting and tracking hourly activities over the course of week for official use only 14companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3h using information building situational understanding is not an end in itself the purpose of collecting and analyzing tactical information is to enable the small unit leader to act decisively and effectively there are two classes of information actionable information and background information actionable information requires some action on the unit leaders part this action can range from dispatching patrol to gather more information to conducting raid on suspected weapons cache to merely passing news on an event in the sector to higher headquarters background information does not require any action but is useful for understanding the surroundings in depth an example of background information is sketch of neighborhood layout with the name of each family written on each house or list of vehicles commonly seen in the sector this information may be important in the future but requires specific action by the unit leader i indicators of surveillance activity reconnaissance is part of any sophisticated military activity this generalization applies to terrorists and guerrillas as well the enemy conducts surveillance and reconnaissance to select the target he will attack and to gather detailed information on the selected target to increase the likelihood of success thankfully the enemy is vulnerable to observation by friendly units when he does this in fact these instances of enemy surveillance will likely be the only opportunities during stability operations and support operations to go on the offensive against the enemy when terrorist or guerrilla strikes friendly units are required to react to the attack reaction is an inherently defensive activity it is normally said that defeat can be prevented by the defense and the offense is the only way to victory in asymmetric warfare even successful defense cannot stave off defeat the enemy by the sheer audacity and violence of his attempt may impact political and popular support for the mission therefore the small unit leader has strategic responsibility in the asymmetric fight to 15 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned this radial graph can be used to track hourly events over the course of week and will indicate patterns of activity over time each concentric ring represents one day of the week the hour of the day is indicated by the numbers around the outside of the graph events can be given color or alphanumeric code using this system the chart can be crossreferenced with journal or log figure 21attempt to identify surveillance activity all indicators of surveillance activity represent actionable information it must be passed along to higher headquarters and may even require countersurveillance measures in order to spoil or disrupt the enemys ability to collect target information it can be difficult to spot surveillance activity in the urban environment this is why detailed situational understanding is so critical the better educated all members of the unit are in the characteristics of the sector the better able they will be to notice activity that is out of the ordinary and perhaps an indicator of surveillance surveillance is often detected only after collecting the information from multiple observers in the unit and comparing reports in thorough debriefing sessions some common indicators of surveillance activity are the following the repeated presence of new persons or vehicles in the sector particularly around times of regularly scheduled friendly activities such as supply deliveries reports from the locals of persons from outside the sectorneighborhood asking questions regarding friendly units spontaneous confrontations with patrols or at checkpointsguerrillasterrorists often conduct dryruns on friendly units to determine reaction times and procedures the accidental presence of host nation workers in restricted areas of friendly compoundpersonnel may use excuses such as i got lost while going to the bathroom

group optag with special acknowledgment to cpt thomas harper british liaison officer lno jrtc operations group the planning and conduct of counterinsurgency coin operations at brigade battalion and company level ground 1 the operational environment is characterized by number of factors such as the ground eg urban rural urbanrural interface b the threat eg enemy aims capabilities support of population c the political situation eg stable fluid transitional democracy d the economic and social situation eg full employment good wages decent standard of living or poor conditions that provide fertile ground for recruitment of activists particularly important in this is meeting the expectations of the iraqi any disappointment or broken promise will be seen as failure of the coalition and promote discontent the security environment what about criminal investigations eg active effective and respected civilian police force functioning basic law judiciary and penal system all these factors contribute to the operational environment in which troops operate and influence operations s2int 2 thorough cultural understanding of the environment is major combat multiplier that makes soldiers all the more lethal on the front lines in the war on terrorism every encounter with an iraqi civilian is an opportunity to develop respect and trust in coalition forces as professional educated soldiers who are committed to finishing the job they set out to accomplish ignorance and intolerance deepens the divide between the coalition forces and the free iraqi people the war on terrorism will be won by the squad leader on the ground it is the foot patrols interacting with the iraqi people who will provide the raw information and will be the public face of the coalition information must be processed into int at the lowest level ideally this means the company co level but at the very least it should be processed at the battalion bn level thorough knowledge of all activity in the area of responsibility aor is essential and the latest int picture should be briefed to the lowest level possible if the most junior private patrolling the streets does not understand the local int picture then he will not know what to look out for which is waste of valuable asset 17 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedthe threat 3 the military are given missions plans are made and executed to fulfill those missions on completion there will be postoperation review the terrorist is different in this regard after deciding what it is he wants to achieve the terrorist will set about his task in the same manner int gathering will begin which will allow the terrorist to decide which type of attack best suits his needs there are host of options available to him on completion of each of his attacks he will conduct his afteraction review aar he will look at your reaction and procedures as well as his own he is looking for areas he can exploit the easiest thing for the terrorist to exploit is routine and set patterns if you do the same thing at the same time everyday or even every week then you are vulnerable to some form of attack 4what options of attack are open to the terrorist these are the categories as specified from united states army s2 there are huge number of weapons and munitions stock piles in iraq therefore everything the terrorist needs is readily available in abundance agrenades military or improvised used conventionally or in the form of booby trap bmortars predominantly military munitions not always military tubes they are normally used to attack static locations mortars can be fired remotely by either command or on longdelay timer crocket propelled grenade rpg rpgs are used in the direct fire role they are very effective against softskinned vehicles they have been used as protection by bombing teams with the likely use of firing into the remains of convoy that had just been attacked drockets 122mm rockets are easily obtained they have been used to attack buildings again being fired remotely they could also be used in direct fire role esmall arms attacks these comprise snipes driveby shootings closequarters assassination cqa and group attacks following improvised explosive device ied attacks fimprovised explosive devices the ied allows the enemy to use limited resources to maximum effect he can use conventional munitions to construct some sophisticated devices it should be pointed out that iraq had very sophisticated statesponsored ied manufacturing programa bombmaking school in effect as the supply of conventional weapons dwindles the enemy will increasingly look toward adopting commerciallyavailable products as bombmaking components the ied can be tailormade specific to the type of attack target and location the categories that ieds fall into are the following time command for official use only 18companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3victimoperated an ied can be hand held or can fill cement mixer ieds can vary in complexity from stick of dynamite with burning fuse to device that incorporates antihandling measures such as collapsing circuit that is initiated by an encoded firing signal they can be used singly or in larger numbers single ied can be used to draw forces into an area making them vulnerable to further attack it has proven to be the weapon of choice for terrorists insurgents and enemies of the peace worldwide all soldiers expecting to work in an environment where the ied is threat must be aware of what they are what components the enemy uses where they are likely to be found and how the devices are employed in an attack deploying conventional battlefield clearance personnel such as scouts or assault engineers should be avoided the terrorist will monitor the actions of those who render device safe he will amend his modus operandi mo to target that render safe procedure indeed this has already happened on numerous occasions if unit commanders insist on using underqualified personnel they must acknowledge the risks by the same token soldiers should not take it upon themselves to have go preservation of evidence 5 the ground forces will evolve and adapt their procedures to counter the terrorist similarly the terrorist will be doing the same thing to ensure continued success key part of the battle to defeat the terrorist is the exploitation of forensic evidence left at the scene of an incident this analysis will enable the relevantly qualified personnel to determine the level of technology and sophistication of the terrorist this determination will in turn provide guidance as to how to counter that particular threat thus it is imperative that incident scenes are attended only by the minimum of qualified personnel int 6 the key to successful operations at brigade bde level is in gaining and exploiting quality int while bdes will often be the recipients of int from other sources there is great deal that can be done to generate int at bde level the principal ways of achieving this are the following aconstruction and implementation of bde int collection plan icp this plan includes the commands priority int requirements pir this plan is issued to all units who use it as their collection tool reports are sent back daily or weekly for analysis at bde level and an int picture is built up that can ideally result in welltargeted intled operations buse of bn and colevel int cells the use of int cells creates focus for the icp at these two levels and also permits some additional capability for the unit to conduct its own information collection on local patterns of life key individuals mapping etc at the very least each co should have noncommissioned officer nco who is the int focus 19 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedcpatrol briefing and debriefing all framework patrols must have task and purpose and be formally briefed by the co int cell before deployment and debriefed on their return in order to gain the maximum amount of information each individual on the patrol has an informationgathering function in addition to his role as rifleman in counterinsurgency operations the main intgathering tools are the eyes and ears of troops on the ground conducting foot patrols dsector observation teams sot sots are iraqi nationals who work for the coalition forces and are used to get feel for the mood of local community they are deployed into an area to sound out local views and concerns sots are very useful but always treat their information with degree of skepticism ehuman int humint humint teams are working in most areas and are normally controlled at bde level sometimes money is paid for information but always after that information has been confirmed again treat information sourced in this way with caution bdes and higher formations have responsibility to disseminate information downwards in fashion that allows the private soldier to act as an information gatherer for example if the threat is from radio controlled ieds rcieds then the soldier needs to know what the component parts look like by using posters with photographs this information should be well circulated it will help allow soldiers to identify suspicious objects during house car or personnel searches system called erica the eye involves publishing such information on posters in wellused locationson the back of latrine doors and in our equivalent of the chowqueue it works overclassification of such material can be counterproductive responsibility for an aor 7 units should be made responsible for all intgathering in an aor and every unit operating within that area should always coordinate with aor tactical operations center toc this method is the only way to coordinate effort for both gathering int and coordination of operations outside units working in the aor must be briefed and debriefed on int as well as the posture being adopted and the commanders intent in the area if the unit in the aor is trying to win the hearts and minds of village by soft approach lot of hard work can be ruined very quickly by an outside unit adopting hard aggressive approach in the same area number 8 covert forces is of particular note 8covert forces if covert forces are working in the aor then an out of bounds oob box should be imposed and other units should go into this area this is the only way to avoid blueonblue incidents or disruption of covert activity the activity within the oob area will be on strict needtoknow basis the temptation to have too many oob areas should be avoided culture 9hearts and minds understanding the iraqi frame of mind for official use only 20companylevel stability operations and support

by arabs who may not necessarily see unifying link between events what they perceive to be the situation is most important not the reality which they may not accept bdeep belief in god arabs usually believe that many if not all things in life are controlled by the will of god fate rather than by human beings what might appear as fatalism at first is more deeply belief in gods power sovereignty active participation in the life of the believer and authority over all things business transactions relationships world events etc true muslims will respect christians as fellow believers as many parts of the old testament are common with the koran cwish versus reality arabs much more so than westerners express emotion in forceful animated and exaggerated fashion their desire for modernity is contradicted by desire for tradition especially islamic tradition since islam is the one area free of western identification and influence dimportance of justice and equality arabs value justice and equality more than anything else it is imperative that coalition forces act within the rule of law those who transgress must be dealt with and the population must know that they have been punished eparanoia arabs may seem to be paranoid by western standards they are suspicious of us intent in their land and have cautious approach to american forces some arabs view all westerners as agents of

exchange pleasantries do not expect instant answers and take time to converse with them hwomen male soldiers should not talk to women except through an iraqi male searching of arab women must only be carried out by female soldiers holding conversation with an arab woman could place her in danger it could well be seen by her family that she has brought dishonor onto them icivil affairs ca

order for clear intent to be implemented by every unit on the ground units working in an area for short time should be briefed in detail on int aspects of the aor and the ongoing operations in the area units must be debriefed regularly so that they can all contribute to the int picture 13coordination of overtcovert ops the aim of such coordination is not to reveal the activities locations or mo of the covert forces to wider audience but to ensure that there is synergy of effort between the two for example covert operations may rely on working unmolested within particular area in order to achieve this an oob box may be placed over the area of their operation restricting access by normal overt green troops for their part these green troops can contribute to the operation by either conducting normal patrolling in the surrounding area to give the impression of normality or provide quick reaction forces qrfs for the covert forces the role of bde in this is one of coordination and

operations 15reserves in line with all conventional operations commander should maintain reserve the uk experience in northern ireland and elsewhere confirms that effect can best be achieved through the use of uncommitted reserves on unpredictable and often shortnotice operations the size of reserve will depend on the size of the bct and the ao typically one to three companies bn and co conduct of operations 16 at bn and co level coin operations can be broken down into two types aframework operations these provide the basic structure for operations in tactical area of responsibility taor whether it is bn or co and usually consist of the following tasks 1 patrols 2 qrf 3 guard 4 rest often combined with guard or qrf duties bsurge operations surge operations are superimposed on framework operations with the aim of concentrating force in certain areas for certain times to achieve particular effect they form the 2nd echelon of operations surge operations are normally conducted at co level by troops uncommitted to groundholding tasks and who have greater flexibility of movement and employment thus in fourco bn three companies might have groundholding role and be responsible for particular area of operation ao while the fourth co is the cos maneuver asset such assets should be used in addition to but linked in with framework operations examples of such operations might be

routine framework operations these operations should be mounted using good int and under conditions of excellent security they are designed to maximize effect in as short time as possible they must be coordinated with neighboring units to ensure deconfliction reaction to incidents 17 it is important to have standing operating procedures sops for reacting to incidents in this way all personnel will know their part in the process and time and possibly lives will be saved these sops do not and must not hinder mission command or initiative indeed they should complement it 18 there are 3 phases involved in reacting to an incident acontact phase aim is to kill or capture the terrorist during this phase which lasts until the immediate contact is over in our experience this is up to three minutes but can be longer bimmediate followup aim is to capture the terrorist during this phase which lasts typically fro m33 0 minutes cconsidered followup aim is to preserve evidence during this phase which lasts 30 minutes 19 the toc must support the platoon on the ground the following should be considered the platoon commander sends an initial contact report during the contact phase the toc acknowledges contact and deploys qrf to suitable location close to the contact point but not too close to interfere with the contact platoon the bn commander cdrexecutive officer xo is informed for official use only 24companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3b the qrf should move in once the contact platoon commander has passed rendezvous rv this may happen during either the immediate or considered followup phases depending on the situation the platoon leader is still in command of the overall situation at this point c contact platoon commander or the nominated individual possibly the qrf commander seizes control of incident and becomes the incident commander at this point he is planning the considered followup to the incident we use the following drill pauseplotplanissue d incident commander issues detailed contact report and commences the 4 cs confirm clear cordon and control agencies deploy to deal with incident medics police bomb disposal etc 20 many of the above can be happening concurrently and it is the speed of thought and action in the toc that will determine how smoothly an operation is mounted it is recommended that the duty battle captain has tactical aide memoir with recommended followup actions for different incidents these are not doctrinal documents they are check lists and for best effect should be produced at unit level 21 speed is not however always your friend and you might be being lured into secondary attack take time to study maps that chart recent incidents incident control points routes to and from them etc and do not always rush things the priority must be to save life 22 it is important to evaluate exactly how an incident occurred where it occurred and whom the likely perpetrators were in order to take any action to prevent it from happening again unless correctly qualified specialists such as eod forensics and int agencies are given the opportunity to investigate incidents postincident analysis will not be adequately conducted the enemy will set patterns bombmakers have favorite devices snipers have preferred targets with little lowlevel analysis and the use of specialist agencies you can identify these patterns and take measures to combat them communications 23 the success of operations in the urban environment against wellequipped and unpredictable enemy relies on many factors none is more important than communication and in two ways atechnical communications to enable patrols to deploy themselves to permit depth mutual support allround defense and unpredictability they must be able to speak to each other within the patrol only in this way will you achieve parallel patrolling crossing of the primary route and the ability to move ahead and fall back equally communications must exist between patrols static bases where the toc is located urban operations uo where they exist and helicopters these are all valuable assets but they can only be fully utilized on an allinformed net one radio per patrol is not enough 25 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedbinformation communication information gained on patrol or from analysis of incidents has to be shared in this way otherseven in different bn or bctcan learn from the experiences of others photographs say more than words ever can and so pictorial examples of ieds component parts of devices firing positions etc are invaluable this information is best disseminated in freely available format such as posters leaflets and briefing packs probably the most important people to receive this information will be the soldiers who are patrolling and guarding on daily basis and who need to know the uptodate threat and enemy capabilities in order to counter them again the establishment of companylevel int focus is highly recommended the ethos of passing on as much int as possible is to be encouraged general metz during exercise freedom resolve said the rule is to decide if you need to hold anything back rather than to decide what you are going to give out deception measures 24 using deception can unsettle the enemy and heighten coalition troops security most terrorists less suicidal ones will only engage if they know they can survive and escape deception produces doubt in his mind and will act as significant deterrent there are many examples possible but just some include move days when there is roadair movement thus depriving the enemy of targets these periods can of course be varied within certain days eg flying between 09001200 and 15001800 b discreetly leaving staybehind parties on the ground to observe activity once troops have seemingly left the area the trick here is to conceal the exact number of troops who deploy as the enemy will count you out and count you back c use dogs even if they are not specially trained on patrol in the ammunition explosive search role take other unusuallooking pieces of equipment that might otherwise do nothing as this will plant seed of doubt in the enemy mind d deploy several patrols for very short periods into the area around the base in short time frame this tactic might put off planned attacks vary routes to and from routine tasks when route doubleback stop for short periods return to base unexpectedly etc f deploy both foot and vehicle patrols at the same time and then recover the vehicle patrol immediatelythey provide cover and firepower for the foot patrol deploying g deploy teams from different exits in the camp and have prearranged rv for them to link up and continue the patrol gives the impression of more troops on the ground at any time h vary the speed with which the patrol carries out its task the odd sprint forward doubling back or lying up for period will confuse the opposition we call it varying profile from hard to soft for official use only 26companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3the variation in deception is as endless as your imagination the golden rule in deception is twofold firstly plan it carefully and explain it to your own men and secondly ensure that it is credible it is the enemy you are trying to deceive not yourselves consideration of low level drills and skills 25points to consider cycle of duties patrols guard qrf rest should permit variety to keep soldiers alert interested and allow time for rest the british army might adopt nineday cycle at co level with each platoon performing each task for three days at stretch b each task should include roster between duties to allow soldiers restvariety within tasks for example guard duties can be split between lookout main gate guard perimeter patrols rest etc usually spending more than two hours on each 26why patrol it is important to consider the reason for each activity patrols might be conducted for one or combination of the following purposes to dominate ground b to gain information int c to speak to the locals and gain their trust d to deter the enemy from mounting attacks to interdict and attrit the enemy f to reassure the civilian population of their security g to support other operations eg mobile support to static guard points banks etc or larger preplanned operations such as largescale searches or arrest operations this list is not exhaustive as already mentioned all patrols must have task purpose if not question why they are being sent out the patrol may be unnecessary assigning patrols purpose gives soldiers the feeling that they are being put in harms way for legitimate reason if patrols have task then soldiers will feel that they have contributed in some small way towards improving the security situation this contribution may only be something minor like accumulating data on car registration plates or speaking to some locals but it is as important for morale as well as the tactical effect tasking patrols will greatly help you in maintaining the morale component of fighting power over your long deployment and is factor which should not be underestimated focused soldier is better one and key factor in your success will be leadership and requiring commanders at all levels to be inspirational in preventing staleness and lax drills 27planning patrols must be thoroughly planned taking into account threat b duration of patrol 27 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedc time of day will patrol

planning patrol account must be taken of all recent events in the area these might include arecent military or civilian police patrols traces of previous patrol routes must be retained for examination choke points and commonlyused streetsjunctions that might be vulnerable points vps must be identified in addition to recent incidents brecent incidents do they show signs of clustering cpredictability do patrols generally leave and return at the same time daily are they using the same routes are they the same size think variety and unpredictability sow the seed of doubt in the enemys mind the patrol brief will cover the essentials of the patrol such as route which should also be displayed on the toc map composition timings tasks deploymentrecovery actions on etc this briefing will ensure that all those on patrol are wellinformed on what they are to do and what they might expect this is where the co int nco plays critical role 30patrol action aprinciples these principles are largely at the discretion of the commander but in pure military terms the principles to ensure are for official use only 28companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 31 depth 2 allround defense 3 mutual support 4 unpredictabilitydeception 5 communications both within the patrol to any supporting troops eg rooftop operations aviation assets and to the base toc bpatrolling the lynchpins of coalition forces countermeasures are good int and domination of the ground primarily by the soldier patrolling on foot in rural areas there is also need to keep rural routes free for operational and administrative traffic vehicle and foot patrols have been subjected to increasingly more sophisticated forms of ambush including extensive use of the lure or comeon technique we have countered these tactics by constant vigilance suspicion of even the most apparently innocent objects and the avoidance of predictable pattern of activity in order to maintain the correct balance of weaponry specialist equipment flexibility and command and control the concept of multiple team patrolling has been developed patrolling should be based on two or more squads working together this method remains the most efficient way of maintaining presence on the ground without tying ourselves to static defensive positions fortress mentality while allowing movement initiative and determination and ability to succeed to flourish maneuver approach the patrol with supporting squads can be selfsufficient in terms of security adhere to all the principles and retain the ability to conduct variety of task types ideally patrols should consist of two or more squadsteams working together in synchronization squad composition depends of the task purpose and can vary from four to nine depending on this task one squad is the primary patrol with given task purpose and the other squads satellite around it thereby creating greater depth allround defense and unpredictability than the standard patrol deploying in linear fashion c it would be impossible to cover all the possible actions on patrol in this short document but few might be useful they are 1 the primary squad follows the route as briefed with the other squads supporting it all squads can conduct tasks such as tcps and chatups with the public as long as they maintain their situational awareness continue to provide mutual support to each other and carry out the primary task purpose they can cross the primary route to create deception and unpredictability this requires thorough knowledge of the aor including shortcuts and good communications both between squads and individuals within the squads 2 use mix of mobile and foot patrols to both increase unpredictability and the speed of response to incidents this mixture requires very thorough briefing and good communications vehicles can be used to drop teamssquads off and these then return to base on foot 3 establish the occasional rooftop observation post op that dominates the ground you are covering both with view and fire good communications between the op and the ground troops are essential 29 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned4 allow the ips and icdc to interact with the public as it is their credibility as well as ours that is important if they are ever to be established as credible police force push them to the forefront 5 all soldiers must be aware of their own fire positions there is time for the platoon leader to move around advising every man all the time tailend charlies should be in the habit of looking backwards as well as forwards and sideways look upwards too in urban areas and scan the rooftops 6 dismount from vehicles at vulnerable points choke points when the vehicle is likely to be static for some time traffic lights traffic jam etc walk vehicles through such locations when used frequently 7 five and 20meter m checks any patrol halting for more than 15 minutes must consider itself vulnerable to snap attack it will have lost the security provided by the fire and maneuver system of pepperpotting or of satellite teams moving along patrol route from task to task all halts must involve individual soldiers conducting 5m checks and teams conducting 20m checks indeed individuals halted for more than couple of minutes should extend the checked area out to 20m these are potentially lifesaving and should be conducted in both urban and rural environments 8 minor aggravation patrols should aim to defuse any situation to prevent it building into riot situation minor aggravation can often be used to lure troops into an area of the enemys choosing for an attack troops should aim to defuse the situation either by negotiation or by backing off and returning to the area later if the patrol has option but to stand its ground then the qrf should be deployed to position close by but unseen the patrol commander must be aware that the deployment of the qrf to his location could further escalate the situation 31patrol debrief at the conclusion of the patrol all members should attend central debrief when they can contribute to short report written by the commander each soldier should be asked for any information gathered during the patrol and this should be included in standard patrol report form these should be kept as reference material for future patrol planning and must include an acetate sheet indicating the route taken by the patrol known as an honesty trace 32base security the guard platoon or other nominated force will be responsible for base security during its scheduled guard period few tips for base security might be the guard should consist of guard commander second in charge 2ic and an adequate amount of soldiers to fulfill 24 hour duty the guard should be accommodated together for the duration of their duty b the guard should have their orders read out to them by the commander and also be rehearsed on their reaction to incidents which may occur during their duty c rotate soldiers between front gate lookouts prowler duty and standby regularly keep their time on duty to practical minimum keep them fresh and alert ensure each soldier is posted on duty by the guard 2ic and is briefed of his duty accordingly for official use only 30companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3d ensure that there is sufficient standoff at the front gate to deter or minimize the threat from car bombs or suicide bomb attack the gate should be strong and ideally the base perimeter will have cover from view so that activity within is not observed from outside lookout towers should allow sentry visibility of the perimeter the use of sentries in towers can be supplemented by the use of mastmounted video cameras sentries must have communication with the base toc and should be afforded protection from small arms fire where possible watch towers should be equipped with weapons vision aids day and night and panorama photos of the camp surrounds for ease of reference these photos should also be displayed in the toc and qrf room they must have communications with the toc f the guard platoon can carry out what we term ground defensive area patrols on frequent yet irregular basis this ensures that the area immediately surrounding the camp is covered on foot and suspicious activity checked potential attack sites such as mortar base plate positions in dead ground can be checked too g dead ground study for each base will assist in planning the general disturbance area gda patrols the co commander must take personal interest in the security of the base this is his forward mounting base and in common with other principles of war it must be secure 33qrf the concept of qrf in response to incidents is very simple and needs further explanation except to highlight that there are areas where the best form of transport for the qrf is in helicopter rather than in vehicles few points that might help qrf is usually on immediate standby this is tiring job in full kit for hours on end break up the monotony by allowing them to conduct gda patrols while still able to react to incidents and rotate them every day b vehicles should be fully loaded and ready to go qrf commander should be in the toc where he is able to be briefed the moment something happens and then deploy quickly with good idea of the plan to be followed by being in the toc the commander will have good situational awareness for what else is happening in the ao c switchedon wellbriefed qrf commander may be able to anticipate the enemy escape route and rather than make his way to the scene of the incident make for the getaway car and interdict the enemy d qrf deployment will be monitored and they themselves may become target vary routes where possible as the most direct may be the most obvious and thus more dangerous deconflict deployment of qrfs with neighboring call signs there is nothing worse than everyone arriving at the same incident needlessly f good communications both with the toc and the troops on the ground are essential 31 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedsearch 34aim the aim of search is to gain int deny terrorist resources protect potential targets and gain evidence for prosecution search can be defined as the application of systematic procedures and appropriate detection equipment to locate specified targets 35levels of search there is pyramid of search capability the higher up the pyramid the more specialized the troops and the higher the capability and assurance of search the diagram

is conducted when detailed check of route is required using metal and cable detectors it is slow and laborintensive process but it is one of the only ways of giving high level of assurance in the safety of route it is also one of the most dangerous search operations route check is carried out by three teams two teams move along the flank removing any command wire threat this is carried out by the use of wire detectors the remaining team moves behind the flank team approx 100 m checking the main route which is now free of any command wires ehouse checksearch this search forms the basis for all forms of building search it must be borne in mind that an iraqi has the right to defend his house with force house check that is poorly conducted causing lot of damage can cause the owner his family and the wider community to turn against the coalition however house check carried out professionally and leaving damage can help to portray the coalition in favorable light consideration should be given to sending ca team to the house after it has been checked the patrol search record is key part of the house check 38patrol search record patrol search record is used when any type of search is carried out it gives the owner written record of the search who conducted it and what damage may have been caused this report is signed by the owner and is also receipt for any documentation that has been removed two copies of the document are produced one copy is handed in to the toc and the other copy is given to the person who has been searched this gives the proud iraqi feeling of worth and responsibility it will also prevent him making false claims against the coalition for damage the patrol search record is useful document which gives degree legality to your actions 39equipment

faulty brakes using lethal force to stop it may be highly counterproductive bcross boundary cooperation and operations as stated earlier boundaries provide useful control between aors but can also create nogo zones that the enemy can exploit neighboring units should develop sops for crossboundary operations where such exploitation might occur the use of ops boxes that straddle these boundaries and in which patrols from both units can operate with prior agreement should be considered cmovement of military vehicles military vehicles are an obvious target and their movement into within and out of aors must be controlled consideration might be given to establishing restricted movements times during the day even to the extent of having complete move by road days planned in advance there should be effect on operations or on logistic support the use of civilian vehicles should also be given thought especially for logistic runs to collect rations etc consider establishing bde movement control movcon cell dconvoy movement convoys of vehicles should be treated as separate operation they present tempting and highprofile targets especially if they are routine eg tofrom logistic bases for resupply and are obliged to follow the same route regularly steps can be taken to reduce their frequency see above but when they do become necessary they should be preceded by route checks to look for roadside ieds provided with mobile escorts and helicopter top cover that is in communication with the ground troops physical picketing of the routeespecially at vulnerable points vps where vehicles commonly either slow down or bunch together junctions sharp bends bridgesmay be necessary eaviation the use of aviation assets adds 3rd dimension to the coin battlespace helicopters providing aerial surveillance are an excellent force multiplier keeping the terrorist guessing and making him unsure when he can and cannot be seen aviation assets providing realtime commentary or live ground linked video is very good way of keeping track of riot situation the ring leaders in riot can be spotted and photographed more easily from the air and coalition forces can be guided to the right place accordingly aviation can also be used for deploying patrols and for midpatrol moves in highthreat areas helicopters can be deployed in pairs or in threes one to conduct the task and another one or two to provide overwatch for the first the overwatch helicopters are able to react quickly to any potential attack on the primary helicopter like any other asset entering an ao pilots must receive full

must only be taken with the approval of the ao commander due to their significant impact potential fpatrol search search is one of the ways in which the ordinary infantry soldier or any soldier operating in the infantry role can make difference he can find weapons and other munitions in vehicles on people and in buildings the act of searching people and vehicles in public is itself deterrent in addition to using search as fundamental part of normal patrols consideration might be given to bnlevel search operations as part of surge op once search has been conducted patrol search report should be completed gsecondary weapons many soldiers carry two weapons when on patrol this redundancy creates problem when encountering crowd disturbance as usually only one weapon can be secured by an individual this gives scope for the unsecured weapon normally the pistol to be stolen and used against the security forces one weapon only should be carried all those on patrol should carry rifle as this prevents individuals being singled out as special by carrying only sidearmbe anonymous top tips 41 to finish off with few top tips in particular order anames on windshields all hmmwvs have the names and rank of the driver and passenger on the windshield is this necessary already suspects have been detained in baghdad in possession of list of names from one unit taken from observing vehicles with names on them this is presenting an unnecessary risk and providing the enemy with valuable target information at least ranks should be removed bweapons do they need to be loaded with one up the spout at all times this may seem sound military practice but the act of cocking the weapon is in itself an escalatory act and can be used either to defuse potentially difficult crowd problems or persuade potential assailant to put down his weapon it also reduces the chances of negligent discharges ctop cover sentries they could be equipped with sa so that they can cover 360degree arcs from their position on top of the vehicle this is not always possible with largecaliber crewserved weapon dcheesecutters top cover sentries are very vulnerable to wires stretched across roads at head height these are potentially fatal traps welding 6foot engineer picket onto the side of the vehicle in line with the windshield that extends above head height will hugely decrease the risk ecomeon be aware of the threat from the terrorist comeon ie ruse designed to draw coalition forces into killing area of their choosing this ruse may take the form of civilians asking for medical help from soldier to draw him away from the patrol isolate and then execute him or the comeon may take the form of an attack on patrol to draw them towards the firing point and then secondary iedbooby trap

vehicles should maintain tactical spacing between them to decrease the risk of more than one manvehicle being involved in an incident and allow greater freedom of action should an incident occur vehicles should always leave distance between them not bumpertobumper and the vehicles in front if static for example at busy road junction this allows room for maneuver should someone approach the vehicle to attempt cqa or to dispatch grenade through the window always have windows up and doors closed when in busy urban areas gdepthmutual support foot and vehicle patrols should always generate integral mutual support and depth by varying the route of at least one of the three teamssquadsvehicles satelliting moving ahead and holding back this all confuses the enemy and helps deter attacks remember in general terms the enemy wants to attack and then escape and he will not put himself in harms way if he is not sure of his escape hrelating to the locals do not forget that not all iraqis are the enemy in fact if only 2 out of population of 25 million were that would still be gross overestimation treat them with respect interact with them remove your sunglasses shake their hand and make contact to prove that you are human like them when you search them do not humiliate them there is time to be hard and time to be softer as we learned the hard way in northern ireland if you build up relationship with them then they are more likely to respect you and help you defeat the enemy consider the profile you are presenting by removing sunglasses balaclavas and not pointing weapons at ordinary individuals you are presenting lessaggressive image which might be more appropriate in most circumstances iabsence of the normal and the presence of the abnormal is that normally busy market strangely quiet today why is there large white panel up against the wall at that point in the road where you always slow down are there fewer children on the street than usual all these potential combat indicators should arouse your suspicion and heighten your awareness jthink of operations from the enemys point of view are you becoming too predictable both in patrolling and in your reaction to incidents are you too static with too many fixed points and not enough mobility is the base an easy target the enemy knows you are always there after all are you alienating the population thus encouraging them to either sympathize with or worse actively support or join the ranks of the enemy kevaluation of information each incident however minor teaches lesson learn from these and share the experience with the others in your bn and elsewhere in the bct they all face the same problems to greater or lesser degree conduct evaluation of serious incidents describing enemy mo and supplement

conducting attacks against security forces or supporting the terrorists it is imperative however that all information is shared the most innocuous piece of information picked up by soldier on patrol may hold the key to foiling terrorist attack and therefore save lives be aware that the actions of even the most junior soldier can have strategic consequences the shooting of child or unarmed civilian will cause great damage to the coalition efforts everyone on patrol is the strategic soldier and is very much the public face of the coalition as they are seen every day by the common iraqi and the global media conclusion 41 i hope that this short list is of some use to you in the planning and conduct of operations in the urban environment it is not exhaustive but it may provoke some

again dismounts scan opposite side of road in urban areas ie soldiers on the left side of the road scan the right side this must be rehearsed soldiers must pay attention to windows doorways and roofs

procedures ttps smaller patrols are easier to control in an urban environment warm lighted dugout in each battalion should be reserved for exclusive use of patrols assemble the patrol there about an hour and half before starting on mission so that they can be warmed and given hot coffee this procedure allows time too for such chores as field stripping cleaning and drying each weapon during this time the mission should be thoroughly explained and each mans duties carefully reviewed maps and aerial photographs should he studied in detail all these things help to form the men into team they are the incidentals that pay off later in more effective performance of the patrols duties two small patrols are better than one large one if they are in constant communication and terrain permits them to be mutually supporting walking in the footsteps of the man ahead helps conceal the number of men in the patrol and reduces the chances of setting off booby traps simply warning the men on the outpost line that friendly patrols are operating to their front is not enough they should be told where and during what time the patrols will he operating prior to departure work out with the artillery three or four easily recognizable target reference points trps arrange to communicate directly with the artillery to get rapid action on requests for smoke for orientation and supporting fire 5 one mission per patrol patrol should have single task and purpose there can be tendency by staff officers and commanders to add second mission just because patrol is going to be in the vicinity of some point in which they are interested 39 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned world war ii vignette patrol experts from the united states armys 99th infantry division france report effective use of magic wand when it was necessary for small units to cross known minefields not covered with snow we had considerable success in detecting boobies by having one man precede us through the minefield holding small stick lightly in his hand at an angle of 45 degrees with the end about two inches off the ground pressure of the trip wires against the stick warned him of eight booby traps in one day some trip wires are neck high others only six inches or less from the ground remember that if you find one booby trap there probably are more around taken from center for military history website wwii collection6 night patrols when the mission is reconnaissance night patrols should consist of small number of men higher headquarters should not prescribe the composition of patrol they should order that certain information be obtained allowing the unit furnishing the patrol to decide on its composition at night send one squadsized ambush and at least one fireteamsized listening post the squad that pulls the night ambush conducts squad patrol in the morning second squad pulls an afternoon patrol and third squad secures the patrol base the purpose of day patrol is to select site for night ambush squad will rarely conduct an ambush at site it has not seen in daylight 7 include an engineer whenever possible an engineer sapper should be sent with each patrol it is reassuring for any patrol to have with it someone who is experienced in handling mines booby traps and explosives 8 assumptions when on patrol always assume that you are being watched and that if being watched you are probably being followed 9 patrol security dropback ambush the dropback ambush is technique used when the patrol suspects it is being followed on signal two or more men previously designated and scattered throughout the patrol drop to the ground and cover the rear the patrol continues to move few hundred meters and set up security the dropback team remains in place 1015 minutes and then rejoins the remainder of the squad this tactic is repeated two or three times on normal patrol and is very effective cloverleaf this technique is very difficult in an urban environment and should only be used when building layout permits 10 presence patrols presence patrols provide cop on the beat approach presence patrols use both mounted and dismounted patrol techniques to accomplish their tasks presence patrols are visible show strength and discipline and are combat ready stealth is not normally required or desired presence patrols also establish habitual relationships within sectors and communities provide information news and upcoming events to the community assist communities in requesting and receiving civil military operations projects encourage community projects and assist when

basic methods of zone reconnaissance fan converging routes or successive sectors 3 obtain and report information about the terrain and enemy within the specified area 4 enter and leave the target area without being detected by the enemy training and evaluation training information outline 1 estimate of the situation upon receipt of the reconnaissance mission the platoon leader develops an estimate of the situation that estimate is based on all current int available about the enemy in the vicinity of the target area and on the capabilities of the unit while planning for the mission the unit engages in normal preparation for the mission the organization is tailored to best support the mission the reconnaissance element of platoon will normally be larger than squad 2 planning details the overall plan is developed based on the following considerations int all reconnaissance operations must be based on the best information available about conditions in the objective area b deceptive measures the success of reconnaissance operations depends to large extent on deception measures and on undetected infiltration and exfiltration c use of the smallest possible unit to accomplish the mission keeping the unit size to minimum decreases the possibility of detection by the enemy while only small element may do the actual reconnoitering the parent unit must be large enough to provide 41 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedsecurity or support if the reconnaissance element is detected or engaged by an enemy force d the importance of remaining undetected the unit uses stealth camouflage concealment and sound and light discipline while taking advantage of limited visibility to avoid contact and to get near or on the objective use of surveillance target acquisition and night observation stano devices the unit uses stano devices to help it to move and to gain information about the enemy based on int reports however consideration must be given to the enemys detection devices when detection devices are available to the enemy passive devices should be used by reconnoitering forces to decrease the probability of enemy detection f rehearsals after all int has been analyzed the plan developed special items of equipment procured and issued and the troops briefed the unit then rehearses the plan the rehearsal increases the probability of the operations success rehearsals are as detailed as time will allow and include dry runs and briefings with appropriate repetition and questioning to ensure understanding of the plan contingency plans are also rehearsed where applicable as minimum those plans must be repeated by the reconnaissance members to ensure they are understood g the need for minimizing audio and electronic communications constraints on communication depend upon enemy detection capabilities and upon how quickly the information obtained about the enemy must be acted on there may be instances where the importance of the information may require an immediate report that could threaten the units existence often onetime radio contact during the mission is necessary h inspections the planning phase of the operation will include at least one inspection of all members of the reconnaissance force with equipment included only equipment identified by the platoon leader as essential for mission accomplishment will be carried special equipment must be closely inspected and safeguarded to ensure its functioning during the mission personnel and equipment assigned to augment the unit must also be carefully inspected and monitored before and during the operation every shortcoming found in personnel or equipment is corrected before the operation begins thorough inspections and supervision of personnel and equipment before the operation make compromise or failure less likely 3 organization of the unit for zone reconnaissance patrol regardless of the type of reconnaissance the unit normally is organized into three elements command and control element reconnaissance element and security element command and control the commander of the unit conducting reconnaissance normally will require small command group the command group helps communicate with higher headquarters subordinate elements and supporting forces helps coordinate and control supporting elements fire support and air or water transport and helps provide logistical support for the operation for small operations this group may consist of only the commander and radio operator for larger operations the commander may require int logistics and fire support elements with communication personnel adequate for sustained 24hour operations the command group is always kept as small as possible b reconnaissance of the objective the reconnaissance element approaches the target using stealth and concealment the element must acquire the needed information while remaining undetected it must skillfully avoid all known and discovered enemy sensing devices therefore patience is important passive stano devices will be used to observe for official use only 42companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3activities at the objective reconnaissance personnel may electronically transmit information about the target to the appropriate headquarters as it is observed or they may withdraw from the target and disseminate the information by other means the reconnaissance site should be sterilized before the reconnaissance elements withdraw from it withdrawal from the area must be as skillful patient and precise as was the movement into it c security of the force the elements responsible for security must give the commander sufficient warning of the location and movement of enemy forces to permit the friendly force to take evasive action when it is not possible to give warning covering fires must be provided to permit withdrawal of the reconnaissance element only timely warning and accurate information can give the commander the time and space to react if the reconnaissance element is detected by the enemy the commander must have correct information quickly in order to support the element with suppressive fires or to give it time to evade and withdraw 4 zone reconnaissance in zone reconnaissance the platoon is tasked to obtain information about the terrain and enemy within clearly defined boundary figure 51 the techniques presented below can be used regardless of the nature of the int objective the major differences would result from the movement technique involved once given zone reconnaissance mission the platoon will move to the designated area in the shortest possible time this movement normally involves traveling along existing roads and of course employing the appropriate movement techniques during this movement to an area the platoon should report and bypass enemy opposition unless ordered to take other action b the choice of the techniques that follow should be based on the distribution of int objectives within the area and the time allocated for the reconnaissance of said objectives objective rally points orps and rendezvous points are used to facilitate control 43 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned zone reconnaissance figure 51 zone reconnaissance1 the fan method figure 52 the element leader first selects series of orps throughout the zone from which to operate when the unit arrives at the first orp it halts and establishes security the leader confirms the units location he then selects reconnaissance routes to and from the orp these routes form fanshaped pattern around the orp the routes must overlap to ensure that the entire area has been reconnoitered the leader sends out reconnaissance elements along the routes he does not send out all of his elements at once he keeps small reserve in the orp for example if the unit has three reconnaissance elements only two are sent out the other one is kept as reserve additionally the patrol leader sends the elements out on adjacent routes this pattern prevents having the unit make contact in two different directions after the entire area fan has been reconnoitered all information acquired during the reconnaissance is disseminated the unit moves to the next orp this action is reported at each successive orp figure 52 the fan method 2 the converging routes method figure 53 in this method the unit moves to its zone of operation once there they halt at the designated orp and establish security the leader confirms his location and the unit is broken down into smaller elements the leader gives each element reconnaissance route the location for the rendezvous point and linkup time at the rendezvous point all elements depart for their designated routes the leader normally travels with the center element each element normally reconnoiters its route using the fan method after the zone has been reconnoitered the elements link up at the rendezvous point at the designated time security

action of the unit at each orp and rendezvous point is the same as is used for the converging routes method at each rendezvous point information is disseminated that point becomes the orp for the next

first understand first act first and finish decisively int preparation of the battlefield ipb although the environment has changed there are two important things that have notthe potential for close fight and combined arms maneuver therefore leaders have to plan for the close fight and maneuver forces to dominate the potential threat to gain the initiative if the threat is realized as in movement to contact leaders must identify potential friction points such as crowds during an engagement leaders also must identify potential points of contact such as improvised explosive devices ieds at intersections or built up area with suspected cell prior to those points the leader must maneuver to either confirm or deny the threat for example company commander conducting combat patrol identifies potential ied locations at key intersections outside of built up area prior to reaching those intersections the commander maneuvers clearing team along the flanks to clear possible enemy observers defile drill secures the area around the suspected ied and waits for follow on force explosive ordnance disposal eod to clear the suspected ied location before committing the main body todays contemporary operational environment involves much more than direct fire threat as stated before this environment involves more variables that require soldiers to be smarter and much more than just steelyeyed soldiers these variables have the potential of influencing unit operations therefore they should be addressed during the planning phase of an operation below are just few of the variables

information confirming or denying the location of an enemy cell operating in the village the situation leads the patrol to general area or location and based on the size of the village more information is needed to further focus the patrols efforts primary sources of information include local leaders and the populace therefore the patrol must interact with locals andor local leaders in order to collect the necessary information 53 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedinformal engagements prior to any operation requiring units to interact with the local population leaders and soldiers must review the unit io campaign plan understand the messages and themes and be able to relay the message or theme with and without interpreters ultimately the messages should influence the populations attitudes toward the unit and prevent commitment to the enemy not every soldier has immediate access to an interpreter however ttp is to have soldiers prepare themselves with script or fliers with io messages in the appropriate language formal engagements in most cases formal engagement between village leader and the patrol leader becomes the primary effort in gathering information leaders must prepare themselves by doing the following understand background information of the village and leaders review previous debriefings and civil assessments identify potential motivational needs prepare an agenda to address both village needs and leaders concerns as well as build smooth transition into questioning that may provide the unit actionable int review the units io campaign plan focus io effort to influence attitudes and reduce commitment to the enemy rehearse using the interpreter during the course of the engagement if other individuals are present ensure that the names of the individuals and other information if available are recorded debriefings not every patrol will produce priority int requirements pir or actionable int however every patrol collects information based on what the soldiers see or hear friendly interaction with local vendor may not immediately seem important to soldier however the local interaction of any soldier of that patrol may build picture for commander or effects cell therefore it is critical that every soldier is debriefed additionally soldiers should be debriefed on their actions or io themes successfully passed or relayed the quality of the debriefing may even be degraded by the length of the patrol soldiers over period of time may forget certain aspects of the patrol or certain observations therefore patrol should designate recorders one ttp is to designate recorder per fire team or squad another technique for capturing information is to use digital cameras if available to the unit patrols should maximize the use of the digital cameras and designate camera man prior to patrol as secondary task squads should be given certain information requirements to gather 1st squad develop sketch of building 21 and 22 identify doorways and windows for official use only 54companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 32nd squad identify locations where the populace congregates and note the makeup of the congregation attempt to identify certain individuals 3rd squad identify potential observation platforms observe attitudes of the populace these information requirements will help focus the patrols ir effort and build better understanding of the village for future operations rules of engagement roe leaders and soldiers must understand the roe prior to the patrol knowing and understanding are different if soldier does not truly understand he may hesitate or prolong an action technique to ensure soldiers understand the roe is to provide vignette training of possible situations he may encounter this training can be given during rehearsal time or during inspections detainee operations probably the most discouraging event is to watch captured person get released for improper handling or failing to fill out required documents leaders must understand the process if an individual meets the requirements for detention technique to facilitate detention operations is to designate team armed with the appropriate documents knowledge and expertise of the process the following questions are provided to assist in determining if person meets the requirements for detention at the initial point of capture these questions are not inclusive and the patrolling unit may have additional information requirements that meet detention criteria has the person committed crime did they shoot at the capturing unit did they drop their weapons and attempt escape were they engaged in hostile conduct upon capture do they possess multiple identification documents are they carrying explosives large amounts of munitions or money immediate actions of detention treat all detainees with dignity and respect use only appropriate and necessary force immediately secure the area and

stop offensive actions and focus on security or defending the terrain it owns until additional forces arrive act first force protection there are two thoughts when conducting patrol requiring units to interact with locals some units will attempt to enter with small force to conduct the initial engagement while leaving majority of its combat power out of sight or tactically uncommitted another approach is to demonstrate combat power up front by maneuvering units into overwatch while the engagement team approaches the potential site of the engagement units must weigh the pros and the cons of both courses of action however the latter may deter attacks on the unit set the stage for the engagement and posture the unit for success if contact is made not every scenario will provide the ability to establish overwatch positions but it is helpful to employ them whenever possible for official use only 56companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3development of commanders critical information requirements ccir in todays environment units must be able to operate effectively throughout the spectrum of conflict the most difficult transition for any soldier or leader is the ability to quickly and effectively transition from stability operations and support operations to combat operations the development of ccir will help the unit make those transitions visualize the battlefield and stay ahead of the enemys decisionmaking cycle current trend for commanders is listing numerous ir as ccir by definition ccir is information required by commander that directly affects his decisions and dictates the successful execution of tactical operations therefore ccir are those information requirements that either confirm the commanders vision or cause the commander to deviate from the plan ccir do not encompass all ir instead they focus on specific information another trend is commanders failing to plan and disseminate branches or sequels if an ir is answered when developing ir focus on ir that would cause the plan to be invalid or cause the commander to make decision decisions can be focused on either an unexpected event or the exploitation of success the if and then is one method of developing ir and decisions some examples might be if crowd develops during an engagement and local leaders and the iraqi police cannot control the crowd then trigger the reserve and if mortar system is found and our unit has not been compromised then establish hasty ambush command and control one of the toughest concerns for company commanders is determining where his location best commands and controls the unit during the patrol or in terms of the coe location where he can see and understand to act first and finish decisively as previously discussed the development of ccir helps the commander visualize the fight and make decisions the commander should be located where he could best make those decisions it is highly recommended that the commander be able to observe the situation develop rather than attempt to build picture based on reports in addition to ccir company commanders or patrol leaders should consider three things 1 decisive actions during the patrol for example patrol may require company to conduct an engagement with local leaders and then joint dismounted patrol with the iraqi police the first decisive action is the engagement the commander or patrol leader if not decisively engaged with the local leaders should be positioned to observe the security of that engagement and the situation as it develops the next decisive action is the joint dismounted patrol in the same manner the commander or patrol leader should be positioned where he can observe the patrol and the situation around it this position allows either the commander or patrol leader to decisively influence actions positioning forces to isolate one decisive action at time or influencing the decisive action with additional assets based on what the commander sees 2 picture based off reporting versus ground truth company commanders rely heavily on reports to help paint the picture reporting by all means is important however 57 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedcommanders must understand that platoons report the actions of the closein fight at times it may be difficult for subordinate leaders to observe hence report the evolving situation around their units therefore the commanders location serves to provide second set of eyes generally not decisively engaged in the fight 3 the ability to influence or shape the platoon fights at the decisive point based on being able to observe his units actions and understand the surrounding situation the commander may anticipate the leverage of additional assets to the fight if platoon makes direct fire contact commander may employ additional forces to provide supporting fires and secure or isolate key avenues of approach to the contact by employing traffic control points tcps these actions restrict the enemy and force the enemy to fight in two directions until the platoon in contact is able to maneuver on the enemy this example demonstrates how the commander can shape the platoons fight with assets readily available to him in some instances other assets if available can be usedmortars for isolating or attack aviation for route reconnaissance or supporting fires direct fire planninggraphical control measures unless the patrol is given specific locations of the enemy the location of direct fire contacts will be impossible to predict therefore the patrol leaders must develop direct fire plan and graphical control measures for locations of anticipated contact this plan facilitates controlling and maneuvering units and orienting fires consider the following topics when developing control measures movementroutes phase lines building numbers direct firebuilding numbers support by fire sbfoverwatch potential objectives indirect fireaviationtarget reference points aerial attack by fire positions minimum safe distances for official use only 58companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3finish decisively the desired outcome for all lethal contacts is obviously to finish decisively hopefully the previous topics will help prepare patrol leaders in decisively finishing the enemy however the contact may have an effect on our ability to influence the population therefore the focus of finishing decisively can be directed to one question what message did we leave the population there are various and evolving techniques informal engagements with local leaders technique is to keep the individuals informed of what individuals are in lethal contact with friendly forces if unit leaders are decisively engaged an informal engagement afterwards would be just as effective this informal engagement provides the unit the opportunity to pass on pertaining io messages insurgents are indiscriminate with their weapons they risk the lives of innocent civilians friendly forces are capable of defeating insurgents and protecting the population using the media soldiers and leaders shy away from the media however this asset can be used to influence the population one rule of thumb to remember is as follows if we dont provide them our story they will make their own without our input 59 for official use onlycenter for army

deliverassess d3a targeting process and effectsbased operations ebo because they focus on information gathering while we have tried to keep the focus of this article on the executors of patrols we do occasionally raise ttp for companies and battalions as well for the sake of clarity we will use the term commander to denote battalion or company commanders directing combat security patrol the term leader will denote the platoon or squad leader in charge of combat security patrol the term local will denote an area leader or person of influence in the operational environment oe finally the term engagement will denote twoparty bilateral negotiation between leader and local in the oe patrolling is the basis of operations in hostile area fm 30731 peace operations states patrolling is the basis of operations in hostile area it is aimed at acquiring information identifying and apprehending persons and neutralizing hostile group pg iv1 common mistake made by leaders is to assume that the sheer number of patrols conducted is positive indicator or measure of effectiveness if patrols are not prepared to answer specific questions then they have not succeeded in accomplishing anything of value if the patrols do not engage the local populace especially locals and persons of influence in the area then the soldiers ability to understand local challenges and gauge local sentiment is challenged successful patrol requires focused patrol brief while there are many details that need to be briefed and rehearsed patrol leaders routinely fail to cover the commanders priority int requirements pir fm 50 army planning and orders production defines pir as those int requirements for which commander has an anticipated and stated priority in his task of planning and decision making the battalion s2 establishes specific information requirements sir and special orders and requests sor for each patrol the s2s sir and sor should be put in the form of questions to be answered or tasks to be accomplished for each patrol an all too common mistake at the jrtc is for companies and battalions to send out patrols with focused int requirements because the patrol is not provided pir sor and sir it does not provide the detailed information the battalion and ultimately the brigade requires for making decisions like the example above the patrol is debriefed upon return but actionable int is gleaned from the patrol on the other hand if patrol is directed to survey citizens on power outages and determines one section of the town has consistent problem with power the battalion can coordinate with the brigade to send team to assess and repair the problem the unit can also use this information and the followon action as bargaining chip in future engagements patrols are often directed to for official use only 62companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3engage the locals and deliver focused messages while this sounds simple enough most junior leaders are illprepared to engage locals and effectively deliver focused messages little knowledge in engagement techniques interpreter skills and rehearsals can greatly assist leaders in patrol execution prior trained tasks vs premission tasks units always have number of tasks to accomplish these tasks may be divided into priortrained tasks and premission tasks priortrained tasks involve all general tasks trained before knowledge of the warning order warno and are usually found in units battle drills and standing operating procedure sop premission tasks are those that are specific to the mission at hand priortrained tasks set up the leader for success and allow his unit to start preparation with only warno priortrained tasks consist of battle drills and sops for example react to contact react to sniper casevac etc companies and platoons should include nonlethal tasks such as rules of engagement roe rehearsal and interpreter rehearsal soldiers must be proficient at the use of an interpreter they must know and understand io themes and talking points and they must understand how to apply the roe of these use of an interpreter will take the most training time as it is very unfamiliar task for most soldiers interpreters should be viewed as part of the unit and included in training and rehearsals as much as possible they must be made to feel safe during the mission and the leader must understand their capabilities and limitations above all during actual translation they must act as translation machines accurately interpreting the conversation without injecting their own analysis opinion or personal agenda tips for using an interpreter speak in the first person and tell your interpreter to do the same instruct your interpreter to translate accurately and to avoid paraphrasing keep eye contact and orientation with the local person to whom you are speaking not your interpreter speak in short phrases with simple vocabulary avoid military jargon and acronyms if misunderstanding occurs the leader and local person should rephrase their statements do not ask the interpreter what the local person means prepare simple hand and arm signals to signal interpreter or leader to stop talking when needed rehearse with your interpreter any specific terminology likely to arise ensure your interpreter knows the proper roles and actions during battle drills as much as possible include the interpreter in the mission preparation to make him part of the team once the leader has received the warno he can start his troopleading procedures and determine the necessary premission tasks all patrol members should attend the commanders patrol briefing and should be encouraged to ask questions to fully understand the mission the 63 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedleader should ensure everyone in the patrol knows and understands the commanders intent the pir the sorsir and relevant io themes and talking points standard premission tasks include route planning requesting and receiving missionspecific equipment or supplies roe key tasks and making coordination with other units or agencies reviewing the roe by providing examples to patrol members and soliciting response is much more effective than simply reading acronyms such as random antiterrorism measures program ramp in other words it is better to ask questions that force soldiers to apply the roe for example you are on patrol when you see two men down an alley in fist fight one man pulls knife on the other is use of deadly force authorized this question requires the soldier to apply the roe that states that us soldiers must do everything in their power to prevent bodily harm to civilian actions during patrols in addition to leading his patrol the patrol leader will often be the manonpoint when talking to locals his demeanor as well as that of the rest of the unit can greatly influence the outcome of the mission friendly smile and respectful greeting to important figures will go long way toward fostering cooperative relationship while demonstrating good alert security posture to deter attacks make an effort to engage the locals in friendly conversation the leader must integrate io themes and messages including his commanders guidance in his conversations getting information out is vital portion of the mission not public relations pr drill the leader should focus large percentage of his conversation toward his commanders sir but he should also remember to try to set up the town to ensure success in following missions the british army calls this leaving trace noting that every contact between soldiers and locals leaves some sort of trace whether physical remnants of the patrol battle damage improved school etc or memory in the mind of local the leader should try to ensure the trace he leaves is in accordance with his commanders guidance spheres of influence in his article preparing leaders for nation building lieutenant colonel patrick donahoe writes in iraq and elsewhere the army asks battalion and company combat commanders to conduct nation building and act as civil affairs officers soldiers must master warfighting skills to seize and

possible refrain from pointing fingers for poorlyperformed actionsthe time for corrective training is later the commander must also ensure that he receives the actual route taken by the patrol and any reasons the patrol may have for deviating from preplanned routes using your fire supporters the company commander can effectively utilize the fire support officer fso to assist with preparation

confirming the mission and directing the patrol to gather sir of the availability of clean drinking water and how the police chief is viewed by townspeople during the patrol briefing the s2 provides list of specific questions for the patrol to ask in order to answer the sir and asks the leader to survey at least fifteen townspeople the s2 also wants the soldiers to ask the townspeople if they know about any insurgent activity in the area the fso confirms the specific io themes and messages to be disseminated during the patrol reviews the police chiefs contact folder and prepares the patrol leader with facts about the police chief the company commander assigns the interpreter for the mission and ensures he is linked up with the platoon leader the platoon conducts pcc and pci in accordance with their sop and the company commander ensures adherence by selecting three random items to inspect during the patrol the squad maintained an alert security posture in order to deter aggressors and gave lollipops to twentythree local children while walking through the town the patrol moved along its assigned route for the most part but made detour down one alley to take digital photos of vandalized building with anticoalition graffiti the surveys were completed and two individuals one from the survey and one childs uncle report knowledge of an ied workshop on the outskirts of town at the conclusion of the combat security patrol the fso debriefed the entire patrol asking specific questions to find out the general attitude of locals who were encountered during the patrol he confirmed the route taken and recorded the location of the vandalized building two soldiers in the patrol reported that they observed the town banker handing large amounts of cash to three people

made recommendations to s3 and commander for cordon and search of the suspected ied warehouse additionally the s2 developed new questionnaire for followon patrols that will seek information about the vandalized building and about the distribution of money by the bank officer by following the patrol cycle in figure 72 the right information gets collected by patrols and fed to higherranking officers for analysis and decision making the common mistake made at the jrtc is brigade and battalion staffs fail to tell patrols what information needs to be collected often patrols are sent out with guidance other than to provide security presence in town after several days of not getting information brigade assets like the psyops and ca teams get frustrated in an effort to be proactive these teams will go out and commit information fratricide the result is an unsynchronized effort across the brigades battlespace another way of looking at this problem is that information collection is critical to success in the coe more so than in traditional linear combat winning the support of the population cannot be accomplished unless patrol leaders engage the local population and get sense for what local needs are brigades and the new modular bcts are empowered with tremendous assets to shape the fight in their battlespace but need bottomup information to plan the use of those assets

trigger well unless engaging targets as well 3 soldier use of random antiterrorism measures program rampsoldier rules of engagement roe knowledge most soldiers were comfortable with roe nevertheless some soldiers did not understand the roe and the results were catastrophic continued use of roe vignette training is recommended to ensure that soldiers do not hesitate when it counts nor violate the laws of war with respect to pws roe vignette training is another area where leaders try to make it too complicated training for the simple black and white scenarios is recommended most commanders are not going to secondguess judgment of our junior leaders in contact for the grey cases 4 integration of tactical psychological operations psyop teams tpts several companies were allocated tpt in fifty percent of the cases the tpt was used very effectively in the cases where it was not use effectively poor positioning prevented employment or the ability to control the asset in several cases the tpt failed to prepare dismounted rig for dismounted patrol identifying the right messages for different contingencies unruly crowds direct fire contact etc and the criteria for employment are keys to success 5 security another major trend for combat patrol stx training was not adequately securing objective areas prior to conducting specified tasks to engage local leaders collect int requirements ir and promote information operations io dominating battlespace and securing the force are prerequisites to conducting civil engagements several companies were challenged to coordinate the heavy weapons platforms with dismounted movement this can be accomplished using the bounding overwatch movement technique majority of the companies were challenged to effectively position their mounted and heavy weapons with dispersion and standoff in good positions affording cover and fields of fire these positioning challenges resulted in difficulty getting these assets into the fight if or when contact was made in many cases leaders are not thinking of the bradley as mobile support by fire capability additionally dismounted formations tended to group and did not maintain tactical dispersion maintaining 360degree security of every independent element was another common shortcoming for both mounted and dismounted elements vehicle commanders learned to think in terms of optimizing the use of their critical weapons systems while reducing the vehicles vulnerability to rocketpropelled grenade rpg shots when selecting positions 71 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned6 security and weapons posture during these patrols force protection is about dominating battlespace sometimes this is personal battlespace soldiers seem to understand this most soldiers whether walking or in the turret looked ready and capable of inflicting lethal force leaders must constantly enforce weapons being on safe muzzle awareness and fingers remaining out of trigger wells until the soldiers needs to engage target quick fire and reflexive fire training will enforce these habits 7 mobility requirements commanders often have more high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles hmmwvs and mobility platforms than they need for the specific mission ie 25 hmmwvs for an 89 soldier company once dismounted to conduct the patrol the need for security of the vehicles impedes the ability to get boots on the ground and does not contribute to the key tasks of the mission beyond force protection fp configuring mobility assets to support the ground tactical plan is new phenomenon for mobile or wheeled company commanders with 3soldier vehicle crews if dismounted plt is the requirement then sometimes leaving the hmmwvs at the forward operating base fob and using an light medium tactical vehicle lmtv may be better option 8 battle command the most prevalent improve trend company commanders were challenged in positioning themselves on the battlefield to maintain situational awareness and feel the battlefield most were not positioned to see and understand in order to make decisions to act first finish decisively generally commanders of heavy companies initially positioned themselves too far from their main effort to really understand what was going on in several cases the company commanders tried to command and control the fight using just map and the radio other commanders who positioned themselves forward in the fight quickly begin to fight the sqd or plt fight abdicating their roles in shaping the battlefield outside the plt fight 9 commanders were coached into anticipating what decisions they would have to make during the operation or in contact and then determining the best location from which to see and understand in order to make this decision urban terrain generally requires leaders to position farther forward in order to understand first and act first this improved throughout stx lane training and with each iteration commanders better positioned themselves to understand to make quick but informed decisions leaders who moved forward to literally see and feel the battle were much more successful in quickly developing the situation this involved maneuvering other available assets to isolate contain secure flank or follow and support casualty evacuation casevac and handling pws company commanders reportingpainting the picture for battalion once in contact will facilitate requesting battalion or brigade assets to help shape the company fight army aviation close air support quick reaction forces and flash traffic control points twentyfive percent did well seventyfive percent received heavy coaching after the first iteration with some improvements in their second iterations the urban environment necessitates having dismounted radio configurations so that commanders can shape the fight battalion bn and co and maintain command and control 10 language skills generally companies are attempting to incorporate soldier remedial

to more easily control fires as well as render contact reports at the fire team and sqd level several leaders failed to direct the fires of their formations in some companies incontact soldiers fired

84companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3chapter 11 conduct negotiations extract fm 30611 combined arms operations in urban terrain chapter 14 the company team may face number of situations in which leaders will need to conduct negotiations the two general types of negotiations are situational and preplanned situational negotiations are conducted in response to requirement for onthespot discussion and resolution of specific issue or problem an example would be members of an advance guard negotiating the passage of convoy through checkpoint preplanned negotiations are conducted in such situations as company team commander conducting work coordination meeting between commanders of former warring factions fwfs to determine mine clearance responsibilities asituational negotiations at the company team level situational negotiations are far more common than the preplanned type in fact employment in stability operations will require the commander his subordinate leaders and other soldiers to conduct some form of negotiations almost daily this in turn requires them to have thorough understanding of the rules of engagement roe and rules of interaction roi 1 members of the company team apply this working knowledge to the process of discussing and whenever possible resolving issues and problems that arise between opposing parties which may include the team itself critical aspect of this knowledge is the negotiators ability to recognize that he has exhausted his options under the roeroi and must turn the discussion over to higher authority negotiations continue at progressive levels of authority until the issue is resolved 2 in preparing themselves and their soldiers for the negotiation process the commander and subordinate leaders must conduct rehearsals covering the roe and roi one effective technique is to wargame application of roeroi in given stability situation such as manning checkpoint these simulations force leaders and subordinates alike to analyze the roeroi and apply them in an operational environment bpreplanned negotiations preplanned negotiations require negotiators to thoroughly understand both the dispute or issue at hand and the factors influencing it such as the roe and roi before talks begin the negotiators ultimate goal is to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both sides and that reduces antagonism and or the chance of renewed hostilities between the parties involved the following paragraphs discuss guidelines and procedures for each phase of the negotiation process 1identify the purpose of negotiations before contacting leaders of the belligerent parties to initiate the negotiation process the commander must familiarize himself with both the situation and the area in which his unit will be operating this includes identifying and evaluating avenues of approach that connect the opposing forces results of the negotiation process which may be 85 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedlengthy and complicated must be based on national or international agreements or accords negotiation topics include the following when the sides will withdraw positions to which they will withdraw these should be located to preclude observation and direct fire by the opposing parties which forces or elements will move during each phase of the operation prepositioning of peace forces that can intervene in case of renewed hostilities control of heavy weapons mine clearance formal protest procedures for the belligerent parties 2establish the proper context the next step in the process is to earn the trust and confidence of each opposing party this includes establishing an atmosphere and physical setting that participants will judge to be both fair and safe these considerations apply always conduct joint negotiations on matters that affect both parties when serving as mediator remain neutral at all times learn as much as possible about the belligerents the details of the dispute or issue being negotiated and other factors such as the geography of the area and specific limitations or restrictions for example the roe and roi gain and keep the trust of the opposing parties by being firm fair and polite use tact remain patient and be objective never deviate from applicable local and national laws and international agreements 3prepare for the negotiations thorough exacting preparation is another important factor in ensuring the success of the negotiation process company team personnel should use the following guidelines negotiate sequentially from subordinate level to senior level select and prepare meeting place that is acceptable to all parties arrange for interpreters and adequate communications facilities as necessary for official use only 86companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3ensure that all opposing parties as well as the negotiating team use common map edition and scale coordinate all necessary movement establish local security keep higher headquarters informed throughout preparation and during the negotiations make arrangements to record the negotiations use audio or video recording equipment if available 4conduct the negotiations negotiators must always strive to maintain control of the session they must be firm yet evenhanded in leading the discussion at the same time they must be flexible with willingness to accept recommendations from the opposing parties and from their own assistants and advisors the following procedures and guidelines apply exchange greetings introduce all participants by name including negotiators and any advisors consider the use of small talk at the beginning of the session to put the participants at ease allow each side to state its case without interruption and without making premature judgments make record of issues presented by both sides if one side makes statement that is incorrect be prepared to produce evidence or proof to establish the facts if the negotiating team or peacekeeping force has preferred solution present it and encourage both sides to accept it close the meeting by explaining to both sides what has been agreed upon and what actions they are expected to take if necessary be prepared to present this information in writing for their signatures do not negotiate or make deals in the presence of the media maintain the highest standards of conduct at all times 87 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedchapter 12 company engagement training cpt p roy walker jrtc operations group engagement definition

patrols focusing on reconnaissance and route clearance as well as verifying the status of various water wells and the attitude of the civilian populace we normally operated with at least two uparmored high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles hmmwvs one with 50 caliber and the other with an mk19 for some patrols we added an additional two cargo m966 hmmwvs medic an interpreter and an afghanistan soldier always accompanied the six to twelve us infantrymen at times we would have addons including counterintelligence ci agents leaders and staff previewing routes or members from the center for army lessons learned call i was selected to lead many additional patrols because of the rapport established between the local elders and my team we met our interpreters several days before we started the patrols we spent many hours together and were taught some of the basic language and local customs i asked the correct way to show proper respect to the different age groups of people with special focus on the elders the elder of the village is wellrespected and usually educated man but is not necessarily the oldest male in the village it is his responsibility to ensure the needs of the village are met he is expected to greet strangers accepting the risk himself and decide if they bode good or evil for his people the younger village members show him sincere respect and respond to his requests immediately i wanted to be sure the villagers were not offended as we conducted our patrols through their villages and farms usually we would stop about 200300 meters from the village and set up security then the interpreter and i would walk up to the village and seek out the elder the first visit was usually tense but with friendly smile and handshake we began the slow process of building trust i had the assurance that my patrol was watching my back and the interpreter would tell the elder that we meant harm to his village or his people we also asked few questions to ensure that we had good understanding of the best way to travel through the area some example questions are 1 would you mind if we drove through town or is there safe bypass around the village usually the response would be that we were welcome to drive through town 2 where do the children play so we can watch for them and make sure they are safe distance from the trucks in every case we were shown the play area and thanked for our concern 3 do you mind if we come back through again we were invited back and thanked for helping them we would then usually being invited for tea i asked the interpreter if they would be offended if i declined he explained that if i did not accept the offer then the elders would not believe we for official use only 96companylevel stability operations and support operations vol 3were friendly and meant them harm so after sharing tea for about twenty minutes we were safely on our way through town the extra time for public relations was critical to the success of our mission tactics techniques and procedures as we became better acquainted in each of the villages we expanded our questions to gather more intelligence int about the areas some example questions are 1 are there any strangers moving into your village that did not live here before the war on some occasions there were and the information was passed to the s2 2 have your people found any new mines while they were farmingworking the people started to warn us about the mines and helped us mark some safe routes through existing minefields 3 have you seen any of the taliban soldiers in this area when some of the towns became hostile or closed their gates due to some careless patrols conducted by other nations forces i was tasked with taking my team on patrol and attempting to reestablish rapport so the route would open again fortunately because of the earlier visits when we took the time to show some respect and share in their customs the doors were reopened and patrolling resumed i would then take their complaint to the s2 to be worked through proper channels the reputation for having good rapport with the locals led to my selection to conduct several ci and humanitarian aid missions on these missions there were usually lot of children in the towns i would assist the patrol by keeping the children out of the way getting the kids interested in worked well i would take out pen and some paper and ask one of their names in their own language then i would write it in english as best i could and ask them to write the name in pashtu when we had both written the name the paper was given to the child the activity allowed the gunners to pull security without having children in the kill zone the leaders were also able to accomplish the ci or intent the int staff and the local elder commended the effectiveness of this technique another simple technique was to wave lot this caused the locals to wave and allowed us to locate the people with weapons more readily in addition we seemed friendly and that resulted in friendlier responses whenever we stopped for information or for security halt on several occasions we heard of people who were harassed by previous patrols after some sincere questioning of the locals we learned that the previous patrol had in some way been viewed as disrespectful usually the disrespectful perspective was based on simple activity that we take for granted such as passing out candy or ink pens to the children even though the children loved it the adults looked on the practice as not respecting their ability to provide for their own we would go to the elder and explain our custom of sharing and apologize for the offense then we would ask the proper way to give these items to the kids the answer was 97 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedsimple give the items to the elder and he would pass the candy or ink pens to the villagers at this point the villagers became comfortable with this tradition because respect was then focused on the village elder because of the success of our earlier patrols my team was selected to escort akmed karzi the kings brother this assignment was great honor and i was thrilled to lead the escort i was informed that my team was selected by the s5 specifically because of the earlier reports about the success of the ci and patrol missions the task was to lead him through village with
