the senatereported bill includes 4 billion of emergency agricultural disaster assistance which does not count against budgetary caps the h ouse bill has disaster provisions the house bill provides 178

forest service included with natural resources in figure 1 is the only usda agency not funded thr ough the agriculture appropriations bill usda defines its programs using mission areas which do not always correspond to categories in the agriculture ppropriations bill for example foreign agricultural assistance programs are separate title title v in the appropriations bill but are joined with domestic fa rm support in usdas farm and foreign agriculture mission area compare figure 1 with figure 2 conversely usda has separate mission areas for marketing and regulatory programs and agricultural research but both are joined with other domestic farm support programs in title i agricultural programs of the appropriations bill related agencies in addition to the usda agencies mentioned above the agriculture appropriations subcommittees ve jurisdiction over appropriations for the food and drug administration fda of the departme nt of health and human service hhs and the commodity future trading commission cftc an independent regulatory agency these agen cies are included in the agricu lture appropriations bill because of their historical connection to food and agricultural markets however food and agricultural issues have become less dominan t in these agencies as medical and drug issues have grown in fda and nonagricultu ral futures have grown in cftc their combined share of the overall agriculture and related agencies appropriations bill is usually less than 2 see title vi in figure 2 mandatory vs discretionary spending mandatory and discretionary spending are treated differently in the budget process congress generally controls spending on mandatory programs by setting rules for eligibility benefit formulas and other parameters rather than approving specific dollar amounts for these progra ms each year eligibility for mandatoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33412crs4 programs is usually written into authorizin g law and any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law spending for discretionary programs is controlled by annua l appropriations acts the subcommittees of the house and sena appropriations committees originate bills each year that provide funding to c ontinue current activities as well as any new discretionary programs approximately 80 of the total agriculture and related agencies appropriation is classified as mandatory which by definition occurs outside of annual appropriations table 1 the vast majority of usda s mandatory spending is for the following programs the food stamp pr ogram most child nutrition programs the farm commodity price and income suppor t programs authorized by the 2002 farm bill and various disasteremergency appropriations the federal crop insurance program and various agricultural cons ervation and trade pr ograms mandatory spending is highly variable and driven by program particip ation rates economic conditions and weather patterns figure 3 although these programs have mandato ry status many of these accounts ultimately receive funds in the annual agri culture appropriations act for example the food stamp and child nutrition programs are funded by an annual appropriation based on projected spending needs suppl emental appropriations generally are made if these estimates fall short of required spending an annual appropria tion also is made to reimburse the commodity credit corporation for losses in financing the commodity support programs and the va rious other programs it finances the other 20 of the agriculture and related agencies appropriations bill is for discretionary programs ma jor discretionary programs include certain conservation programs most rural development progra ms research and education programs agricultural credit programs the supplemen tal nutrition program for women infants and children wic the public law pl 480 international food aid program meat and

appropriations bill both the house and senate agriculture appropriations subcommittees held hearings on the request see table 12 at the end of this report for tabular summary of each agency at various stages during th appropriations process limits on mandatory programs in recent years appropriators have placed limita tions on mandatory spending authorized in the 2002 farm bill pl 107 171 for various mandatory conservation rural development nd research programs2 the savings achieved by limiting mandatory programs in this way are count ed as scorekeeping adjustments and can be used to fund discretionary programs at higher level than allowed by the discretionary spending cap the 302b allocation for fy2007 the housepassed bill cont ains 505 million in reductions to mandatory programs 483 milli on in conservation and 22 million in rural development while the senatereported b ill contains 396 million in reductions 371 million in conservation and 25 milli on in rural development the administration proposed 490 million in such reductions the proposed reductions for fy2007 woul d be much smaller reductions than the actual reductions in previous year s eg 15 billion in fy2006 and 12 billion in fy2005 mostly because of savings alread scored by the agriculture authorizing committees under budget reconciliation last ear the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 reduced the authorized leve l of several mandato ry programs which appropriators have limited in recent years and thos savings were scored for budget reconciliation and are longer available to appropriators with less room for scorekeeping adjustments higher net discretionary budget allocation 302b will be necessary to achieve the same level of gross discretionary program activity the 302b discretionary allocation in the house is 17812 billion up about 1 billion from fy2006 in the senate the 302b allocation is 182 billion up about 850 million from fy2006 these accounting distinctions help expl ain why gross discretionary programs recommended by the bill are within 1 of fy2006 levels declining about 130 million from fy2006 in the house bill and increasing 140 million in the senate bill even though the net discretionary amount which tracks the official 302b allocation is increasing by about 1 billion 61 in the house bill and 14 billion 85 in the senate bill table 3 and table 12

500 million or 3 of the discretionary total table 4 for these figures an earmark is defined as any designation in the appropriations act or accompanying reports conference house or senate which allocates portion of the appropriation for specific pr oject location or institution most of these earmarks originated in congress although some may have been requested by the administration most of the administrati ons requests are not so specific eg institution or location as to be c ounted as earmarks for these purposes3 for fy2006 about half of the total numbe r of earmarks and 40 of the dollar value are for agricultural research at usda or in universities another third of the earmarks and about 40 of the value are for conservation projects the rest are for rural development and animal and plant health programs the number and dollar amount of earmarks in fy2006 are relatively close to the levels in fy2005 and fy2004 however compared to fy2000 the fy2006 earmarks are 86 higher in va lue and 92 greater in number for the fy2007 bill the earmark issue was raised on the house floor when representative flake offered eight amendm ents to restrict funding for specific earmarked projects all of these amendments were defeated including three by recorded votes 92325 90328 and 87328 earmark sponsors spoke on the floor to explain and justify the projects they said that cancelling earmarks would not necessarily reduce overall spending but w ould lessen congresss role in directing spending and leave more to the discretion of the executive branch opponents of the earmarks said that without such amendmen ts earmarks are not debated nor are the sponsors known on november 15 senator coburn submitted 14 amendments for floor consideration 11 of which w ould strike earmarks for ag ricultural research animal control or rural development three ffect earmarks generally including one that would define an earmark and require usda to create an internet database identifying earmarks showing their cost and gradi ng the earmarks according to their utility in meeting the departments primary goals samdt 5163 another samdt 5164 would require earmarks to be listed in the conference report in order to be considered approved by both the house nd senate as opposed to past years when language was included in the conference report allowing ear marks in house or nate

also has been paid from the ccc over the years particularly for ad hoc farm disaster payments and direct market loss payments to growers of various commodities in response to low farm commodity prices the ccc eventually must repay the funds it borrows from the treasury because the ccc never earns more than it spends its losses must be replenished periodically through cong ressional appropriati on so that its 30 billion borrowing authority debt limit is not depleted congress generally provides this infusion through the annual usda appropr iation law because most of this spending rises or falls

nutrition program administration this account provides money for federal administrative expens related to domestic f ood assistance programs and special projects the senatereporte d measure includes

congressional hunger center 25 million was appropriated for fy2006 and earlier years special program initiatives the bill reported in the senate and the measure adopted by the house also include number of special provisions relating to the rules and operations of domestic food assistance programs and expand one program free fresh fruit and vegetables in schools in most cases pr oposals for change advanced by the administration we re not adopted in either the senate or house bills in the case of programs under the food stamp act the house and senate bills 1 continue rule in place since

3 million in fy2006 and 3 permit up to 10 million in commodi ty funding for tefap to be used for tefap distribution costs these provisions were part of the administrations budget request for fy2007 in addition the house bill through floor amendment stipulates that existin g legal requirements on sponsors of legal aliens who receive food stamps s hould be followed eg sponsors s hould be held liable for the cost of food stamp benefits the administrations fy2007 budget pr oposal for food stamp act programs included several additi onal provisions that were reject ed 1 providing special short term assistance to those losing csfp s upport under separate initiative the proposed termination of the csfp was rejected by the house and senate 2 excluding all retirement savings from food stamp financ ial eligibility tests 3 disqualifying households with relatively high incomeassets who might otherwise be eligible for food stamps because they receive other public assistance and 4 allowing states to

senatereported bill includes only one significant provision related to wic rulesoperations as suggested by the ad ministration and stipulated in the fy2006 appropriations law it adopts specific rule barring pproval of new retailers whose major source of revenue is sales of wic food items so called wiconly stores the house bill includes provisions changing wic rulesoperations in addition to the wiconly store provision noted above the administration called for cap on the proportion of grants that can be spen t on nutrition services and administration leading to state match requirement after fy2007 and an income limit on those who can get wic services automatically because of their participation in medicaid15 for programs under the child nutrition commodity assistance and nutrition program administration accounts the house and senate bills adopt one proposal advanced by the administration barring the use of senior farmers market nutrition program funds to pa sales taxes coupled with disregarding the value of the programs benefits as financial resources for tax and public assistance purposes but as noted earlier they continue fu nding for the csfp and the congressional hunger center in separate part of its bill the senatereported measure also adds one state minnesota to the list of stat in which simplifie d summer food service program rules socalled lugar rules apply under these rules summer program sponsors do not have to document all cost s in order to receive maximum federal subsidies in addition the senate and house bills reject the administrations proposal to provide new funds to continue fivestate extension of the free fresh fruit and vegetable program in schools and instead provide more funding for the program the senate measure appropriates 9 million in addition to the existing 9milliona year mandatory appropriation for this pr ogram this 18 million total is intended to support the existing program operating through selected schools in the 14 states and on 3 indian reservations in fy2006 plus 3 states named in the senate committees report arkansas california and ge orgia in fy2006 15 million was available for this program 9 million in mandatory

intended to allow expansion of the ex isting fy2006 program to selected schools in all states albeit at perstate pa yment amount lower than received by states currently allowed to partic ipate the 25 million total appropriation in the house bill represents substantial increas over the 15 million available in fy2006 but the house proposal also makes all of the funding for this program discretionary

trading commission cftc the commodity futures trading commission cftc is the independent regulatory agency charged with oversight of derivatives markets the cftcs functions include oversight of trading on the futures exchanges registration and supervision of futures industry personnel prevention of fraud and price manipulation and investor protection although most futu res trading is now re lated to financial variables interest rates currency prices and stock indexes congressional oversight is vested in the agricultural committees becau of the markets historical origins for fy2007 the senatereported bill provides 995 million for the cftc an increase of 21 million 22 from the fy 2006 appropriation of 974 million the housepassed bill provides 1094 million 12 increase over fy2006 but 176 million less than 14 the admin istrations reque st of 1270 million figure 15 the administration requested large increase in recognition of growth and change in the markets that the agency regulates and the housepassed bill supports some of that increase user fee proposal both the house and senate bills reject the administrations proposal that cftc be f unded by transaction fee rather than by appropriated funds the admin istrations request did not specify any particular fee rate but said that the proposed fee would cover the cost of the cftcs regulatory activities17 to fund the cftc at the 127 million vel fee of about six or seven cents per transaction on the futures ex changes would be required based on 2005 trading volumes the same futures transaction fee proposal was last included in the administrations fy2003 budget but was not acted by congress in fact every administration since ronald reagans has ca lled unsuccessfully for such fee the futures industry argues that ch fee would be anticompet itive and could divert trading to foreign markets or to the unr egulated overthecount er market however it is not clear that fee of this relatively modest size would have significant impact on trading decisions in market where the value of single contract may rise or fall by hundreds or thousands of dollars in day the administration notes that the cftc is the only federal financial regulator that does not derive its funding from the specialized entities it regulates18 for more information about the cftc user fee proposal see crs report rs22415 proposed
