6406c16 shspec23 communication overts and responsibility people who have been in processing for some time can forget the degree to which other people are wrapped up in and in contest with their environments this is the direct key to the case your first job as an auditor is to find out what the pcs environment is you should also be able to recognize that pcs can get down to the level of where their only concern is to handle some problem in their environment this pc is not going to ot just to sigh of relief contest is not necessarily fisticuffs it is just that there are different ways of reacting to the environment at lower levels anything the pc is doing is an effort to handle the environment this effort could even amount to catatonia or complete immobility the method is not necessarily smart but down to the lowest rung the person is still in contest with his environment and trying to handle it thetan never gives up the methods he uses are solutions their frailty is so great that you can unsettle them quite easily the more irrational the solution the more easily it is unstabilized it is amazing that this fact hasnt been realized much sooner by earlier practitioners an irrational solution has more points to it therefore it is harder to maintain madman works at staying mad the only requisite to unstabilizing this solution is communication there has to be contact to do it probable reason why earlier practitioners didnt see how easy it was to unsettle the irrational solution was that the first step getting into communication was so difficult person could have so much trouble with this point that he forgets that if he could communicate would be simple to unsettle the aberrated solution psychotherapy parks on the subject of communication therapists get so frantic that their efforts to achieve communication get more and more frantic and brutal culminating eventually in electric shock and prefrontal lobotomies part of the trouble is that the psychotherapists think that they can reach the patient by doing something to his brain gestalt and touchiefeelie therapies satisfy this same need of the therapists to reach the patient in less destructive but equally ineffective way to do anything for person you must be in communication with that person you must be reaching him and receiving comm from him dont assume however that communication solves all communication is necessary but not sufficient condition for helping someone in the lower levels where scientology breaks down it is in the area of effort to communicate to the being that is why the auditor gets weird notions about what he should do to and for the person that is where every psychotherapy breaks down and it is true for scientology too you have to keep acknowledging the pc and giving the next auditing command that is what you have trouble getting across to lowerclassed auditors and that is why you work on keeping the comm cycle in you are working along communication channel in order to accomplish result with the pc so you must keep the channel in good repair what makes level in scientology is gradient scale of what communication can be entered in upon with the pc for instance at level 0 pc cant yet be talked to once you are reaching the pc and he is responding to you you can take up the goofiest solutions he has for his environment you are trying to alleviate his contest with his environment the fact that he is in contest with his environment barriers communication from his environment person solves his environment by withholding from it he will eventually solve the fact that he is being communicated to from his environment during auditing by moving you out of his environment the pc is having trouble with his environment he is not having trouble with you therefore you cant be part of his environment you are thus longer part of his normal environment hence he will talk to you even if to one else he says there are human beings and i dont want anything to do with them and then there are auditors they are different so the auditor takes on holy proportions this seems to be the real explanation of transference similarly attacks on scientology make scientology supernatural to justify their overts on us scientologists cant be considered normal people or the overts would not be justified the melbourne inquiry goes along this way the organization has taken on supernatural aura if you can reach and talk to people when others cant you will immediately assume some special status with the pc who is aware of this dont bother to deal with this issue with the pc unlike psychoanalysis which dwells on the transference once you have your communication line in use it to handle whatever contests the pc has going with the environment you can use whatever you know of the communication formula to get some communication established then gradiently improve it and move into other processes just getting into comm with the pc is likely to give him some benefits but dont stop with that communication isnt the endall it is merely the channel now you are set up to do something for the case scientology is the only discipline that can uniformly 1 accomplish comm line 2 use it to increase communication and then 3 do something for the individual dont stop when you establish communication even though the mere establishment of comm line is beneficial the pc will look better around you because he is in arc with you so dont forget that he may still be batty around others if you dont do something for the pc you may find that while he is calm and sane in your vicinity he is just as nutty in his environment as ever you may feel that you have cured his battiness when it is only resolved around you so you dont believe him when he talks about how bad life is dont make the mistake of saying ive cured him because i can now talk to him all you have done is to set him up to now do something for him communication is the beginning not the end now after establishing communication you must find out what in his environment is dangerous and menacing and what means he is using to combat these elements you shouldnt use problems and solutions too long beyond the opening part of the case or you will restimulate the problems and solutions in his gpms problems and solutions isnt the basis of his activities with his environment at all it is what the pc does to solve his environment that keeps him obsessed and pinnedin against the hostile elements in his environment how do you know that you havent handled the pcs ptp he is going to do something about it so it is not handled that is the biggest index you have so you want to find what the individual is continuously doing in his environment this falls under the heading of ow not problems because the more he does about the problem he is stuck in the more he will be obsessed by it and the more he will be stuck what brings about an undue concentration on subject and conviction that person has tremendous conflict with his environment it is because he doing something about it all the time for instance person who is hung up on the must be doing something to or about the this lifetime persons way of fighting some part of the environment can take innumerable forms he feels that he had better not communicate with the environment because he is going to commit overts he is mucking up his communication with the environment therefore because his communication with the environment is series of overts so therefore he has to not communicate with the environment because it is an overt against the environment so he had better have some kind of wild solution so he wont have to communicate with his environment in summary 1 an individual keeps doing things to solve his environment this doingness amounts to continuous series of overts 2 so the individual considers that his communicating with the environment is an overt 3 therefore he has to stop communicating with the environment 4 so he develops wild solutions so that he wont have to communicate with the environment like not looking this is not at the communication level it is just riding on the comm line the individual has put up screen against tigers so he cant see the tigers he just knows that he has to fight in that direction this may take different forms eg never looking in that direction someone who doesnt look at something has something there that he is doing something to or about he does lowlevel overts because he is afraid that he will do highlevel overts the bank is manufactured in such way that 1 the individual is forced to commit overts 2 he gets in trouble after committing those overts people are kept insane because the bank enforces commitment of overts and insures insanity if the individual does commit overts even if the individual didnt have bank he would get into trouble by committing overts because committing overts violates the communication formula this is above the bank there are two mechanisms above the bank 1 the communication formula cf axiom 51 2 ow that puts the auditor in the driver seat early on because he has two things that are superior to all the aberration that the pc can muster ow is one of the frail spots of auditors you would expect the perpetuators of any trap to talk lot about invasion of privacy and how people should keep their withholds so they seize emeters the most craziness is at the door to sanity auditors reticence in pulling withholds is based on fear of breaking down the communication channel they preserve communication so well that they never do anything with it an auditor can pussyfoot on getting overts from pc because he wants to preserve the comm line but he hasnt done anything with it the fact is that if the pc is pinned into something he must have originated something that got him connected to the thing then once he is pinned to it he gets into an obsessive do to straighten it all out this gives him more worries when person is pinned he thinks that he can unpin himself by more doing actually he can unpin himself by stopping obsessive doing anyone can get caught in this mechanism since it is the basic mechanism of entrapment what the individual originally did may not have been intentional but he starts having to do more and more to handle it sometimes the doingness in resisting thing is to blow having failed to handle it so if the person cant leave physically he may for instance get groggy or show people that he shouldnt be allowed to stay around there are innumerable ways in which thetan can leave without leaving physically all the way down the neuroticpsychotic spiral for instance if one cannot leave marriage physically one may leave nonphysically complication stems from the number of ways in which thetan can leave without leaving physically for instance thetan can make others sorry they didnt let him leave he can appear nasty where he was happy before psychotherapy could be called study of ways of leaving without leaving physically so the sequence is 1 an individual commits overts asserted thereness 2 he commits more overts to get out of previous overts v 3 he invents solutions to not leaving asserted notthereness all this occurs on comm channels being on comm line it is resolved by communication ow regretted reach or action and the communication formula are senior to the bank the bank boobytraps this the word withhold is in the bank so you shouldnt use it it is too restimulative and gives false ta ie ta unrelated to discharge by virtue of just moving banks around in running withholds therefore substitute for withhold what the pc didnt say use what havent you said one of the principal factors that you bat your head against in case is the inability of case to admit any action or take any responsibility for action if case can take responsibility for any action ever committed that case has had it thats any act not just an overt act lost soul thats being shredded between the worlds with soundless wail is the person who can take responsibility for any action he has ever done that is where case ceases to be in range of any assistance the case must be able to take some responsibility for some action in order to be salvageable this makes those things that you cant talk to pretty irresponsible doesnt it well they are i can imagine conversation if you could achieve one with spider the utter irresponsibility of any action ever undertaken by the spider would be amazing inability to communicate is an index of irresponsibility as the ability to communicate drops out responsibility for action as factor falls and vice versa they rise and fall together stutterer has some deteriorated area of communication and therefore deteriorated area of responsibility madman is as mad as you cant get into communication with him the biggest problem with the madman is how you can get in comm with him what gradient of comm to use and how you put it to him that you want to find out what part of his environment he can be responsible for you could get in comm with him one way or another he would eventually differentiate you from the rest of the environment then you would have to find out where guy is stuck and what he is stuck in then find what responsibility can he take for his own actions in that zone or area expand that perimeter and you would return his sanity all you are interested in at lower levels is responsibility for own actions or responsibility for lack of actions the real difficulty is the getting into comm and really finding what he would take responsibility for an undercut would be to get done by reason of placement where have you been that you know you have been even though communication is in the bank the formulas of communication are superior to the reactive bank responsibility is also superior to the bank it is the woof and warp of being thetan the questions are can you decide to do something and do it can you be somewhere at will can you be in or out of something on your own determinism the overtmotivator sequence is not an ultimate truth but it goes out as consideration higher than any other consideration it is still truth after other things have become lies before it becomes lie it gives you all levels of processing and cases from level iv on down if youve got those two factors communication and responsibility youve got all lower levels of processing there is real reason for you to be in the dark about why you are not making progress with case whatever other factors are present these factors are more present there is one thing that gets in your road someone can have gpm keyed in to such degree that it is driving him round the bend at lower levels you had better leave it alone lrh has tried reading pc list of words that might be causing the condition if one read lrh told the pc that that word was an integral part of the reactive bank that was influencing him and the pc ceased to be obsessively worried this is bit dangerous though if person is glibly telling you what he has done in an area it may be that he is not really taking responsibility for that the rebuttal in this case is to get the pc to explain at length how he has not really done this thing eventually it begins to dawn on him how he did have something to do with it this is an indirect approach to lowerlevel case you cant run it too long because it is an outofarc process at little higher level you could run what reasons did you have for doing that as long as you dont let him get into inventing them
