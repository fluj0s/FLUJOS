the operation and maintenance procedures relevant to the interconnection between the pstn and plmn 1 2 it is essential that any malfunction of the interconnection be rectified promptly 1 3 each party accepts the responsibility to ensure that its own staff adheres to the agreed principles and procedures laid down in this appendix 1 4 additional operation and maintenance procedures for poils as well as all cofls are defined within appendix 5 2 0 definitions 2 1 interconnection service desk isd telkom and mtn shall establish one isd each to which all factors relevant to the proper functioning of the interconnection generally of technical nature are to be reported this desk will also deal with all faults relating to cofls and poils the isd should be staffed on 24 hour basis and equipped with necessary infrastructure to facilitate efficient communication each party will be responsible for processing reported faults using its own procedures any inter service assistance required shall be requested through the isd each isd is obliged to offer its full assistance for rectification of interconnection faults each isd will be the traffic controlling party for the circuit on which it loads outgoing traffic isd contact telephone numbers are contained in separate document and are to be updated by the isds as and when changes occur 2 2 cataleptic failure of interconnection sudden failure persisting for longer than 10 seconds which is characterised by complete inability to perform all required functions of any item in the interconnection32 3 partial failure of interconnection any failure other than cataleptic failure which affects more than 15 of the total number of ports port is the interface between the exchange equipment on the one hand and the environment on the other hand 2 4 interconnection outages the duration of cataleptic or partial failures of any of the components included in the interconnection are termed outages these outages could be planned or unplanned all interconnection outages must be reported to all isd 2 5 installation attendance staffed building is defined as building where technically competent person is present with the correct test equipment spares and tools to clear the fault at the time the fault is reported to the isd if the above requirements are not met then the building is considered unstaffed the parties have to inform each others isd about the staffing of relevant buildings 3 0 fault handling and rectification procedures 3 1 cessation and recovery of service 3 1 1 outages caused by cataleptic or partial failures in the interconnection 3 1 1 1 unplanned outages upon detection of an unplanned outage relevant isds must be notified at the time of notification the outage could have ceased to exist or could still be persisting in cases where the outage has ceased to exist the isds will note the occurrence duration and details of the failure immediate action must be taken to localise the fault causing the failure and consequently identify which party is responsible for clearing the fault where this is unclear at first in cases where the outage persists relevant isds must be informed every 15 minutes or at mutually agreed upon intervals thereafter by the responsible party of the4progress of the repair until restoration of full service whereupon the isd will note the outage duration and details of the failure 3 1 1 2 planned outages planned outages must be kept to an absolute minimum and should not be carried out during busy traffic times the party planning such an outage must inform the other affected isds 14 days in advance by mutual agreement this time scale can be reduced and mutually agree upon suitable time and expected duration for such an outage if the planned outage does not directly affect the other parties their isds should be informed of the planned time of the outage during the planned outage the responsible party must keep the other isds informed at regular intervals with the progress until full restoration of service whereupon the isds will note the outage duration if the items are not restored to full service within the expected duration the outage will be regarded as an unplanned outage occasioned by planned outage and the procedure above for dealing with unplanned outages will be followed 3 1 1 3 fault history each party shall maintain records preferably electronic containing details of all faults and the corresponding restoration times which were handled between it and the other isds for running twelve month period these records should be used to assess the fault performance of the interconnection 3 1 2 other external influences which could affect interconnection service 3 1 2 1 international service the pstn operator must inform all isds immediately of major failures which could degrade international telephone service to any particular destinations by more than 50 g failure of satellite or undersea cables international exchange etc isds must be informed of restoration of service and details of the failure 3 1 2 2 inter primary service the pstn operator must inform all isds immediately of major failures which could degrade pstn inter primary telephone service between nodes by more5than 50 g transmission media failure exchange failure etc isds must be informed of restoration of service and details of the failure 4 0 maintenance procedures 4 1 maintenance methodology it is accepted that certain scheduled preventive and unscheduled maintenance actions will be carried out by the parties on the items comprising the interconnection where such actions could affect the proper functioning of the interconnection g working on critical centralised equipment isds should be informed accordingly in the case of scheduled maintenance the schedule of critical activities must be made available to isds in advance it would not be necessary to inform the isds of completion of such activities if however the maintenance action results in cataleptic or partial outage the procedure in paragraph 3 1 1 above should be followed 4 2 routine testing all parties shall supply each other test numbers to be used for test calls for routine testing of the interconnection circuits the parties agree to use artificial traffic generators in such way so as not to unduly load the interconnection 4 3 system and circuit identification generic system and circuit identification shall be communicated by telkom to mtn for mapping to its own generic system and circuit identification scheme 4 4 interconnection circuit utilisation details the parties may where required exchange records of utilisation and call connection performance over the interface to ensure that service over the interface is maintained at satisfactory levels information regarding planned dates for route augmentation shall also be exchanged between the parties whenever necessary 4 5 malicious call tracing authorised malicious call tracing may be requested by any of the isds the other party shall give priority to the request64 6 access to plmn sites housing transmission line terminating equipment when faults on the transmission links connecting the msc and poi are reported mtn agrees to provide access or assistance to telkom maintenance personnel at these sites during testing and repair of the fault telkom cannot be held responsible for long outages due to lack of reasonable access or assistance at the plmn sites 5 0 other issues 5 1 escalation procedure for operational matters in all cases of outages or interaction between mtn and telkom during operation and maintenance activities an escalation procedure is applicable if the service levels agreed to in appendix 2 are not adhered to the matter may be escalated to the next level in the organisation as agreed upon according to the general escalation procedure 5 2 software upgradesmodifications software version enhancements must be initially introduced and tested between mtn and telkom at test exchanges to ensure that there are interworking problems before introduction into an active exchange minimum of two weeks written notice must be given before testing can commence this notice of the requirement to test must go via telkoms appointed person unless otherwise agreed in writing between the parties 30 day lapse between software upgrade in any msc or telkom switching unit and the general release into the rest of the network is required controllable number of software patches should be activated in any 24 hour period on the same switching unit the testing of such patches will be by mutual agreement in writing all applications and tests must be completed in low traffic periods i between 22 00 and 05 00 or by mutual agreement in writing 5 3 service reviews whenever required but not less frequently than every six months meetings are to be held between the three isds to review the performance of the interconnection and operational information

point codes is also addressed in the section relating to numbering 2 routing principles 2 1 routing from telkom to mtn the catchment areas within the pstn served by any poi shall be mutually agreed upon between the parties concerned calls from within the agreed pstn catchment area will be routed over the pstn to the appropriate poi in accordance with the pstn routing plan at not less than the service levels and grade of service agreed to in appendix 2 section 4 2 2 routing from mtn to telkom according to mutual agreement mtn will route calls to the poi as defined in the routing tables supplied by telkom these tables will define first choice and alternate routing for specified pstn dial codes in the event of loss of circuits forming route rerouting to poi which is within the same pstn metropolitan exchange area as the first choice poi will be allowed rerouting to poi in different metropolitan exchange area may only be done on mutual agreement in writing 2 3 abnormal conditions the rerouting of traffic under abnormal conditions will be according to the alternate routing indicated in the routing tables supplied by telkom as for 2 2 above it is agreed to inform the other party of such rerouting undertaken in the event of severance of routes when only portion of route has failed traffic should continue to be offered to the remaining portion of that route before overflowing to latter choice routes in the event of the available capacity on the designated alternative routes being insufficient to handle all the overflow traffic then eacheither operator must contact the other to seek agreement to route the remainder of the traffic through its own network to an alternative poi the predefined prescribed arrangements and3details of the information to be handed over in such an event will be encompassed in document to be drawn up by the appropriate subcommittee in the event that the predefined routing arrangements for abnormal conditions cannot be implemented due to exceptional circumstances within the pstn telkom will provide details of the alternative arrangements which are to be implemented in their place 2 4 route diversity and security arrangements for reliability signalling links must be provisioned over physically diverse transmission paths andor equipment where such exists any deviation from this rule must be negotiated and agreed to in writing between telkom and mtn telkom undertakes that the following rules will apply with respect to service levels these will be assessed over any accounting period 1 at service level of 99 5 there will not be need for diversity in any form 2 at service level of 99 9 telkom shall provide transmission equipment diversity but not necessarily route diversity 3 for the 99 95 service level then telkom shall provide transmission equipment and route diversity the above rules would not incur extra costs to mtn and any change to them must be discussed between the parties all 2 mbits systems carrying ccs 7 signalling links between mscs andor the pois shall be clearly marked in the switching and transmission equipment rooms so as to prevent any unnecessary maintenance activities the minimum number of links per link set shall be two any number of links per link set however exceeding 2 shall be negotiated between mtn and telkom all circuit conditioning equipment such as pads and echo cancellers must be removed from the signalling links4accordance with ccitt recommendations 164 and 163 the international access code will also be sent 3 6 ccs 7 spc numbering 3 6 1 general the numbering of the signalling points and the networks is interrelated by the signalling point code spc and the network indicator nl for the purpose of convenience and security it is proposed that each telecommunications network have an independent signalling point code spc numbering scheme and one single numbering scheme where the interconnecting signalling points are defined this will have the effect where each telecommunications network is responsible for the internal spc numbering of its telecommunications network without being subjected to demands by other telecommunications systems 3 6 2 identification of telecommunications networks 3 6 2 1 subservice field ssf or network indicator nl the subservice field or network indicator is part of the service information octet sio the network indicators are defined in ccitt as follows bits d and c network indicator 0 0 international network inato 0 1 spare inat1 1 0 national network nato 1 1 reserved for national use nat1 where bits and b are not presently used ie spare6e the next three bits shall determine the operator in the areas ie 001 telkom 010 mtn the remaining four combinations will be reserved for future operatorsservices f the next four bits can determine the switching unit maximum of 15 g the last three bits will be by default set to zero until such time as their use is required 3 6 3 4 it is possible for signalling points in different telecommunications systems to have the same opc and dpc numbers ie pstn and plmn but the difference is shown in nat code in the subservice field of the service information octet9appendix 5

order for specified link contact will be required between telkom and mtn for the purposes of carrying out detailed planning and project management such detailed planning and project management will involve the accommodation and location of telkom transmission equipment on mtns premises and towers the availability of dc and ac power and the accessibility of the premises and towers for the installation of equipment at the time of placing an order mtn shall indicate who the contact person is as well as provide contact information 2 3 from telkoms side such contact will be done at regional level by appointed regional coordinators 2 4 where transmission equipment is to be located on mtns premises or towers for the purposes of providing fixed link such accommodation the necessary dc and ac power 3 ohm earth and lightning protection for the transmission equipment must be made available at least 60 days prior to the date the fixed link is required to be in service and at cost to telkom in addition mtn must ensure that telkom personnel have full accessibility to the site as from the date that the order for specified link is placed 2 5 accommodation at mtns premises or towers for the location of transmission equipment for the purposes of providing fixed link must be based on telkoms technical instruction h1041 installation of pcm equipment at customers premises 2 6 for the purposes of long term planning within telkom mtn must provide telkom with its two year forecast for specified link requirements on the first working day of each calendar year such information which must be forwarded to the telkom appointed person must include the quantity and point to point location of specified links as well as an as accurate as possible indication of the month within particular year that such specified links will be required63 0 operations and maintenance procedures 3 1 reporting of faults service problems related to the transmission links provided to mtn shall be reported to telkoms isd as described in appendix 3 telkom and mtns isd shall also be timeously informed of planned outages on transmission links and both parties shall agree upon suitable time and the expected duration of such an outage the telkom isd will report faults proven into the transmission links to the responsible transmission maintenance section of telkom according to internal fault reporting procedures recurring faults in the case of recurring or intermittent faults the parties will undertake all reasonable measures to find and clear the fault by means of special investigations and permanent monitoring of the relevant circuits 3 2 access to plmn sites housing transmission line terminating equipment when faults on the transmission links to plmn sites are reported mtn must provide access or assistance to telkom maintenance personnel at these sites during testing and repair of the fault telkom cannot be held responsible for outages due to lack of reasonable access or assistance at plmn sites 3 3 escalation procedures in all cases of outages on transmission links provided to mtn the escalation procedure as agreed upon in the network contract and escalation procedure document is applicable 3 4 after hours repair service the same fault reporting procedure as described above will also be followed after hours an additional fee as published from time to time by telkom will be charged for after hours repairs there will be additional charge for faults reported after hours but repaired during normal hours7the after hours repair service will be rendered during the following hours mondays to fridays from 17 00 until 7 30 the next day weekends from fridays 17 00 until 7 30 on mondays public holidays from 17 00 on the preceding working day until 7 30 on the next working day 3 5 operational standards for fixed transmission links the parties shall endeavour to adhere to the standards for the operation of the transmission links provided to mtn as specified by ccitt recommendation g 821 or subsequent recommendations that may become relevant provided they are mutually agreed upon in writing between the parties i m 2100 series of ccitt recommendations adherence to these standards is intended to ensure that the quality of messages passing between the pstn and the plmn and between the plmn sites is such as to afford satisfaction to the senders and recipients of those messages 3 6 service levels on cofls 3 6 1 availability when applying for cofls mtn will specify one of three levels of availability i 99 5 99 9 or 99 95 that will be assessed over particular accounting period the availability figure will exclude failures that occur after hours if mtn does not make use of the after hours repair service referred to in clause 3 4 or when failures cannot be repaired due to lack of access or assistance at plmn sites circuit is deemed to be unavailable when there is either data throughput for period greater than 10 seconds or when the error ratio exceed 103 for more than 10 consecutive seconds the availability figure should not be used to assess the short term quality of the cofls until such time that the availability can be measured continuously with dedicated surveillance equipment the availability for the routes will be calculated by using the time from when fault is reported to the telkom isd to when it is cleared only faults due to failures of telkom equipment or telkom working party involvement or 50 of8the outage time due to faults which are cleared as fault found will be taken into account when calculating route availability the service level or availability will be calculated per route for the purpose of determining installation and rental fee discounts on cofls and the determination of service levels on such cofls route is defined as group of 2 mbits systems used to connect 2 elements within the same telecommunications network or between 2 elements in different telecommunications networks notwithstanding the physical routing of the systems further in the case of 1 msc connected to multiple pois such pois will be considered to be 1 element 4 0 transmission fixed link testing and commissioning procedures 4 1 introduction this is preservice test program to ensure that the parties agree on the acceptable performance of the 2 mbits link before commissioning the aim of this programme is to determine the preservice test points types of tests to be performed and the duration of the tests 4 2 digital performance parameters the analysis outlined below has been based on ccitt recommendations g 821 m 550 m 555 and m 557 4 2 1 brief outline of the analysis used the error performance objectives used for international isdn connections as defined in g 821 are the performance classifications of errored seconds severely errored seconds ses an degraded minutes dm these performance objectives are then apportioned according to the length of the link in order to obtain the acceptable performance limits for an international digital connection9the m 550 recommendation finds it more realistic to consider the error performance of system as independent of the length but dependent on equipment density and recommends that the g 821 performance objectives for international paths be apportioned as detailed in 4 2 3 below 4 2 2 g 821 error performance objectives for international isdn connections severely errored seconds ses 0 1 errored seconds 8 degraded minutes dm 10 4 2 3 national networks apportionment ad 500 km 2 0 500 km d 1000 km 3 0 1000 km d 2500 km 4 0 2500 km d 5500 km 6 0 d 5500 km 8 0 4 3 calculation of error allocation the error performance of the path is now defined by the reference performance objectives rpo which is the maximum permissible degradation allocation to each parameter ses dm over period of one month for example for national primary rate digital path nprdp of 500 km rpoes3 0x8 0 rpo ses 3 0 x 0 1 rpo dm 3 0 x 10 0 to minimise maintenance intervention m 550 recommends that an ageing margin of 0 5 is introduced into the objectives which now gives the bring into service objectives biso biso 0 5 x rpo x time10where time duration of the test the bring into service objectives apply only to monitoring period of one month or more in many cases this is impractical in order to monitor the performance of the system over shorter period g 24 hours and still be sure that the long term objectives biso will be met two threshold levels s1 and s2 are introduced the values of s1 and s2 are chosen so that if the measured performance of the link over 24 hours period is below the s1 value then we can be 95 confident that the long term objectives for the link will be met if however the measured performance of the link over 24 hours period is above the s2 value then we can be 95 confident that the long term objectives will not be met s1 biso2 biso s2 biso 2 biso the bring into service limits bisl of the link are determined for shorter periods of time by bisl biso x time x s1 bislses biso sesx time xs1 bisl dm biso dm x time x s1 4 4 jitter jitter parameters will be measured according to g 823 at bit rate of 2 mbits the tests involved are input jitter tolerance limits are given in table 2 of recommendation g 823 maximum output jitter in the absence of input jitter limits are given in table 1 of g 823 and the jitter transfer characteristics all tests are done on an end to end basis the jitter at all interfaces must be measured and should conform with the maximum permissible levels given in table 1 of g 823114 5 test duration all 2 mbits ports will be tested for 24 hours thereafter the first 2 mbits tributary on multiplexer will be tested for 24 hours to verify the basic transmission at tributary level the other tributaries will then be tested for much shorter duration to verify continuity and to check performance quickly 4 6 test procedure 4 6 1 preservice test points will be the test and patch frame associated with telkom equipment the tests will be performed end to end with the equipment in 120 ohm terminated mode using pseudorandom sequence according to ccitt recommendation q 151 4

vodacom 3 1 1 permanent services 99 95 99 90 99 50 99 30 3 1 2 temporary services as provided for in clause 11 4 of the agreement 99 50 99 30 3 2 the provision of cofls at specific service level is dependent on the minimum configurations specified in clause 4 below 3 3 service levels are only applicable to cofls that have undergone proper acceptance testing to the satisfaction of both parties as determined in clause 4 of appendix 5 existing cofls will on the date that this appendix enters into force be deemed to have been properly tested and accepted 3 4 if difficulties arise due to travelling time from maintenance centres to network elements telkom may determine that service level of 99 3 shall apply vodacom may either accept or reject such determination if rejected service

links between two network elements telkom will removenot install its protection switching equipment telkom will still provide the cofls over 2 or 3 physically diverse routes as detailed in clause 4 3 hereof and vodacom shall not transmit more than 100 of the traffic capacity of the cofls over the cofls as ordered in accordance with the table in clause 4 3 hereof the service level of the individual point topoint links in the cofls will be 99 5 the tariffs for the cofls will still be charged at service level of 99 95 but vodacom will receive further discount of 5 on the monthly rental for the cofls in this case 4 5 daisy chains each of the cofls connecting the network elements in daisy chain configuration shall be considered to have service level of 99 5 unless service level of 99 9 or 99 95 is specifically requested for specific cofl in the daisy chain in which event the specified service level shall apply2lepse 47 to that particular cofl only each cofl in the daisy chain must be provided over diverse routes and diverse equipment from every other cofl in the daisy chain for reliability purposes any deviation from this rule must be negotiated and agreed to in writing between the parties necofl 1necofl 2necofl 3necofl 4ne cofl 5 5 measurement of service levels 5 1 until such time as the availability can be measured continuously with dedicated surveillance equipment the measurement of service levels will be based on the manual method of logging all reported faults at the telkom isd 5 2 the service level of cofls will be measured in terms of the availability of each individual cofl and will be assessed separately for each calender month 5 3 the service level will be measured per cofl irrespective of the number of links used to provide the cofl 5 4 the first period of assessment of newly installed cofl sh all commence on the first day of the calendar month in which the link is installed 5 5 the last period of assessment of cofl cancelled by vodacom shall end on the last day of the last full calendar month during which such link effectively ceases to be in service 5 6 when cofl has been upgraded to higher service level the availability of such cofl shall continue to be measured in accordance with its former service level until the last day of the calendar month during which such cofl was upgraded and be measured in accordance with its new service level as from the first day of the calendar month following such upgrade 5 7 when cofl has been downgraded to lower service level the availability of such cofl sh all be measured in accordance with its new service level as from the first day of the calendar month during which such cofl was downgraded 5 8 where number of cofls are affected by the same fault the unavailable time will be recorded against each individual cofl 5 9 service levels will be measured at both vodacoms and telkoms isd by logging unavailable time for each cofl on monthly basis per calendar month these figures will be reconciled weekly cofl is deemed to be unavailable when there is either data throughput for period greater than 10 seconds or when the error ratio exceeds 103 for more than 10 consecutive seconds85 10 unavailable time is defined as the time from when fault is reported to telkoms isd to the time when the service is restored either by repair of the cofl or patching to an alternate links and the vodacom isd has been notified that the service has been restored for example if cofl had two outages of 60 and 15 minutes respectively reported during given month the availability or service level for that month is calculated as availability 1 minus total outage time in minutes divided by total minutes in month multiplied by 100 1 75 30 x 24 x 60 x 100 99 83 for practical purposes all calculations will be based on 30 day month irrespective of the actual number of days in particular calendar month i total minutes in month 30 x 24 x 60 43 200 5 11 allowable outage times per month for the service levels are therefore specified as follows service level 99 95 99 90 99 50 99 30allowable 21 6 43 2 216 0 302 4outage minutes minutes minutes minutestime per per per perper month month month month month 5 12 the availability figure will exclude the following times elapsed time from when the fault is reported to the telkom isd after hours until the start of the following business day if vodacom elects not to make use of telkoms after hours repair service b the time lost in the case where repairs are started during normal hours stopped after hours and resumed the following business day with the consent of vodacom c the time lost when failures cannot be repaired due to lack of access to vodacom sites andor lack of assistance from vodacom d the time lost due to vodacoms isd not being available to receive fault clear report the time lost due to planned outages scheduled maintenance as provided for in clause 3 1 1 2 of appendix 3 as well as planned outages due to the relocation of cofls on the same premises where the planned outage time exceeds the agreed time frames the extra time will be regarded as outage time to be added to the unavailability time of cofl unless vodacoms isd agrees to the extension of the planned outage time where planned outage time is requested less than 14 days before the planned outage unscheduled maintenance the outage time will be added to the unavailability time of cofl unless the vodacoms isd agrees to this short notice planned outage95 13 only faults due to failures of telkom equipment or telkom working party involvement or 50 of the outage time due to faults cleared as fault found will be taken into account when calculating individual cofl availability 5 14 clause 21 of the agreement force majeure will be applicable to the repair of faults and the measurement of service levels 6 penalties and incentives 6 1 telkom will pay vodacom monthly penalty per cofl as determined with reference to the table in clause 6 3 below when the cofls average availability over calendar month is below the agreed service level for that cofl the penalty is limited to maximum of 100 of the monthly rental for that cofl the basic principle being that penalties may not exceed the actual amount received by telkom in payment for each cofl 6 2 vodacom will pay telkom monthly incentive per cofl as determined with reference to the table in clause 6 3 below when the cofls average availability over calender month is above the agreed service level for that cofl the total monthly incentive for all cofls leased by vodacom is limited to 100 of the total monthly penalties for all cofls leased by vodacom and accumulation of penaltiesincentives will take place from one month to the next 6 3 the following penaltiesincentives per cofl will be payable by the parties when cofls average availability over calendar month is belowabove the agreed service level for that cofl service level 99 95 99 9 99 5 99 3penalty per minute when below

to cofls shall be reported to telkoms isd as described in appendix 3 the telkom isd will report faults relating to the telkom network to the relevant maintenance sections of telkom according to internal fault reporting procedures only faults in the telkom network may be reported to the telkom isd where reported faults are proven by telkom to be in the plmn fault location fee of r150 00 will be charged by telkom where faults are referred back to10vodacom by telkom but proven to be in the telkom network fee of r150 00 will be charged by vodacom 7 2 after hours repair service after hours fault reports will also be handled by the isd an additional fee of r640 00 provided that vodacom accepts the charge on each occasion will be charged for afterhours repairs only one after hours callout fee regardless of the number of telkom personnel involved will be charged per single fault reported to the telkom isd after hours the after hours repair service will be rendered during the following hours mondays to thursdays from 17 00 until 07 30 the next day weekends from fridays 16 30 until 07 30 on mondays public holidays from 17 00 on the preceding business day until 07 30 on the next business day 7 3 recurring faults for the purpose of this appendix recurring fault is defined as an instance where 3 faults are reported on the same cofl within sliding period of 3 months in the case of recurring fault telkom will take all reasonable measures to find and clear the fault by means of special investigations with the view to repair reroute or provide temporary alternate link if possible to d as recurring fault and provide information on the possible cause of the fault end the remedial action that is being 7 4 access to vodacom sites housing transmission line terminating equipment when faults on the cofls at vodacom sites are reported vodacom shall provide access andor assistance to telkom maintenance personnel at these sites during testing and repair of the fault 7 5 general escalation procedure general escalation procedure copy of which shall be furnished by both parties upon request will be established for all operation and maintenance activities and will contain contact telephone numbers that will be updated as and when changes occur 7 6 escalation procedures within telkom 7 6 1 cofl with service level of 99 95 which is unavailable for longer than 60 minutes will be classified as catastrophic failure and escalated to the area manager network business unit cofl with service level of 99 95 which is unavailable for longer than 216improve the quality of service telkom will report back to vodacom within 24 hours of fault being identified as recurring fault and provide information on the possible cause of the fault and the remedial action that is being planned11minutes will be escalated to the executive delivery network business unit 7 6 2 the above escalation procedure will also apply to cofls with service levels of 99 5 when an upgrade of single cofl from 93 5 to 99 95 is not achieved by telkom within 120 days after the receipt of an official request from vodacom for such an upgrade or when both parties agree that it is not feasible to install the additional equipment as provided for in clause 3 5 hereof b both parties agree that it is not feasible to install the additional equipment for new single 99 95 cofl as provided for in clause 3 6 hereof 8 telkom interconnection service desk isd 8 1 this clause expands the responsibilities of the telkom isd as defined in clause 2 1 of appendix 3 in order to facilitate the accurate
