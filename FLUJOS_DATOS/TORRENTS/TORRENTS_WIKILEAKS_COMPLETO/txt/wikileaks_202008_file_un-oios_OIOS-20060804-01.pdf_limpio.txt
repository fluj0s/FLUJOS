office accordin g to the unodc liaison officer the discussion focused on how unodc senior official 1s dual citizenship status would affect his plans to participate in the elections the unodc liaison officer told idoios that he had not discussed the relevant unit ed nations rules regarding staff member participating in political election inste ad he advised unodc senior official 1 to lodge an

the newspaper unodc senior official 1s application as candidat for the member state 2 election placed him in position where he was unable to ful fil his role as an international civil servant discharging his duties in truly independe nt and impartial manner as required by staff regulations 12 f and 12 h unodc seni or official 1 failed to preserve his impartiality as he was invoking his longstanding ex perience with the united nations and his standing as an international civil servant in order to further his political career thus placing responsibility for his personal political ctions on the united nations paragraph 44 of the standards of conduct for the internation civil service approved by the general assembly precludes staff members partic ipation in political activities such as standing for or holding local or national political office both unodc senior official 2s endorsement of unodc senior official 1s politi cal aspirations and the unodc liaison officers failure to appropriately advise f the potential issues arising from these aspirations reflects poorly on their judgment in th circumstances allegation 2 while at his post between 2001 and 2004 unodc senio r
