top secretcomintnoforn20291123 cne presence in ct10 status report authors snip intern 1lt ufouo executive summary ssirel usa fvey this paper discusses the work completed as of 1 april 2008 on the inclusion of cne data into the ct10 pilot project ct10 engaged two fronts in this effort first was the acquisition and alerting of active sigint into ct10 second was the design of an extension to the current ct10 data model to support further analytic development of cne data as result of this work ct10 now supports alerting of the establishment of new tao points of presence on the internet with respect to certain exploitation methodologies additionally this paved the road with internal and external partners for the continued development of the ct10 cne data model extension ssirel usa fvey specific conclusions and recommendations are contained at the close of this paper however three key points underpin majority of the information in this paper ufouo priority support to ct10 data acquisition efforts ufouo further building dnicne analytic and development team ssirel usa fvey development of strategic vision for use of cne data in ct10 ssirel usa fvey the first step in processing cne data is to identify and acquire cne data flows in order to route this information into ct10 this work presents its own unique challenges as described in the next section u current state derived from nsacssm 152 dated 20070108 declassify on 20291123 top secretcqmintnoforn20291123secretcomintrel to usa ufouo tao data flow acquisition fvey20291123 top secretcqmintnoforn20291123 ssirel usa fvey ct10 is ingesting single flow of cne data specifically foxacid log files this was identified as top priority by ct10 customers ghostwolf therefore it was chosen to be the first cne data flow to pursue after mapping the flow of foxacid data throughout nsa ct10 established flow of this data from protocol exploitation starting in the middle of february 2008 ssirel usa fvey because the cne data model extension had not been implemented at this time the only way to process foxacid logs was to fit the information into the current ct10 data model this was possible primarily because of the natural flexibility in the current model it was easy to define new event type within the ct10 ingestion system and populate events with all selectors pulled from the each foxacid event another benefit of the current model design was that it became easy to define new selector type for an implant id and easily integrate it into the system this allows implant ids to be added to watch lists and as target selectors so that ct10 users can track any events that are associated with defined set of implants therefore if ct10 acquired data flow containing implant callback information it would be easy to add this into the current data model giving analysts additional capability to follow implants deployed through foxacid ssirel usa fvey as result of this work the ct10 system is now alerting on foxacid exploitation activity through suite of alerting technologies this includes geolocational tipping in geo7 and alerting through agent logic irc and emails and the space dashboard ssirel usa fvey one conclusion reached from developing the foxacid ingestion code is that the current ct10 data model can support more cne data than previously believed as new cne flows are introduced into the system it may be possible to easily add them to the current data model if the extension is still not implemented ufouo near and long term goals for tao data flow acquisition ssirel usa fvey the near term goal regarding cne data flow into ct10 is to identify additional cne data flows that build off of the foxacid data based on the requirements of ghostwolf the immediate next step would be to acquire implant callback data flows this would allow analysts to track when their implants are calling back to listening posts for tasking and exfiltration the implants in question are validator olyumpus unitedrake and straitbizzare top secretcomintnofqrn20291123 top secretcqmintnoforn20291123 ssirel usa fvey after establishing this data flow the next step would be to ingest collected data from the implants this includes any exfiltrated files and implant plugin results with each new data flow ct10 analysts will have more complete picture of cne activity related to their targets however these types of data do not naturally fit into the current data model which is why the proposed extension is so important ssirel usa fvey additionally there are other cne datasets not created by tao that would be useful to ct analysts gollum partner implant is one such data set that ghostwolf has indicated that would be useful to ingest into ct10 radius logs isp dial up customer records are also an excellent source of information and create natural link between dnr and dni datasets u challenges i way ahead ssirel usa fvey there are number of challenges for securing further cne data from tao first given the complexity of tao data flow locating the ultimate data owner is challenging though everyone in tao ct10 has interacted with on data flow issues has been extremely helpful new cne flows have been established this is largely due to the fact that ct10 is not imbedded within the requirements generation process in tao additional transparency on tao data flow requirements will greatly ease this issue ssirel usa fvey one other issue that would greatly help other systems in using tao data is universal marking and classification of cne data in the case of foxacid there are native classification markings on the files and compartmented targets as well as fisa data have to be stripped out by tao before data is sent on to external customers such as ct10 as ct10 becomes pl3 accredited it becomes critical that ct10 ingests full foxacid records unfortunately the lack of unique marking and classification for each file creates additional challenges that complicate the oversight classification and policy surrounding cne data furthermore additional discussions with tao have indicated that this may be an issue for other data flows as well the addition of classification markings to tao data feeds would greatly assist all consumers of tao data with maintaining the proper security procedures ufouo tao engineers have worked towards creating an rdf database system that would house all of their information and make it available to external customers as this capability is developed ct10 could benefit greatly from becoming consumer of this data this system would address number of issues including the marking and classification challenge addressed in the previous paragraph top secretcomintnofqrn20291123 top secretcqmintnoforn20291123 ssirel usa fvey in summary the way ahead is to address these existing challenges in order to effectively push more tao data flows out to analysts in near real time ct10 should also remained synched with taos effort to develop and deploy the rdf database finally ct10 needs to implement the data model extension and move any currently ingested tao data into the new model top secretcomintnofqrn20291123
