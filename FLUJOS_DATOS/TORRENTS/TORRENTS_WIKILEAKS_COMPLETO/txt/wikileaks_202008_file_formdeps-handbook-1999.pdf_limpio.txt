mobilization process is divided into five phases as follows 1 phase i planning this phase includes the normal daytoday efforts of each unit at its hsduring this phase units plan train and prepare toaccomplish assigned mobilization missions theyprepare mobilization plans and files as directed bystarcs rscs and formdeps attendmobilization coordination conferences providerequired planning data to

alert this phase includes all those actions taken by unit following receipt of theofficial alert specific tasks and standards are listedin this regulation the unit takes specific actions toprepare for transition from rc to active statusactions such as screening and cross leveling areessential during the alert phase unit commandershould attempt to contact gaining unit commanderespecially if gaining

phase ends with the effectivedate of mobilization of the unit at hs 3 phase iii home station this phase begins on the effective date of the unit mobilization oncemobilized units have 72 hours to be ready to move totheir ms actions taken at this point includeinventory and loading of unit property and dispatch ofthe advance party to the ms during this phase theunit takes action to speed its transition to activestatus specific tasks and standards are listed in thefollowing chapters and annexes of this regulationmovement from hs to ms will be by the most expeditious and practical means

base support units at thebeginning of phase iv actions at ms include theprocessing of personnel and equipment and the actualaccessioning of the unit into the active structure thegoal of the unit during this phase is to attainoperational readiness status in the shortest possibletime consistent with its planned deployment oroperational mission this phase also includes anynecessary individual or collective training as well asappropriate crossleveling actions soldier readinessprocessing srppreparation for overseasmovement pom and validation for deploymentphase iv ends with arrival of the unit

this phase ends withdeparture of personnel and equipment from the poe b this document is designed as how to handbook to assist the unit commander during phasesi ii and iii of mobilization once the

of the conusa or of the ac affiliateforscom regulation 50033 10division if the latter is not already deployed in the former case the unit should take direction from thems commander and his staff because unitrequirements and ms operations vary it isimpractical to attempt to specify the tasks andstandards required in phase iv and phase v thecommander must take the initiative to make thenecessary coordination and arrangements with theappropriate ms agencies to provide for housingtraining logistics and other support to bring his unitto combat ready status as soon as possible
