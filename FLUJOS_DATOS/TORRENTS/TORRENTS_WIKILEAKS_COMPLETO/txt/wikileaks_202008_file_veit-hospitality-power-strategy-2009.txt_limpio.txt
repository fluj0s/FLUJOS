date wed 19 jan 2005 020751 0100 from veit kuehne to veit subject hc democracy and strategy hi friends ah how much fun to read all those long messages this is discussion that will come again and again as long as the club will exist and it is fun i will try to share some comments on some of your points impossible to say something about everything i invite you to dresden to discuss more and in detail over beer if you wish most of you have already perfectly expressed my own thoughts so dont have to repeat them thanks lot i will save and recycle those texts when the discussion comes up again in the future luckily i can recycle text from myself i wrote for jeanyves some time back here you go put online something not approve by veit you or some commitee i know veit doesnt like this word but with 11000 members may be we will soon need more structure it is not the word i really mean it there will never be any commitee for taking decisions as long as i am onboard in the club and am involved in it and since i am quite young it might take 50 years seriously since the beginning this is one of my most important dogmas for the hc official structure for decision taking i will always discuss issues openly with the people involved and with knowledge to come to good decisions that are the best for the network but the final decision will always be with i know this sounds harsh especially when coming from democratic network like servas but i see it as the only way to keep power struggles manipulation inefficiency out of the club who will chose any commitee how to make sure they really think about the best for the club how to avoid struggles between them i dont want to waste any time and energy with that the club from this angle really just is an internet platform to bring people together and we dont need any commitee to take decisions matter whether there are 1000 11000 or 1000000 members the benefit is that we can take quick decisions and dont waste energy in power struggles as long as i dont go crazy or stop listening to peoples opinion this decision making process will work if you only meant that we need more structure in asense of organizing the work i absolutely agree i am more and more getting used to the role of organizing the specialized teams of volunteers who take care of hc issues independently and of course i will not be involved in every decision there so the above only holds true for debatable decisions as more people become active i can give up more control just the way it should be for example i really trust claudio in all those speed improvements and dont have the check or be involved in any way thank god adding few things to that to understand my stand point you have to realize that i founded the hc exactly as an alternative to servas which in my eyes is hindered so much by its pseudodemocratic setup so i vowed since the beginning that the hc will never go down this road to inefficiency if you want democratic hospitality exchange network become servas member try to get your ideas into reality there i promise you that it will be easier in the hc because we try to implement good sound ideas as quickly as possible all this democracy talk sounds so strict and harsh it is important to realize that i am happy to give up responsability for message checking for accepting members for translations etc etc thats the plan get more and more great volunteers onboard and hand them over some part of our network but i will not give up responsability for the hc as whole for many decades to come hopefully thats why i am reserving the final word in any really important or debated decisions for myself as tijs wrote notforprofit organisation does not need to be democratic to be able to integrate new members and motivate more people to involve thats the real challenge how to get people to contribute and here i always listen to all of you guys i know sometimes i am overburdened sometimes i make mistakes or let people wait too long but i know that this is not perfect and i am really striving to get better and better at it i know that the survival of the hc depends on our ability to motivate people to contribute and you can trust that i am smart enough to work on myself and my work routines where i see it is really needed and integrating new volunteers in good way really was big problem in the last months we are working on it another note we already did one very successful semidemocratic feedbackdecision thing when implementing the new navigation on top we announced it in the news presented several alternatives and asked for opinions after that i took those opinions weighed and counted them and finally took the seemingly most popular and thats what i always try to do involve many people listen to many opinions and then come to good decisions it seems to be working also i always try to listen to normal members to look over their shoulder when they use the club to read all feedback messages so i never make the mistake to just take the opinion of you valued key volunteers and this btw also solves the issue of key volunteers vs normal members all opinions are listened to maybe the key volunteers have more weight but only because i know and see they also care lot about our network and work lot on it to make it better and better about tijs suggestion to present better why we are doing things what we will do in the future the problem with that is that it often depends on programming that it is quite unpredictable at times but i agree that we need to find ways to integrate new or future volunteers better and this will be done in the volunteers group once way to send messages to all members of group has been programmed just bit of patience our communcation will improve there was some talk about my mindmap it basically is just way for to keep my thoughts and to do lists organized and of course i cannot put it online but many parts of it are online anyway the detailed volunteer info page is pretty much straight from my mindmap gerrit is also working with mindmap that used to be mine so please trust to efficiently manage my thoughts with that tool and to put those things onto the site that should be there coordinators i will write some more about this job in other messages thanks for the list pierre yahoogroup augustas we had yg before for key volunteers problem with it there are so many issues that have to be discussed among alwayschanging volunteers sometimes pierre has to tell gerrit valmi and something something kjell and gerrit etc etc that it really has proven more effective to use cc otherwise the email volume would rise and rise and we would spend all our days just reading hc mails and not actually working anymore last but not least let close with little anecdote when i was 18 i decided to run for city council in the town of herzberg i went 4 weeks every day from door to door listening to peoples suggestions what should be done better in town and introducing myself i filled whole little book with suggestions and at the end i knew what the people in town really wanted then i was elected but being from small party was the only one in city council so couldnt really make those suggestions reality now i have the hc and i can make many suggestions come true so you dont have to fear for moment that i will become stuckup or arrogant in that sense i will always listen and try to make people happy thats what i love doing allright although we have spent many valuable volunteerhours on this discussion it was probably good to have it as i said i will save some texts and use them again in the future feel free to discuss more and send more thoughts but i think it is better to continue this in real life now i will try to concentrate on getting all those 1680 messages in my inbox answered so you have less reason to complain and many future volunteers see that we indeed care about them you can help by accepting the hc the way it is taking piece of it and working on it trying to make it better thanks to those of you who have done so for months and years in the past greetings from the wonderful city of dresden germany veit ps i
