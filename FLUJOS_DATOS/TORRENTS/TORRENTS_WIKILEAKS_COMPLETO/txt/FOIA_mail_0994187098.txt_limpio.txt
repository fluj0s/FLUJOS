the discussion of this in the bilt meeting report that led to think this was envisioned in broadened version of the datun approach i thought the idea was that you would eventually use forward biologicalphysical model to scale up from given proxy an estimate of say precipitation or temperature for an atmospheric model gridpoint and use that to nudge say the slp or 500 mb field into particular configuration this is clearly more ambitious than what you are doing now and i suppose i was blurring the distinct efforts of nanne and colleagues with that of yours and colleagues i makes much more sense at present to only use statisticallybased upscaling of the proxy data the other possibility remains intriguing but we are certainly far off from doing that in my opinion as well im actually quite relieved to find out that i was wrong in assuming that this is the direction the datun approach was going thanks for the clarification mike at 0832 pm 7301 0200 you wrote hi folks forward models can only deal with weather proxy but we need proxy circulation if we had forward models and we should certainly strive to develop such models we could generate large data sets of consistent pairs weather proxy and then derive empirically neural nets the needed inverse relationship actually this method is used at our lab to evaluate the informational value of remotely sensed data about water quality in coastal seas but the inverse relationship is not processbased but necessarily phenomenological i think the need for forward models was spelled out in the report about he bilt meeting in 1999 see eos paper by weber and regards hans at 1352 030701 0400 michael mann wrote dear julie et then i apologizei thought the idea in datun was to at leat eventually incorporate physical or biologicallybased models of proxies into the upscaling effort in addition toin place of statistical upscaling there was lots of discussion of this and i recall hans early on having described to plans to use physical models of proxies in the process though i could be mistaken so i thought that was planned component of datun and the work that you described ie using empirical cca techniques was just preliminary empirical approach but from what martin and you have told this is not the case and there is plan in datum to use physicalbiological forward models of proxies if someone out there still believes this is not the case please let know otherwise the wording will be clarified to indicate that it is statistical and not physicalbiological model that is used to upscale the proxy information that simplifies things quite bit mike at 0718 pm 7301 0200 julie jones wrote hi mike im getting very confused now if you mean forward modelling by what i term upscaling this is done in exactly the same way as most other climate reconstructions ie calibrating proxy data against climate data using linear multivariate statistical methods in this case i use cca so has the same errors inherent in it as other reconstructions where proxy data has been calibrated against largescale climate or climate indices if your idea is that such largescale climate reconstructions may have additional uncertainties compared to local empirical models where proxy data are calibrated against local climate records i agree that this is so but i think this applies to all such nonlocal reconstructions so should maybe go in the paragraph which discusses reconstructions of regional climate variability to keep things consistent the additional potential source of error specific to the datun method compared to the other climate reconstructions whether local or largescale is in the nudging to assimilate the climate reconstructions obtained as above into the gcm which should probably go into the text so we could perhaps change the end of the paragraph to read this method is more resistant to biases specific to purely empirical or modelbased approaches but it is relatively untested using proxy data and prone to additional uncertainties in the nudging method used to assimilate the proxy data am i on the right track or have i missed something cheers julie dr julie m jones

all i am working on preparing final version of the workshop report based on julie cs revisions and comments thusfar recieved there is one instance below in which it seems especially important that we agree on the wording so i wanted to give you my revised wording now and let you comment on it if you see any problem the third approach represents hybrid of the first two it prescribes the dynamics of the system using model physics but aims to reproduce the historical climate evolution by nudging the model towards reconstructed climate estimates this method is more resistant to biases specific to purely empirical or modelbased approaches but it is relatively untested using proxy data and prone to additional uncertainties in the forward models employed to describe proxyclimate relationships i think the latter statement is important because the assumption in the forward model is not the same assumption as in empirical reconstructions i take slight issue w julie j in this regard the forward modeling makes some universal assumptions regarding eg tree growth patterns the empirical calibration approach calibrates the individual trees against local meteorologicalclimate records it doesnt make any universal assumptions though the local calibration may be flawed in other words were not saying that one method is better than the other but the potential pitfalls are definitely different i think this needs to be expressed hence my revised wording julie j should let know if there is problem w this since she and julie c spent some time parsing the wording on the paragraph in question thanks mike at 0743 pm 62801 0200 julie jones wrote hi julie yes that works although if i could ask for one extra word but it is also limited by potential cheers julie dr julie m jones institute for

for the author oversight i did not change that from mikes original which did not have you on it but he told you should be added i like all your suggestions i would alter the wording of the last one bit maybe to use somewhat fewer words does this work 68 words instead of 78 we are tight on space the third approach represents hybrid of the first two it prescribes the dynamics of the system using model physics but aims to reproduce the historical climate evolution by nudging the model towards reconstructed climate estimates this method is more resistant to biases specific to purely empirical or modelbased approaches but it is limited by potential instabilities in the proxyclimate relationships and is relatively untested using proxy data cheers julie dear all thanks julie and mike for your work on the paper i have just few sentences where i suggest alterations 1 first paragraph stateoftheart climate models are also being applied to analyze late holocene climate sensitivity upscale paleodata to largescale reconstructions and simulate proxies themselves i suggest changing to stateoftheart climate models are also being applied to analyze late holocene climate sensitivity assimilate largescale climate reconstructions from palaeodata and simulate proxies themselves 2 paragraph2 last sentence patterns of atmospheric circulation just as meteorological information is assimilated into numerical weather forecasting models von storch et 2000 i suggest changing to patterns of atmospheric circulation in conceptually similar way to the assimilation of meteorological information into numerical weather forecasting models weber and von storch 1999 von storch et 2000 the weber and von storch reference is already in the reference list 3 paragraph 3 the third approach represents hybrid of the first two it prescribes the dynamical evolution of the system from climate physics but is nudged toward the observed climate by the proxy data this method is more resistant to the biases specific to purely empirical or purely modelbased approaches but it is limited by potential instabilities in the proxyclimate relationships and by imperfections in the upscaling models and it is relatively untested using proxy data i would suggest changing to the following as the upscaling models are produced in exactly the same way as other climate reconstructions so there are extra imperfections in the upscaling models than in other climate reconstructions the third approach represents hybrid of the first two it prescribes the dynamics of the system using model physics but is aimed at reproducing the historical climate evolution by nudging the model states towards towards climate estimates obtained by the first approach although this approach also requires the stability assumption in the statistical models it is hoped that it is more resistant to the biases specific to purely empirical or purely modelbased approaches it is however relatively untested finally ive been missed off the list of authors and the address for hans and myself should be gkss research centre geesthacht best regards julie dr julie m jones institute for coastal research gkss forschungszentrum
