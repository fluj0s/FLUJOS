referring to montana and indiana 8 roper v simmons 112 sw3d 397 2003in 2002 the court revisited the constitutiona lity of capital punishment as applied to offenders with mental retardation in atkins v virginia 3 in atkins the us supreme court overruled its 1989 holding in penry v lynaugh4 and found that the execution of such individuals to be unconstitutional the court recognized recently established and evolving national consensus that quantifiable behavioral and cognitive limitations diminish the moral culpability of offenders w ith mental retardati on and consequently impact their appropriate punishme nt concerning these offenders with mental retardation the court specially stated because of their disab ilities in areas of reasoning judgment and control of their impulses however they do not act with the level of moral culpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal conduct5 some contend that the courts reasoning in atkins should apply with equal force to juvenile offenders juvenile offenders and ntally retarded offenders have been deemed by one legal scholar as the siamese twins of the death penalty their status inextricably linked in constitutional principle and substance6 however in footnote eighteen of the atkins majority opinion the court explicitly dis tinguished those with mental retardation from juveniles with respect to national c onsensus on application of the death penalty justice stevens noted that the list of states barring execution of those with mental retardation had grown by 16 states since the original 1989 penry holding however with specific reference to juve nile offenders he said comparison to stanford v kentucky in which he held there was national consensus prohibiting the execution of juvenile offenders over age 15 is telling although we decided stanford on the same day as penry apparently only two state legislatures have raised the threshold age for imposition of the death penalty7 state supreme court decision in 2003 the missouri supreme court held that the execution of juvenile offenders in missour i violates the evolving standards of decency and is prohibited by the eighth amendm ent ban on cruel and unusual punishment of the us constitution8 roper is an unusual case in the boldness of the ruling that preceded its presentation before the highes t court in the land the supreme court of missouri granted the petition of christopher s immons for relief from his upcoming execution in spite of the fact that the us supreme court has speci fically rejected the very grounds on

in roper the missouri supreme court followed the approach taken by the us supreme court in atkins and examined objective factors including 1 legislative action 2 fre quency of imposition of capital punishment on juveniles and the freque ncy with which the sentence is actually carried out 3 national and international opinion and 4 an inde pendent examination of whether the death penalty as applied to juveniles violates evol ving standards of decency and thus is barred by the eighth amendment9 the court noted that at the time stanford was decided 11 states banned the execution of juvenile offenders since stanford five more states have banned such executions10 the court opined that states have moved cons istently in the direction of opposition to the juvenile death penalty demonstrating that the standard of decency has evolved since stanford the court also noted that not single state had lowered the minimum age for execution from 18 during this time and many states have considered legislation to raise the minimum to 1811 the court noted that despite 22 states llowing the imposition of the death penalty on juveniles only 6 missouri texas virgin ia georgia oklahoma and louisiana have actually executed offenders since 1973 and that only three states t exas virginia and oklahoma since 199312 the court found of particular significance the fact that only 22 juvenile offenders have been executed ce reinstatement of the death penalty in 197613 significantly the court cited international law prohibiting the execution of juveniles this included specifically artic 37a

adolescents as class are less mature and responsible than adults id at 834 and therefore less culpability should attach to crime committed by juvenile than to comparable crime committed by an adult 20

justices kennedy br eyer ginsburg souter and stevens justice stevens wrote brief concurring opinion praising the court for modernizing its view of the 8th amendment other international treaties and agreements14 alongside international law the court looked to the views of the international community and worldwide imposition of the juvenile death penalty15 in addition the court found the opposition of many domestic social professional and religious groups to confirm the national consensus against the execution of juvenile offenders16 finally the court examined whether the death penalty was warranted for juvenile offenders in regard to fulfilling the primary social purposes of the punishment retribution and deterrence17 comparing juvenile offenders to those with mental retardation the court found neither purpos to be furthered18 the court noted the lesser culpability and reasoning ability of juvenile offenders addressed by the us supreme court in thompson19 and concluded that the s upreme courts reasoning in atkins regarding the social purposes served by the death penalty is inapplicable to juvenile offenders the dissenters quoting from stanford concluded there was neither historical or modern societal consensus forbidding th imposition of capital punishment on those under 18 years of age at the time of the offense20 further noting the us supreme court decision in stanford and its subsequent refusal to readdress the issue despite recent opportunities to do so21 the justices contended that the missouri supreme court lacked authority to overrule existing us supreme court precedent22 united states supreme court decision in roper v simmons roper 23 divided court held 54 that capital punishme nt for juveniles who committed their crimes when they were under the age of 18 is unconstitutional writing for the majority24 justice kennedy conceded that the court was r econsidering decision it had made in stanford 1989 in overturning the stanford ruling the court set aside statement made by fourhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21969crs5 25 it is worth noting that justice kennedy wa s one of the four justices who endorsed that statement he did not explicitly explain his change of mind but noted that the court had abandoned that statement when it ruled in atkins 26 roper at 15 27 roper at 6 quoting trop v dulles 356 us 86 100101 1978 28 roper at 14 stating that an unacceptable likelihood exists that the brutality or coldblooded nature of any particular crime would overpower mitigating arguments based on youth as matter of course even where

should not use its own independent judgment to decide whether the death pena lty was too great punishment for particular groups of individuals or cr imes the rejection in stanford of that role for the court the roper majority stated is inconsistent w ith prior eighth amendment decisions26 instead following the standard the court set forth in atkins the majority rested its decision on three rationales 1 that evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of maturing society27 which led the court in 2002 to ban the execution of mentally retarded people are similar with respect to juveniles 2 that the brutality of juveniles crime makes it all too likely that mitigating factors based on youth such as vulnerability and immatur ity would be overlooked28 and 3 that the overwhelming weight of international opinion against the juvenile death penalty provides confirmation that the penalty is disproporti onate punishment for juveniles the majority runs through the statistical case for an emerging national consensus against the juvenile death penalty but as the majority seems to realize the statistical case is not as strong as in atkins the atkins court was able to rely on the fact that after 1989 state had gone on record affirming its desire to execute the mentally retarded but the situation with juvenile offenders is arguably different two states recently affirmed their desire to execute particularly culpable juvenile offenders29 twelve states still have juvenile offenders on death row in findi ng now national consensus against execution of juvenile offenders the court noted that 30 states now bar such sentences 12 that have abolished the death penalty for all persons nd 18 that retain the death penalty but do not allow it for juveniles the court noted the infrequency of the execution of juvenile offenders citing that in the last 16 years only six states have executed juvenile offenders but in the past decade only three have done so oklahoma texas and virginia30 the majority conceded that in contrast to the pace of states abolition of the death penalty for the mentally retarded the rate of change regarding juveniles has been slowerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21969crs6 31 roper at 10 32 id at 1112 discussing the general differences between juveniles under 18 and adults 33 id at 13 concluding that neither retribution nor deterrence provides adequate justification for imposing the death penalty on juvenile offenders 34 id at 16 35 roper at 19 oconnor j dissenting 36 joined by chief justice rehnquist and justice thomas 37 roper at 31 scalia j dissenting 38 idthough less dramatic the court said the chan ge remains significant in addition the court also said that the trend away fro m executing juveniles wa s consistent one31 besides relying upon that trend the court also cited scientific and sociological studies showing significant differences be tween juveniles under 18 and adults including less sense of responsibility susceptibility to ne gative influences and the lack of fully formed character32 the court also noted that the two social purposes that the death penalty serves retribution and deterrence have less force or none at all with regard to juvenile offenders the same characteristics of youth that make them less culpable than adults also suggest they will be less susceptible to deterrence the majority suggested33 in finding new consensus against execu ting juveniles the court also relied upon what it called the stark reality that the unite d states is the only country in the world that continues to give official sancti on to the juvenile death penalty34 the court noted that this reality is not controlling since it is the courts responsibility to interpret the 8th amendment however the court added that since 1958 the court has referred to the laws of other countries and to international authorities as instructive in defining the meaning of that 8th amendments prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments justice oconnor wrote dissent only for he rself in which she argued that the majority had not found genui ne national consensus agains t executing juveniles rather it simply relied on its own inde pendent moral judgment that death is disproportionate penalty for any 17yearold offender35 justice scalia36 in markedly bitter dissent conde mned every facet of the courts approach to the eighth amendment issue he said the consensus discerned by the majority was on the f limsiest of grounds he also ar gued that the court illegitimately had cast aside the judgment of the peoples representatives and substituted its own proclamation of itself as the sole ar biter of our nation s moral standards37 in addition he also lambasted the majority for its reliance upon what he called likeminded foreigners38
