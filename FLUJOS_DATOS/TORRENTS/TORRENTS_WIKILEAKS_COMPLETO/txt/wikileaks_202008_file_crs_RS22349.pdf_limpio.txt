the distribution method for the remainder of appropriations for shsgp and letpp was at the discretion of dhs add itionally congress authorized the allocation of uasi funding to be at the discretion of

allocated based on risk only8 state and local risk will be determined by dhs using risk formula developed by the office of grants and training gt formerly the office for state and local government

asset to that particular threat and threat to that asset9 the dhs risk formula is to c onsist of two risk calculations assetbased risk which uses threat values derived from us intelligence community assessment of threats to specific critical infrastructure and geographicbased risk which uses values based on inherent risks associated to geographical areas ie states or urban areas taking into account such factors as internati onal borders terrorism reporting and investigations nd population density the risk associated with assets combined with geographical areas will produce state and locality terrorism risk score10 need coupled with the dhs risk formula state and local homeland security needs will be assessed through cap ability review which is currently underway this review is an effort to help states determine their own homeland security capabilities identified and explained in the na tional preparedness goal11 through an evaluation of each states homeland security program

allocation at the time of award14 issues in august 2004 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states 911 commission criticized the allocation of federal homeland security assistance and recommended that the distribution not remain program for general revenue sharing15 the former members of the 911 commission acting as private citizens conducting the 911 public discour project gave congress and dhs in its final report dated december 5 2005 failing grade on distri bution of homeland security funding to states congress has still not changed the underlyi ng statutory authority for homeland security grants or benchmarks to insure that funds are used wisely as result homeland security funds continue to be distributed without regard for risk vulnerability or the consequences of an ttack diluting the national security benefits of this important program16 almost immediately after dhs announced the fy2006 allocations some states urban areas and their congre ssional delegations complained about reductions in grants as compared to fy200517 members of congress raised questions about the suitability of the methods dhs used to allocate the gran ts and they pursued those questions in congressional oversight hearings18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22349crs5 18 continued grants june 21 2006 19 for an indepth discussion on mini mum versus base see crs report rl33050 riskbased funding in homeland security grant legislation issues for the 109th congress by shawn reese 20 pl 10990 title iiigiven this criticism dhss development of risk and needsbased formula and its determination to allocate guaranteed base to states raise some policy questions that congress may wish to addre ss through oversight of dhss administration of fy2006 hsgp grants some of the issues include guaranteed minimum vs guaranteed base risks vs needs and delayed awarding of state allocations minimum versus base19 dhs has elected to provide guaranteed base to every state and us insular area from shsgp nd letpp funding congress authorized dhs discretion in determinin g if the 075 of total appropriations guaranteed to states is to be either minimum or base20 if dhs were to use 100 riskbased fo rmula in determining state allocations minimum is the smallest amount each state would receive following riskbased state allocations were the riskbased calculations to result in any state allocation less than the statutorily defined minimum allocations of states receiving more than the minimum would be reduced proportionally so that all states would receive at least the minimum base is an amount guaranteed to each stat without regard to risk or need after allocation of base amounts states might recei ve further funding based on risk and needs policy options for the method of grant allo cation could include guaranteed base guaranteed minimum or neither that is policymakers may choose to decide whether to 1 provide every state with the same amount of base funding and then allocate the remainder of total appropriations based on risk and need 2 to allocate total appropriations based on risk and need and then if state does not receive certain amount or percentage minimum provide add itional funding to the state to meet this amount or percentage with proportional reduction of funding to the other states or 3 to allocate funding to states based 100 on risk and need risk versus need dhs has elected not to use 100 riskbased formula for allocating the remainder of total appropriations following the distribution of state base amounts instead dhs has developed tw opart approach to determining state allocations this approach consists of dhs risk assessment and states justification of need for funding dhs has not inform ed states through its fy2006 guidance what percentage of remaining funds will be allocated based on ri sk and what percentage of remaining funds will be allocated based on need or if th two will be combined into single allocationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22349crs6 21 in fy2003 state allocations were announced in jan 2003 in fy2004 state allocations were announced in dec 2003 and in fy2005 state allocations were announced in nov 2004one could argue that by not allocating st rictly on risk dhs s not addressed the critics such as the 911 commission in its 2004 report who advocate purely riskbased allocation of homeland security funding by coupling needs with risk dhs might be providing funding to states that do not have high risk of terrorism conversely by allocating funding based on both risk and need s dhs is arguably addressing not only terrorism risks but also states capability to address those terrorism risks congress may wish to address the issue of risk and needsbased funding by reviewing fy2006 state allocations once they have been announced by dhs at later date and determining if the new distribution formula meets the homeland security needs of the nation as whole if congress were to determine that this new distribution method does not address the national n eeds it might consider imposition of distribution method beyond the present statutory requirement of guaranteed amount of 075 to every state this distribution method might include risk criteria and benchmar ks for determining national homeland security needs delayed awarding of state allocations in fy2003fy2005 states were informed of their homeland security grant allocation early in the fiscal year21 states have been notified of their fy2006 base allo cation approximately 713 million however because of dhss decision to wait til states complete their enhancement plan and investment justification states w ill not be notified of their total grant allocation until sometime in the spring of 2006 it is possible that states lacking an indi cation of how much funding they will receive will not know how to accurately plan or velop homeland security activities for fy2006 it is possible that state will develop an enhancement plan and investment justification that relies on certain amount of federal homeland security funding and then be notified following dhss risk and needs assessment that it will not be receiving the desired amount of funding or any funding beyond its ba allocation this in turn might result in the state having to adjust or rework its homeland security pla nning and implementation activities additionally by delaying the announcement of state allocations localities could be further delayed in being informed by states of any fy2006 funding they might receive conversely by delaying the announcem ent of state allocations dhs may be afforded an extended period for more accurately determining state homeland security risks and needs dhss requirement for an enha ncement plan and investment justification could also result in states more accurately determining their risks capabilities and needs which could facilitate dhss overall national risk and needs assessment
