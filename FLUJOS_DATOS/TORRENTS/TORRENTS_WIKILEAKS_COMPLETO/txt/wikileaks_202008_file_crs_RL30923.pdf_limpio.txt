and neglect nations shame fatal child abuse and neglect in the united states washington dc 1995the longterm trend in child abuse reporting however has been one of substantial growth with the number of maltreatment reports more than quadrupling since 1976 increased reporting does not necessa rily mean an equivalent increase in actual abuse or neglect and it is generally agreed that some part of the dramatic growth in reporting over the last two to three decades is due to greater public awareness and recognition of child abuse nd neglect especially since the 1960s and 1970s when states enacted mandatory reportin g laws indeed the percentage of child maltreatment reports that ar substantiated child is found to be victim has declined over the past decades at the same time researchers and professionals agree that not all children who are victims of abuse or neglect are reported to child welfare agencies to gain more complete picture congress has periodica lly directed hhs to fund the national incidence study of child abuse and negl ect nis this study collects data on children who have been investigated by ch ild protection agencies but also includes information from community professionals on children who were either not reported to child welfare agencies or whose cases were not investigated the nis was conducted in 1980 1986 and 1993 according to the most recent nis survey more than 15 million children were victims of abuse or neglect in 1993 under the harm standard ie children who have suffered demonstrable harm by objective measures for 67 increase from 1986 and 149 increase from 1980 the nis also found that 28 million children could be count ed in 1993 under the endangerment standard more subjective measure including children who were not actually harmed but might be considered at ri sk which was almost double the number counted in 1986 the endangerment st andard was not used in the 1980 nis4 children may experience one or more kinds of maltreatment of the child victims in 2000 close to 63 suffered neglect including medical neglect while little more than 19 were physically abused 10 were sexual abuse victims and 8 were emotionally or psychologically maltreated in addition 17 experienced maltreatment that wa s coded by state as other and might include abandonment threats of harm to the child or congen ital drug addiction in 2000 an estimated 1200 children died due to child abuse and neglect this number is based on more comprehensive reporting than in previous ears although it is still slightly below the peak of 1240 in 19945

welfare services received 292 million in discreti onary fy2002 funding this program is generally considered available for services other than foster care but states may and do expend some of these program funds for outofhome placements22 in addition to programs that are speci fically designed to fund child welfare states use variety of fede ral funds that have more ge neral or other purposes

according to an urban institute survey of state expenditures in sfy2000 some 42 of fe deral funds expended for child welfare purposes came from these nondedicated sources23 the same survey found that

addition there are concerns about the effects of this reporting requirement given limited available social services especially substance abuse treatment as passed by the house hr 3839 mainta ined states right to define child abuse or neglect to include or not include prenatal exposure to drugs and alcohol38 it also stated that notification of prenat drug exposure shall not be construed to

langua ge does not create any new or amended definition of child abuse neither is it the intent of this language to address any legal prosecution of mothers the amendment does not preempt states law regarding what constitutes child abus or requires prosecution40 while s 2998 provided less explicit statutory language the committee report accompanying the legislation noted that the provision did not intend to preempt state law regarding what constitutes child abuse or requirements for prosecution41 currently some states are unable to re spond to all reports of abuse and neglect due to inadequate resources further an increased number of children needing outof home placements could tax the child welfare systems ability to find them foster care during the crack epidemic of the middl 1980s through the early 1990s heightened attention to drugexposure in some places led to increased reporting requirements for prenatal drug exposure and the foster care system struggled to keep up

training cps workers on their legal duties including the legal rights of children and families and provisions and procedures to improve the training retention and supervision of caseworkers s 2998 did not include this provision as an eligibility requirement for basic state grant funding but did recommend training of cps workers on th eir legal responsibilities to protect the rights of children and families child protective services agencies are sometimes criticized for acting too aggressively unnece ssarily removing children from their homes or alternatively for failing to act as aggressively as th ey should to remove children from unsafe homes in particular some critics of cps argue that th anonymous reports of child maltreatment produce many baseless charges and that caseworkers frequently violate parental rights when investigating th cases by entering homes under false pretenses and needlessly harassing innocen t parents and children social scientific research concerning these allegations has not been conducted however anecdotal evidence is sometimes offered43 other individuals argue that the current system strikes the proper balance betw een childrens best interest s and parents rights and that explicitly expanding parental rights may prevent the removal of children from unsafe homes some of these individuals also argue that cps workers have insufficient training casework supervision and resources to effectively investigate abuse reports and argue that more training and support for these workers is needed44 language included in hr 3839 and subsequently in hr

complaint concerning training of cps personnel on their legal duties to protect the constitutional and statutory rights of children and families the majority notes the committee believes that child protective services personnel should understand that they dont have the authority to demand entry in the family home when investigating an allegation46 eighteen house education and workforce committee democrats who signed the additional minority views asserted that the views expressed in the report go beyond the agreed upon intent of the rele vant provisions distort what is known about this issue defy mode l professional practice and could potentially detrimentally tip the balance between parents rights and childrens interests in manner that would lead to greater harm to children in addition

declarations from the federal government about what caseworkers should or should not say in their investigations47 the senate help committee report accomp anying s 2998 notes that while it remains strongly committed to the main mission of the child protective services system to ensure that child safety and the best interests of the child are protected the committee believes it is important for
