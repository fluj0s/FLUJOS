securitization forum asf plan to freeze certain mortgage interest rates summary in response to the downturn in the us mortgage market the bush administration helped broker an alliance of mortgage lenders servicers counselors and investors called the hope now alliance whose stated goals are to maximize outreach efforts to homeowners in distress to help them stay in their homes and to create unified coordinated plan to reach and help as many homeowners as possible one aspect of the alliance is the statement of principles recommendations and guidelines for streamlined foreclosure and loss avoidance framework for securitized subprime adjustable rate mortgage loans the framework or asf plan as proposed by the american securitization forum asf pursuant to the framework borrowers who meet certain requirements qualify for fast track loan modification which may include an interest rate freeze at the rate prior to reset that in most cases lasts for five years because this type of modification is deviation from the norm servicers willing to perform loan workouts in accordance with the frameworks guidelines could worry that they would open themselves up to tax accounting and contract liability from secondary market investors and federal regulators of taxexempt trusts this potential liability could deter servicers from engaging in loss mitigation even those measures outlined in the framework the internal revenue service issued revenue procedure rev proc 200828 on may 16 2008 to clarify certain tax issues relating to modification of securitized mortgage loans the irs said that it would not challenge the tax status of the trusts that hold securitized loans nor would the irs assert that anticipatory loan modifications create tax liability on prohibited transactions if 1 the mortgage is for singlefamily 14 unit dwelling 2 the dwelling is owneroccupied 3 overdue mortgages make up less than 10 of the trusts assets at startup 4 there is reasonable belief that the original loan will result in foreclosure 5 the loan modification is less favorable to the holder of the loan than the original loan and 6 there is reasonable belief that the loan modification reduces the risk of foreclosure the data show that loan modifications and formal repayment plans have been increasing steadily in each successive quarter since the issuance of the framework however it is difficult to identify which of these modifications were made pursuant to the asf plan and which occurred through alternative channels the framework only applies to certain mortgages that are current which makes it distinct from project lifeline plan announced on february 12 2008 for mortgages that are in serious default on june 17 the hope now servicers announced common

introduction in response to the downturn in the us mortgage market the bush administration helped broker an alliance of mortgage lenders servicers counselors and investors called the hope now alliance1 whose stated goals are to maximize outreach efforts to homeowners in distress to help them stay in their homes and to create unified coordinated plan to reach and help as many homeowners as possible2 one aspect of the alliance is the statement of principles recommendations and guidelines for streamlined foreclosure and loss avoidance framework for securitized subprime adjustable rate mortgage loans the framework or the asf plan3 the framework was proposed by the american securitization forum professional forum for many organizations that participate in the securitization market and member of the hope now alliance this report first examines the details of the asf plan and then discusses the potential liability concerns that may arise for servicers who implement modifications under the plan finally the effectiveness of the framework is analyzed based on the loan workout data provided by the hope now alliance features of the asf plan the principles provided in the framework are voluntary the frameworks stated overall purpose is to provide further guidance for servicers to streamline borrower evaluation procedures and to facilitate the effective use of all forms of foreclosure and loss prevention efforts including refinancings forbearances workout plans loan modifications deedsinlieu and short sales or short payoffs4 1 for more information about the hope now alliance see the programs web page available at httpwwwhopenowcom 2 alliance statement hope now alliance available at httpwwwfsroundorgmedia pdfsalliancestatementpdf 3 available at httpwwwamericansecuritizationcomuploadedfilesfinalasfstatement onstreamlinedservicingprocedurespdf hereinafter referred to as framework 4 id at 2 crs2 the voluntary framework structure may be applied to mortgages with the following characteristics 1 subprime 2 firstlien mortgages that 3 were originated in the oneandonehalf year period between january 1 2005 and july 31 2007 with 4 adjustable interest rates that have an introductory fixedrate period of less than 36 months where 5 the first interest rate resets are scheduled to occur between january 1 2008 and july 31 2010 and that 6 have been securitized on the secondary market5 it should be noted that the framework does not apply to interest only mortgages simply because payments as opposed to interest rates increase within the specified time period nor does it apply to prime mortgages or alta mortgages6 servicers of mortgages that meet all six of the above requirements may separate borrowers of these mortgages into one of three segments segment 1 is for borrowers with loans that are current7 and that qualify to be refinanced into an available fha federal housing administration fha secure or private mortgage product servicers are encouraged to help borrowers of mortgages falling into this category to refinance if the borrowers are unable to afford the mortgage after reset or if they are unwilling to pay for the reset8 segment 2 is for borrowers with mortgages that meet the six requirements above but that are not likely to qualify for refinancing and where four additional requirements are met borrowers must be current9 with their mortgage payments b borrowers must reside in the residences securing the mortgage c borrowers must meet the fico test ie have credit scores below 660 and less than 10 higher than their scores at the time of origination10 and d borrowers mortgage payments would have to increase by more than 10 after the scheduled reset borrowers who meet all of the requirements of segment 2 qualify for fast track loan modification which may include an interest rate freeze at the rate prior to reset that in most cases lasts for five years this fast track rate freeze is designed to give 5 id at 4 6 alta refers to mortgages for borrowers with good credit but some other indicator of risk such as lack of income documentation prime and alta mortgages account for considerable number of foreclosures in the united states according to crs calculations of the mortgage bankers association national delinquency survey approximately 40 of the foreclosures that took place during the third quarter of 2007 were of nonsubprime mortgages 7 for purposes of this statement current means the loan must be not more than 30 days delinquent and must not have been more than 1 x 60 days delinquent in the last 12 months both under the office of thrift supervision ots method for servicers who determine delinquency under the mortgage bankers association mba method current means the loan must be not more than 60 days delinquent and must not have been more than 1 x 90 days delinquent in the last 12 months both under the mba method framework at 5 8 id at 46 9 see supra fn 7 10 if the borrower meets all other requirements except the fico test then the servicer may conduct alternative analysis to determine if the borrower otherwise qualifies for loan modification framework at 6 crs3 borrowers and lenders time to refinance into more affordable loans in order to limit the number of mortgages going into default and reduce the number of homes for sale in an already saturated market11 in part because eligibility for this segment is defined by readily available financial data servicers should be able to apply this fast track rate freeze to borrowers in more efficient and streamlined fashion than is normally the case12 the final segment is for all mortgages meeting the six requirements above but that do not qualify for either segment 1 or 2 servicers may apply more individualized analysis of these mortgages to determine the best way to mitigate losses in manner consistent with the applicable servicing standard13 servicers of securitized mortgages who do not fall within the scope of the framework may perform loan modifications in accordance with the governing service contracts potential for servicer liability as described above the framework provides servicers guidance in identifying borrowers who are in danger of defaulting on mortgages and in helping them provide effective refinancing loan modification and loss mitigation measures for these borrowers in ways that likely are in accordance with governing pooling and servicing agreements psas psas are contracts that govern the legal relationship between mortgagebacked securities mbs trustees mbs investors and servicers of the mortgages comprising these trusts14 while not all psas are exactly alike one relevant feature of typical agreements is the scope of permission for servicers to perform loss mitigation for borrowers who have yet to miss mortgage payment industry standards issued in the summer of 2007 stated that servicers could modify loans if default was reasonably foreseeable provided that such action increased the net present value npv of the 11 id at 67 this fast track modification is nonexclusive and does not preclude servicer from using alternate analysis to determine if borrower is eligible for loan modification as well as the terms of the modification id at 8 12 the frameworks fast track modification because it only applies to mortgages that are current differs from project lifeline plan announced on february 12 2008 that would impose 30day pause on foreclosure proceedings for certain mortgages that are seriously delinquent ie mortgage payments that are 90 or more days late the hope now alliance has not publicly released specific data on the implementation of project lifeline nor has it provided guidance as to when pause may be appropriate one reason for the lack of specificity regarding this program is that servicers commonly slow the foreclosure process in situations in which borrowers contact the servicer 13 framework at 8 14 these contracts also may be called servicing agreements sas the term psa will be used in this report to refer to both psas and sas crs4 mortgage pool15 fast track modification that freezes interest rates could potentially create gains for mbs trusts thus increasing their npv by minimizing losses as result of avoiding foreclosure expenses from the troubled borrowers but also could potentially create losses by freezing rates for borrowers capable of paying the higher reset satisfying the npv test generally would require comparison of the likely gains and losses of particular plan which historically has been done through individual loan analysis loanbyloan modification however is time consuming and expensive in the summer of 2007 many loan servicers and policymakers recognized that large number of upcoming payment resets could potentially overwhelm the resources of servicers willing to conduct voluntary modifications these servicers likely would not have been able to help applicable borrowers in need in timely fashion if action only took place on mortgagebymortgage basis for this reason one of the frameworks goals was to create structure by which broad swaths of mortgages could be modified as group hence the fast track loan modification plan because broad swath modification is deviation from the norm servicers willing to perform loan workouts in accordance with the frameworks guidelines could worry that they would expose themselves to tax accounting and contract liability from secondary market investors and federal regulators of taxexempt trusts for instance some in the industry might have worried that trust could cease to qualify as taxexempt remic if significant portion of its qualified mortgages were modified in accordance with broadbased plan rather than on loanbyloan basis this potential liability could deter servicers from engaging in loss mitigation including making use of those measures outlined in the asf plan in an attempt to allay liability concerns the hope now alliance requested opinions from the internal revenue service irs on the tax implications of its particular modification plan as well as from the securities and exchange commission sec on the accounting ramifications of modifications of loans held in securitization trusts tax implications depend on the interpretation of the real estate mortgage investment conduit remic rules which govern limitations on taxexempt passive trusts accounting implications depend on the interpretation of financial accounting standard fas 140 which governs the treatment of asset sales to passive trusts the irs stated in revenue procedure 200772 that it would not object to the framework by challenging the tax status of affected trusts this irs statement assured participants of the asf plan that loan modifications provided in accordance with the frameworks specific criteria will not result in loss of the tax status of the remics and other trusts16 rev proc 200772 was limited to the afs plan 15 statement of principles recommendations and guidelines for the modification of securitized subprime residential mortgage loans american securitization forum june 2007 16 rev proc 200772 internal revenue bulletin 200752 december 26 2007 crs5 the irs then issued separate revenue procedure rev proc 200828 to clarify more general tax issues relating to modification of securitized mortgage loans17 the irs identified conditions under which it would not challenge the tax status of the trusts that hold securitized loans or assert that anticipatory loan modifications create tax liability on prohibited transactions the conditions enumerated in rev proc 200828 are 1 the mortgage is for singlefamily 14 unit dwelling 2 the dwelling is owneroccupied 3 overdue mortgages make up less than 10 of the trusts assets at startup 4 there is reasonable belief that the original loan will result in foreclosure 5 the loan modification is less favorable to the holder of the loan than the original loan and 6 there is reasonable belief that the loan modification reduces the risk of foreclosure the sec which has oversight authority over organizations that coordinate accounting standards provided letter dated january 8 2008 stating that it would not object to loan modifications on the basis of fas 140 but specifically abstained from passing judgment on possible alternative plans or the rights of third parties such as investors like the irss tax opinion the secs accounting opinion might need to be supplemented if significant features of the plan are changed although the sec has stated that it would not object to the asf plan based on the npv test servicers who provide fast track loan modifications may still face from objections from other parties secondary mortgage market investors could still challenge servicers who provide these modifications on contract violation theory if they could show that the gains from avoiding foreclosures have reasonable probability of outweighing the losses from freezing payments at lower rates18 for example if secondary mortgage market investor could show that only 35 of loans in particular trust that were modified under the fast track plan would have resulted in foreclosure in the absence of some kind of workout plan while the remaining 65 of those modified mortgages would not have resulted in foreclosure then that investor could argue that these modifications did not increase the npv of the trust and thus the fast track rate freezes were provided in breach of the governing psa number of loan modifications the hope now alliance has accumulated data on the number of loan modifications and repayment plans that have been initiated by servicers per quarter table 1 presents the quarterly statistics for prime and subprime loss mitigation including both loan modification and formal repayment plans the data show that loan modifications and formal repayment plans have been increasing steadily in each successive quarter since the issuance of the framework total workout plans rose from 398691 in the third quarter of 2007 to 502520 in the first quarter of 2008 second quarter 2008 data are not yet available but an additional 182901 mortgages received workout plans in april 2008 the april results brings the total number of 17 rev proc 200828 internal revenue bulletin 200828 may 16 2008 18 as previously mentioned the npv standard is applicable to the typical psa other standards may apply which may affect liability pursuant to contract violation claim crs6 borrower workout plans to 1558854 compared with 573133 foreclosure sales however it is difficult to identify how many of these measures were made pursuant to the asf plan and how many were performed through alternative channels it is unlikely that many of the loan modifications that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2007 or earlier came as result of the asf plan because the plan was not announced until december 7 2007 the irs bulletin was not published until december 27 2007 and the sec letter was not issued until january 2008 in addition servicers would have needed time after the frameworks issuance to analyze their loan files identify mortgages meeting the plans standards and set up policies necessary to implement the plan rather the majority of the modifications and loss mitigation measures that had taken place up to the end of 2007 were probably based on individualized analysis and an agreement similar to the asf plan but that apply exclusively in california which was instituted prior to the framework it is also unclear how many of the modifications from the first quarter of 2008 were fast track modifications according to hope now 431171 subprime 228 and 327 mortgages in the us were scheduled to reset to variable rate at some point during the first quarter of 200819 while approximately 203000 of these loans were either sold or refinanced only 14418 of them were modified either under the fast track plan or otherwise adjusted20 partial explanation for this relatively low number of modifications of subprime mortgages with hybrid arms may be the decrease in short term rates most notably of the london interbank offered rate libor the index to which the majority of these mortgages rates are tied in december 2007 the sixmonth libor was around 48 that rate had dropped to just over 28 by april of 200821 this reduction has resulted in diminished reset shock which likely has held many of these mortgage payments below the 10 increase necessary to qualify for fast track modification additionally the falling rates likely kept the payments of many of these subprime mortgages at an affordable level for borrowers who may not have been able to afford payments that reset to the higher december 2007 rate 19 30year mortgage with 2 or 3 year introductory period is called 228 and 327 respectively 20 hope now has not delineated how many of these 14418 modifications were fast track modifications pursuant to the asf plan 21 although libor is not the reference rate used for all adjustable rate mortgages it is used for the majority of mortgages eligible for hope now according to industry data crs7 table 1

necessity of fast track modifications under current conditions illustrates how the limited scope of the asf plan could lead to proposals to change its features which could lead to another round of requests for sec and irs letters in addition it can be argued that different root causes of mortgage problems in different parts of the country complicate the creation of uniform solution as an example subprime loans make up relatively small share of californias total loans as compared to other states yet alternative mortgages made up relatively large share of californias prime and alta markets not only did many of these prime loans have adjustable rates but some had introductory interestonly features the rapid increase in prime and alta loan delinquencies in california and other states that had experienced rapid runups in house prices could lead some to question limiting the scope to subprime loans or adjustable rate loans arguments may also be made for new programs that address the specific problems occurring in particular geographic region for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34372
