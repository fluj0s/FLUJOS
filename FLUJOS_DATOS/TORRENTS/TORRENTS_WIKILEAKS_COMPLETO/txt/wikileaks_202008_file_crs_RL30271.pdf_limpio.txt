basis for distingu ishing between measures undertaken with artificial aids and measures undertaken by the bodys own systems existence of the dots waiver program does t alter an employers ability to impose the safety standard as job qualification without having to justify its application on casebycase basis the waiver program did not purport to modify th substance of the safety standard but instead was designed as an experiment to gather data for use in determining the feasibility of relaxing the standard the ada does not require an em ployer to justify novo an applicable government

powers to subject nonconsenting states to private suits for damages in state courts the history and structure of the constitution mak clear that states retain residual and inviolable sovereignty under th constitut ion fair labor standards amendments of 1974 violate this principle of sovereign immunity by subjecting nonconsenting states to suits for damages brought by employees in state courts behind the words of the constitutiona l provisio ns are postulates which limit and control the original constitutions silence about state immunity is explained by the fact that one at the tim suggested that the document might strip the states of sovereign immunity the eleventh amendments narrow terms applicable only to cases brought in federal courts did not by implicat ion eliminate state sovereign immunity in state courts that immunity derives not from the eleventh amendment but from the structure of the original constitution itself neither the supremacy clause nor the necessary and proper clause authorizes congress to override stat sovereign immunity in exercise of article i powers to recognize such nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30271article i power would create an anomaly under

given because of th recipients official po sition under the more natural reading of this language an indictment is defecti ve if it does not allege specific connection between the gratuities and some official act the provision could have been worded mor simply and directly if the aim had been to proscribe all gifts for or because f official position broad p rohibitions on gift giving found elsewhere in the code are more precise and more administrable moreover the government s position could produce peculiar results such as prohibiting sports tea m visiting the white house from giving

noticeprejudice rule under which n insurer may avoid liability for an untimely claim only by establishing that claimants delay in filing was prejudicial is law which regulates insurance within the

applies t insurance contracts and is not general principle applicable outside th insurance context moreover the rule is grounded in policy concerns specific to the insurance industry two of the three

damages in dministrative proceedings the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc possesses the authority t require federal agencies to pay compensatory damages when they discriminate in employment in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 section 717b added in 1972 grants the eeoc authority to enforce the act through appropriate remedies including reinstatement or hiring of employees with r without back pay section 717c authorizes an employee or job applicant to file ci vil action compensatory damages amendment cda enacted in 1991 authorized award of compen satory damages in an action brought under section 717 read literally the langu age of the statutes is consistent with grant of authority to the eeoc to award compensatory damages afte r enactment of the cda in 1991 award of compensatory damages is remed that is appropriate the m eaning of appropriate was not frozen as of 1972 rather the meaning of the word permits its scope to expan d or contract to reflect later changes in the law recognizing this authority in the eeoc is consistent with the purposes of the 1972 amendments to encourage administrativ resolution of discrimination complaints while the cda made mention of the eeoc and use of the word action often refers to judicial cases and not t administrative proceed ings congress could have referenced section 717c had it desired to limit the remedy to cour t actions conferral of right to jury trial unavailable in an eeoc proceeding if compl aining party seeks compensatory damages does not preclude holding that the eeoc may award compensatory damages the provision merely makes jury trial available if complaining party brings court action under 717c finally the provision meets the standard for waiver of sovereign immunity the statutory language taken togethe r with statutory purposes history and the absence of any convincing reason for denying the eeoc the relevant power produce evidence of waiver tha t satisfies the appropriate standard 54 opinion of court by breyer joined by stevens oconnor souter an d ginsburg dissenting opinion by kennedy joined by rehnquist scalia an d thomas wilson v layne 67 uslw 4322 52499 fourth amendment media ridealong qualified immunity police officers violate the fourth amend ment by bringing members of the media or other third parties into home during the executio n of warrant if the presence of the third parties in t he home was not in aid of the execution of the warrant respect for privacy of the home lies at t he core of the fourth amendment absent exigent circumstances warran t is required before officers may enter home to search or to make an arrest moreover police actions in execution of warrant must be related to the objectives of the authorized int rusion in this case the reporters were not present to identify stolen property or otherwise to assist in execution of the warrant and consequently their presence in the home was not related to the objectives of the authorized intrusion generalize d interests in furthering law enforcement objectives and publicizing crimefighting efforts do not suffice tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30271override the right of residential privacy however because this right to be free from media i ntrusion during search of the home was not clearly established at the time of the search in this case the law enforcement fficers deputy federal marshals and local sheriffs deputies are entitled to qualified immunity reasonable officer could have belie ved that it was legal to bring media observers along during the execution of an arrest warrant in th home at that time 1992 media ridealongs were common and there were court decisions holding the prac tice unlawful also the policy of the us marshals service explicitly

belongings are capable of concealing the object of the search even if it is the driver and not the passenger who is unde r suspicion the initial step in evaluating the constitutionality of search is t determine whether the search would have been regarded as unlawful under the common law at the time the fourth amendment was adopted there is long history that allows of ficers with probable cause but without warrant to search for contraband in vessel and the same principle has been applied to allo w search of c ontainers within motor vehicles cases allowing such searches have expressed qualification based on ownership of the containers secon d inquiry is the reasonableness of the search and this is determined by balancing the intrusion on individual privacy against the governmental interests at stake this balancing must be conducted with an eye to the generality of cases passengers possess reduced expectation of privacy with regard to th property that they transport in cars and search of such property is far shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30271intrusive than search of the person on the other hand the governmenta l interest in effective law enforcement is substantial and the ready mobility of cars often makes obtaining warrant impractical also impractical i s requiring police offi cers to determine whether property belongs to the driver or to passenger whether the driver and

medicar act administrative law judicial review of agency action provider of medicare services has right to judicial review of fisca l intermediarys refusal to reopen an annual determination of the amount f reimbursement to which the provider is entitled the medicare act gives provider the right to an administrative appeal within 180 days of th intermediarys original determination and the provider reimbursement review boards decision is subject t review in federal district court the provider may also within three years request the intermediary to reopen the reimbursement determination and any new decision is subject to review the regulation says nothing however about refusal to reopen the medicare act authorizes hearing before the board if the provider is dissatisfied with an intermediary s final determination as to the amount of reimbursement the secretarys interpretation of this language to mean that refusal to reopen is not fina l determination as to the amount but rather refusal to make such determination is reasonable interpretation titled to deference under chevron v nrdc 1984 these review provisions authorizing direct appeal and request for reopening are not
