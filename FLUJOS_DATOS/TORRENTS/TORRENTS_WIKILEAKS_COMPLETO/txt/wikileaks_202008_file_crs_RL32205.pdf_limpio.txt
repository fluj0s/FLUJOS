lng import growth the united states has used lng comme rcially since the 1940s initially lng facilities stored domestically produced natu ral gas to supplement pipeline supplies during times of high gas demand in th 1970s lng imports began to supplement domestic production primarily because of low domestic gas prices lng imports stayed relatively small accounting for onl 1 of total us gas consumption as late as 20025 in countries with limited domes tic gas supplies however lng imports grew dramatically over the same period japan for example imported 97 of its natural gas supply as lng in 2002 more than 11 times as much lng as the united states6 south korea france spain and taiwan also became heavy lng importers natural gas demand has accelerated in the united states over the last several years due to environmental concerns about other energy sources widespread building of natural gasfired electri city generation and low natu ral gas prices through the 1980s and 1990s domestic gas supplies have not kept up with this demand however so prices have often become high and volatile at the same time international lng costs have fallen substantially because of increased supplies

because it is so cold the likelihood and severity of catas trophic lng events have been the subject of controversy while ques tions remain about the cred ible impacts of specific lng hazards there appears to be consensus as to what the most serious hazards are pool fires if lng spills near an ignition source evaporating gas will burn above the lng pool13 the resulting pool fire would spread as the lng pool expanded away from its source and continued evaporating pool fire is intense burning far more hotly and rapi dly than oil or gasoline fires14 it cannot be extinguished all the lng must be consum ed before it goes out because an lng pool fire is so hot its thermal radiati on may injure people nd damage property considerable distance from the fire itself many experts agree that large pool fire especially on water is the most serious lng hazard15 flammable vapor clouds if lng spills but does not immediately ignite the evaporating natural gas will form va cloud that may drift some distance from the spill site if the cloud subsequently encounters an ignition source those portions of the cloud with combustible gasair concentration will burn because only fraction of such cloud would have co mbustible gasair concentration the cloud would not likely ignite all at once but the fire could still cause considerable damage16 an lng vapor cloud fire would gra dually burn its way back to the lng spill where the vapors originated and w ould continue to burn as pool fire17 other safety hazards lng spilled on water could theoretically regasify almost instantly in flameless explosi on although an idaho national engineering laboratory report concluded th at transitions caused by mixing of lng and water are not violent18 lng vapor clouds are not toxic but they could cause

serious fire the environmental damage associated with an lng spill would be confined to fire and freezing impacts near the spill since lng dissipates completely and leaves residue21 terrorism hazards lng tankers and landbased facilities could be vulnerable to terrorism tankers might be physically attacked in variety of ways to destroy their cargo or commandeered fo r use as weapons against coastal targets lng terminal facilities might also be physically attacked with explosives or through other means some lng facilities may also be indirectly disrupted by cyber attacks or attacks on regional

have carried over 45000 lng cargoes and traveled over 100 million miles wit hout serious accident at sea or in port23 lng tankers have experienced groundings and collisions during this period but none has resulted in major spill24 the lng marine safety record is pa rtly due to the doublehulled sign of lng tankers this design makes them more robust and less prone to accidental spills than old single

the terror attacks of septembe r 11 2001 technical studies have been commissioned to evaluate the safety hazards of lng terminals and associated shipping the most widely cite d of these studies are listed in table 1 these studies have caused controversy because some reach differing conclusions about the potential public hazard of lng terminal accidents or terror attacks consequently community groups fear that lng hazard s may be misrepresented by government agencies or that certain lng hazards may simply not be understood well enough to support terminal siting approval most hazard analyses for lng terminals and shipping depend on computer models to approximate the ffects of hypothetical accidents federal siting standards specifically require computer modeling of thermal radiation and flammable vapor cloud exclusion zones 49 cfr 1932057 205930 such models are necessary because there have been major lng incidents of the type envisioned in lng safety research and because historical lng experiments have been limited in scale and scope but lng hazards models simu late complex physical phenomena and are inherently uncertain relying on calculations and input assumptions about which fair minded analysts may legitimately disagree even small differences in an lng hazard model have led to significantly different conclusions referring to previous lng safety zone studies for example

performed by i ndividuals with various kinds of expertise it is beyond the scope of this report to make detailed comparisons of the methodologies and findings of these studies and ferc analysis furthermore each of the available studies or its application appears to have significant limitations or has been questioned by critics for example the absg consulting study released by ferc in may 2004 which reviewed exis ting lng hazard models concluded that release models are available that take into account the true structure of an lng carrier pool spread models are availa ble that account for wave action or currents and relatively few experimental data are available for validation ofmodels involving lng spills on water and there are data available for spills as large as the spills considered in this study 32 the 2004 sandia national laboratories study similarly reported that there are limitations in existing data and current modeling capabilities for analyzing lng spills over water33 nonetheless the sandia re port concluded that existing analytic tools can be used to identif and mitigate hazards to protect both public safety and property34 uncertainty related to lng hazard modeling continues december 2006 study using yet another lng computer model of large lng fire states that current generation models that are being used to cal culate the radiant heat from the fire are found to be overly conservative35 in february 2007 the government accountability office gao issued re port comparing six recent unclassified studies including studies in table 1 of the consequences of lng spills the gao report concluded that36 because there have been largescale lng spills or spill experiments past studies have developed modeling assumptions based on smallscale spill data while there is general agreement on the types of effects from an lng spill the results of these models have created what appears to be conflicting assessments of the specific consequences of an lng spill

materials safe ty department of transportation hazardous materials shipments washington dc october 1998 table 2 p 2following the gao report members of c ongress expressed re newed concern about the uncertainty associated with lng hazard analysis37 hazards vs risks in reviewing the various lng hazard studies it is important to be clear about the distinction between hazards and risks although theoretical models may try to quantify the effects of worstcase hazards evaluating the risks associated with those hazards requires an estimate of the probability that they will occur some argue that significant hazard that is nonetheless highly unlikely does not represent an unacceptable risk to the public in this view worst case hazard studies alone do not provide sufficient basis for evaluating public safety unfortunately few lng safety studies compre hensively and convincingly address the probability of catastrophic acci dents or attacks actually occurring38 in part this shortcoming arises from lack of historical lng incidents and detailed terrorist threat information on which to base such probabilities faced with this analytic uncertainty decision makers are forced to draw the best information they can get and rely upon their own best judgment to reach conclusions about lng safety lng terminal safety in perspective other hazardous materials lng terminals and tanke rs have high profile because of extensive media c overage although there are fe w of them relative to all the hazardous chemical plants and ship s currently operating near us cities according to the us environmental protection agency epa for example more than 500 toxic chemical f acilities operate in urban areas at which worstcase accidents could affect 100000 or more people39 these include chlorine plants in city water systems and amm onia tanks in agricultural fe rtilizer production there are also oil refineries and other liquefied pe troleum gas eg propa ne butane terminals operating in us

of multiple lng and natural gas pipeline facilities proposed in the same region73 they assert regional lng siting process would be more efficien t than fercs current process because it would focus

the discharge originates or will originate that the discharge is in compliance with the applicable provisions of the cwa including the states water quality standards83 thus states could use their certification authority under the clean water act to influence the siting of an lng project by attaching conditions to the required water quality certificate or by denying certification this certification authority has become an important tool used by states to protect the integrity of their waters it is worth noting that the ergy policy act of 2005 created one potential avenue of relief

remarked from all the information we have we dont see lng as likely or credible terrorist targets113 industry representatives ar gue that deliberately causing an lng catastrophe to injure people might be possible in theory but would be extremely difficult to accomplish likewise ferc and other experts believe that lng facilities are relatively secure comp ared with other hazardous chemical infrastructures that receive less public attention in december 2004 report ferc stated that for new lng terminal proposal the perc eived threat of terrorist attack may be considered as highly probable

perspective 2008 report by the institute fo r the analysis of global security states proponents are correct in that both safety and security measures currently in place make lng terminals and ships ex tremely hard targets for terrorists however it would be imprudent to believe that terrorists are either incapable or unwilling to attack such targets it would be equally imprudent to assume that these targets are impenetrable if anythi ng in todays environment insiders will always remain potential threat120 because the probability of terrorist attack on lng infrastructure cannot be known policy makers and community leaders mu st to some extent rely on their own judgment to decide whether lng security is adequately addressed in ferc siting application reviews as oversight of the federal role in lng terminal siting continues congress may explore policies to reduce this uncertainty by improving the gathering and sharing of terrorism intelligence related to lng public costs of lng marine

lng safety research would be beneficial the absg report states for example that additional research will need to be performed to develop more refined models and additional largescale spill tests would be useful for providing better data for validation of models129 the 2004 sandia study similarl concludes that obtaining experimental data for large lng spills over water would provide needed validation and help reduce modeling uncertainty130 physical testing as opposed to computer simulations of impacts and explosions on lng tanker hulls could also fill important gaps in engineering

efforts targeting constitu ents or otherwise taking place at the local level136 reducing lng demand some policy makers argue that congress should try to reduce the need for new lng terminals by acting to curb growth in domestic lng demand or growth in natural gas demand overall for example congress could change public and industrial incen tives for conservation and efficiency switching to other fuels or developing re newable energy supplies but other fuels like coal and nuclear power pose their own hazards to communities and the environment so their expansion may not be preferable to additional lng infrastructure conservation and renewa ble energy sources are less hazardous although they face significant technological and cost barriers to public adoption on the scale that would be required federa l investments in rene wables research or conservation subsidies might have to be large and mig ht not have enough impact to alleviate the need for lng expansion altogether various provisions in recent proposed energy legislation would encour age the development of conservation and other alternatives to natural gas but critics believe they would not likely go far enough to significantly affect n earterm natural gas consumption another potential way to curb us l ng demand would be to encourage greater north american production of natural gas provisions in the energy policy act of 2005 seek to promote this objective as do proposals to encourage construction of an alaska gas pipeline and to expand natura l gas production on the outer continental shelf an alaska gas pipeline would take years to build however and would not on its own be able to meet the anticipated longterm growth in us gas demand increased production from natural gas wells in the lower 48 states could help alleviate possible nearterm natural ga s supply shortage but may not offer sustainable longterm supply solution si nce it is not known whether domestic gas reserves will be able to keep pace with rising gas demandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32205crs31 conclusion proposals for new us lng import rminals are numerous but lng imports pose safety challenges lng is inhere ntly hazardous and its infrastructure is potentially attractive to terrorists the 2004 lng terminal fire in algeria demonstrates that despite technolog ical improvements since the 1940s lng facilities can still experience serious accide nts many lawmakers and the general public are concerned about these hazards the us lng industry is subject to more extensive siting and safety regulation than many other similarly haza rdous facilities federal st ate and local governments have also put in place security measures intended to safeguard lng against newly perceived terrorist threats some commun ity groups and other stakeholders fear that federal siting requirements for lng facilities are still not stringent enough but the responsible federal agencies disagree the safety issues associated with lng terminal siting are both important and familiar every major energy source poses some hazard to public safety similar public concerns have been raised around sitin g of other types of energy facilities such as nuclear power plants oil import termin als pipelines and electric transmission lines in evaluating new lng terminal propos als therefore policy makers face full range of facilities and safety hazards associated with us energy supplies not only lng needs and hazards on their own although lng terminal regulations are extensive and the global industry has decades of experience operating lng fac ilities many stakeholders question lng terminal safety some of these questions might be resolved through additional research on key lng topics lng siting decisions are already underway however so any research efforts intended to affect the siting process would probably have to be completed quickly revising lng sa fety requirements after completion of facility could be disruptive of energy s upplies some cite the shoreham nuclear power plant in the 1980s which was clos ed after construction due to new public safety requirements as an example of th need to resolve safety concerns before capital is invested both industry and government analysts project continued nearterm growth in the demand for natural gas and cons trained ability for domestic gas producers to meet that demand greater lng imports represent one way to address this growth in demand along with increased north am erican gas production conservation fuel switching and the developmen t of renewable energy sources one way or another the fundamental gas supply and demand balance must be maintained if policy makers encourage lng imports then the need to foster the other energy options may be diminished and vice versa thus decisions about lng infrastructure could have consequences for broader rray of natural ga s supply policieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32205crs32 137 for recent lng siting application mar ad
