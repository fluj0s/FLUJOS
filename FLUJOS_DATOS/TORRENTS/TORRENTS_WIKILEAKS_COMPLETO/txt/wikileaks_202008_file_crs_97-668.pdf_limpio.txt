add three countries poland the czech republic and hungary to the alliance the national legislatures of the current 16 current member countries must now approve the enlargement one major question being considered is how much expansion might cost early in 1997 the clinton dministration sent to congress report detailing its rationale and cost estimate s for nato enlargement the report noted that with the collapse of the soviet threat nato has reoriented itself from static defense posture suitable during the cold war to more flexible and mobile set of capabilities t respond to different types of threats the administration maintains that this ne w strategic concept dovetails with the task of extending nato membership to ne w entrants through measures that will permit them to defend themselves and integrate with nato forces and through enhancing the allia nces ability to project ground and air power the report estimated enlarge ment costs between 1997 and 2009 at 27 35 billion of this the us share is projected to be 1520 billion two other us organizations rand and the congressional budget offic cbo also estimated expansion co sts but used wider range of threat assumptions and scenari and came up with different results the rand cost estimates ranged from 10110 billion while cbo costs were from 21 billion to 125 billion although the rand autho rs present series of increasingly ambitious deployments their report highlights 42 billion joint airground power projection program similar to the type of defense posture outlined by the clinton administration i t appears that if the cbo had used the same reduced threat assumption for it s comparable defense posture its estimate would have been over 60 billion part of the cost d isparity may arise from different perceptions of what constitutes n adequat defense also it would appear that more microlevel assumptions those regarding specific types of weapon systems and equipment necessary ca n have major effect on aggregate costs in december 1997 nato announced that its staff had estimated the 10yea r cost of enlargement at 15 billion unlike the other studies this one did not include the aggregate deployment expenses of individual member countries but focuse d strictly on increased costs for natos common budget to fund programs for ne w members the us department of defense reportedly has concurred with the new nato estimate as they debate expansion policymakers may encounter some longerterm issues that will affect costs including the timing of expenditures associated wit h expansion possible economic benefits

nato is mutual defense pact under article v of the treaty if one of the members is attacked each member will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith individually and in concert with the other parties such action as it deems necessary including the use of armed force to restor and maintain the security of the north atlantic area3 for four decades after the treaty was signed the most likel aggressor was considered to be the former soviet union with the collapse of the soviet union and th warsaw pact however there is general agreement today that the threat has greatly diminished accordingly natos central mission has become less urgent twelve co untries in central and eastern europe have indicated desire to join nato they regard membership not only as an important security guarantee bu t also as sign of acceptance by and means f political and economic integration with the west most current nato countries believe that enlargement will not onl strengthen the

money curren t nato mbers including the united states also face budgetary and political constrain ts and have been reducing their defense spending in recent years conseque ntly one major factor that policymakers are taking into account as the deliberate the pros and cons of enlargement is how much expansion may cost on february 24 1997 the clinton administration sent to congress repor t detailing its rationale and cost estimates for nato expansion the document 5 which may be viewed as the presidents statement of us policy outlines the defense posture the administration believes is necessary presents the likely costs for it s scenario and estimates the share of costs that would be assumed by the unite d states its allies and new members when the report was released some members of congress took issue with the administrations conclusions they were particularly critical of the cost estimates which they asserted were unrealistically modest members have also expressed concern that the united states might end up bearin g disproportionate share of the cost of expansion other members however believe that the administrations cost proje ctions are reasonable and that the price would be moderate particularly in comparison to what the alliance and individual membe r countries were spending before the berlin wall fell this report describes the administrations proposal and presents the finding s of three other st udies that sought to estimate the costs of expansion but which used wider range of threat assumptions and came up with different results it the n discusses some of the major factors that likely will affect the cost of expansion compares the assumptions of the three studies and presents some longerterm issues that policymakers may encounter the clinton administrations cost estimates at the outset of its report to congress the administratio n points out that nato has been undergoing transformation from defense posture suited to the cold war to one that is adaptable to new strategic vironment the alliance has shifted from static defense mainly centered in former west germany to one that entail s maintain ing continuous capacity to project power both in the context of mutua lhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97668crs3 report to congress on nato enlargement p 86 report to congress on nato enlargement p 107 report to congress on nato enlargement p 128defense commitments as well as nonarticle v missions the administratio n describes natos new strategic concept adopted in 1991 as an ability t respond rapidly and flexi bly by reinforcing areas where forces are needed this6 new focus is reflected in administration estimates of the costs of admitting ne w members the administration contends that adding members to the alliance will confe r several benefits to the united states to europe at large and to the centraleaster n region in particular enlargement it is argued will help foster political stability consolidate democracy improve intraregional relations strengthen collectiv defense enhance burdensharing and promote economic prosperity in devel oping its cost estimates the administration assumes that enlargement will take place in european securi ty environment in which there is current threat of largescale conventional aggression and where any such threat would take year s to develop with significant threat on the horizon nato will extend articl e7 v assurances to new members through improving its ability to send reinforcements if necessary rather than through stationing substantial forces in the new territories natos task in this plan is to enable new entrants to be able to operate wit h nato forces and for current nato allies to be able to provide and support suc h reinforcements8 throughout the period 19972009 the administration envisions two phases to accommodat expanded membership under these terms during the first phase t be completed by 2001 nato will aim at achieving an initial capability of ensuring that the alliance will co ntinue to be able to meet article v commitments this phase would focus on highpriority actions that will provide some degree of interoperability and limited capabilities for new members to defend themselves with the help of th alliance these measures are to be funded by natos common budget and by th new members beginning with accession nato would also seek to develop over 10 year period mature capability which will further enhance interoperabilit through such steps as equipment replacement and force modernization an d restructuring this process will involve expenditures by current and new members as well as common nato funding the administration lists several priorities for attaining interoperability new members wil l need to train and exercise with alliance forces to become familiar with nato procedures they also wi ll need to integrate with natos command control communications and intelligence c3i network be able to receive and suppor t nato troops operate with the alliances air defense system and field combat an d logistical support the goal will be not only to ensure that these countries can help nato defend their borders but also to enable them to deploy their own forces t assist nato in both mutual defense and nonarticle v missionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97668crs4 report to congress on nato enlargement p 12 the identity of the

on decisions by nato new member states and the united states congress see report to congress on nato enlargement p 15 one analyst has noted that the costs for strengthening regional reinforcement

pay for their own forces an d share the costs of infrastructure improvements and other common activities would apply and 4 some of the activities eg language training and air traffic contro l upgrades are already underway the administration states that its estimates are based not on total defens spending but on two types of measures that are associated with enlargement th first those that would take place whether new members are added or not and th second those that are tied directl to expansion it breaks these measures down into three categories 1 new members military restructuring 2 nato regiona l reinforcement capabilities and 3 direct enlargement measures to restructure nd modernize new members armed forces the administration estimates that from 19972009 it would cost between 800 million and 1 billio n annually or total of 1013 billion this will include such measures s modernization of ground forces including artillery armor and ammunition procureme nt by each country of surfacetoair missiles and one squadron of combat aircraft and training the cost of these steps would be borne by the new countries10 the us study reemphasizes the point that many of these measures would b undertaken with or without expansion for nato regional reinforcement capabilities the administration estimate s alliance costs of 600800 million per year or 810 billion total this estimate i s based on the stated goal of being able to deploy and sustain notional force of four divisions and six nato fighter wings to reinforce new members in the event of threat because the united states is already fully prepared to deploy such forces these costs would fall largely on current nato allies according to th administra tion like restructuring and modernization most of these steps it i s reasoned would take place regardless of expansion plans as they are applicable t natos evolving strategy regarding nonarticle v missions they are based n earlier allied commitments to force goals implied by natos 1991 new strategi c concept11httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97668crs5 for further information s ee us library of congress congressional research service12 partnership for peace by paul gal

to attain mature capability these costs consist of upgrading andor ensuring interoperability of command control communications and intelligence c3i air defense systems logistics support reinforcement reception infrastructure and exercise facilities and staging th report estimates that about 40 of the costs for direct enlargement activities would be paid by individual member countries both current and new to improve their own forces and th remaining 60 would be financed by nato common funds for infrastruc ture divided in this manner the new countries would pay about 35 2303 50 million per year or 345 billion total current allies other than th united states would contribute 50 350425 million per year or 455 5 billion total and the united states share would be 15 150200 million annually or 1520 billion total because common funding of nato activities woul d commence only after accession in 1999 the us contribution is reckoned over th 10year period 20002009 total costs for the administrations scenario consequently range from 2 7 billion to 35 billion of which new members would pay 13175 billion curren t allies 125155 billion and the united states 1520 billion the administration notes that its estimates exclude programs in support f relation s with eastern and central european countries as well as us funding fo r natos partnership for peace program since neither is directly related to nat enlargement12 the administration also concedes that enlargement costs could increase r decrease considerably if one or more of its assumptions were off for example although it is not anticipated direct territorial threat to nato members would prompt substant ial response costs in addition if more or fewer countries13 were to join in the first enlar gement tranche than assumed costs would rise above or fall below the estimates alternative cost estimates two other us organizations the congressional budget office and the rand corporation also attempted to assess the likely cost of expansion their estimates ran from low of 10 billion to top figure of 125 billion this enormous rang is due to differences in threat scenarios as well as other fundamental assumptions it should also be noted that two of the reports those by the administration an d rand promote enlargement of nato while the congressional budget offic study is neutral on the question most

congressional budget office in march 1996 the congressional budget office cbo published the cost s of expanding the nato alliance study that estimates the amounts that would be14 necessary to fund several possible expansion scenarios the report opens with discussion of the pros and cons of wide range of future options for nato fro m disbandin g the alliance to expanding it slowly or rapidly to opening the door t admit russia the subsequent cost analyses focus on expanding the alliance t include the four countries consider ed most likely at the time the analysis was written poland hungary the czech republic and slovakia often collectively referred to as the visegrad countries after the hungarian town where their leaders first t in 1991 and agreed on measures for regional cooperation cbo states that although the threat to the alliance has diminished drasticall since 1989 natos article v its mutual defense provision is still viewed as the core mission and expansion would necessarily extend the security guarantee to new entrants cb assumes two levels of threat regional dangers which are more likely and much less lik ely threat from russia the only power with the potential to mount significant thr eat to the alliance the varying perceptions among defense analysts of these threats give rise to several possible defense postures the cb study presents five scenarios wi th cumulative costs that is the cost of each is added to the previous ones costs are calculated for the period 19962010 option 1 strengthen visegrad defense forces and provide for nat reinforce ment 606 billion the most fundamental and least costly singl scenario option 1 envision s current nato members assisting the four abovenamed countries in defending themselves against border skirmish with neighbor or limited war with regional power15 cbo notes that most defense analysts agree that three steps should b considered key to enabling western nato allies to assist and send reinforcement s in the event of an attack on one of the new members the first involves instruction in nato military doctrine and procedures as well as largescale exercises with the alliance the second consists of improvements in and interoperability of ne w members c3i systems finally the new countries would need to upgrade their ai rhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97668crs7 costs of expanding the nato

given cbos assumptions various improvements in military capability ar presumed necessary under option 1 nearly onethird 192 billion of the cost of this option is dedica ted to upgrading equipment of new members and current allies and acquiring new stocks including such items as fighter aircraft and antitan k weaponry in addition cbo also includes 5 billion for tanker aircraft for inflight refuelin g of nato tactical fighters route to assist besieged new member an d nearly 7 billion for improving polands army and navy in order for the new members to receive supplies and reinforcements fro m nato the alliance would also likely need to upgrade infrastructure in the ne w member states which would consist of making improvements in transportation and fueling systems including roads ports airfields railways and pipelines cb budgets 3 billion for such work cbo also factors in 47 billion for th construction of training facilities and 06 billion for purchase of fuel an d ammunition stocks cbo estimates the total cost of option 1 at 606 billion over 15 years of which the united s tates would contribute 48 billion the new members 420 billion and other members 138 billion the report acknowledges that it might be politicall infeasible for some nato members old and new to increase their defens spending drastically and that with the current low levels of threat to this region this lowercost approach might be adequate however the study adds that if16 nato chose simply to provide for minimum defense capability by employing the first three ini tiatives c3i air defense and training the estimated cost of expansion would fall to 212 billion of which the us share would be 19 billion option 2 project nato air power east to defend the v isegrad states 792 billion according to cbo options 25 would attempt to provide an article v defense against an aggressive and militarily potent russia under cbos second17 scenario nato would project air power eastward by creating prepared or colocated operating bases cobs this would permit nato aircraft from western states to fly into and operate from new member states in time of crisis allowing nat aircraft to operate directly out of the eastern territories would obviate the need fo r purchasing tankers cited in the first option creating natostandard cobs which would include staging exercises and providing fuel and ammunition storag would add 186 billion to the first option 46 billion of which would be pai d by the united states option 3 project power eastward with ground forces based in germany 1093 billion option 3 adds ground forces to air power by enabling nearly all of natos 11 divisions to move from germany to the visegrad states in the event of an attack this option would not require troop buildup

stocks of equip ment would be moved from their current west european locations to newly built storage facilities in the visegrad countries at an additional cost of 1 2 billion with 290 million of it

review the cumulative totals for the cbo scenarios are option 1606 billion option 2792 billion option 31093 billion option 41105 billion and option 51247 billion rand in the aut umn 1996 issue of survival three analysts at rand non governmental research or ganization published another study of the possible costs of nato expansion they observe that some critics of enlargement have bee n18 arguing that the costs of adding new members would be prohibitive and counter that expandin g the alliance is not just financial calculation but also political an d strategic one they also note that some of the costs of enlargement may be offset19 by savings in some areas and that the alternative of not adding new members might result in higher costs for individual member countries like cbo the rand authors posit series of enlargement options rathe r than assigning single cost estimate to each option however rand provide s funding rang for each based on different policy choices rand also assumes the visegrad four to be the most likely new members though acknowledging tha t slovakias chances had clearly diminished20 the rand study develops cost estimates based on menu of policy choice s regarding the path to enlargement chosen by nato the military strategy selected and the accompanying defense posture the rand authors discuss analytica l frameworks for different defense postures political rationales and militar requirements and the political and military tradeoffs and cost distribution httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97668crs9 in general the rand analysts contend th at the cost of nato expansion would be relatively moderate they do not envision the need for buildup of forces in the foreseeable future in addition some of the expansion measures can be made to fit in with changes that nato aspirant states likely will be making regardless f whether they soon become members of the alliance given the reduced threa t environment these countries will continue to downsize and streamline their arme d forces importantly as they restructure and modernize t hey can do so in consultation with the alliance so that any changes will ensure eventual interoperability rand attempts to place expansion costs in perspective by making severa l points first the report argues it costs less for country to act in concert with n alliance than for it to rely solely on its own resources for defense secondly the cost of expansion is small relative to the total amount that the alliances wealthy member states already devote each year approximately 160 billion by the europeans to their national defense budgets finally the types of changes needed t accommodate the visegrad nations would dovetail with natos changing strategy which now aims at being able to project mobile forces over distance both within and perhaps beyond the european continent rand believes that four tasks will define what needs to be done t accommodat natos old and new missions under expansion first of all the new entrants armed forces must be prepared for merging with nato this will involv modernizing aging equipment and purchasing new weapon systems as well as taking other steps that will ensure that the new members forces are compatible wit h natos second the infrastructure in the new territories must be upgraded an d configured for nato needs third provisions must be made so that nato forces limited to command staff and support troops may be based in the ne w countries and fourth natos current forces must be rec onfigured to project power toward the new countries the rand study then posits four alternative defense postures somewha t similar to those constructed by cbo rand also develops increasingly ambitiou s scenarios but provides additional flexibility within each option for example in th first option two types of surfacetoair missiles are considered and under option 2 costs vary according to the number of fighter wings employed option 1 the selfdefense support option assumes that new member states will be responsible for defending the ir own borders and that western nato member assistance might be limited to aiding in such key areas as c3i and logistics however the alliance might provide other forms of aid such as assisting new members develop better air defenses infrastructure muniti ons reserves and helping them improve their readiness option 1 costs range from 1020 billion option 2 as in the cbo study rands second option adds air power through such steps as the upgrading of european ir wings and the construction of colocated operating bases with munitions storage f acilities in the new member territories once more the cost of this option would depend on the extent of the forces used if 5 fighter wings were readied for eastward deployment in the event of crisis cost s would go up to 20 billion if 10 fighter wings were equipped costs would rise t 30 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97668crs10 what will nato enlargement cost p 1521 what will nato enlargement cost

to perform broad spectru m of missions in eastern europe ranging from border defense to peacekeeping an d crisis managem ent rand estimated that costs for this option would range from21 3052 billion the higher estimate would combine 10 nato divisions with 1 0 fighter wings middle option with 42 billion price tag is discussed in som detail option 4 under the fourth and final option set up to address worst cas scenario nato would move significant forces both land and air eastward estimated costs for this option range from 55 billion to 110 billion the latte r estimate ar ises from forward deployment of the 10 divisions and air wings of option 3 rand points out however that because there is imminent threat such posture is clearly not needed today22 the rand authors argue that the defense po sture nato ultimately adopts will depend upon the interaction of the political and strategic approaches chosen by the alliance rand identifies three political approaches to enlargement n evolutionary path that assumes imminent security threat in the area promot stability track that sees nato membership playing key role in fosterin g democra cy and security in the region and strategic response that would b appropriate only if russia were to emerge as threat in accordance with thes politica l considerations policymakers must decide which military threat to prepar for lowintensity local conflicts regional dangers which might be comprised of coalitio n of mediumsize powers or theater threat which could be presented b russia allied with the commonwealth of independent states the rand analysts believe that an assessment of the political and military situation as presented b these six conditions will help determine which defense posture would be mos t consistent and effective rand argues that if expans ion is to proceed it would be preferable for nato to make decision early so that the alliance and those whom it invites to begi n negotiations over membership would have more preparation time corollary to this earlier membership would mean that total enlargement costs would be spread ove r longer time period thereby reducing the size of annual payments on the topic of burdensharing the authors note that member states currently are responsibl for funding their own forces and pay share of the nato commo n infrastructure costs the amou nt that any given country will contribute to expansion will depend upon how large its share is of the common infrastructure budget an d upon how extensively its forces will be used thus under the first option self defense support larger share of the burden would be borne by the new members while projecting air andor ground forces would entail greater expenses by curren t members under rands abovementioned 42 billion middle

nato p rovide different and quite disparate cost ranges to recapitulate the clinton administration estimates the price of ex pansion at between 27 billion and 35 billion the congressional budget office puts it at 21126 billion rand suggests 10110 billion while nat claims 15 billion will suffice why are there such enormous differences part of the answer is that two fundamentally dissimilar approaches were used the cbo and rand studies sketch several different types of possible threa t environme nt they posit what they believe would be the necessary steps to counter the various threats and then calculate the approximate costs for each step on the other hand t he clinton administration and in all likelihood nato more narrowly define the threat based on intelligence projections and political judgments and the implied defense posture leading to much narrower range of estimated costs another part of the answer lies in what the studies have counted and what they left out for example an august 1997 general accounting office gao repor t stated that our analysis of dods cost estimate to enlarge nato indicates that its key assumptions were generally reasonable and were largely consistent with th views of us nato and foreign government officials however the repor t26 faulted the defense depar tment for including expenditures such as those needed for allies force modernization that would have been made regardless of enlargement httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97668crs12 however the picture in the candidate countries may still be somewhat clouded although27 the admin

for not including such things as support for the partnership for peace progra m and us military assistance to potential future nato members the nato study constitutes another example of analys ts counting certain costs while omitting thers nato staff appear to have agreed with the administrations assessment of low security threat and their analysts estimated common costs accordingly however the 15 billion nato estimate should not be compared to the administrations overall estimate of 2735 billion but rather to just that par t which was devoted to direct enlargement costs eligible for common funding s noted earlier that amount was estimated at 60 of 912 billion which equals 54 72 billion also us fense secretary cohen told congress in october 1997 that the upcomi ng nato cost assessment likely would be lower than the clinto n administratio ns because the latters had included slovakia which did not make the final cut secretary cohen added that the three invitees also had made progress on interoperability27 numerous factors will affect any study of the cost of enlarging nato n understanding of the underlying assumptions is key since the alliance as whole is still addressing large number of issues that will guide funding needs threat the type of deployment nato deems appropriate will be shaped by th evolving perceptions of current and future threats to the alliance is resurgen t russia the major power to be guarded against if so then would an attack originate in the kola peninsula where large share of the former warsaw pact forces an d equipment were re located and then sweep down across the plains of poland what kind of troops and ar maments would the russians be able to muster if they launched an invasion would nato face an endless wave of modern tanks supported by state oftheart fighter aircraft if such threat is not imminent when might russia which according to many analysts is too weak to p ose serious threat today be able to rebuild its military should the alliance be looking instead to its south which28 29 are the more likely sc enarios border clashes or civil ethnic strife as in the former yugoslavia the greater and more geographic ally dispersed the perceived threat the more extensive the likely deployment and the steeper the cost none of the studies specifies that russia or any other country will pos signific ant threat to any

whic h substanti ally raises costs they add however that russias military has suffere d from deep troop cutbacks low morale obsolescent and illmaintained equipment and reductions in training the authors of the rand study maintain that the cbo work is aimed mainl at defending against russia whereas their approach is not threat but rather goal and capabilitybased anchored in the premise of

with lowintensity local conflicts regional dangers comprised of group of mediumsize powers and theater threat composed f russia in league with allies deployment perhaps the major immedi ate factor driving costs is the potential deployment of forces what kind of military support will be offered by current members to the new countries and what will be expected of them in return does nato intend simply to transport reinforcements to any of the new members if they are attacked at the opposite end of the spectrum would nato in changed security environment envision stationing significant number of troops and aircraft in the new territory the more troops and equipment involved in defending the new entrants the mor expensive the expansion because the cbo and rand studies offer menu of choices for threa t scenarios they also provide variety of different possible deployments there is an apparent consensus on two matters 1 at minimum the alliance should help th new members prepare to defend

are geared toward an increasingly formidable threat the addition of first air power and then ground forces of prepositioning equipment and f stationing troops each boosts costs considerably although the rand authors also present series of increasingly ambitiou s deployments their report highlights 42 billion joint airground power projection program similar to the type of defense posture outlined by the clinto n administration estimated to cost 2735 billion this points up an important difference among the studies the cbo study s roughly comparable joint power projection scenario the third option assessed t 109 billion would still likely cost significantly more than the selfdefens support option set at about 61 billion even if similar threat assumptions wer used why are there such large di fferences for similar defense posture part of the cost disparity may arise from different perceptions among defense analysts of wha t constitutes an adequate defense it would appear that more microleve l35 assumptions those rega rding the specific types of weapon systems and equipment that would be necessary can have major ef fect on aggregate costs for example cbo assumes that for an appropriate air defense new members would need t acquire modern patriot surfacetoair missiles whereas the administration assumes the use of older and cheaper ihawk type missiles the rand stud contrasts the costs of pat riots versus far less expensive russian air defense system new members other factors affecting cost include the number of new states to be added who will join where they are located how large they are and when they will becom member s generally speaking the more countries that are added the higher th initial cost of providing mutual security also it would cost less to add

numbers significa ntly the rand report notes that the marginal cost of including slovakia would be small37 burdensharing particu larly thorny issue is the distribution of costs among members nearly all of the current member states have been paring back their defense spending since the end of the cold war and the prospective members are busy repairing th economic damage wrought by fo ur decades of communism and will be hardpressed to undertake large increases in their defense budgets if member state perceives that it is bearing disproportionate share of the burden its legislature may be less likely to ratify the agreement in general all three studies and according to cbo nato staff as well assume that the incoming countries will bear large share of the costs f enlargement that i nfrastructure improvements will be paid for in part out of one of natos common funds the security investment program sip and that current member countries will be responsible for financing the use of their own forces there are some differences however among the three us reports on th distribution of costs the clinton administration as noted above assumes that standard nat costsharing ru would be applied for new defense arrangements ie individual nato nations pay for their own forces while costs for infrastructure are shared where they qualify for common funding the executive branch report concede s38 that these costs woul d of course increase if there were dramatic increase in the threat or decision by the united states to bear larg er share of the costs than would otherwis fall on our

authors argue the defens posture and implied d eployment and budget that nato ultimately adopts will depend upon the interaction of the political and strategic approaches chosen additional considerations number of other i ssues may be raised as policymakers assess the likely future costs of nato expansion timing when will the bills come due will they be spread out fairly evenly over th transition period to mature capability or will they be heavily front loaded member countries it has been argued may spend less on their own armed force s because they are members of nato once the alliance has expanded and been made interoperable national defense spending by individual countries may not need to be as high as would be the case if they were not part of nato because missions and responsibilities are rationalized through specialization is it possible that allianc costs could actually f all off in the out years as the new nations militaries modernize and become interoperable and their economies grow stronger or might th introduction of more sophisticated and costlier defense technology increas funding needs savings will there be any offsetting savings for the united states or other member s states it is likely that portion of the costs of joining nato paid by the ne w entrants would flow back into the us ec onomy for example as they upgrade their air defenses new members will need to buy electronic systems surfacetoai r missiles and fighter aircraft some of these will likely be procured from america n manufacturers which would indirectly offset the economic
