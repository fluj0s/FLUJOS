established mechanism by which congress can review and disapprove by mean s of an expedited legislative process virtually all federal agency rules this was part of the contract with america critics have questioned the efficacy of the review scheme as vehicle to control agency rulemaking through the exercise of legisl ative oversight these questions have been raised despite the use of the cra to nullify oshas controversial ergonomics standard in march 2001 it has been ar gued that the action on the osha proposal was the result of unique confluence of ci rcumstances not likely to soon recur the white house and both houses of congress in the hands of the same political party contentious rule promulgated in the wa ning days of an outgoing administration longstanding opposition to the rule by some in congress and by broad coalition of business interests and encour agement of repeal by the president on the other hand some maintain that number of major rules have been affected by agency recognition of the availability of the review mechanism and argue that the review scheme has had sign ificant influence critics who maintain that the cra has not been appropriately utilized assert that the current procedure provides for ex pedited consideration in the house of representatives lacks screening mechanism to identify rules that may require special congressional attenti on and that disapproval re solution of significant or politically sensitive rule is likely to need supermajority to be successful if control of the white house and the congress are in different political hands they further contend that number of critical interpretive issues and questions remain to be resolved including the scope of the provisi ons coverage of rules whether an agency failure to report covered rule is subject to court review and sanc tion whether joint resolution of disapproval may be utilized to veto parts of rule or only may be directed at the rule in its entirety and what is the scope of the limitation that precludes an agency from promulgating substantially similar rule after disapproval of rule from these critic s perspective potential impediments and uncertainties have contributed to the fact that of total of 47 joint resolutions of disapproval that have been introduced to date since april 1996 only one has passed they point out that during that peri od over 47540 major and nonmajor rules have been reported and become effectivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30116crs2 1 section 8043 excludes from the definition any rule of particular applicability including rule that approves or prescribes fo r the future rates wages prices services or allowance therefore corporate or financia l structures reorganizations mergers or acquisitions thereof or accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing b any rule relating to agency management or personnel or c any rule of agency organization or practice that does not substan tially affect the rights or obligations on non agency parties 2 attorney generals manual on the administrative procedure act 13 1948 3 avoyelles sportmsmens league inc v marsh 715 f2d 897 5th cir 1983 this report will provide brief explanation of how the review scheme was expected to operate and describe how it has been utilized the possible reasons for the relatively limited use of the formal review mechanism thus far are assessed many do not support increased utilization of the cra review process those holding this opinion may represent num ber of views including concern that expanded use of the process will lead to the disproportionate influence on federal regulations by powerful intere st groups or that many re gulations have become too technical to be judged by nonexperts however since these positions have seldom been articulated publicly the are not well represented in this report review of agency rules the congressional review mechanism codified at 5 usc 801808 and popularly known as the congressional review act cra requires that all agencies promulgating covered rule must submit report to each house of congress and to the comptroller general cg that contains copy of the rule concise general statement describing the rule including whether it is deemed to be major rule and the proposed effective date of the rule c overed rule cannot take effect if the report is not submitted section 801a1a ach house must send copy of the report to the chairman and ranking minority member of each jurisdictional committee section 801a1c in addition the pr omulgating agency must submit to the cg 1 complete copy of any costbenefit an alysis 2 description of the agencys actions pursuant to the requirements of the regulatory flexibility act and the unfunded mandates reform ac t of 1995 and 3 any other relevant information required under any other act or executive order such information must also be made available to each house section 801a1b section 8043 adopts the definition of rule found at 5 usc 5514 which provides that the term rule means the whole or part of an agency statement of general applicability and future effect designed to implement interpret or prescribe law or policy1 the legislative history of section 5514 indicates that the term is to be broadly construed the definition of rule is not limited to substantive rules but embraces interpretive organizational and procedural rules as well2 the courts have recognized the breadth of the term indicating that it encompasses virtually every statement an agency may make3 including interpretive and substantive rules

2002 opinion letter to hon edward m kennedy chairman senate committee on health education labor and pensions from anthony h gamboa general counsel the situation involved department of health and human services hhs major rule published in the federal register on january 18 2002 with an announced effective date of march 29 2002 the house of representatives however did not receive the rule until february 14 2002 hhs thereafter delayed the effective date of the rule until april 15 2002 in an attempt to comply with th cra but the senate did not receive the rule until march 15 2002 the general counsel determined that the rule could not become effective until may 14 2002 60 days following the senates receipt relying on the language of section 801a1a of the act requiring that copy of covered rule must be be submitted to each house of congress in order to become effectivetypes of actions thus broad range of agency action is potentially subject to congressional review the comptroller general and the administrator of the office of information and regulatory affairs oira of the office of management and budg et have particular responsibilities with respect to major rule defined as rule that will likely have an annual effect on the economy of 100 million or more increase costs or prices for consumers industries or state and local g overnments or have significant adverse effects on the economy the determination of whether rule is major is assigned exclusively to the administrator of oira s ection 8042 if rule is deemed major by the oira administrator the cg must prepare report for each jurisdictional committee within 15 calendar days of the submission of the agency report required by section 801a1 or its publication in the federal register whichever is later the statute requires that the cgs report shall include an assessment of the agencys compliance with the procedural step s required by section 801a1b4 section 801a2a the cg has interpreted hi s duty under this provision relatively narrowly as requiring that he determine wh ether the prescribed action has been taken ie whether required costbenefit anal ysis has been provided and whether the required actions under the regulatory flexib ility act the unf unded mandates reform act of 1995 and any ot her relevant requirements under any other legislation or executive orders were taken not to examine the substantive adequacy of the actions the designation of rule as major also affects its effective date major rule may become effective on the latest of the following scenarios 1 60 calendar days after congress receives the report s ubmitted pursuant to section 801a15 or after the rule is published in the federal register 2 if congress passes joint resolution of disapproval and the presid ent vetoes it the earlier of when one house votes and fails to override the veto or 30 calendar days after congress receives the vetohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30116crs4 6 reviewing courts have generally applied the administrative procedure acts good cause exemption from which this language is obviously taken narrowly in order to prevent agencies from using it as an escape clause fro m notice and comment requirements see eg action on smoking and health v cas 713 f2d 795 800 dc cir 1987 however since section 805 precludes judicial review for an determination finding action or omission under this chapter there could be court condemnation of good cause determination but the rule would still be subject to congressional vacation and retroactive nullification 7 in leisegang v secty of veterans affairs 312 f3d 1368 13731376 fed cir 2002 the appeals court held that section 801a3 does not change the date on which major rule becomes effective it only affects the date wh the rule becomes operative in other words the cra merely provides 60day waiting period before the agency may enforce the major rule so that congress has the opportunity to revi ew the regulation at issue in the case was the date from which certain veterans benefits would be calculated the benefit statute provided that it would be the date of the issu ance of the rule the government argued that the cra was superceding statute and that the effective date was when the cra allowed it to be operative the appeals court agreed w ith the veterans that the date of issuance as prescribed by the law was determinativemessage or 3 the date the rule would ot herwise have taken ffect unless joint resolution is enacted section 801a3 thus the earliest major rule can become effective is 60 calendar days after the later of the submission of the report requi red by section 801a1 or its publication in the federal register unl ess some other provision of the law provides an exception for an earlier date three possibilities exis t under section 8082 an agency may determine that rule should become ffective notwithstanding section 801a3 where it finds good cause that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable unnecessary or contrary to the public interest6 second the president may determine that rule s hould take effect earlier becau of an imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency to insure the enforcement of the criminal laws for national security purposes or to implement an international trade agreement section 801c finally third route is available under section 801a5 which provides that the effective date of rule shall not be delayed by operation of this chapter beyond the date on which either h ouse of congress votes to reject joint resolution of disappr oval under section 8027 all other rules take effect as otherw ise allowed by law after having been submitted to congress under ction 801a1 section 801a4 under the administrative procedure act final rule may go into effect 30 days after it is published in the federal regist er in final form 5 usc 553d an agency in its discretion may delay the effec tiveness of rule for long er period or it may put it into effect immediately if good cause is shown all covered rules are subject to disapproval even if they have gone into effect congress has reserved to itself review pe riod of at least 60 days moreover if rule is reported within 60 sessi on days of adjournment of the senate or 60 legislative days of adjournment of the house th period during which congress may consider and pass joint resolution of disapproval is extended to the next succeeding session of the congress section 801d1 such held over rules are treated as if they were published on the 15th session day of the senate and the 15th legislative day of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30116crs5 8 for an indepth discussion of procedural issues that may arise during house and senate consideration of disapproval resolutions see richard s be th crs report rl31160 disapproval of regula tions by congress procedure u nder the congressional review act october10 2001 archived 9 there is some question whether motion to proceed is nondebatable because of the absence of language so stating arguably the nondebatability of the motion is integral both continuedhouse in the succeeding session and as t hough report under section 801a1 was submitted on that date section 801d2a e2 but held over rule takes effect as otherwise provided 801d3 the opportunity for congress to consider and disapprove is simply extended so that it has full 60 session or legislative days to act in any session if joint resolution of disapproval is enacted into law the rule is deemed not to have had any effect at any time section 801 f if rule that is subject to any statutory regulatory or j udicial deadline for its promulgation is not allowed to take effect or is terminated by the passage of joint resolution any deadline is extended for one year after the date of enactment of the joint resolution section 803 rule that does not take effect or is not tinued because of passage of disapproval resolution may not be reissued in substant ially the same form indeed before any reissued or new rule that is substantially the same as disapproved rule can be issued it must be specifically authorized by law enacted subsequent to the disapproval of the original rule section 801b2 section 802a spells out the process fo r an up or down vote on joint resolution of disapproval8 joint resolution of disapprova l must be introduced within 60 calendar days excluding days either hous of congress is adjourned for more than three days during session of congress after the agency reports the rule to the congress in compliance with section 801a 1 timely introduc tion of disapproval resolution allows each house 60 session or legi slative days to consider it through use of expedited consideration procedures and if passed allows retroactive nullification of an effective rule and the limitation on an agency from promulgating substantially similar rule without subsequent congressi onal authorization to do so by law the law provides an expedited considera tion procedure for the senate if the committee to which joint resolution is referred has not reported it out within 20 calendar days after referral it may be discharged from further consideration by written petition of 30 members of the senate at which point the measure is placed on the calendar after committee report or discharge it is in order at any time for motion to proceed to consideration all poi nts of order against the joint resolution and against consideration of the measure are waived and the motion is not subject to debate amendment post ponement or to motion to proceed to other business if the motion to consider is agreed to it remains as unfinished business of the senate until disposed of section 802d1 debate on the floor is limited to 10 hours amendments to the resolution and motions to postpone or to proceed to other business are not in order section 802d2 at the conclusion of debate an up or down vote on the joint resolution is to be taken section 802d39httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30116crs6 9 continued to the scheme of the expedited procedure provisions as well as to the overall efficacy of the cras statutory scheme and thus may be imp lied alternatively debate on such motion may be limited by section 803d2 which limits debate on joint resolutions as well as all debatable motions to 10 hours ultimately resolution of this question would be made by the senate parliamentarian or the senate itself however at the commencement of the debate on sjres 6 to disapprove the ergonomic s rule the presiding officer declared that the motion to proceed is not debatable th question is on agreeing to the motion the motion was agreed to 147 cong rec s 1831 d aily ed march 6 2001 at least one other precedent exists in which it was ruled that motion to proceed to budget resolution under the budget act was nondebatable despite the silence of the act on the matter see 127 cong rec s 4871 may 12 1981 10 see discussion infra at pp 2429 11 general accounting office reports on federal agency major rules which may be found at httpwwwgaogovdecisionsmajrulemajrulehtmthere is special procedure for expe dited consideration and processing of joint resolutions in the house but if one house passes joint resolution before the other house acts the measure of the other house is not referred to committee the procedure of the house receiving joint resolution shall be the same as if joint resolution had been received from the other house but the vote on final passage shall be on the joint resolution of the other house section 802f12 section 805 precludes judicial review of any determination finding action or omission under this chapter this would insulate from court review for example determination by the oira administrator th at rule is major or not presidential determination that rule should beco effective immediately an agency determination that good cause requires rule to go into effect at once or question as to the adequacy of comptroller generals assessment of an agencys report the legislative history of this provision indicates that this preclusi on of judicial review would not apply to court challenge to fa ilure of an agency to report rule this appears not to be judicially settled matter10 finally the law provides rule of cons truction that reviewing court shall not draw any inference from congressional failure to enact joint resolution of disapproval with respect to such rule or related statute section 801g utilization of the review mechanism since 1996 as of march 31

components of the industry to be regulated to the ergonomics standards and the willingness and encouragement of president seeking to undo contentious endofterm ru from previous administration in all

the same area which critics believe have introduced uncer tainties and impediments to concerning the use of the process 1 lack of screening mech anism to pinpoint rules that need congressional review proposals for change proponents of an expanded use of the cra process have called for screening mechanism that would alert committees to rules that may raise important or sensitive substantive issues in this view the perceived lack of timely substantive information prevents busy committees from prioritizing such issues the comptroller generals reports on major rules serve as check lists as to whether legally required agency tasks have been done and not as substantive assessments of whether they were done properly or whether the rules accord with congressional intent lack of knowledge of the existence of such sensitive rules by jurisdictional committees or interested members is rarely the case what critics say is absent is in depth scrutiny and analysis of individual rules by an authoritative and presumably neutral source that may provi the basis for triggering meaningful congressional review opponents reject this argument and often conclude that the act in its current form is exactly what congress intended and that lack of action under it does not equate to lack of know ledge of major rules some support for an independent substa ntive screening body was signaled by the introduction by representative sue kelly of hr 1704 in the 105th congress bill that would have established congressional office of regulatory analysis24 the bill was referred to the house judiciary and governmental reform andoversight committees both of which favorably reported differing versions of the legislation 25 both versions would have blished an independent congressional office of regulatory analysis cora to be headed by director appointed by the house speaker and the senate majority leader for term of four years with service in the office limited to more than three terms the

committee would have allowed the cora director to use any data and analyses generated by the federal agency and any data of the office in analyzing the submitted rule both bills provided that similar analysis of nonmajor rules was to be conducted when requested to do so by house or senate committee or by individual members of either house firs t priority for the conduct of such analyses was given to all major rules secondary priority was assigned to committee requests tertiary priority was given individual member requests finally under the judiciary committee version the report was to be fu

that an independent office of regulatory analysis would serve the congressional need for objective information necessary to evaluate agency regulations in their view it would also provide credibility and impetus for wider utilization of the review mechanism further by providing intensive review of certain nonmajor rules the possib ility of oira hiding significant rules by not designating them as major is forestalled those opposing the establishment of an office of this kind would argue that cr eation of new congressional bureaucracy for review purposes would be unnecessarily duplicative of what the agencies have already done as well as extraordinarily expe nsive the requirement of the judiciary committees version that cora do its own costbenefit analysis from scratch could be pointed to as an unknown cost f actor as well as task that may not be possible to perform adequately within the allotted 45 days congress agreed upon limited test of th cora concept late in the 106th congress with the passage of th truth in regulating act of 200027 that legislation established three year pilot project for the general accounting office now renamed the government accountability office gao to

million per year for the program monies had been appropriated and it could not proceed with the request further action was taken on the request and congress never enacted an appropriation thereby foresta lling implementation of the project it may be noted that the 180day reporting period did not sh exactly with the time period under the cra for consideration of rules subject to resolution of

the house si gnificant differences appear however with respect to the roles assigned to the joint committees under hr 3148 the current process established by the cra for congre ssional review of new

joint committee rather than the jurisdictional committees of each house would have received the re port of covered rule s submitted for review by federal agencies as well as cost benefit analyses and other materials jurisdictional committees would receive copi of these materials from the joint committee gao was to submit its report on major rules to the joint committee not the jurisdictional committees concerned major rules could have taken effect earlier than 60 days after the rule was published in the federal register or is received by the joint committee joint resolutions of disapproval ere to be reported by the joint committee to the respective houses for action the joint committee could also report by bill recommendations with respect to matters within the jurisdiction of their respective houses which are referred to the joint committee or otherwise within the jurisdiction of the joint committee it would appear then that the joint committee would have had the predominant role in the congressional review process which might inject highly controversial issue diminution of the role of jurisdictional committees third bill introduced in the 109th congress was hr 931 by representative hayworth which would have prohibited any regulation pr oposed by federal agency from going into effect until bill enacted under expedited cons ideration procedures applicable to to the rule was signed into law the term regulation was given the broad meaning of the term rule as fined in 5 usc 5514 the bill did not specifically reference the current cra process in fact it would have superceded it and required rulemaking agencies to seek approval of all c overed regulations there was provision for congressional processing in timely and expeditious manner potentially huge memb er proposed regulations 2 lack of an expedited house procedure those unsatisfied with the current procedure argue that the current absence of an expedited consideration procedure in the house of representatives may well be factor affecting use of the process in th at body since as practical matter it will mean engaging the house leadership each time rule is deemed important enough by committee or group of members to seek speedy access to the floor in view of the limits both on floor time and the ability to gain the attention of the leadership it is argued that only the most well situated in the body will be able to gain access within the limited period of review29 it is also maintained that perception that action will be taken in the house might deter senate action 3 the

cra review mechanism has been the realization that any joint resolution disapproving rule that does not have the support of the administration would be vetoed and require twothirds vote in each house to override the deterrent potential of the need for supermajority in each house to overcome presidential veto is likely to be significant unless the object of the exercise is simply to provide the impetus for informal accommodations such as occurred in the hcfa surety bond matter or to influence members to support lternative legislati on critics assert th at realization by agencies over time that passage of disapproval resolution is highly unlikely could substantially reduce the efficacy of such threat additionally they maintain that possible consequence of such an assumption is that agencies will not factor in congressional disappr oval as part of the ru development process30 since the ergonomics veto 19 resolutions of disapproval with respect to 14 rules have been introduced only one of which has been acted upon by one house31 which some see as return to the prior practice of using the mechanism to facilitate bargaining thus even with the disapproval of the ergonomics standard critics are concerned about the possible effect of th supermajority requirement some have proposed multitiered disapprova l mechanism that is instead of all rules major or nonmajor being treated qually in that they can only be overturned by joint resolution of disapproval some rules might be designated for more selective special review for example some argue that major or significant rules might be subject to joint resolution of approval under such scheme major or significant rule would not become effective unless join t resolution approving it passed both houses within specified period of time32 to make such scheme effective someone or some body would need the authority to designate which rules are major or significant and thereby subject to the affirmative approval requirement the burden for supporting and justifying such rules would fall on the promulgating agencies all other rules would be subj ect to disapproval resolutions another proposal is to subject all covered rules to congressional approval and establish an expedited procedure whereby noncontrovers ial rules may be sped through leaving only few for close consideration33 4 the reluctance to

the text of the review provision refers to such rule rule or the rule with language expr essly referring to part of any rule under review the procedure leading to vote on the propos ed disapproval resolution allows for amendments and the final vote is up or down on the joint resolution as introduced the legislative history of the provision is similarly uniform in using language that would ordinarily indicate reference to submitted rule in its entirety except in one instance during discussion of the section 802 procedur that would obtain when one house completes its action on joint resolution and sends to it to the other house before the second house has yet to complete any action the following comment is made subsection 802f sets forth one unique provision that does not expire in either house subsection 802f provides procedures for passage of joint resolution of disapproval when one house passes joint resolution and transmits it to the other house that has not yet co mpleted action in both houses the joint resolution of the first house to act sha ll not be referred to committee but shall be held at the desk in the senate housepassed resolution may be considered directly only under normal senate procedures regardless of when it is received by the senate resolution of disapproval that originated in the senate may be considered under the expedited procedures only during the period specified in subsection 802e regardless of the pr ocedures used to consider joint resolution in either house the final vo of the second house shall be on the joint resolution of the first house matter when that vote takes place if the second house passes the resolution conference is necessary and the joint resolution will be presented to the president for his signature

last sentence would appear to contemplate the possibility of conference to resolve differences in resolutions the last sent ence minimizes what those differences could be some have suggested that the explana tion contemplates that parts of rules may be the subject of disapproval resolutions arguing that the framers of the provision would have known that many rules are comp lex and contain variety of provisions only one or few of which may be objec tionable and would not have required whole rulemaking to be brought down simply because of one offending portion out of many it has also been argued that in light of the section 801b2 prohibition against agency issuance of rule in substa ntially the same form after passage of disapproval resolution unless c ongress by subsequent law au thorizes it not allowing rejection of part of rule would have draconian result an up or down vote on the entire rule woul d appear to have been the intent of the framers of the review provision the nguage and structure of the provision and the supporting explanation of the legisl ative history cont emplates speedy definitive and limited process it is not unlike the legislative processes created for congressional actions dealing with military base closings36 international trade agreements37 and presidential reorganization plans38 among others each dealt with complex politically sensitive decisions which allowed only an up or down vote by the congress on the entire package presen ted it was understood that piecemeal consideration would delay nd perhaps obstruct legislativ resolution of the issues before it for similar reasons the statutory structure and legislative history of the review provision strongly indicate that congress intended the process to focus on submitted rules as whole and not to allow veto of individual parts perhaps proper reading of the quoted portion of th legislative history is that it was contemplating the possibility that the blank to be filled in after relating to might have different generic descri ptions of the rule subject to disapproval broader reading of these sentences would not othe rwise appear warranted by either the legislative language itself or the rest of the explanatory legislative history as practical matter if this reading is correct it may be factor in the limited use of the mechanism as indicated nullifying rule means

essential focus of this inquiry is not on the type of rule but on its effect on the rights and obligations of nonagency parties40 the drafters of the legislation indicated their awareness of the practice of agencies avoiding the notification and public participation requi rements of apa noticea ndcomment rulemaking by utilizing the issuance of other documents as means of binding the public either legally or practically41 and noted that it was the intent of the legislation to subject just such documents to congressional scrutiny the committees are concerned that some agencies have attempted to circumvent noticeandcomment requirements by trying to give legal effect to general statements of policy guidelines and agency policy and procedure manuals the committees admonish the ag

precluded its enforcement the government argued th at section 805 was blanket preclusion of judicial review in respons to plaintiffs contention that section 805 only precluded review of any determination finding or mission by congress the court held that the statute provides for j udicial review of any any determination finding action or omission under this chapter not by c ongress under this chapter the court must follow the plain english apparently congress seeks to enforce the cra without the able assistance of the courts48 the court made refere nce to the scheme of the act or its legislative history the texas district courts plain meaning rationale was cited with approval by an ohio district in united states v american electric power service corp 49 that case was one of many

faced the same issue in motion for summary judg ment by the power company defendant rejecting the texas savings and american electric power precedents it found that section 805 is ambiguous and susceptible to two possible meanings that congress did not intend for any court review of an agencys compliance with the cra or that congress only intended to preclude judici review of its own determination findings actions or omissions made under the cra after rule had been submitted to it for review adopting the first alternative argued for by the government and adopted by the texas savings and american electric power courts would according to the court allow agencies to evade the strictures of the cra by simply not reporting new rules and cour ts would be barred from reviewing their lack of compliance this result would be at odds with the purpose of the cra which is to provide check on administrative agencies power to set policies and essentially legislate without congressional oversight the cra has enforcement mechanism and to read it to preclude court from reviewing whether an agency rule is in effect that should have been reported woul d render the statute ineffectual54 the court found that the postenactment legislative hi story buttresses the limited scope of the cras judicial review provision but was careful to acknowledge that the lack of formal legislative history for the cra makes reliance on this joint statement troublesome however the court made it clear that this court reached its conclusion about the limited scope of the judicial review provision of the cra based on the text of the statute and overall purpose of the act the legislative history only serves to further reinfo rce the courts conclusion55 it is certainly arguable that the southern indiana courts view of the limited preclusiveness of section 805 is plausible potentially stronger case can be made from closer analysis of the text and struct ure of the act taken as whole although the court was correct as general matter that post enactment legislative history normally is given less weight there are number of supreme court rulings that recognize that under certain circumstances arguably applicable here contemporaneous explanations of key provi sions intent have been found to be an authoritative guide to statutes construc tion in one instance the court relied on an explanation given eight years afte r the passage of the legislation the plain overarching purpose of th review provision of the cra was to assure that all covers fi nal rulemaking actions of

finds that notice and pub lic procedure are impractical unnecessary or contrary to the public interest sec tion 808 rules promulgated pursuant to the telecommunications act of 1996 are exclude d from the definition of major rule but all such rules must ultimately be submitted for review and while the scheme anticipates that some or even most rules will go into effect before joint resolution of disapproval is passed th law provides that enactment of joint resolution terminates the effectiveness of the rule nd that the rule will be treated as though it had never taken effect sections 801b1 801f further rule that has been nullified cannot be reissued by an agency in substantially the same form unless it is specifically authorized to do so by law after the date of the disapproval section 801b2 the review scheme also requires variet of actions by persons or agencies in support of the review process and time for such actions to be scrutinized by both houses to implement the scheme thus the comptroller general must submit report to congress on each major rule s ubmitted within 15 cale ndar days after its submission or publication of the rule s ection 801a2a the administrator of oira determines whether rule is maj or rule section 8042 and after rule is reported the senate has 60 session days and the hous 60 legislative days to pass disapproval resolution under expedited procedures

of the house prior to the date cong ress adjourns session of the congress the period during which congress may cons ider and pass joint resolution of disapproval is extended to the next succeed ing session of the congress section 801d1 thus the statutory scheme appears gear ed toward congressional review of all covered rules at some time and reading of the statute that allows for easy avoidance

to be neither natural nor warranted reading of the provision s ection 805 speaks to determinations findings actions or omissions under this chapter plain reference to the range of actions authorized

provision limitation on judicial review of congressional or administrative actions section 805 provides that court may not review any congressional or administrative determination finding ac tion or omission under this chapter thus the major rule determinations made by the administrator of the office of information and regulatory affairs of th office of management and budget are not subject to judicial review r may court review whether congress complied with the congressional review proc edures in this chapter this latter limitation on the scope of judicial revi ew was drafted in recognition of the constitutional right of each house of congress to determine the rules of its proceedings us const art i 5 cl 2 which includes each house being the final arbiter of compliance with such rules the limitation on courts review of subsidiary determinations or compliance with congressional procedures however does not bar court from giving effect to resolution of disapprov that was enacted into law court with proper jurisdiction may treat the congressional enactment of joint resolution of disapproval as it would trea t the enactment of any other federal law thus court with proper jurisdiction ma review the resolution of disapproval and the law that authorized the disapproved rule to determine whether the issuing agency has the legal authority to issu substantially different rule the language of subsection 801g is also in structive subsection 801g prohibits court or agency from inferring any inte nt of the congress only when congress does not enact joint resolution of disappr oval or by implication when it has not yet done so in deciding cases or c ontroversies properly before it court or agency must give effect to the intent of the congress when such resolution is enacted and becomes the law of the land the limitation on judicial review in way prohibits court from determining whet her rule is in effect for example the authors expect that court might recognize that rule has legal effect due to the operation of subsections 801a1a or 801a360 the justice department has suggested that such postenactment legislative history should not carry any weight partic ularly in view of the unambiguous nature of the preclusion language at issue61 however as discussed below the courts appear to have taken contrary view in analogous interpretive

directors decision to approve or not to act upon collection of information requirement contained in an agency rule 44 usc 3504h9 similar provision appears in the 1995 revision of the pape rwork reduction act62 the 1980 legislation also contained public protection provisi on which absolved person from any penalty for not complying with an information collection request if the form did not display an omb control number or failed to state that the request was not subject to the act63 the public protection provision s ection 3512 has been the subject of numerous court actions some finding it applicable and providing complete defense to noncompliance others finding it inappli cable but court has ever raised question with respect to precl usion of judicial review64 reviewing court construing the nguage of the congressional review provision the structure of the legislation nd its legislative history including post enactment statements is therefore could we ll hold that court is not precluded from preventing an agency from enforcing covered rule that was not reported to congress in compliance with section 801a1a 7 the uncertainty of the breadth of the prohibition against an agencys promulgation of substa ntially similar rule after the original rule h as been vetoed enactment into law of disapprova l resolution has several important consequences first disappr oved rule is

subs tantially the same as the disapproved rule be issued unless such action is specifically authorized by law enacted subsequent to the disapproval of the original rule66 the full text of this provision states 2 rule that does not take effect or does not continue under paragraph 1 may not be reissued in substantially the same form and new rule that is substantially the same as such rule may not be issued unless the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by law enacted after the date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule finally if rule that is subject to any statutory regulatory or judicial deadline for its promulgation is not allowed to take effect or is terminated by the passage of joint resolution any deadline is extended for one year after the date of enactment of the disapproval resolution67 opponents of disapproval re solution may argue that successful passage of resolution may disable an agency from ever promulgating rules in the area covered by the resolution without future legisl ative reauthorization since successful disapproval resolution must n ecessarily bring down the entire rule or at the very least it may be contended that any future attempt by the agency to promulgate new rules with respect to the subject matter will be subject to judicial challenge by regulated persons who may claim that either the new rules are substantially the same as those disapproved or that the statute provides meanin gful standard to discern whether new rule is substantially the same and that the agency must await congressional guidance in the form of statute before it can engage in further rulemaking in the area the practical effect of these arguments then may be to dissuade an agency from taking any action until congress provides clear authorization review of the cras statutory sche and structure the contemporaneous congressional explanation of th legislative intent with respect to the provisions in question the lessons learned from the ex perience of the march 2001 disapproval of the osha ergonomics rule and the applica tion of pertinent case law and statutory construction principles suggests that 1 it is doubtful that congress intended that all disapproved rules would requi re statutory reauthoriza tion before further agency action could take place for example it appears that congress anticipated further rulemaking without new authorization wher the statute in question established deadline for promulgating implementing rules in particular area in such instances the cra extends the deadline for promul gation for one year from the date of disapproval 2 close reading of the st atute together with its contemporaneous congressional explication arguably provide s workable standards for agencies to reform disapproved

specificity with which the cong ress identified the objectionable portions of rule during the floor debates on disapprova l an important factor in judicial assessment may be the cras recognition of the continued efficacy of statutory deadlines for promulgating specified rules by extending such deadlines for one year after disapproval 3 the novelty of the issu the uncertainty of the weight court may accord the post enactment congressional explanation and the current judicial inclination to give deference to the plain meaning of legislative language make it difficult to anticipate what court is likely to hold since congress can apparently only disappr ove rule as whole rather than pinpointing any particular portions there ma be sound basis for the agency to act without further legislative gu idance where rule deals ex clusively with an integrated subject matter the statute gives indication as to how an agency is to discern what actions would be substantially th same and it would run the risk of successful court challenge if it guessed wrong it might be further argued that even if the agency promulgates new rules wh ich of course would be subject to cra scrutiny and congress did not act to di sapprove the new rules that would not provide the necessary reauthorization since section 801g of the act provides as rule of construction that in the event of the failure of congre ss to disapprove rule court may infer any intent of cong ress from any action or inaction of the congress with regard to suc h related statute or join t resolution of disapproval it is fundamental that

commission 461 us continuedbring about an end completely at va riance with the purpose of the statute74 it is fundamental canon of stat utory construction that the words of statute must be read in their context and with view to their place in the overall statutory scheme thus it is more faithful construction of statute to read it as whole rather than as containing two unrelated parts it is the classic judicial task of construing related statutory provisions to make sense in combination75 in the instant situation it is arguably not likely that court would hold that the substantially the same language of section 801b2 is unambiguous either on its face or in the context of the statutory scheme the di rection of the provision is not selfenforcing mandate it clearly requires further determination whether rules have been reissued in substantially the same form or whether new rule is substantially the same as the one disapproved the ambiguity raised appears to be who makes those determinations and on what basis the language of the provision however does not naturally or ineluctably lead to the conclusion that further remedial rulemaking can take place unless congress passes new law this reasoning is buttr essed by section 803a which contemplates that agency rulemaking must take place after disapproval action if the authorizing legislation of the agency mandates th at rules disapproved had to have been promulgated by date certain that pr ovision extends the deadline for promulgation for one year after the date of enactment of the joint resolution not one year after congress reauthorizes action in the area reasonable conclusion is that congress understood that after disapproval an agen cy if it was under mandate to produce particular rule had to try ag ain the question then is how was it to perform this task the answer may lie in the legislative history of the act the congressional review act was part of title ii of the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act of 1996 that title was product of negotiation between the senate and house and did not go through the committee process thus there is detailed expre ssion of its legislative history apart

the gislation in the sena senators nickles reid and stevens and house representative hyde submitted identical joint explanatory statements for publication in the congressional record intended to

resolution and attempts to provide guidance for both congress and agencies faced with repromulgation questions at the outset the statement notes that disapprovals ma have differing impacts on promulgating agencies depending on the nature and sc ope the rulemaking authority that was utilized for example if an agencys authorizing legislation did not mandate the promulgation of the disapproved rule and the legislation gives the agency broad discretion the authors deem it likely that it has the discretion whether or not to promulgate new rule on the other hand th statement explains that if an agency is mandated to promulgate particular rule and its discretion is narrowly circumscribed the enactment of resoluti on of disapproval for that rule may work to prohibit the reissuance of any rule78 arguably congressi onal mandate to issue regulations that is not narrowly focused would still be operative but how would the agency be guided in that circumstance the statement addresses that very question it is the obligation of congress during the debate on the disapproval resolution to focus on the law that authorized the rule and make the congressional intent clear regarding the agencys options or lack thereof after the enactment of joint resolution of disapproval79 thereafter the agency must give effect to the resolution of disapproval80 the full statement on the issue is as follows effect of enactment of jo int resolution of disapproval subsection 801b1 provides that rule shall not take effect or continue if the congress enacts joint resolution of disapproval described under section 802 of the rule subsection 801b2 pr ovides that such disapproval rule may not be reissued in substantially the same form and new rule that is substantially the same as such rule may not be issued unless the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by law enacted after the date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule subsection 801b2 is necessary to prevent circumvention of resolution di sapproval nevertheless it may have different impact on the issuing agencies depending on the nature of the underlying law that authorized the rule if the law that authorized the disapproved rule provides broad discretion to the issuing agency regarding the substance of such rule the agency may exercise its broad discretion to issue substantially di fferent rule if the law that authorized the disapproved rule did not mandate th promulgation of any rule the issuing agency may exercise its discretion not to issue any new rule depending on the law that authorized the rule an issuing agency may have both options but if an agency is mandated to promulgate partic ular rule and its discretion in issuing the rule is narrowly circumscribed the enactment of resolution of disapproval for that rule may work to prohibit the re issuance of any rule the authors intend the debate on any resolution of disapprov to focus on the law that authorized the rule and make the congressional inte nt clear regarding the agencys optionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30116crs39 81 147 cong rec s 183233 daily ed march 6 2001 emphasis added 82 147

of disapproval it will be the agencys responsibility in the first in stance when promulgating the rule to determine the range of discretion afforded under the original law and whether the law authorizes the agency to issue s ubstantially different rule then the agency must give effect to the resolution of disapproval the congressional experience with th disapproval of the osha ergonomics standard provides useful lesson this ru became the first and only rule to be disapproved thus far under the cra the prin cipal sponsor of the resolution senator jeffords at the outset of the debate ddressed the issue whet her disapproval would disable osha from promulgating new rule senator jeffords referred to the above discussed joint statement and noted that osha has enormously broad regulatory authority citing pertinent sections of the osh act providing expansive rulemaking authority the senator concluded that i am convinced that the cra will not act as an impediment to osha should the agency decide to engage in ergonomics rulemaking81 what senator jeffords apparen tly understood was that while the agency had broad authority to promulgate rules there was congressional mandate to issue an ergonomics rule in the underlying law as consequence it was possible that further rulemaking would occur as implied by letter to senator jeffords from secretary chao which indicated that new rulemaking was only one of many options available to the departme nt should the rule be disapproved82 osha made it clear on april 5 2002 that rulemaking was in the offing on april 17 2002 senator breaux and 26 cosponsors many of whom had voted in favor of the disapproval resoluti on introduced s 2184 which would direct the secretary of labor to promulgate new ergonomics rule and specifies in detail what should be included what should not be included nd what evidence should be considered section 1 b4 of the bill deems the direction to issue the rule specific authorization by congress in accordance with section 801 b2 of the cra an interesting contrast with the ergonomics situation was the consideration given by the key senate sponsors of the bipartisan campaign reform act 2002 bcra83 which required that the federal election commission fec promulgate rules implementing the soft money limitations and prohibitions of title i of the act later than 90 days after its date of enactment84 whether to introduce cra disapproval resolution with respect to th rules issued by the fec on july 17 200285 the senate sponsors believed that the new rules which became effective on november 6 2002 undermined the bcras ba n on the raising and spending of soft money by federal candidate s and officeholders and on national party use of soft money since the fec was mandated to promulgate rules to implement the bcrahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30116crs40 by date certain it could have been argu ed that in contrast with the general discretion osha has with respect to whet her to issue any ergonomics standard if congress disapproved the fecs soft money rule the agency would be obligated to undertake new rulemaking to be comple ted within year after the disapproval resolution was signed into law that w ould reflect congressional objections to the rule at the same time in accordance with the understanding of the joint statement it would have been arguably incumbent on congress in its debates on any such resolution to clearly identify those provisions of the rule that were objectionable as well as those that are not whether this line of argument would suffice to withstand challenge in the courts cannot be answered with any degree of certainty foreseeable obstacles may be the novelty of the issue the amount of we ight if any that court will accord the postenactment congressional ex planation of the cra and the current inclination of the courts to give deference to the plain meaning of statutory language and to eschew legislative history new rule may be ch allenged on grounds of lack of authority as consequence of the disapproval resolution either because congress failed to articulate its objections to the rule thereb providing standards for the agency to apply in its rulemaking or that the new rules were substantially the same as the old disapproved rules and ther efore invalid under the cra the joint statement declares that it is the congressional intent to make clear and specific identification of the options available to the agency including identification of objectionable provisions in the proposed rule during the floor debates in this way congress could provide an agency clear and direct guidance as to what it expects in the repromulgation process as well as po ssible defense to challenge based on the substantially the same

indications of study commissioned by the house judiciarysubcommittee however appears to suggest far less successful challenge rate but the consequence of the perceived actions of the reviewing courts

identifiable structural and interpretive flaws part may also be attributable to lack of interest in confronting and dealing with complex and sensitive policy issues that major rulemakings often present du ring the crssponsored symposium on presidential congressional and judicial control of rulemaking one panelist professor jack beermann expressed his vi ew that making it easier for congress to overturn an agency rule may come at high political cost he asked does congress want to be in the position where it is perceived that everything an agency does is their responsibility since theyve taken it on and reviewed it under this mechanism do they want to have that perception he concluded that i think that this may just increase the blaming opportunities for congress some of the commentators saw failu re of the congress to understand and appreciate the nature of the stakes involved and the danger s inherent in failing to act decisively to resolve them professor cynthia farina

establishe d under the rulemaking authority of each house which would allow summa ry approval of all rules fo r which there has been indication of need for full consideration by the house ie the filing of notice of intent by specific number of members with prescribed time period after congressional receipt of the proposed rule94 although the internal decisional processes expedited consider ation and the deeming proce ss could be established by house rule the requirement of congressional appr oval of all rules would require the passage of new law presidential approval of such legislation is likely to be highly problematic 2 by rule of each house establish joint committee to act as clearinghouse and screening mechanism for all covered rules such committee would be advisory only reporting to jurisdictional committees for both houses its findings with respect to reported rules and recommendations when appropriate for action on joint resolutions of disapproval the house of re presentatives would establish by rule an expedited consideration procedure complimentary to the current senate procedure the joint committee would be authorized to request reports on submitted rules from gao assessing such matters as the cost nd benefits cost eff ectiveness and legal authority of the subject rule none of the foregoing would require the passage of legislation requiring presidential approval 95 the witnesses at the committees hearings and panelists at the crs symposium concluded that the establishment of joint congressional committee to screen rules and recommend action to jurisdictional committees in both houses could provide the coordination and information necessary to inform both bodies sufficiently and in timely manner to allow them to take actions under current law the balanced na ture of such joint committee and its lack of substantive authority might provide way to allay political concerns regarding turf intrusions 3 amend the cra to direct that reports to congress and gao of covered rules are to be submitted electronically the house parliamentar ian and other witnesses and symposium panelists indicated that the paperwork burden on the

limiting the screening burden on committees and on the assumption that only major rules are likely to raise significant congressional review issues at present the cra allows only the administrator of oira to designate which rules are to be deemed major however even rule that may be conceded to be minor in the sense of it having minimal economic impact may well have significance to congressional constituencies the difficulty would be designating determiner that is politically acceptable and constitutionally appropriate the supr eme courts ruling in ins v chadha 96 the legislative veto case precludes authorizing legislative committees or officers from selecting particular rules and ordering agencies to report them for review in view of the practical and lega l problems it may well be that the current requirement of blanket rule reporting perhaps supplemented by screening body such as the suggested joint committee would be more acceptable 5 amend the cra to make it clear that failing to report covered rule renders the rule unenforceable and is s ubject to judicial review proponents of the cra consider this lack of an enforceable reporting requirement to undermine the purpose of the cra 6 amend the cra to make it clear that an upordown vote is on the entire reported rule the credible threat of congressi onal review would presumably force agencies to carefully tailor their rules with more attention to congressional expectations expedition in the review pr ocess however is vital so as not to undermine agency enforcement and the certainty needed by the regulated community the possibility of conflicting disapproval resolutions from each house and long perhaps unsuccessful conference committ ees deliberations may undermine the intended purpose of the cra the following option however may ameliorate the concern over the upordown vote on the entire rule 7 amend the cra to provide that if rule is disapproved an agency is prohibited from repromulgating only those pr ovisions of the rule that the review process and floor debates on disapproval clearly identify as objectionable such qualification to the cra review process appears to comport with the legislative intent of the sponsors of the cra if th option of creation of joint committee were adopted it could be ma ndated to identify the discrete problems of the rule that were objectionable that would obviate the nece ssity of legislative amendment to re establish agency authority in an area after passage of disapproval resolution conclusion this report identifies structural and interpretive issues affecting use of the cra while there have been some instances of the law apparently influencing the implementation of certain rules the limited utilization of the formal disapproval process in the ten years since enactment has arguably reduced the threat of possible congressional scrutiny nd disapproval as factor in ag ency rule development the one instance in which an agency rule was
