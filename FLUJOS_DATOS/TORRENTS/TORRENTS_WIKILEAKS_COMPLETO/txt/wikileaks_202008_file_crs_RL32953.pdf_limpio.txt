current acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 clean air act amendments the third is to enact energy and related programs that would also have the added eﬀect of reducing greenhouse gases

climate change is generally viewed as global issue but proposed responses generally require action at th national level in 1992 th united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industrialized countri to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000 over the pa st decade variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states but carbon dioxide emissions have continued to increase several proposals designed to address greenhouse ga ses have been introduced in the 109th congress two proposals s 1151 in troduced by senators mccain and lieberman and draft alternative nnounced by senator bingaman received increased scrutiny in preparation for the senates debate on comprehensive energy legislation during that debate s 1151 introduced as samdt 826 was defeated on 3860 vote in contrast the draft altern ative remains worki nprogress and has yet to be introduced this repor t compares these two proposals both proposals would establish marketbased systems to limit emissions of greenhouse gases however the proposals differ in how those systems would work s 1151 would establish an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities and would allow entities to trade emissions unde r that cap the draft amendment would limit emissions intensity greenhouse gas emi ssions per unit of gdp and establish costlimiting safety valve to protect against high compliance costs each would set up tradeable permit program to begin addressing emissions by the year 2010 in 2004 the energy information administr ation analyzed an earlier version of s 1151 under eias analysis s 1151 w ould achieve 67 reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared with its projected businessasusual scenario but would not return emissions to their 2000 or 1990 levels this contrasts with the crs estimate that the draft am endment would reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions 25 in 2010 compared with eias businessasusual scenario the two proposals represent different answ ers to the priceversusquantity issue in reducing greenhouse gases in general marketbased mechanisms to reduce co2 emissions focus on specifying either th acceptable emissions level quantity or compliance costs price and allowing th marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution for the other variable if one is more concerned about the possible economic cost price of the program then use of safety valve to limit costs could appear to some more appr opriate even through it intr oduces some uncertainty about the amount of reduction achieved quantity in contrast if one is more concerned about achieving specific emission reducti on level quantity with costs handled efficiently but not capped tradeable per mit program without safety valve may be viewed as more appropriate in the case of these alternatives s 1151 leans toward the quantity total emissions

introduction climate change is generally viewed as global issue but proposed responses generally require action at th national level in 1992 th united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industrialized count ries to take the lead in reducing the six primary greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 20001 over the past decade variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states including monitoring of power plant carbon dioxide emissions improved appliance efficiency and incentives for veloping renewable energy sources but carbon dioxide emissions have continued to increase in 2001 president george w bush rej ected the kyoto protocol which called for legally binding commitments by devel oped countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions2 he also rejected the concept of mandatory emissions reductions since then the administration has focused us climate change policy on voluntary initiatives to reduce the growth in greenhouse gas emissions this focus is particularly evident in the administrations 2002 climate action report car submitted under the provisions of the unfccc of the over 50 programs summarized in the 2002 car only six are described as regulatory3 t h s regulatory programs were generally implemented to achieve energy or environmental goals other than the reduction of gr eenhouse gas emissions but produced concomitant greenhouse gas missions reduction in this sense they could be considered the results of regrets4 policy where climate

legislation comparison of two proposals in february 2005 senators mccain and lieberman introduced s 342 the climate stewardship act of 20055 the primary focus of the proposed legislation is to reduce us emissions of greenhouse gase s through the use of flexible market based mechanisms in may 2005 senators mccain and lieberman introduced s 1151 an expanded version of s 342 that in cludes new title designed to encourage innovation and deployment of less carbon intensive tec hnologies sequester carbon emissions or mitigate the ffects of climate change the bills emission reduction provisions are very similar to samdt 2028 to s 139 of the 108th congress which the senate debated in 2003 that amendm ent failed on 4355 vote during the debate on the energy polic act of 2005 s 1151 was introduced as samdt 826 and defeated on 3860 vote as summarized in table 1 s 1151 w ould require mandatory and economy wide emission reductions using flexible marketbased implementation strategy the bill would

policy ncep that called for mandatory economywide tradeable permit prog ram to begin limiting greenhouse gases8 the climate and economy insuran ce act of 2005 hereafter referred to as the draft amendment would mandate an accelerated reduction in the gree nhouse gas intensity of the countrys economy9 between 2010 and 2019 the draft amendment would require 24 annual reducti on in greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of projected gross domestic product gdp after 2019 this reduction would increase to 28 annually implementation would be through flexib marketoriented allowance trading program the total number of allowances each year would be calculated based on the mandated decline in greenhouse gas intensity and projected gdp growth however the draft amendment includes costlimiting safety valve that allows covered entities to make payment to doe in lieu of reducing emissions the initial price of such payments would be 7 ton in 201010 thus if covered entity chooses it may make payments to doe at specific price rather than make any necessary emissions reductions the most notable difference between th two proposals is their approach to controlling emissions of greenhouse gases both would cover the majority of us greenhouse gas emissions however while s 1151 would place an absolute cap on emissions from covered entitie s the draft amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity under s 1151 while emissions from covered entitie s would be capped uncovered emissions would be expected to continue to rise ultimately overall us emissions would be expected to grow u nder the draft

safety valve price results emission reductions as discussed in the next section emission reduction estimates under both options involve at least some uncertainty particularly for the draft amendment thus the estimates provided in table 2 should be considered b allpark in nature in 2004 the energy information adminis tration eia analyzed an earlier version of s 115113 under eias analysis s 1151 would achieve 67 reductionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32953crs8 13 continued as surrogate here however the number of covered entities may be greater or fewer under s 1151 than assumed here so the estimates may understate or overstate actual reductions that would be achieved under s 1151 14 assumptions for analysis are discussed in the next sectionin overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 co mpared with its projected businessas usual scenario but would not return gr eenhouse gas emissions to their 2000 or 1990 levels this result contrasts with crss estimate that the draft amendment would result in 25 reduction in overall gr eenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared with eias businessasusual scenario14 crs did not estimate longer term reduc tions from either s 1151 or the draft amendment because of the inherent uncertainty involved in such projections qualitatively it can be stated that missions of greenhouse gases would likely continue to increase under both options although somewhat more slowly than businessasusual in the case of s 1151 the percentage of greenhouse gases not covered by the bill would increase and would be uncontrolled by the reduction program thus the initial reduction in missions achieved in 2010 would be slowly eaten up over time in the case of the draft amendment covered emissions would continue to grow to the extent that projected economic growth outstripped the 24 annual reduction in carbon intens ity 28 beginning in 2020 and to the extent that increased costs drove covered entities to invoke the safety valve rather than further reduce emissions in the longer term emissi ons could potentially rise faster under the draft amendment than under s 1151 table 2 projected emissions under s 1151 and draft amendment billions of metric tons

addressing the price versus quantity issue uncertainty in emission reductions the projected emission reductions under the draft amendment are more uncertain than under s 1151 the primary source of uncertainty for s 1151 is the precise number of covered entities that must meet the reduction requirements in eias analysis of previous versions of s 1151 the assumed cove rage is about 75 supporters of the bill have suggested the coverage is about 85 the difference is significant as higher coverage means more reductions than estimated by eia and more certainty about their quantity lowe r coverage means lower compliance costs but greater uncertainty about quantity table 3 factors potentially affecting emission reductions s 1151 draft amendment gdp growth yes carbon intensity improvementno yes to year 2009 covered entities yes yes safety valve yes as indicated in table 3 the draft amendment has several uncertainties with respect to emissions reductions unlike s 1151 which defines historic emissions baseline which covered entities must achieve the draft amendment calculates future baseline from projections of 2009 gdp gr owth and carbon inte nsity improvement both of those variables are uncertain in eias current projections economic growth to 2010 is assumed under its three scenario s to range from 25 annually low case to 36 annually high case with its reference case set at 31 annually crs calculations presented in table 2 assume the reference case assumption of 31 annual gdp growth however as indicated here this timate could be off by 20 or more likewise the carbon

calculations however based on the presidents clima change initiative the targeted 2009 carbon intensity is in the range of 159 mmtcemgdp15 likewise improvement could be less than projected as current

1151 the draft amendment raises some questions as to the exact extent of its coverage the crs estimate in table 2 assumes 100 c overage however there are potentially entities not c overed under the draft amendment the final uncertainty aff ecting emissions reductions achieved under the draft amendment is the safety valve all anal ysis done of previous versions of s 1151 indicate that 7 per ton of carbon diox ide safety valve would be triggered immediately16 in contrast the energy information administrations analysis projects the safety valve would be triggered around the year 201517 as the degree to which reductions could be achieved be fore the safety valve would be triggered is disputed another layer of uncertainty is added to the emission reductions achieved under the draft amendment particular ly in the longer term uncertainty in cost estimates the projected cost under s 1151 is mo re uncertain than under the draft amendment major source of uncertainty for s 1151 is future growth in greenhouse gas emissions by c overed entities because s 1151 establishes firm cap on greenhouse gas emissions based on the year 2000 any increased emissions resulting from continuing economic growth would have to be offset the more robust the economic growth the greater poten tial for more emissions that would have to be offset to maintain the cap in gene ral more emission re ductions probably means higher costs if economic growth is ss robust fewer reducti ons would have to be made and costs would be less s 1151 cost estimates are affected by veral other uncertainties in three studies conducted on the cost of previous versions of s 1151 two studies placed the potential permit price in 2010 at 9 ton 2001 and one at 15 ton 2001 the sources of the differing estimates are diffe rent assumptions about the availability of the following 1 cost effective energy efficiency improvements 2 costeffective nonco2 greenhouse gas reductions 3 cost effective carbon sequestration and international credits and 4 future natural gas supply with program designed to achieve leastcost solution through marketbased allowance trading system restricting the availability of options increases projected costs the range between the two studies indicating 9 ton and th one indicating 15 ton illustrates the sensitivity and uncertainty surr ounding s 1151s potential costs18

using th gdp implicit pr ice deflator see energy information administration impacts of modeled recommendations of the national commission on energy policy report sroiaf200502 april 2005 20 see crs report rs21067 global climate change controlling co2 emissions cost limiting safety valves by larry parkerthe draft amendments cost estimates are not as sensitive to the factors identified above partly this is by design and partly this is b ecause the draft amendment requires less emi ssion reductions than s 1151 unlike s 1151 the draft amendment incorporates economic growth into its emissions limitation target permitting some increase in future emissi ons if projected economic growth exceeds the mandated improvement in greenhouse gas intensity fewer offsets required translates into lower costs like s 1151 the draft amendments project ed cost is affected by the assumed availability of costeffective control meas ures such as those noted above energy efficiency improvements costeff ective carbon sequestration and nonco2 greenhouse gas reductions along with assume d future natural gas supply however the draft amendment does not extend its flexible market implementation program to international credits in the manner that s 1151 does thus uncertainty or possible lower costs is introduced by the potential for international trading the national commission on energy po licy placed the permit price of its proposal on which the draft amendment is based at 5 ton in 2010 2004 although there are uncertainties in the draf t amendments potential costs its safety valve puts firm limit on its upside risk 7 ton nominal 2010 converting these estimates to 2001 dollars the projected permit price for the draft amendment would be 48 59 ton 200119 besides putting ceiling on upside cost the draft amendments safety valve narrows the band of potential costs substantially the remaining cost uncertainty is w ith respect to the lower bound of costs price versus quantity the safety valve the purpose of safety valve is to bound th costs of any climate change control program price at the expense of reductions achieved quantity20 i n g n r l marketbased mechanisms to reduce co2 emissions focus on specifying either the acceptable emissions level qua ntity or compliance costs price and allowing the marketplace to determine the economically fficient solution for the other variable for example tradeable permit program sets the amount of emissions allowable under the program ie the number of per mits available caps allowable emissions while letting the marketplace determine what each permit will be worth likewise carbon tax or the safety valve containe d in the draft amendment sets the maximum unit per ton of co2 cost that one should pay for reducing emissions while the marketplace determines how much actually gets reduced in one sensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32953crs12 preference for pure tradeable permit system or inclusion of safety valve depends on how one views the uncertainty of cost s involved and benef its to be received for those confident that achieving specific level of co2 reduction will yield significant benefits enough so that ev the potentially very high end of the marginal cost curve does not bother them pure tradeable permit program may be most appr opriate co2 emissions would be reduced to specific level and in the case of tradeable permit program the co st involved would be handled efficiently though not controlled at specific cost level this efficiency ccurs because through the trading of permits emission reduction efforts concentrate at sources at which controls can be achieved at least cost however if one is more concerne d about the potential downside risk of substantial control costs to the economy than of the benefits of specific level of reduction then including safety valve may be most appropriate in this approach the level of the safety valve effectively caps the marginal cost of control that affected entities would pay under the reduction sc heme but the preci level of co2 achieved is less certain emitters of co2 would spend money controlling co2 emissions up to the level of the safety valve however since the marginal cost of control among millions of emitters is not well known the overall emissions reductions for given safety valve level on co2 emissions cannot be accurately forecast in essence the safety valve on the draft amendment coul d be seen as contingent carbon tax hence major policy question is whet her one is more concerned about the possible economic cost of the progra m and therefore willing to accept some uncertainty about the amount of reduction received ie safety valve or one is more concerned about achieving speci fic emission reduction level with costs handled efficiently but not capped ie pure tradeable permits s 1151 leans toward the quantity total emissions side of the equation the draft amendment leans more toward the price side conclusion the two proposals s 1151 and the dr aft amendment would establish marketbased systems to limit emissions of greenhouse gases however the proposals differ in how those systems would work s 1151 would establish an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities and would allow entities to trade emissions under that cap the draf t amendment would limit greenhouse gas emissions intensity and establish costlimiting safety valve to protect against high compliance costs under both proposals s hortterm us emissions would likely be below businessasusual scenario lthough reductions under s 1151 are likely to be larger and more certain in contrast the cost of the draft amendment is likely to be less and more pr edictable however under both proposals total us emissions could be expected to continue their upw ard trend albeit at slower rate than currently forecasted
