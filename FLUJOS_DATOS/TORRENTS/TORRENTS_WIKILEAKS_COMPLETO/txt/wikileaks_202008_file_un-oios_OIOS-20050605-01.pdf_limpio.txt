protocol s and technical program of work the m andate was expanded in 1995 to incl ude regional sustainable developm ent biodiversity conservation and the integrated m anagem ent of the coastal areas

necessary to achieve the m andate c organisation structure and functions delegation of authority for adm inistration 13 the prior oios audit aa2001023 found that there was clear statem ent of delegated authority to medu referring to adm inistration of program personnel and other resources and activities recom mendation was raised because unep inform ed oios that it was drafting docum ent dealing with delegated authority to its units oios was concerned to note that at the tim of this audit ie f our years later statem ent had yet been issued in respect of delegated authority for recruitm ent of consultants individual contractors and procurem ent 14 in june 2003 the coordinator of th global program of action for the protection of the marine environm ent from landbased

or the f ollowing aspects of hum an resource m atters travel classifica tion recruitm ent and contract extensions in practice however medu is dealing directly with unon on classifications recruitm ent and contract extensions th value and purpose of the delegation to gpa was therefore unclear to oios recommendation to ensure proper arrangem ents are in place for ensuring that the mediterranean

parties to carry out such task and this task has the potential to be com mon service shared with other agencies in athens oios is of the opinion that the newly form ed departm ent of safety and
