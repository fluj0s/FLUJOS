funding summary as the freight industry enters the peak fall shipping season many government officials and industry observers are concerned that the railroads could be overwhelmed by record volumes of freight the surface transportation board the federal agency that regulates railroads has taken the unprecedented step of requiring each railroad to submit plan on how they intend to prepare for this years peak season other industry experts point to recent service disruptions as early warning signsof possible capacity crunch in the nations intermodal rail system keeping up with trade growth will require substantial investment to expand capacity on rail rightsofway however many rail analysts question whether the freight railroads have the financial means to add capacity at sufficient pace to meet the anticipated demand this raises the issue of whether the government could or should assist the railroads in expanding the capacity of their infrastructure and if so how funding program could be arranged several proposals have been introduced in the 108th congress to accelerate investment in the rail network number of concerns have been raised about federal assistance for the development of freight rail facilities some contend that an aid program is unnecessary others object to providing public aid for privately owned infrastructure and some warn that public aid will do more harm than good on the other side of the issue number of public benefits can be associated with improving freight rail infrastructure one view is that public aid should be directed to those rail or railrelated projects which improve passenger mobility projects that mitigate gradecrossing delays or upgrade passenger rail corridors are primary examples another popularly held assumption is that public aid should be provided because there are energy safety and environmental benefits to rail transportation there are also those who support public aid for rail projects for the purpose of enhancing freight mobility this view holds that freight railroads are so critical to the national economy that upgrading and expanding their infrastructure is national concern freight railroads primarily finance projects themselves with almost government assistance the railroads have been investing heavily in their service capacity particularly with respect to intermodal terminals the question is if their pace of investment is sufficient to meet anticipated demand there is growing sense by some parties that public support for intermodal rail projects must become more common if growing congestion and inefficiencies in the nations intermodal transportation system are to be corrected one proposal is to create rail trust fund similar to the highway inland waterway and aviation trust funds to provide regular funding stream others suggest that existing federal programs could be modified to make it easier for freight rail projects to qualify for federal monies related issue is how projects deserving

surface transportation board stb the federal agency that regulates railroads has taken the unprecedented step of requiring each railroad to submit plan on how they intend to prepare for this years peak season other industry experts point to recent service disruptions as early warning signsof possible capacity crunch in the nations intermodal rail system1 they contend that the intermodal rail network is in fragile state where seemingly local problems quickly spread throughout the national network because the system is operating at maximum capacity peak season shipping problems according to some are indicative of longer term underlying capacity problem recent transportation research board study entitled freight capacity for the 21st century points to several trends in the rail industry as consistent with condition of tightening capacity2 these trends include longrun contraction of the extent of the network declining net capital stock rising profits slowing train speed and sporadic service failures meanwhile growing congestion on certain portions of the nations interstate highway system has also focused the interest of policymakers on the capability of the railroads to divert more truck traffic to the rail mode and increasing demand for commuter rail whose trains run on freight track in parts of the country has put further strain on rail infrastructure capacity recent dot inspector general report finds that despite the freight railroads investments certain parts of the railroad system have become severely congested and cannot accommodate the conflicting demands of both increasing freight movement and increasing commuter and intercity passenger rail traffic3 1 see for instance intermodal storm ahead traffic world july 12 2004 p11 warnings on intermodal rail journal

with trade growth diverting more truck traffic to rail and accommodating more frequent passenger trains will require substantial investment to expand capacity on rail rightsofway however many rail analysts question whether the freight railroads have the financial means to add capacity at sufficient pace to meet the anticipated demand this raises several important but complex policy issues for congress4 should federal rail policy remain relatively handsoff or does the current situation require more activist policy should government assist the railroads in expanding capacity on the intermodal network if so how should government funding be arranged how would rail projects deserving government support be selected the first section of this report provides historical context and reviews some of the factors inspiring debate on these questions the next section examines arguments for and against government involvement in financing rail infrastructure and discusses the types of rail projects being proposed for public funding the following section describes current funding mechanisms and discusses the pros and cons of some alternative mechanisms for funding and planning rail infrastructure improvements the last section identifies legislation introduced in the 108th congress to accelerate the pace of investment in rail infrastructure background what is intermodal rail intermodal rail is the movement of cargo in combination with at least one other mode of transport but under single bill of lading although intermodal rail could include many types of commodities such as grain or coal the rail industry limits the term to mean the carriage of trucktrailers with wheels or containers without wheels by rail trucking is critical to intermodal rail transport trucks are utilized for the pick up or delivery of the trailer or container to the shipper at either end of the rail segment5 import and export moves through seaports involve water in addition to rail and truck modes import and export containers may be transferred directly between ship and rail if the port has an ondock rail facility if the rail facility is located offdock truck will transfer the container between the port and railroad6 truck may also transfer container between two rail terminals if the transit involves two rail networks that do not share common terminus7 the most common forms of intermodal rail are traileronflatcar tofc containeronflatcar cofc and doublestack container dst railroads generally 4 for further information on this topic see also jeremy f plant railroad policy and

fhwa office of freight management and operations historical context although today the railroads may be operating close to their physical capacity it was not very long ago that they were burdened with too much capacity this dramatic change in circumstances over the past 20 to 30 years is largely due to technological innovations coinciding with deregulation and trade growth 8 united parcel service is the railroads largest intermodal customer 9 john williamson crs technical information specialist assisted in producing this figure crs4 significant development in the recent history of intermodal rail was the implementation of doublestack container cars in the early 1980s in 1984 only one doublestack train per week originated from the west coast and served only one inland market today over 241 doublestack trains per week originate on the west coast and serve all the major us long haul markets10 doublestack cars allow railroads to potentially carry double the amount of containers for given train length this produces cost savings in terms of per unit crew costs and shortens the length of track needed in switching yards however doublestack trains also require higher clearances for overpasses and tunnels and require expensive lifton and liftoff equipment in terminals because intermodalism and containerization is relatively recent phenomenon the rail network was largely built before and is not specifically designed for this type of cargo this creates some inherent inefficiencies in the networks connectivity for instance to move container across the country requires carriage by more than one railroad in many instances depending on the destination the western railroads track does not directly connect to the eastern railroads track often requiring truck to transfer the container crosstown between rail terminals this most often occurs in chicago where it is estimated that 3500 containers day are transferred by truck between rail terminals11 this truck traffic contributes significantly to the regions road congestion st louis kansas city memphis and new orleans are other important interchange points between the eastern and western rail networks when doublestack trains first came into use in the early 1980s the new intermodal traffic consumed underutilized rail capacity today however due in large part to deregulation supply and demand are closer to equilibrium as result of series of deregulatory acts most notably the staggers rail act of 1980 pl 96 448 and culminating in the interstate commerce commission termination act of 1995 pl 10488 railroads were given more freedom to abandon unprofitable lines and concentrate traffic on limited number of high density routes deregulation also spurred industry concentration today there are six large freight railroads in north america two in the west two in the east and two in canada with us routes the disappearance of excess capacity was also partly result of the decline of passenger trains to support passenger train operations multiple track yard bypasses and sophisticated signaling systems were installed this infrastructure generated additional capacity by allowing trains of varying speeds to use the same rightsofway however the rail passenger service act of 1970 created amtrak allowing the private railroads to focus on moving freight the freight railroads economized by strategies such as single tracking and lowering maintenance track 10 aar aar news intermodal the best means of addressing the dramatic increase in freight demand available at httpwwwaarorg 11 critical

congestion relief by carrying additional truck traffic they will need to make and are making substantial investments to expand their track and terminal network factors inspiring this issue economic and trade growth concerns about the pace of investment in intermodal rail facilities is fueled by economic and trade growth the dot completed freight forecasting study with driwefa now known as global insight which predicts that over the next 20 years us freight volumes in tons will increase by nearly 70 international freight volumes are growing faster than domestic volumes and are forecasted to nearly double by 202013 major study on freight rail expects that rail traffic measured in tonmiles will increase 47 by 202014 this forecast continues trends experienced in recent years intermodal has been the fastest growing segment of rail traffic in the last decade in the last two decades intermodal rail volume has almost quadrupled from 31 million trailers and containers in 1980 to 121 million units in 200315 in 2003 intermodal surpassed coal for the first time as the leading revenue source for us freight railroads16 much of the increase in intermodal volumes is the result of burgeoning trade volumes particularly in marine containers approximately half of us intermodal rail traffic is generated by imports or exports in addition to trade growth port rationalization strategies by ocean carriers is also fueling the demand for intermodal rail services in anticipation of rising container volumes ocean lines are deploying larger container ships because there are economies of ship size at sea but diseconomies of ship size at port these larger container ships are calling at fewer us ports fewer port calls will in turn place greater reliance on the railroads to disperse and gather container cargo to and from the hinterland highway congestion relief many observers believe that intermodal rail which is essentially trucks on trains can provide at least partial solution for relieving highway congestion according to the texas transportation institutes urban mobility study the cost of traffic congestion nationwide totals 78 billion in 12 robert gallamore perspectives and

onethird by 201019 grade crossing conflicts as rail traffic increases atgrade railhighway crossings increasingly delay automobile and truck traffic freight train can be over mile long blocking several road crossings at time most rail terminals are located in urban areas long slowmoving trains can also delay emergency vehicles replacing atgrade groundlevel crossings by constructing overpasses underpasses rail trenches or even relocating track or roads so that they do not intersect are very expensive projects in some cases railroads have contributed to the cost of gradeseparation projects if they believe the project will improve train speed in other cases railroads may not be interested in the project because they are satisfied with train speed through the area and believe the project primarily benefits vehicular traffic there are also some potential disincentives in law that may cause railroads not to seek greater role in crossing elimination projects pursued by localities20 because of the expensive nature of grade separation projects and because it is uniform problem occurring nationwide many advocate that the federal government provide substantially more funds to mitigate this problem railroad revenue shortfall many rail industry observers are concerned with the industrys ability to invest in added capacity to meet anticipated demand current investment levels appear to approach the level needed to maintain the system but not to add capacity railway consultant has estimated that class i railroads need to invest 8 billion per year just to maintain their network in its current condition21 however in the decade of the 1990s total class i rail capital expenditures fell far short of this mark ranging from 45 billion in 1990 to 66 billion in 199922 the surface transportation board stb23 has found that most railroads are revenue inadequate meaning that the railroads can not earn enough 17 as quoted in hurry up and wait logistics management and

capital for instance from 1990 to 1997 while the cost of capital remained between 114 and 122 the railroads return on investment ranged from 13 to 9424 concerns with federal aid number of concerns have been raised about federal aid for the development of freight rail facilities some contend that an aid program is unnecessary others object to public aid for private infrastructure and some warn that public aid will do more harm than good still others question the potential of intermodal rail to alleviate highway congestion inadequate revenue or inadequate competition some dispute the stbs determination of railroad revenue inadequacy the stbs determination of revenue inadequacy is long standing controversy that dates back to the boards precursor the interstate commerce commission shipper groups question how railroads could be considered revenue inadequate at the same time they were able to attract substantial capital for recent mergers or acquisitions in testimony before congress transportation economist questioned the disparity between the individual railroad data presented in annual reports to shareholders and the industrywide data that the stb used to determine revenue adequacy25 the witness argued that the stb should use the real world data in railroad annual reports as their basis for determining revenue adequacy policymakers are likely to closely examine the financial health of the railroad industry in debating the issue of government aid opinions differ as to whether or not the railroads need an external source of capital to augment their reinvestment capacity economists might contend that private investors are not shortsighted and possess the most skill in supplying the right level of capital to the rail industry they may argue that if the pace of commerce and growing truck congestion dictates greater demand for rail services private capital attracted by the prospect of good returns will flow to the industry without special government encouragement others contend that natural market forces keep supply of rail facilities in check commentators have suggested that investors would rather see rail system that is capacityrestricted so that railroads can better dictate the price of their service leading to higher rates higher revenues and higher returns on invested capital26 skeptics opposed to providing federal assistance to the railroads contend that the 24 general accounting office railroad regulation april 1999 gaorced9993 p 45 25 testimony of harvey levine us senate committee on commerce science

need for public funds is really driven by disenchanted investors unhappy with railroad profits rather than need to increase rail capacity27 another view is that rail system at or near capacity is exactly where it should operate in deregulated environment as one rail executive stated neither customers nor stockholders like paying for excess capacity if you make mistake in estimating need it takes long time to compensate28 other observers argue that the shortage of rail infrastructure is not due to inadequate revenue but inadequate competition they contend that if one is looking for an explanation of why there seems to be chronic shortage of rail service one only needs to open an economics textbook and turn to the chapter on monopolistic behavior economic theory suggests they argue that in an imperfectly competitive market profitmaximizing firms tend to under produce good and may opt for different levels of quality than would perfectly competitive firms the alliance for rail competition for instance argues that more rail to rail competition would drive efficiencies and provide incentive for rail carriers to raise service quality to levels that customers demand rail carriers respond that intermodal traffic is highly competitive because of the containers easy transferability among modes intermodal customers often have various shipping options for instance customers may have choice of more than one railroad they could choose to simply truck the container or for transcontinental traffic they could choose to utilize the allwater route and ship the container through the panama canal on limited number of routes containeronbarge may be an additional option railroads also note that rail supply shortages mainly occur during the peak season lasting only few weeks year they argue that they cannot be expected to build their physical plant around relatively shortlived spike in demand while the rest of the year the infrastructure is underutilized private infrastructure federal support for freight rail raises difficult issues because the freight railroads operate differently than other modes an important difference is that unlike highways waterways and airways which all use public infrastructure rail track is privately owned this raises the difficult question of whether public funding should be used to support projects in private ownership and under private control another important difference is that unlike the other modes railroads generally do not share their infrastructure with competing railroads this raises the issue of open access if competitive equity is the rationale for providing railroads with some form of regular public assistance some would extend this argument further to include railtorail competition in other words like the other modes railroads could receive federal support for infrastructure but in exchange railroads should compete with each other over the same track as one industry analyst stated the cost of railroad access 27 aluta continua traffic world may 21 2001 p 14 28 james mcclellan norfolk southern railroad as quoted in us military preparedness jammed in the traffic transportation research news nov dec 2000 p 18 crs9 to federal funds will be some form of open access to railroad lines29 however rail carriers argue vehemently that imposing open access forced access from their point of view competitive access from the shippers point of view would be detrimental to the financial health of their industry railroads contend that the best way to raise capital for reinvestment in rail infrastructure is to allow them to continue to operate without intrusive government intervention detrimental to industry efficiency policymakers are likely to debate whether federal aid to the railroad industry might do more harm than good to the industry topics of discussion include whether federal support would reduce the rail industrys efficiency whether it would actually slow down the rate of construction in new facilities and whether it would lead to investment in uneconomic facilities some industry analysts are concerned that government support for rail projects could create less incentive for the railroads to continue their costcutting initiatives railroads have been improving profitability through mergers increasing labor productivity consolidating terminals striving to capture more market share from trucks through service improvements selling light density track to regional and shortline railroads and investing in more fuel efficient locomotives and freight cars further application of technology could not only offer railroads additional cost saving opportunities but also increase the throughput capacity of existing infrastructure examples of technology deployment include further expansion of doublestack intermodal trains computeraided dispatching systems and sensors for improving shipment tracking some analysts fear that public aid could dampen the industrys pursuit of these cost saving strategies other concerns include possible conflicts between public and private planning horizons and excessive politicization of the project selection process critics question if public involvement would have the opposite of the intended effect and actually slow the pace of facility improvements the public sector generally operates under longer term planning horizon and is motivated by broadlydefined needs railroads on the other hand are driven by specific customer needs and require faster return on investments some also question whether government can target the right projects to finance they are concerned that political considerations will dominate the selection process if federal assistance were in the form of public funds it could lead to overinvestment in rail capacity in some places to the extent that public funds are available for construction of new project the project may have to pass lower hurdle in terms of evaluating risk and return than if the project was financed by railroad on standalone basis as is often said in this regard you never spend somebody elses money as carefully as you spend your own underestimating investment risk in new facilities could also lead to the development of uneconomic facilities for example due to slowdown in global trade or changes in shipping 29 anthony kruglinski open access not if but when railway age nov 2001 p 12 crs10 routes as result of rail mergers or terminal consolidation the physical life of facility could outlive its economic life potential congestion relief growing congestion on the nations highway system has raised the issue of the possible need to divert more truck traffic from road to rail however when evaluating the ability of the railroads to take trucks off the highways it is important to recognize some of the limitations of intermodal rail in reducing truck traffic intermodal rail almost always relies on trucks for the pickup and delivery portion of the haul this truck move frequently occurs in urban areas where the problem of congestion is most acute therefore intermodal rails contribution to congestion relief is probably most applicable to reducing the number of longhaul trucks on the interstates connecting cities rather than reducing the number of shorthaul trucks on urban streets and circumferential highways when assessing the potential of the railroads to take trucks off the highways it is also important to recognize distinction between international and domestic intermodal service railroads have demonstrated their ability to successfully capture the inland portion of international container shipments however international marine container shippers are generally less service sensitive and more priceelastic than domestic truckload shippers one or two day delay in the context of week to three week ocean transit is not completely unexpected domestic shippers on the other hand demand more precise schedules the time and cost of the truck pick up or delivery at either end of rail move must be considered in the words of one rail analyst30 the trouble with intermodal transport is that complexity increases the risk of failure in theory any good 4x100m relay team should beat the world champion 400m sprinter but the relay team has higher risk of dropped baton or even late arrival at the stadium so matter how elegant the piece parts if more complexity reduces reliability and margins for error are too slim what ought to be possible just might not be an additional consideration in evaluating the potential of rail to alleviate highway congestion is the economics of shorthaul intermodal traffic shorthauls generate the greatest amount of truck traffic however intermodal rail generally is not competitive with trucks for hauls less than about 500 miles which is the point where doublestack trains also generally break even although the market potential for shorthaul rail is large it offers even thinner profit margins or none at all for the railroads compared with longhaul intermodal one of the difficulties for the railroads in capturing this market is that the highway system has dispersed manufacturing and distribution centers similar to passenger rail successful freight rail requires high density trucks have less difficulty in finding load for the backhaul portion of move because they are not limited by track trucks can also offer shippers more flexible scheduling 30 robert gallamore perspectives and prospects for american railroad infrastructure infrastructure summer 1998 p 36 crs11 public benefits of an aid program an important topic of discussion in the debate about aiding and assisting rail infrastructure development is clarifying under what conditions public aid might be provided one view which is well established is that public aid should be directed to those rail or railrelated projects which improve passenger vehicle mobility projects that mitigate gradecrossing delays or upgrade passenger rail corridors are primary examples another popularly held assumption is that public aid should be provided because there are energy safety and environmental benefits to rail transportation in this view these external benefits are justifiably not likely reflected in the rail industrys investment decisions the markets tendency to underproduce these public goods it is argued warrants role for government there are also those who support public aid for rail projects for the purpose of enhancing freight mobility this view holds that freight railroads are so critical to the national economy that upgrading and expanding their infrastructure is national concern an argument could also be made that public assistance for rail infrastructure is advisable for national security reasons passenger mobility grade crossing separation and crossing signal upgrades are well established as railrelated projects with strong public interest grade crossing separation is traditionally viewed as public good because it improves the safety and mobility of vehicular traffic as side benefit it may also improve the flow of train traffic the railhighway grade crossing program 23 usc 130 provides funds for improving grade crossings public benefits are also traditionally associated with improving infrastructure on intercity passenger or commuter rail corridors passenger rail financing is inextricably linked with freight trains because most passenger trains run on track owned by the freight railroads investment in positive train control technologies and upgrading right of way for highspeed rail are projects that improve passenger mobility but may also have collateral benefits for freight train operations the freight railroads are cautious of accepting public funding for track upgrades for passenger operations because they fear loss of control over future investment decisions they are also skeptical of the longterm physical compatibility of freight and passenger trains sharing the same track31 one advantage of accepting public funding for passenger rail upgrades is that the freight railroads can access capital at lower interest rates from public sources than from private money markets32 another rationale for funding rail projects is that cities need intermodal options because of serious congestion problems on urban highways many argue that building additional highway lane miles will not improve highway mobility in the long run due to the expensive nature of highway construction and limited space for 31 why one problem at time wont work railway age sept 2001 32 charles h banks point of view freight railroads need passenger trains railway age nov 2001 p 14 crs12 widening highways in many urban areas many believe cities need to find more integrated transportation solutions proponents of intermodal rail assert that improving the rail links with ports and between rail terminals in metropolitan areas could significantly reduce the amount of bridge and crosstown truck traffic this would not only expedite the flow of goods but also reduce the amount of truck traffic intermingling with highway commuter traffic mitigating highway congestion can also generate air quality improvements finally it is argued that taking heavy trucks off highways can reduce highway maintenance costs freight mobility due to economic and trade growth some policymakers believe bolder vision of rails place in the nations transportation system is necessary freight advocates believe that the nations intermodal infrastructure is failing to keep pace with international commerce in the words of one industry representative the key aspect of our future is simply this if the us economy is going to continue its amazing growth there needs to be renaissance of the north american railroad industry renaissance does not come easily i realize that many who call for dramatic change are branded as heretics but the situation with the major railroads has to change for everyones sake33 the national center for intermodal transportation presents another view34 just as the construction of the interstate highway system which began half century ago served as catalyst for period of economic growth unrivaled in world history the development of an integrated efficient and seamless intermodal transportation system will enable other economic sectors to enjoy enhanced productivity as well thereby enhancing overall economic growth and securing competitive position for the us in the global economy proponents of intermodalism such as those cited above contend that it increases the overall efficiency of the nations freight transportation system because it optimizes the strengths of each mode rail transportations fundamental advantage derives from steel wheels on steel track reducing the friction of moving heavy loads according to one study rail transportation is three or more times more fuel efficient than trucks35 which could also translate into lower freight rates for shippers intermodal rail could also benefit the trucking industry some trucking firms utilize rail service for the longhaul portion of move passing on the cost savings to their customers partnering with railroads can also reduce wear and tear on truck 33 ed emmett president of the national industrial transportation league speech titled railroads renaissance the key to economic growth march 3 2001 available at httpwwwnitlorgrailsphtm 34 national center for intermodal transportation new transportation agenda for america nov 2001 available at httpwwwiemsstateeduncit 35 american association of state highway and transportation officials freightrail bottom line report nd p 29 crs13 drivers it is argued that if rail is used for the longhaul portion of move while trucks are used for the shorthaul pick up and delivery truck drivers can work more conventional hours and stay closer to home this can lessen the fatigue factor for drivers and help reduce driver turnover infrastructure constraints to enhance freight mobility the railroads have identified where they need to increase intermodal capacity although price is always important in justintime delivery environment reliability is paramount and service reliability demands quality infrastructure relieving capacity constraints at identified bottlenecks is especially critical rail and road connections with ports and inland terminals are often choke points in the intermodal network the main rail lines are experiencing high track utilization rates most of the main line system is single tracked double tracking and increasing the number of sidings in some regions would allow time sensitive intermodal trains to pass less service sensitive trains another capacity constraint occurs in urban areas where train speed has to be greatly reduced at present inadequate terminal capacity is major cause of traffic buildup on tracks leading to terminals tunnels and bridges with clearances too low for doublestack trains are other physical constraints especially in the east military mobility the rail network particularly intermodal is also viewed as important for military mobilization rail is used to move unit equipment and munitions to the department of defenses designated strategic seaports in the united states dod contracts with private commercial carriers including railroads to supply more than 85 of its transportation needs in both peacetime and wartime36 many are concerned that adequate transportation infrastructure may not exist particularly during peak shipping seasons to handle rapid surge in case of military crisis as one columnist noted37 the concern is well founded continued traffic growth accompanied by asset rationalization has brought supply and demand into closer balance the network longer enjoys the luxury of overcapacity as nation we reap the efficiencies brought about by transportation deregulation many people forget that prior to deregulation overcapacity was specific public goal carriers had protected business segments in exchange for maintaining excess capacity which would be called upon in times of national emergency 36 us military preparedness

freight railroads primarily finance projects themselves with almost public assistance an intermodal transportation research group estimates that railroads contribute approximately 87 of the total cost of rail infrastructure projects the remaining 13 is provided by federal funding 3 and state and local governments 5 each38 railroads raise money through bond and stock sales bank loans and revenues generated internally rail executive briefly outlined what could be described as marketdriven approach to investment decisions39 market determines infrastructure needs infrastructure needs dictate investment requirements return on investment determines whether market is worth serving as industry trade journals frequently describe railroads have been investing heavily in their service capacity particularly with respect to intermodal terminals the railroads have been consolidating intermodal terminals and in some cases moving terminals from city centers to the outskirts in 1999 and 2000 the rail industry spent about onefifth of its revenue base on intermodal infrastructure40 federal funding is limited in modern times federal programs have funded some rail related projects but relative to other modes funding is limited three programs in the federalaid highway program detailed in tea21 that have been used for rail or rail related projects are the surface transportation program stp the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program cmaq and the corridors and borders program corbor stp funds have been used primarily for safety improvements to existing rail grade crossings such as installing warning devices or improving grade crossing surfaces the railhighway grade crossing program section 130 title 23 of the us code provides funds for the separation of gradecrossings including relocating roadways or rail lines to eliminate road and rail intersections current funding is approximately 155 million per year cmaq funds have been used to improve rail links to ports or

partially financed improvements to canadian pacifics bensenville rail yard in chicago improvements included reducing rail and traffic conflicts at grade crossings new track interlockings and signals cmaq funds provided 21 million of the 35 million total cost of the project42 the corridors and bordersprogram corbor section 1118 and 1119 of tea21 was established to support planning studies and infrastructure development at the national border crossings and along major freight corridors this program has helped finance the fast freight action strategy for the seattletacoma region project which will eliminate 12 grade crossings on access roads to the seaports in this region corbor funds provided 10 million of the estimated 400 million total cost of this project43 third tea21 program the railroad rehabilitation and improvement financing program rrif is intended to make funding available through low interest loans and loan guarantees for railroad capital improvements improvements can include acquiring or improving intermodal terminals rail facilities track bridges buildings and shops44 however this program has been slow in getting underway as of 2003 less than handful of loans have been approved railroads may find two provisions in the fra eligibility requirements overly restrictive 1 the requirement that an applicant show proof of at least one loan denial from commercial lender that previously loaned the railroad money and 2 that the railroad provide collateral for recovery of 100 of principal and interest45 railway financial observers assert that because revenue inadequacy is at least part of the problem loan or loan guarantee program such as rrif that relies heavily on rail revenue as source of funds is not practical solution although there are examples in which tea21 programs have funded intermodal rail projects such as those cited above they are few relative to other modes there is growing sense by some parties that intermodal freight projects must become more common if increased congestion and inefficiencies in the transportation system are to be corrected some parties suggest that federal program be established to regularize funding for these types of projects there is not 41 us dot office of operations freight finance report nd httpopsfhwadotgovfreightfreight_analysisfinancinghtm 42 ibid 43 us dot fra intercity freight and passenger rail

intermodal infrastructure funding state and local initiatives state and local governments have also contributed funds for rail projects the state of pennsylvania assisted conrail in making number of its lines accessible to doublestack container trains46 the state of delaware is funding the cost of rehabilitating train bridge serving the port of wilmington norfolk southern railroad which owns the bridge will reimburse the state through fee for each rail car crossing the bridge the alameda corridor another example of toll railway is the alameda corridor it connects the ports of angeles and long beach with terminus for the transcontinental rail network located 20 miles north of the ports the ports purchased the rail right of way from the railroads and eliminated 200 at grade road and rail intersections by lowering the rail track in ten mile trench and constructing overpasses and underpasses for the roadways the railroads will reimburse part of the construction costs to the ports by paying per container fee for use of the corridor the idea for the corridor was proposed in 1984 by the southern california association of governments scag which is the local metropolitan planning organization mpo construction began in april 1997 and was completed in april 2002 broad array of analysts have suggested that the alameda corridor is model for improving the nations freight transportation system that could be repeated at other major cargo hubs the key to success for such project is an alignment of stakeholder interests with strong willingness on the part of rail companies to participate unlike the alameda corridor the alameda corridor east ace project has not apparently had the active participation of the union pacific railroad ace is project to eliminate grade crossings on rail track extending east from the northern terminus of the alameda corridor policy options for congress concern about the capability of the railroads to selffinance additional capacity as well as the financial and environmental constraints of building additional highway lanes raises several potential issues for congress as it reevaluates surface transportation funding programs in tea21 the broad policy issue is finding the right balance between marketdriven versus policydriven approach to rail investment key questions under consideration are should the federal government 46 for further examples of government assistance for rail projects see fra intercity freight and passenger rail state and local project reference guide april 2001 and us dot office of freight management and operations funding and institutional options for freight infrastructure improvements nd crs17 engage in publicprivate partnership with the railroads to ensure capacity for industry growth are current funding levels and programs adequate or are new sources of funding needed how should government funding be arranged should funding be rail specific or is this an opportunity for multimodal funding program how would projects deserving public aid be identified modal equity despite concerns about capital shortfalls the north american freight railroads are arguably the most selfsufficient railroads in the world freight or passenger when considering how government could engage in more cooperative relationship with the railroads many suggest the railroads first among them that the government first do harm the railroads and others contend that the most economically efficient policy the government could pursue to assist the pace of railway development is modeneutral transportation policy if federal funding distorts modal choice the nation as whole in this view may pay larger freight bill than is necessary while subsidized carrier may offer lower rate the real cost of transport may not be lower the cost difference is merely transferred to others the real total cost the lower rate plus the amount of subsidy may be greater than an aided competing mode may be willing to offer while some economists agree that federal funding should not be biased in favor of or against any one mode congress has not previously adopted modal equity as policy goal one controversial policy option is to refine current modal funding programs so that all surface freight modes pay the full cost of their infrastructure according to dot study on highway cost allocation the heaviest trucks pay only about 80 of their full cost of highway use47 according to cbo report barges pay only about 10 of the cost of their rightsofway48 proposals for how best to aid rail capacity are likely to renew debate on the long standing issue of modal equity rail trust fund the railroads are the only transportation mode in the united states that do not benefit from federal trust fund one proposal being discussed is to create railway trust fund analogous to the highway waterway and airway trust funds these existing trust funds are financed with levies on the users of the transportation system provided they vary in the type and combination of surcharges imposed but may include taxes on fuel new equipment cargo waybills and passenger fares the rationale of transportation trust funds is to provide dedicated pool of funds for infrastructure projects thus ensuring regular systematic funding stream rail trust fund set up in the manner of the highway trust fund could provide steady and predictable source of funds for rail infrastructure projects rail trust fund could 47 for further information on truck cost allocation see us dot fhwa federal highway

charged may 1992 crs18 also entice private sector and local government participation by leveraging federal dollars with contributions from local sources federal funds could serve as catalyst for getting projects underway critics of rail trust fund argue that such program puts the government in position of giving with one hand while taking away with the other if the goal is to shift additional resources to rail improvement projects some question how taxing the railroads and then handing it back with directions on how to spend it would accomplish this goal decision makers may also consider the impact of rail trust fund on rail competitiveness if rail surcharges increase the cost of rail visavis truck or barge it may divert freight to these competing modes an additional concern with rail trust fund is that once established it may prove difficult to terminate if changing economic circumstances invalidate the need for the fund multimodal trust fund many observers believe that major obstacle to achieving the goal of national intermodal transportation network as envisioned in the intermodal surface transportation and efficiency act istea pl 102240 is that the modes are separately managed and funded creating separate trust fund for rail projects could reinforce what these observers describe as stovepipe approach to transportation planning and finance intermodal supporters argue the focus should be on improving the connectivity and interoperability among modes public funding should be directed at improving the intermodal connectors that is the roadways or railways that link to seaports airports and rail yards resource paper prepared for the transportation research board noted every federal reauthorization act for transportation has categorized funding into discrete programs for specific classes of projects typically along modal lines because the old modal boundaries are becoming increasingly blurred at critical nodes and along key corridors compartmentalized approach presents clear challenges to dot in advancing these important types of investments49 this raises the matter of how multimodal trust fund could be financed could funds be generated from an all mode freight surcharge could pool of resources be generated from portion of existing trust funds these are complex policy questions with easy answers or consensus among stakeholders modify existing programs rather than creating additional trust funds another option being debated is making it easier for rail projects to qualify for existing highway trust fund htf financed programs federal assistance could for example be targeted to rail projects where the alternative highways are heavily congested use of highway trust fund monies for nonhighway projects is long standing debate although isteas language encouraged an intermodal approach for solving transportation needs it did 49 transportation research board planes trains and automobiles multimodal reauthorization opportunities scottsdale az aug 21 2000 p 8 crs19 not mandate it state dots consulting with metropolitan planning organizations mpos are given the power and flexibility to decide which projects get funded intermodal freight particularly rail freight has not received significant amounts of funding from istea nor tea21 intermodalism has largely been marketdriven rather than policydriven development the real focus of intermodalism in these laws is that it allowed the use of highway trust fund money more broadly for mass transit projects an advantage of allowing htf funds to be used for nonhighway projects is that it increases the options of state and local planners in solving their transportation needs it should be noted that some state laws prohibit gas tax money being used for nonroad projects nevertheless more options could lead to more cost efficient systemwide solutions for example it could be less expensive to improve an existing rail line to handle more traffic than to build additional highway lane miles another advantage of this approach is that it maintains the basic program framework created by istea and tea21 drawback of using the htf for nonhighway projects is the problem of eligibility creep expanding eligibility may dilute the political support for the fund if the interests benefitting from it are too widely dispersed using the gas tax to support nonroad projects could also reduce the userspay principle the principle that those who benefit must pay for the cost the existing gas tax is an imperfect pricing system however because all users do not necessarily pay their full costs for example the fuel tax does not capture the costs of congestion delays and air pollution and crosssubsidizes certain classes of system users expanding the eligibility of existing programs for rail does not guarantee that rail projects will be funded state dots and local mpos may favor highway and passenger related projects over freight rail concerns freight rail projects face stiff competition from highway and transit needs for limited resources in the htf local governments may perceive the benefits of freight rail projects as flowing outside their geographic boundaries another downside of increasing availability of htf dollars for rail projects is that it may make railroads dependent on public aid to get certain types of projects underway private carriers may then demand government aid on routine basis for private infrastructure improvements railway user charges toll railways such as the examples cited above in delaware and southern california are an alternative solution that some policymakers suggest could be repeated elsewhere the advantage is that they overcome the economic hurdle railroads face with large initial capital outlays for new construction the initial outlay is provided with public funds or by regional transportation authority the railroads repay some portion of the construction costs over period of time the rate of repayment is based on traffic volume with per car user fee the disadvantage of this proposal is that it probably can not be applied on national basis this option is more well suited to geographically limited corridor crs20 intermodal freight planning the issue of how an aid program might be arranged raises related issue of how projects deserving public support might be identified premise of istea and tea21 is that states and mpos are in the best position to identify and prioritize transportation projects needed in their area of jurisdiction however intermodal rail shipments are typically broader in scope geographically than the jurisdiction of single mpo or state dot significant portion of intermodal rail shipments move from one region of the country to another if not across the entire country as mentioned earlier half of all intermodal rail loadings are imports and exports at issue is how to select freight projects that could optimize the network nationally with transportation planning process that is largely decentralized to state the issue another way how can national interests be weighed with local concerns freight stakeholders contend that the existing transportation planning process results in an incremental approach to solving bottlenecks expanding freight capacity at one node in the network can have adverse repercussions for the surrounding community of the next hub downstream if additional traffic overloads their facilities from freight stakeholders point of view simply moving the choke point to the next hub does little to enhance the overall flow of goods as one observer noted you can not fit an 18 pipe into 9 pipe on the other hand if mpos or states do not coordinate their activities they could end up competing with one another for the same freight business this could lead to overcapacity one option is for mpos and state governments to work together to create regional planning perspective some states are already participating in multistate studies on corridors that cross state lines in the reauthorization debate policymakers may consider whether to formalize these multijurisdictional arrangements or allow them to continue informally another proposal is to create national rail map similar to the national highway system identified under the national highway system designation act of 1995 pl 10459 that would identify nationally significant rail corridors and target funding to projects on those corridors50 this proposal represents topdown approach to transportation planning in which the federal government actively identifies and evaluates projects deserving federal support legislative activity several proposals have been introduced in the 108th congress with the intent of accelerating the pace of investment in the nations rail network representative lipinski introduced bill hr 1617 which was referred to the house subcommittee on railroads to create rail trust fund to provide steady source of funding for rail infrastructure the bill would finance the fund by redirecting the 43 cent per gallon diesel tax from the general fund to the rail trust fund impose one percent freight waybill tax redirect portion of customs import duties to the rail fund impose five percent tax on rail commuter tickets impose five percent tax on freight and passenger rolling stock sales impose five percent tax on locomotive 50 jeremy f plant railroad policy and intermodalism policy choices after deregulation the review of policy research june 22 2002 crs21 sales impose new amtrak ticket tax and redirect portion of federal oil and gas royalties to the trust fund representative young introduced bill hr 2571 titled the rail infrastructure development and expansion act for the 21st century ride 21 which was reported by the house committee on transportation and infrastructure one provision of the bill particularly relevant to freight rail infrastructure would expand the rrif program from 35 billion to 35 billion and make it easier for railroads to qualify for rrif loans and loan guarantees representative millendermcdonald introduced the goods movement act of 2003 hr 3398 which was referred to the house subcommittee on highways transit and pipelines among other things the bill would provide grants from the highway trust fund to improve truck routes to intermodal freight transfer facilities and separate railroad and road crossings senator hollings introduced the american railroad revitalization investment and enhancement act arrive21 s 1961 which was referred to the senate committee on commerce science and transportation this bill would establish rail infrastructure finance corporation nonprofit publicprivate partnership that would have authority to issue 30 billion in taxcredit bonds to fund rail infrastructure improvements over six year period the bill also would require the dot to develop national rail plan and 50year intermodal blueprint to promote an efficient transportation system legislation reauthorizing tea21 tealu hr 3550 and safetea s 1072 currently in conference contain several provisions particularly important for intermodal freight transportation both the house and senate versions of the bill create an intermodal connectors program which would set aside portion of states highway funds to improve the roads leading to intermodal freight terminals both the house and senate bills also include language intended to ensure greater consideration of freight transport in state and mpo transportation planning processes the senate bill requires each state dot to designate freight transportation coordinator whose responsibility will be to ensure that freight considerations are integrated into the planning process coordinate with other states to solve regional transportation problems foster collaboration between public and private interests and build professional capacity to better understand freight transportation needs within state the house bill requires the us dot to establish freight capacity building program in order to better target investments in freight transportation systems and to strengthen the decision making process of state and local transportation agencies with regard to freight transport provision particular to rail transportation is in the senate bill and establishes grant program to assist municipalities in relocating rail track in order to improve public safety the flow of motor vehicle traffic or for economic development reasons under this provision the secretary of transportation is required to conduct costsbenefits analysis before awarding grant to any particular rail relocation project the senate bill also contains provision prohibiting the use of highway account funds for rail projects unless they produce public benefit for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31834
