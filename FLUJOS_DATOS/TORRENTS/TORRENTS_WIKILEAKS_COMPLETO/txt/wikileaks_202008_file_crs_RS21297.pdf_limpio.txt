in fy2006 there were approximately 1301 paid staff fulltime equivalents in state ltcops an increase of 34 since fy20006 despite this increase the program still relies heavily on volunteers to carry out program responsibilities nine out of every ten ombudsman staff serve as volunteers in fy2006 there were 13402 total volunteers 9183 of which were certified to investigate comp laints nationwide study conducted by the national l ong term care ombudsman ce nter found that 45 state ombudsman programs have volunteer programs and 37 state programs reported having certification process for their volunteers as of 19997 the 1995 iom evaluation along with study done by the office of inspector general oig in dhhs 1991 acknowledged the im portance of volunteers as contributing factor to high complaint resolution rates in this program8 however the iom evaluation advises that adequate methods for recruiting traini ng and supervising volunteers are essential to maximu m utilization of ombudsman progra m volunteers state programs have different procedures fo r certification of volunteers varying from required classroom training to tests for certification over tw othirds of volunteers 69 were trained and certified to investigate complaints in fy2006 9 increase since fy2000 in fy2006 ombudsmen reported just over 16750 nursing facilities and more than 47000 other residential longt erm care facilities operating na tionwide since fy2000 the total number of licensed fac ilities has increased by 5 from about 60900 to more than 63000 in fy20069 this increase is due to an increase in assisted living facilities board and care homes and other simila r facilities whic h more than offset the decrease in nursing homes over the past five years due to the requirement that ombudsmen inve stigate and resolve complaints of all residents in residential longterm care facilities the workload of staff and volunteers is substantial as shown by the reported ratio of staff to facilities and beds the nationwide ratio of paid ombudsman to facilities was one ombudsma n to every 49 facilities in fy2006 smaller ratio than reported in fy 2000 one ombudsman to every 62 facilities nationwide there were reported 28 milli on facility beds under the programs jurisdiction just over 17 million nursing home beds and about 11 million beds in other longterm care facilities

ratio of one paid fulltime equivalent staff per 2000 longterm care facility beds despite the high number of facilities to be covered by each ombudsman ombudsman staff and volunteers visited 83 of nursing homes on regular basis defined as at least quarterly in fy2006 these visits were not in response to complaint the percentage of nursing homes visited regularly by om budsman staff outweighs visits to other residential longterm car facilities the proportion of regula r visits to assisted living and other longterm care f acilities was 43 in fy2006 training state ombudsman programs are res ponsible for training new and existing staff the oaa contains only ba sic requirements for training and stipulates that the aoa is to develop model standa rds for training longterm care ombudsman both paid and unpaid volunteers furthermore the law s tipulates that the st ate long term care ombudsman is responsible for establishing pro cedures for training representatives of the local ombudsman program based on the aoa st andards and that training is to be developed in consultation with representatives of citizen groups longterm care providers and ombudsmen in the absence of specific fe deral training require ments andor required training materials many st ates have developed their ow n standards several states provide the training directly through an i ndividual who is responsible for conducting all of the training while some states require local ombudsman programs to conduct training state longterm care ombudsman programs have received assistance in developing training programs from the national long term care ombudsman resource center operated by the national citizens coalition for nursing home reform11 program data and r esident complaints in fy2006 aoa data show that ombudsmen opened just over 190000 new cases of resident complaints and closed more than 182000 cases in all types of facilitie s between fy2000 and fy2006 the total number of cases closed incr eased by onethird 33 since 1999 resident care issues have been the primary complaint category in nursing homes poor quality of care in nursing homes has been attributed to insufficient numbers of staff to care for residents however the relationship between staffing and quality of care is complex and includes range of staffing related issues such as wages and benefits training education experi ence and staff turnover12 the top five resident complaints in nursing homes for fy2006 are 1 unheeded requests for assistance 2 pr oblems with discharge planning or eviction notification

conducted in 1995 by the iom conc luded that the program plays an important role in improving longterm care services but is understaffed and underfunded to carry out its broad and co mplex responsibilities13 in march 1999 dhhss oig recommended that aoa work with states to strengthen the program by developing guidelines for minimum level of program visibility that include criteria for the frequency and length of regular visits as well as the ratio of om budsman program staff to longterm care beds further developing strategies for recruiting training and supervising more volunteers and establishing ways in which ombudsman progra ms can enhance collaboration with the state nursing home survey and certification agenci which are responsible for oversight of nursing home care quality14 2000 study of state ombudsman programs reaffirmed the importance of several factors identified in the iom evaluation as key to program effectiveness including sufficient funding staff and volunteer s autonomy of ombudsman program in organizational placement within the state supportive political or social environment and strong interorganizational relationships15 study of local ombudsman programs conducted in two states ca lifornia and new york in 2004 found wide variation both across and within each states program in terms of program location area agency on aging versus nonprofit organization and the number of paid staff versus volunteers despite reporting that their program budgets were inadequate to s upport their mandated requirements program coordinators in both states percei ved their programs as effective more so in the nursing home setting than in board and care facilities program coordinators in both states similarly identified staffing resident care and residents rights as the most pressing issues16
