congressional debate over ope ning the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr on portion of th north slope of alaska to petroleum exploration and developmen t is under way in the 109th congress current law prohibits such development in anwr the north slope is home to the two larg est oil fields in north america and to the largest us oil field discovered in the last decade the north slope also is home to diverse unique and fragile ecosystem resulting in extensive federal state and local regulatory protection pa rtly due to increased restri ctions since the discovery of prudhoe bay operators have developed less environm entally intrusive ways to recover arctic oil primar ily through innovations in veral types of technology seismic technology offers the explorati on sector advanced analytical methods that generate high resolution images of geol ogic structures and that help identify oil and gas accumulations by looking for nomalies or hydrocarbon indicators in the seismic data iceba sed technology has been improved so as to better serve remote areas during exploratory drilling and production computers now allow the manipulation and interp retation of vast amount s of data offering more precise well locations thereby reducing the number of wells needed to find hydrocarbon accumulations recent advances in drilling can reduce th footprint of petr oleum operations in arctic environments new drilling bit designs fluid formulas and advanced forms of drilling such as extended reach horiz ontal and designer wells permit drilling to reach as far as five miles from wellh ead location and to drill around geological barriers to find and develop hydrocarbon accu mulations advances in drilling allow less space for drilling rig and reduce volum and weights of both equipment and drilling waste production facilities are now more compact with modules performing many functions project goal of operators on the north slope is zero discharge of solid and fluid wastes producti on drilling techniques using slim hole technology such as coiled tubing and multilatera l drilling can cont ribute to smaller footprints less waste and better recovery of hydrocarbons from each well proponents of opening anwr to energy development maintain that these technologies substantially mitigate the eff ects on the environment of oil and gas operations and assert that the increase in domesticallyproduced energy would be worth any minimal environmental impacts opponents counter that facility of any size would still be an industr ial site and an intrusion on the ecosystem and argue that the need for gravel and scarce water the permanent roads ports and airstrips that would follow and the unknown number of spills would destroy vegetation contaminate water

gas exploration and velopment that part is 15millionacre area called the coastal plain the so called 1002 area among the arguments put forward by proponents of opening anwr is that there would be much smaller surface impact or footprint from the petr oleum industrys presence compared with procedures operations and equipment di scussed in the 1987 final legislative environmental impact statement fleis on the refuge prepared by the department of the interior1 current law prohibits petrol eum and gas development in anwr some environmental impact is unavoida ble with industry activity searching for oil and gas involves drilling into the earth with heavy equipment and various facilities and other ac tivities are necessary to support such drilling the downscaling of petroleum equipment and

troleum technologies substantially mitigate the environmental impact of oil and gas operations compared with how north slope alaska oil was developed or iginally it also is contended that the use of natural resources such as gravel and water the probability of spills and the loss of wilderness as result of human intr usion are issues that technology advances cannot address gravel would be used in developmen t of the 1002 area at least for things such as main pads airstrips and connecting roads mining the gravel might result in local changes in topography roads may ve to be built to transport the gravel to exploration and production sites and there would be direct loss of coastal plain habitat due to secondary effects of grav spray dust depos ition and altered snow melt and erosion

fleis with its recommendation to drill in anwr tables 1 and 2 summarize the increasing ava ilability of these technological changes since 1987 some technologies are reported to have gone from the embryonic stage white to the mature stage black the shades of gray indicate that technology is characterized by continuum of application and integration by the industry four of the now mature technologies were in early stages of commercialization in 1987 embryonic and emerging technologies are those first supported by scientific fundamentals and theory and then introduced to industry as technology transfer to and initial testing of the technology by industry characterizes growth technology as the technology is used it may or ma not prove to be successful to the industry if the

different possible interpretations of that data lead to an estimate of the geologic risk the n the economic implications of these interpretations the economic risk is evaluated by the company and an overall risk is estimated before it is decided to drill an exploratory well advanced techniques in seismic data in terpretation allow geophysicist to see and to interpret the likely presence of hy

environmental damages of unnecessary wells during ex ploration for and production of hydrocarbon fields the use of advanced exploration techni ques has contributed to the more than doubling of exploration success the percen tage of new field wildcat wells drilled that find any amount of hydrocarbons since the 1980s13 higher success rates mean fewer wells drilled and because ther are fewer wells there may be less impact on the environment however especially in sparsely explored regions exploration carries high risk of dry holes despite the advanced techniques the process of evaluating exploration is important because the most probable outcome of an exploratory well is well without suffici ent quantities of econo mically recoverable hydrocarbons quantifying this risk is fundamental part of the petroleum business there are three common factors in ascertaining geologic risk for petroleum to be present structure is needed to concentrate hydrocarbons reservoir rock is needed to hold hydrocarbons and source rock is needed to form hydrocarbons geologists and geophysicists tr to determine if these three factors are present if hydrocarbons are thought to occur in suffi cient quantities an exploratory well may be justifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31022crs9 14 anthony b hayward expl oration frontiers for new century determined by technology politics oil and gas journal dec

is more expensive and disruptive to the environment than 2d data acquisition nd interpretation difficulties in onshore seismic acquisition and interpretation include ownership of the surface rights physical and geomorphological barriers and difficulties in interpreting the data as result of attenuation or weakening of the data because the sound signal can be absorbed by the upper layers of the earth and is converted to heat instead of an echo in alaska 3d seismic surveys have been acquired in the npra and in areas surrounding the producing fields on state lands 2d and 3d seismic interp retations however are indi rect exploration methods because seismic work results in the mapping of structure in the units of time that it takes the sound echo to reach the surface converting the time recorded to the depth from which that echo is generated involves integrating geological data from wells if available and advanced processing and mathematical modeling characterizing the type and properties of the reservoir rock and identifying fluid type such as oil or gas is improving but seismic data cannot yet routinely determine if rock is source of petroleum17 recent advances in

technology icebased technologies have reduced the need for perman ent gravel roads in the arctic to move equipment and have allowed industry to conduct seis mic operations and to drill exploration wells in the winter with reduced impact on the physical environment ice technologies substantia lly reduce the need fo r gravel structures with their high and longlasting environm ental impacts at the exploration phase and may offer some advantages in the development and produc tion phases as well however use of ice technologies is constrained by the availab ility of fresh water hilly terrain and rising winter temperatures ice roads ice road construction begins with the use of vehicles called rolligons with huge tires and very low pr essure on the ground to transport and stage equipment rolligons compact the ice crystals as they travel over the surface of the frozen tundra removing air and prom oting further freezing of the ice snow collected along temporary snow fences and fresh water are added to the surface to increase the thickness of the ice also ice chips are trimmed from frozen lakes to increase the road thickness warming trend over the last 30 years has delayed the start of ice road construction from midnovember to usually mid or late december insulated ice pads changing climatic conditions that have shortened the time available for exploration have resulted in widespread use of insulated ice pads drilling an exploratory well to 10000 feet ta kes 90 to 140 days if problems arise problems can seriously delay exploration as equipment may have to be demobilized and transported to storage area and drilling operations would have to be completed the following winter higher average temperatures from the fall to the spring on the north slope have restricted exploratory operations from over 200 days in the early 1970s to 75 to 110 days in recent years because of the economic and environmental effects of short drilling seasons indus try attention in the 1990s fo cused on lengthening drilling seasons primarily th rough the use of insulated pads drilling site is selected pad of ice is constructed toward the end of the winter and covered with insulation over the summer months insulated ice pads about 400 feet by 300 feet can be covered with windresist ant insulating panels to preserve the drill pad through the summer the drilling rig is then moved to the insulated pad site the following winter20 drilling season can then be increased by 50 to 70 days21 but even with this method drilling seasons ar shorter than they were 30 years ago if oil is not found in economic quantitie s ice pads and roads are allowed to melt with little effect on plants under the ice where pads are maintained over ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31022crs13 22 fleis p 13 23

case the plants consume stored nutrients completely and die however research is being conducted on designs to minimize the perimeter impact if economic quan tities of oil are f ound gravel pad is constructed to support long term development and c onstruction and vegetation underneath the gravel dies factors limiting use of ice technologies several factors limit the use of ice technologies these include the total amount of available fresh water b the distance from sources of fresh water c the topography of the area and d the distance from staging areas the supply of fresh water is crucial to using ice technologies as melted saltwater would kill underlying vegetation the fleis noted that the supply of fresh water is limited in the 1002 area and is confined to the surface and the shallow zone of soil located above the imperm eable permafrost layer22 the refuge receives an average of six inches of precipitation annually mo st lakes are shallow and therefore freeze solid in winter 1989 study found 255 lakes ponds and puddles within the 1002 area23 less than 25 were deeper than seven feet only eight contained enough unfrozen water to build mile or more of ice road number of rivers and streams exist in the 1002 area and these too are us ually shallow ice chips from lakes and rivers can be used to suppl ement ice road construction each mile of ice road uses an estimated one million gallons of liquid water that road builders typically transport more than 10 miles as it may freeze before it is used water shortages might be addressed with greater use of chipped ice scraped from lakes ndor development of new technologies using salination plant and h eated elevated pipeline24 ice road construction also may be limite d by the areas topography developed areas on the north slope eg prudhoe bay kuparuk and alpine are very flat facilitating ice technology whereas the 1002 area is hillier its drainage is better established and its vegetati on is more woody than the wetland grasses that dominate prudhoe bay and other devel oped areas foothills and the hilly portions constitute 45 and 22 respectively of the anwr coastal plain where topographic relief is high the state of alaska has allowed gravel roads in lieu of ice for safety reasons25 distance from developed areas or potential staging areas can also limit ice technology as noted heavy equipment us ually would be stored in the nearest possible gravel staging areas and once ice roads are finished moved to the drill site if the distance for ice road construction is great there will be delay in reaching the drill site thereby adding to costs at the production phase when still more equipment must be moved the cost of delay could rise furtherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31022crs14 26 department of the

wwwal pinesatellites eiscom visited on dec 13 2004as noted above solutions to these problems exist if not as in the case of topographic limits on use of ice roads gr avel construction can be substituted however if polar warming continues use of ice technology may be limited still further standards for crosstundra travel are being changed to accommodate industry needs while still attempting to balance effects on tundra habitat because it is regarded as model of m odern development the history of the alpine field is relevant located along the border of th national petroleum reserve alaska npra it is considered model of roadless development because of the short threemile road connecting the two initial pads and the lack of connection with the remainder of north slope development except in winter via ice road as noted earlier however the recent approval of five additional pa ds will add about 28 miles of gravel roads to the existing thr ee miles and create 1845 acres of disturbed soils about 150 miles of roads would be built if the field is fully developed26 in sum ice technologies can significan tly limit the footprints of development in the exploration phase especially in fl at terrain with corre sponding benefits to tundra vegetation experience at alpine how ever suggests somewhat more modest mitigation role for ice technologies in development phases after exploration exploration technology comparisons exploration today is much more efficient with the use of advanced exploration technology than it was 20 years ago when the fleis was being prepared late 1980s exploration technology in its 1987 fleis the department of the interior assumed that additional surface geological work or field studies probably would occur in anwr in the summer months prior to exploratory drilling access would be by helicopter and act ual ground time would be only few hours the fleis assumed that additional seis mic exploration which would occur in the winter would take place to obtain more detailed information on subsurface geology use of equipment that gene rates sound waves by vibrating the earth probably would be the prefe rred method and doi raised the possibility of requests for authorizations to conduct 3 d seismic surveys it also anticipated large number of seismic crews because different compan ies would want to obtain data in different areas using different acquisition parameters and techniques movement of equipment was assumed to take place on ice roads crude ly built by packing snow by all terrain vehicles ice roads would be constructed of packed snow thick enough to protect the vegetation mat at that time the alaska department of natural resources required 12 inches of frost and 6 inches of snow before vehicles coul d operate on the tundra single drilling season from onset of construction through testing and demobilization was expected to be appr oximately 170 days one moderately deephttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31022crs15 well less than 10000 feet could be drille d in one season well deeper than 10000 feet would require two seasons if two seasons were required yearround drilling or second demobiliz ation and mobilization woul d be required to continue drilling the following season drill pads were anticipated by doi to be constructed of ice excavated material gravelfoamtimber or other possible comb inations pad would be large enough to hold rig camp and facilities fo r storing equipment and supplies current exploration technology it is likely that field work still would be required in anwr as it is the only method th at allows the study of the vertical and lateral relationship of the different rock types at the surface or outcrops that one would expect to be potential reservoir targets in the subsurface while the length of time required in the field may not change other work could be accelerated by faster interpretation of many data sets and ne w remote sensing and positioning techniques compared to those available in the 1980s add itionally advances in computer technology help make interpre tation of field work more fficient for example over the decade some of the major petroleum companies have been using vast amounts of outcropderived rock data from around the world to design and calibrate powerful computer models to predict potential re servoir rock and its properties in the subsurface of an area in anwr vibrators probably would be us ed to acquire the seismic data during the winter this type of seismic data equipment usually is the largest heaviest piece of equipment used by seismic crews and requires special methods of transport the number of seismic crews in the field in given area may well be about the same as in other regions being explored as ismic contractors may follow the common practice of conducting seismic programs for multiple companies interested in acquiring data 3d seismic data is of interest to the companies interested in exploring anwr but 3d seismic data are not commonly us ed to explore far from known hydrocarbon fields their greatest value is in areas w ith sufficient data and in the use of the production of known hydrocarbon accumulation depending on the kind of information n eeded the geology expected and the type of terrain 2d seismic surveys can be customized to obtain the necessary seismic data for exploration today 2 d seismic data are of much higher quality than even 15 years ago and if programs ar laid out correctly 2d seismic data are valuable exploration tool advanced dr illing t echnology

subsurface at angles other th an vertical while guiding wellpath to ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31022crs16 an introduction to drilling the processes and terms drilling well requires the use of drilling rig which controls rotating pipe or drill pipe on which cutting tool or drill bit is attached the drill bit needs to be lubricated by drilling fluids usually natural or synthetic fluid called mud equipment can be placed on the bit to direct the location and movement of the bit as the pipe rotates and cuts through the rock below the surface it produces rock chips or cuttings which flow to the surface in the mud and placed in shallow plasticlined holes on the drill pad called reserve pits or reinjected into the subsurface evaluation tools are used measure the rock characteristics to preserve the well hole or borehole being drilled mud is used to hold back the subsurface rocks during drilling and casing or pipe is placed in the hole to protect the overlying rocks and the reservoir rocks casing also controls the flow of drilling fluid and oil gas and water from the reservoir after part of the hole is drilled the borehole also is the conduit for petroleum and water from the reservoir to the surface if the flow of fluid up the borehole is uncontrolled blowout in the least extreme case kick occurs prevention techniques are used first to kill the well or stop the fluid flow as last resort equipment blow out preventer stack bop or blind rams placed at or near the surface over the top of the wellbore are used to stop the flow of fluids the direction of the borehole is the well path and the equipment at the beginning of the borehole at the surface is the wellhead if the well encounters hydrocarbons the casing and formation are perforated to allow hydrocarbons to flow into the borehole to the surface wells drilled from common borehole are called sidetracks predefined target involves integrating complex set of technologies to solve technical control and safety problems these problems can be related to unexpected subsurface pressure regimes and fluid types as these problems have been and are being solved directional drilling has gained widespread acceptance the advantages of directional drilling are multiple wells can be drilled from single location allowing easier connections to production facilities and less surface disruption targets below environmentally sensitive areas can be reached from different location up to five to seven miles away more of the target reservoir formation can be accessed from borehole reducing the number of wells and in case of kick see box relief wells can be drilled at an angle to kill the well technology now allows wells to deviat from the vertical from few degrees to horizontal depending on the subsurface geology and the environmental constraints types of di rectional wells are extended reach horizontal and designer or complex wells see figure 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31022crs17 27 doe environmental

well drilling erd wells evolved rapidly in the 1990s and ge nerally are used to reach targets in environmentally sensitive areas from fe wer surface locations erds have horizontal displacement of two to five time s the vertical depth wellheads can also be located closer to each other allo wing for easy hookup to production facilities in the late 1960s erd could reach out little more than mile now erd wells can routinely go out about four miles and five tosevenmile long erd wells have been successfully completed in the north sea and china27 the sevenmile distance between the discovery and the confirma tion well at prudhoe ba could have been drilled by erd from one location horizontal wells are erd wells drilled vertically to the desired depth and then turned 90 degrees to continue horizontally through rock formations for up to five miles drilling erd and horizontal wells require specialized equipment such as motors placed near the bit and equipment to stabilize the wellpath because of the difficulties of using standard evaluation tools in these wells evaluation tools have been developed that measure the rock characteristics at the drill bit while drilling designer wells these are drilled with high precision at sharp angles at times less than 90 and even to near circ they are designed to reach small targets several small il accumulations at one time or to go around geological barriers complex well drilling has been made practical by the use of 3d seismic data that allow reservoir engineers to plot subsurface features to within 10 feet and made possible by new technologies that allow tight turns with steel pipe the drilling of well itself see box on the previous page has not been the limiting operation in horizontal and erd wells the limitations are the physical operations of working with long nonvertical strings of steel pipe as discussed in the next section drill bit technology nd new drilling fluid systems have been developed to help alleviate the problems of high performance drilling drill bit technology and drilling fluid systems advances in drill bit technology and drilling fluids have impr oved drilling performance significantly by allowing wells to be drilled more quickly drill bits greater efficiency during the drilling phase allows for shorter times in an area extending the drill bit life at the bottom of the hole saves time bits such as the polycrystalline diam ond compact pdc bit provide for faster drilling and can be used much longer the pdc bit was introduced by general electric in 1973 the bits use cutters made of thick layer of tungsten carbide impregnated with bonded diamond particles diamond is 10 times hard er than steel and is the most wear resistant material in existence drilling fluids drilling fluids or muds are

multiple sites to delineate newly discovered field drilling typically was expected to be conducted dur ing the winter for the exploration and delineation wells typical drill pad including the reserve pit covered five to ten acres which included facilities to house 100135 workers during construction and drilling of the well reserve pits were excavated on the pad the reserve pit generally covered 05 to 20 acres and was 10 to 20 feet deep flare pit or vent system for excess gas was also included on the drill pad current technology conventional vertical wells most likely would be used for drilling exploratory wells in anwr if potentially commercial hydrocarbon accumulation were found high performance drilling techniques likely would be used to reduce the number and size of drill sites and allow drilling fewer delineation wells probably all wells would be drilled in the winter prudhoe bay had 42 drill sites constructed in 19711977 to velop the estimated 96 billi on barrels of oil if prudhoe bay were developed with horizontal drilling only 11 sites would be needed to develop an estimated 14 billion barrels of oil28 temporary reserve pits if needed for storage of well cuttings would be surrounded by walls of ice on the ice pad according to arco alaska now phillips alaska cuttings would be transported to sites where they could be cleaned and could be used for construction material

arctic and to instantly see the effects of suggested changes results in more efficient design and construction of the facilities zero discharge of solid and fluid wastes the major drilling wastes are drilling m ud water produced along with the oil and drill cuttings drilling mud is pumped down borehole into rock layers in the subsurface containing enough pore space to accept additional fluids without inducing cracks in the rock the borehole must be adequately protected by casing strong enough to contain the fluid in the rock that would flow into the borehole as result of the higher reservoir pressures currently all liquid and all solid drilling and associated wastes generated at the recently developed alpine field are disposed of by injecting them into the subsurface at prudhoe bay all drilling wastes are treated and reinjected into the subsurface associ ated wastes such as office paper and food waste are burned on site and the ash is transported elsewhere for disposal water almost always is produced togeth er with oil and the amount of water increases as oil production from given fiel d decreases usually water and oil are pumped to the surface for separation but sy stems below the surface can now separate oil and water new downhol separation technologies may be able to reduce the amount of produced water by as much as 97 in some wells29 dual pump systems at and above

used in one form or another by the oil and gas industry since 1960 as way of reducing costs and improving exploration and drilling results30 slim holes are 3 425 inches in diameter while conventional holes are 810 inches at the bottom of the well slim hole drill rig uses 97 less drilling fluid generates onethird less cuttings volume and has 25 man drill crew instead of conventional rig crew of 4031 transport of equipment and rig can be by helicopter for easier access to remote areas slim hole drilling also can be used in exploratory wells to gather cores from the subsurface and slim holes are used in improved producti on drilling techniques discussed below however the shortc omings of slim hole drilling are poor methods to keep fluids from escaping the borehole nd the need for nonstandard bits and well evaluation tools also if drill pad were to benefit from slim hole drilling all wells on that site may need to be slim hole wells coiled tubing drilling ctd traditional rotary drilling rigs are as tall as 200 feet and include 30foot tions of drill pipe that must be connected to increase the length of the pipe as the well goes to greater depths in ctd units large drum containing reel of seamless steel pipe that is quite flexible is used ctd units drill rock with the use of motor on the bit to drive the coiled steel through the formation ctd drilling was used first on the north slope in 1991 some of the advantages of ctd are very little pipe handling nd drill pipe connectionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31022crs22 better control of fluids in the borehole allowing for the use of lighter less toxic muds noise at 45 decibels instead of 55 decibels smaller sites less than half and less surface disturbance because it is easier to handle the equipment during the preparation for drilling less heavy equipment lower fuel consumption and emissions and personnel necessary at the wellhead disadvantages of ctd are small diameter drill pipe is us ed and limit s the utility for some drilling objectives such as exploration wells the drill pipe cannot be rotated from the surface mandating more advanced drilling practices and equipment and the reel of coiled pipe is heavy nd often difficult to transport and lift multilateral drilling multilateral wells were fi rst used in production drilling on the north slope in 1999 from central borehole additional boreholes are drilled to different locations branching from common borehole because the secondary boreholes share central borehole th ey can share the same surface facility throughtubing rotary drilling wells the most recent and very innovative technology developed on the nort h slope in years is throughtubing rotary drilled ttrd wells with ttrd new well is drilled through the production tubing of an older well as multilateral well because the old tubing doesnt have to be pulled out of the ground by drilling rig rig even smaller than ctd unit can be used for drilling one of the benefits of ttrd equipment is that the unit can be transported over ice bridges w ith stringent weight restrictions these benefits allow access to areas not open to conventional rigs and decrease the number of surface drilling sites however the t echnology is useful only in areas where production wells have been completed in the past comparison of production technology production in the late 1980s the 1987 fleis evaluation assumed the production fac ilities would be producing from hydrocarbon accumulation of 35000 acres in the subsurface this accumula tion was estimated to require 220 production wells and 90 injection wells expected well spacing was 120 feet requiring seven 20 to100acre drill pads constr ucted of gravel and containing 40 to 50 wells on each drill site the production facilities posited woul d have included operations offices fuel and water storage electrical powergeneration units solid and fluid waste and watertreatment facilities the impact of petroleum operations on the surface was estimated in 1987 to extend only to the size of the accumulati on ie 35000 acres doi projected that the subsurface size and shape of the productiv field would define the areal extent of the surface disturbance from the central production facilities directional drilling from one pad site was posed as an option and the directional we lls were assumed to have been drilled at angles up to 60httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31022crs23 32 personal communication with dawn patience phillips alaska at anchorage may 2001peak production was assumed to be attainable in two to five years and to remain at this level for three to eight years w ith the productive life of the field projected at 2030 years while difficult to determine in the arctic about 10 year time lapse was expected from lease acquisition to initial production unde r optimal conditions the drill cuttings would have to be placed in reserve pit 05 20 acres 10 20 feet deep on the drill pad drilling muds would be reinjected

multifuncti onal modules and pr oduction techniques computer graphics now allow operators to plan site and to make changes before construction begins at the site the alpine field is 40000acre accumula tion with operations including two production drilling sites connected by roada irstrip these struct ures cover 97 acres alpine field operations occupy only 02 the area of the hydrocarbon accumulation whereas prudhoe bay facilities occupy twice the area of the accumulation alpines footprint is reduced by drilling all wells horizontally and from compact facilities permanent drill sites can be much smalle r today partly because drill solids and fluids are reinjected and not put in reserve pits multilateral wells and coiled tubing wells drilled as slim hole we lls require less mud and pr oduce less waste ttrd units can be used to access hardtoreach areas over lightload bridges and in seasons with barely frozen tundra gas may not be fl ared except for safety reasons but can be used in projects during production and ma be flared for safety reasons only however today in alaska drill sites still would be constructed of gravel or recycled cuttings from the exploration wells well cuttings may be treated and used as construction material in place of gravel produced water today is greatly reduced by improved production techniques by 2001 more than 95 of the associated operational waste were being recycled at prudhoe and operators at the alpine field had project goal of zero discharge of all wastes32 observations gains from north slope experience thirty years of development experi ence on the north slope have led to considerable advances in exploration dr illing and pr oduction operations and reduction in the size of the footprint of pe troleum operations in arctic environments these advances many of which are used at the alpine field w ould be available for use in the 1002 area of anwr should it be opened by congress exploration success rates ve improved dramatically which probably would mean fewer exploration wells the use of 3d seismic technology during the exploration for hydrocarbon fields and the production stages of fields on the northhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31022crs24 33 however warming trends in the high arc tic have shortened the exploration season over the last 30 years the shorter season is now addressed by having two starting dates and two stopping dates shorter season for heavy equipment and longer season for lighter vehicles in addition studies conducted jointly by federal and state agencies as well as academic experts are underway to modify curre nt standards for crosstundra travel these may result in further lengthening of the exploration seasonslope enables geologists and geophysicists to be more proficie nt in interpreting seismic data and in identifying the type of hydrocarbon and the use of computer aided models results in fewer and betterplaced wells partly to protect the north slopes t undra exploration ope rations are conducted exclusively in the winter with extensive use of ice roads and allterrain vehicles33 advances in seismic acquisition and pro cessing techniques allow for permafrost exploration using vibrating in stead of explosive techniques reductions in the size of production facilities have decreased the footprint of more recent north slope operations the minimum spacing between onshore wells has been reduced by about 80 from 160 feet to 35 feet an average production drill site has shrunk about 85 from 65 acres to fewer than 9 acres and fewer dril sites are needed with new high perfo rmance drilling techniques and production drilling technology and reserv pits have been eliminated or used on insulated ice pads only temporarily north slope operators are using advan ced technology to manage drilling wastes more effectively cleaned well cuttings can be used for construction material in roads and other gravel structures gri ndandinject technology can enable 100 of all drilling solid and fluid wastes to be in jected into the subsurface which eliminates the need for reserve pits additionally fewer wells drilled means that less solid and fluid waste is generated conclusions there are supportable grounds for proponents of opening anwr to energy development to assert that the advanced technologies for oil and gas development in the arctic might significantly mitigate the effects on the environment of oil and gas operations but opponents assert that notw ithstanding technological improvements facilities of any size would be an industrial site and an intrusion on the ecosystem that would use the areas natural resources interfere with wildlife risk spills of hazardous materials and result in perm anent loss of wilderness in the final analysis the issue of whether to open anwr to energy development remains policy decisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31022crs25 34 for additional information see us department of the interior arctic

delta which in clude more than 36 hydrocarbon fields totaling 740 million barrels of il and 10 trillion cubic feet of gas because of the geologic complexity selection acquisition nd interpretation of data in the deformed area is difficult compared with acquiri ng and interpreting data from the undeformed area if anwr were opened drilling nd production techniques in the deformed area would be different than in the undefo rmed area because of this complexity the determination of the existence of source rock that can generate petroleum is important before active ex ploration begins in new area the potential for rocks to generate hydrocarbons is determined by the organic geochemistry of the rocks on the surface or in the subsurface the ge ochemistry of the outcrops analyzed from the outcrop samples taken in 19831985 indicat that five rock sequences sampled in the 1002 area have the potential to genera oil and gas ga s can be generated from the same rocks that produce oil but the rocks need to have been buried to greater depths and higher temperatures gas can also be generated from rocks with different organic content than the oilgene rating rocks only one of the five rock sequences in the 1002 area is more prone to producing oil than gas the other four identified rock sequences are more likely to produce gas36
