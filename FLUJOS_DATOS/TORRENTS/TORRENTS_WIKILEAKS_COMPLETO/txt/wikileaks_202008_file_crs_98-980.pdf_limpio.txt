substantially lower than market values thi s report will not be updated unless the current systems are substantially changed timber harvested from federal lands two federal agencies th forest service fs and the bureau of land management blm sell significant quantities of timber in general both agencies determine salable quantities based on physical factors area available for timber cutting timber growth and reserves to maintain sustainable harvests but sale levels are constrained by public tolerance of possible environmental dama ges and desires for other uses once annual sale levels are determined each agency pre pares individual sales the number and size depends largely upon the potenti buyers in the area the process typically takes several years to plan the sale and pre pare the area finally the agencies appraise the timber estimate the market value and the appraised value becomes the minimum price for the timberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98980crs2 see crs report 951077 forest

unit of measurement for grazing on federal lands see crs report 96450 grazing fees an overview 5the timber i s then sold to the qualified bidder ie an individual or firm with th capacity to harvest the timber with the highest bid for blm sales buyers pay the total bid value for most fs sales in the west buyers pay the average bid value ie the bid rate for the amount of timbe r actually removed as measured scaled by the agency or an independent third party most fed eral timber is sold competitively with markets to set prices although as much as third of fs timber is sold at or near the appraised value many timber sales cost more to prepare than the return to the us treasury in fy1997 fs timber revenues were 451 million while allocated expenses including the revenue sharing payments were 527 million however prices cannot simply be raised genera ting net timber sale profits would require altering practices to reduce agency costs or to increase timber market values3 livestock grazing on federal lands the federal government charges fee for grazing private livestock on the federa l lands managed by the blm and the fs each agency identifies grazing allotments an d determines the numb er and timing of livestock grazing based on forage quantities range conditions other uses and historical gra zing all allotments are required to be associated with base property private lands located in the vicinity of the allotment while the agencies have the authority to reallocate allotments allotments typically remain with the permittees indefinitely unless they sell the base property or violate the terms of the agree ment the taylor grazing act of 1934 specifies that grazing permit is not right r interest in the land but because the allotments are usually transferred with the base ranch when it is inherited or sold the value of the allotment is typically capitalized into th ranchs value although the grazing use may be adjusted upon transfer grazing fees for both agencies were establishe d under formula in the public range lands improvement act of 1 978 pria and extended by executive order the formula consists of base value 123 per aum set in 1966 adjusted by indices of livestock4 prices and rancher operating co sts sometimes called ability to pay factors the grazing fee for 1998 was 135 per aum many studies suggest that federal grazing fees ar substantially lower than private lease rates and that the federal expenditures for grazing management substantially exceed the revenues 1996 receipts were 28 million whil program costs were 74 million however ranchers argue that di fferent requirements and5 costs invalidate such comparisons since grazing allotments are associated with bas property and are not competi tively bid the market value cannot be determined precisely the appropriate fee has been debated for decades recreation on federal lands recreation use of the federal lands is not sold in the traditional sense but federal agencies do charge fees for some types of recreation recreation is available on mos thttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98980crs3 see crs report 98794 enr federal recreational fees demonstration program 6 the federal government also leases other energy and minerals onshore eg coal potash 7 phosphates and geothermal heat but these leasing systems are not discussed in this reportfederal lands but fees are only charged for users of certain developed facilities such s campgrounds and boat launches and for entering certain areas mostly park system units and some wildlife refuges congress first authorized agenci to collect entrance and user fees in the land and water conservation fund act of 1965 lwcf with revenue s credited to the lwcf account for possible subsequent appropriations the lwcf act as amended specifies both entrance and user fees that can be charged for certain types of areas in 19 93 congress authorized the agencies to retain up to 15 of the revenues to recover fee collection costs 10002b of pl 10366 in 1996 congress established the recreational fee demonstration program allowing the fs park service fish an d6 wildlife service and b lm to test new fee options for recovering the cost to operate and maintain federal recreation sites since revenues under th lwcf fees are substantially less than agency management costs the park service estimates that its fy1999 demon stration fee collections will be 132 million in addition the agencies allow certain commercial recreational organizations to use federal lands and facilities major developed sites principally within the national park and national forest systems eg lodges restaurants ski are as are operated maintained and sometimes improved by concessioners under contracts and leases with the agency competitive bidding is intended to capture the fair market value to recover fair share for the government but many have criticized federal contr acting policies as subsidizing the concessioners numerous large park concession contracts are due for renewal and the trend spurred by congressional criticism has been for substantial fee increases othe r commercial users eg river rafters outfitters and guides are also charged an adminis trative fee for their us permits again these fees are intended to capture the fair market value of the use but critics assert that the fees are unduly low in the closing days of the 105 congress an omnibus parks management bill plth 105391 revised park concessions policy concession fees will now be deposited in special account with 80 directly available for high priority projects at the park uni t where the fees were collected and 20 directly available throughout the park system fees are to assure that public services are available at reasonable price minerals extracted from federal lands several pproaches are used in disposing of minerals from federal lands locatable also called hardrock minerals are disposed under the general mining law of 1872 federal oil and gas resources are disposed under one set of laws onshore and different set of laws offshore salable minerals sand gravel and other common construction7 materials are sold under other provisio ns these components are discussed separately locatable minerals the general mining law of 1872 was intended to promot mineral exploration and development as p art of the efforts to encourage settlement of the west the law allows prospectors to stake claims to unclaimed areas that they believe contain valuable minerals filing claim requires 25 location fee and 10 servic ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98980crs4 blm administers all

claimant pays 250 per acre for placer claims eg alluvial deposits of high quality sand r gravel or 500 per acre for lode claims eg lode or vein deposits usually in quartz or other rock to obtain title to the land and minerals these peracr fees were substantial when the mining law was enact ed in 1872 but are fraction of land values today the federal government currently receives royalties or share of profits from locatable mineral discoveries or extraction from federal or exfederal land10 onshore oil and gas the system for leasing onshore oil and gas on federal lands was revised in 1987 replacing system that had been in place since 1920 the bl m11 plans the areas and timing of offerings and administers the leases while the mineral s management service mms collects the royalties all leasable tracts must initially b offered competitively usually bid at oral auction with the highest responsible qualified bidder being awarded the contract these bonus bids are part of the lease payments lease holders must also pay an annual rental fee of at least 150 per acre increasing to 200 per acre after 5 years w hich is replaced by royalty of at least 125 of the value of production once production is achieved onshore lease revenues in 1997 were 763 million much greater than the 52 million of blm costs for administering the system if bids are received for tract or if the highest bid is less than the minimum sta tutory bid of 2 per acre minimum the lands are offered for leasing on noncompetitive basis within 30 days and are available for 2 years the first qualified applicant is entitled to the lease upon payment of an application fee of at least 75 the noncompetitive lease holders also must make the rental and royalty payments described above offshore oil and gas the fede ral government also leases oil and gas on the outer continental shelf ocs mms develops 5year leasing plans in consultation with coastal states and other s takeholders many areas are withheld from

materials include common varieties of sand stone gravel pumice cinders cla etc they can be sold upon request by an appli cant except for sales to government entity or limited sales to nonprofi t organization sales are to be for the fair market value as determined by an appraisal with reappraisal at least every 2 years salable minerals are to be sold competitively with newspaper advertisement preceding sealed or oral bids however up to 100000 cubi c yards of material or 200000 cubic yards for public works programs or for mineral leases may be sold noncompetitively at the fair market value financial data are available federal fisheries management the federal go vernment administers commercial fishing activity within the us ex clusive economic zone eez generally 3 to 200 miles offshore under the magnuson stevens fishery conservation and management act msfcma management is through regional fishery manageme nt councils composed of variety of interests in general the regional coun cils regulate commercial fishing activity through seasons quotas gear and other restrictions fees and other charges are minor and are clearly not intended to b sales of fishing rights in federal waters msfcma currently limits fees to recoverin g administr ative costs however recovery of actual costs related to enforcement an d13 manage ment is authorized for individual fishing quota programs and for communit development quota programs up to 3 of the landed catch value traditionally under the msfcma only foreign commercial harvesters have bee n prevented from entering fishery however federal programs currently limit access to the midatlantic surf clam and ocean quahog fishery and few other fi sheries some states also limit access to commercial fisheries in state waters limited access programs typically14 allocate harvesting rights based on historic harvests or will ingness to pay for future harvest access fees re currently allowed to recover some management and enforcement costs although limited access permits may become quite valuable and some interests would like to see the msfcma amended s that more of this value is returned to the us treasury or used to enhance fisheries management activities federal water projects the federal government delivers water to irrigators and to municipal and industrial users in 17 western states through projects constructed by the bureau of reclamation once construction is compl eted water is delivered at rates designed to recover construchttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98980crs6 an acrefoot is enough water to cover one acre of nd to depth of one foot 325681 gallons15tion costs specified in longterm typically 40year contracts except for fixedrate tracts rates may be adju sted every 5 years depending on ability to pay and other factors under the reclamation act of 1902 facility costs were originally to be financed with money receiv ed from public land sales and repaid within 10 years by irrigators receiving project water payments were to be deposited into revolving fund to finance futur projects several factors including administrative decisions not to charge interest development of abilitytopay stand ards and occasional longterm fixedrate contracts have in many cases kept payments from covering the total cost of delivering water congress established new formula for water charges in the rec lamation reform act of 1982 this act included interest charges on the unpaid principa l on project capital costs and on operations and maintenance deficits accruing since 1982 the 1902 act limite d bureausupplied water to 160 acres of owned land but critics charged that the cap was ineffective the 1982 act raised the ownership limit to 960 acres and assessed higher full cost rate on leased lands above 960 acres irrigators choosing to operate under prior pre1982 reclamation law were required to dispose of lands owned in excess of 16 0 acres and to pay the full cost rate on any additional leased lands current c harges for water delivered from reclamation facilities are based on several factors includin g 1 the reimbursable costs of the project at the time of construction costs not directly attributable to p roject users such as for flood control are borne by the federal government 2 the amount of irrigable land within project area 3 yearl operation and maintenance costs 4 land class and ownership 5 interest on unpai d construction costs and on operation and maint enance deficits accruing since 1982 and 6 irrigators ability to pay consequently prices for bureaudelivered water vary amon g projects and within areas with water from newer projects typically being more expensive primarily because of higher construction costs in 1990 water service contract rate s ranged from 022 to 1699 per acrefoot in contrast the 1990 fullcost agricultural15 water rates ranged from 4 to 251 per acrefoot i n addition in 1992 congress directed the bureau to assess surcharge on water delivered from the central valley project i n california to help pay for fish and wildlife habitat restoration pl 102575 conclusion the federal gov ernment sells or leases many resources to users sometimes market mechanisms ie competitive bidding are used to set prices and allocate resources though market s do not assure cost recovery because federal decisions of whether to sell or lease resources are often not determined by profitability nonmarket methods are also widesprea d with prices and users determined by legislative or administrative polic decisions such prices may but often do not and sometimes cannot approximate th private market value of such resources and may not recover administrative costs though the current syste ms have their defenders with the continuing pressures to control federal spending alternative resource sale or leasing mechanisms that increase federa l revenues will likely be the focus of continuing debates
