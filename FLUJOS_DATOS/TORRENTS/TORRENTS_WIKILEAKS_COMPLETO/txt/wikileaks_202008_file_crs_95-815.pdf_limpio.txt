constitution provides that congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press this language restricts government both more and less than it would if it were applied literally it restricts government more in that it applies not only to congress but to all branches of the federal government and to all branches of state and local government it restricts government less in that it provides protection to some types of speech and only limited protection to others this report provides an overview of the major exceptions to the first amendmentof the ways that the supreme court has interpreted the guarantee of freedom of speech and press to provide protection or only limited protection for some types of speech for example the court has decided that the first amendment provides protection to obscenity child pornography or speech that constitutes advocacy of the use of force or of law violation where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action the court has also decided that the first amendment provides less than full protection to commercial speech defamation libel and slander speech that may be harmful to children speech broadcast on radio and television and public employees speech even speech that enjoys the most extensive first amendment protection may be subject to regulations of the time place and manner of expression which are contentneutral are narrowly tailored to serve significant government interest and leave open ample alternative channels of communication and even speech that enjoys the most extensive first amendment protection may be restricted on the basis of its content if the restriction passes strict scrutiny ie if the government shows that the restriction serves to promote compelling interest and is the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest

is unique in being the only type of speech to which the supreme court has denied first amendment protection without regard to whether it is harmful to individuals according to the court there is evidence that at the time of the adoption of the first amendment obscenity was outside the protection intended for speech and press 4 consequently obscenity may be banned simply because legislature concludes that banning it protects the social interest in order and morality5 actual harm let alone compelling governmental interest need be shown in order to ban it 1 herbert v lando 441 us 153 168

pornography is not legally obscene ie most pornography is protected by the first amendment to be obscene pornography must at minimum depict or describe patently offensive hard core sexual conduct6 the supreme court has created threepart test known as the miller test to determine whether work is obscene the miller test asks whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work taken as whole appeals to the prurient interest b whether the work depicts or describes in patently offensive way sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law and c whether the work taken as whole lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value 7 the supreme court has clarified that only the first and second prongs of the miller testappeal to prurient interest and patent offensivenessare issues of fact for the jury to determine applying contemporary community standards8 as for the third prong the proper inquiry is not whether an ordinary member of any given community would find serious literary artistic political or scientific value in allegedly obscene material but whether reasonable person would find such value in the material taken as whole9 the supreme court has allowed one exception to the rule that obscenity is not protected by the first amendment one has constitutional right to possess obscene material in the privacy of his own home 10 however there is constitutional right to provide obscene material for private use11 or even to acquire it for private use12

even when it is not obscene ie child pornography need not meet the miller test to be banned because of the legislative interest in destroying the market for the 6 miller v california 413 us 15 27 1973

might be less than an entire state in ashcroft v american civil liberties union 535 us 564 577 2002 the supreme court recognized that web publishers currently lack the ability to limit access to their s ites on geographic basis and that therefore the use of community standards to define obscenity would effectively force all speakers on the web to abide by the most puritan communitys standards nevertheless the court found that use of community standards does not by itself render statute unconstitutional id at 585 emphasis in original 9 pope v illinois 481 us at 500501 10 stanley v georgia

possess child pornography even in the privacy of ones own home15 in 1996 congress enacted the child pornography protection act cppa which defined child pornography to include visual depictions that appear to be of minor even if minor is actually used the supreme court however declared the cppa unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibited pictures that are produced without actual minors16 pornography that uses actual children may be banned because laws against it target the production of the work not its content the cppa by contrast targeted the content not the production17 the government may not prohibit speech because it increases the chance an unlawful act will be committed at some indefinite future time18 in 2003 congress responded by enacting title v of the protect act pl 10821 which prohibits any digital image computer image or computergenerated image that is or is indistinguishable from that of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct it also prohibits visual depiction of any kind including drawing cartoon sculpture or painting that depicts minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and is obscene or lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value g5g152g151g157g142g151g157g556g4g138g156g142g141g561g20g142g156g157g155g146g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 justice holmes in one of his most famous opinions wrote the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect man in falsely shouting fire in theater and causing panic the question in every case is whether the words used create clear and present danger 19 in its current formulation of this principle the supreme court held that advocacy of the use of force or of law violation is protected unless such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action20 similarly the court held that statute prohibiting threats against the life of the president could be applied only against speech that constitutes true threat and not against mere political hyperbole21 in cases of contentbased restrictions of speech other than advocacy or threats the supreme court generally applies strict scrutiny which means that it will uphold contentbased restriction 15 osborne v ohio 495 us 103 1990 16 ashcroft v free speech coalition 435 us 234 2002 17 id at 249 see also id at 242 18 id at 253 19 schenck v

least restrictive means to further the articulated interest22 thus it is ordinarily unconstitutional for state to proscribe newspaper from publishing the name of rape victim lawfully obtained23 this is because there ordinarily is compelling governmental interest in protecting rape victims privacy24 by contrast one would question but that government might prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting service or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops 25 similarly the government may proscribe fighting wordsthose which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace26 here the court was referring to utterances that constitute epithets or personal abuse that are essential part of any exposition of ideas as opposed to for example flag burni ng which is discussed below under symbolic speech

content of the speech then the limitation on speech may still violate the first amendment but it is less likely than contentbased restriction to do so this is because the supreme court applies less than strict scrutiny to noncontentbased restrictions with respect to noncontentbased restrictions the court requires that the governmental interest be significant or substantial or important but not necessarily as with contentbased restrictions compelling and in the case of non contentbased restrictions the court requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored but not as with contentbased restrictions that it be the least restrictive means to advance the governmental interest two types of speech restrictions that receive this intermediate scrutiny are 1 time place or manner restrictions and 2 incidental restrictions which are restrictions aimed at conduct other than speech but that incidentally restrict speech this report includes separate sections on these two types of restrictions in addition restrictions on commercial speech though contentbased are subject to similar intermediate scrutiny this report also includes separate section on commercial speech finally bans

information has been acquired unlawfully by newspaper or by source the government may ever punish not only the unlawful acquisition but the ensuing publication as well id at 535 n8 emphasis in original in bartnicki v vopper 532 us 514 2001 the court held that contentneutral statute prohibiting the publication of illegally intercepted communications in this case cell phone conversation violates free speech where the person who publishes the material did not participate in the interception and the communication concerns public issue 24 however the court did not rule out the possibility that in proper case imposing civil sanctions for publication of the name of rape victim might be overwhelmingly necessary to advance compelling state interest id at 537 25 near v minnesota

the content of speech receive intermediate scrutiny because according to th supreme court they are aimed at combating secondary effects such as crime and not at the content of speech27 g18g155g146g152g155g561g20g142g156g157g155g138g146g151g157g561 there are two ways in which the government may attempt to restrict speech the more common way is to make particular category of speech such as obscenity or defamation subject to criminal prosecution or civil suit and then if someone engages in the proscribed category of speech to hold trial and impose sanctions if appropriate the second way is by prior restraint which may occur in two ways first statute may require that person submit the speech that he wishes to disseminatea movie for exampleto governmental body for license to disseminate iteg to show the movie second court may issue temporary restraining order or an injunction against engaging in particular speechpublishing the pentagon papers for example with respect to both these types of prior restraint the supreme court has written that any system of prior restraint of expression comes to this court bearing heavy presumption against its constitutional validity 28 prior restraints it has held are the most serious and least tolerable infringement on first amendment rights prior re straint by definition has an immediate and irreversible sanction if it can be said that threat of criminal or civil sanctions after publication chills speech prior restraint freezes it at least for the time the damage can be particularly great when the prior restraint falls upon the commu nication of news and commentary on current events29 the supreme court has written that the special vice of prior restraint is that communication will be suppressed before an adequate determination that it is unprotected by the first amendment 30 the prohibition on prior restraint thus is essentially limitation on restraints until final judicial determination that the restricted speech is not protected by the first amendment it is limitation for example against temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions pending final judgment not against permanent injunctions after final judgment is made that the restricted speech is not protected by the first amendment31 27 for additional information on this subject see crs report 95804 obscenity and indecency

restrictions and presumably other forms of speech that do not receive full first amendment protection lesser procedural safeguards are adequate 34 prior restraints are permitted in some circumstances the supreme court has written in dictum that traditional prior restraint doctrine may not apply to commercial speech35 and the court has not ruled whether it does the vast majority of federal circuits do not apply the doctrine of prior restraint to commercial speech36 some circuits however have explicitly indicated that the requirement of procedural safeguards in the context of prior restraint indeed applies to commercial speech37 furthermore only contentbased injunctions are subject to prior restraint analysis38 in addition prior restraint is generally permitted even in the form of

of expression whose liberty is safeguarded to the maximum extent by the first amendment42 commercial speech however may be banned if it is false or misleading or if it advertises an illegal product or service even if fits in none of these categories the government may regulate it more than it may regulate fully protected speech in addition the government may generally require disclosures to be included in commercial speech see the section on compelled speech below the supreme court has prescribed the fourprong central hudson test to determine whether governmental regulation of commercial speech is constitutional this test asks initially 1 whether the commercial speech at issue is protected by the first amendment that is whether it concerns lawful activity and is not misleading and 2 whether the asserted governmental interest in restricting it is substantial if both inquiries yield positive answers then to be constitutional the restriction must 3 directly advance the governmental interest asserted and 4 be not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest 43 the supreme court has held that in applying the third prong of the central hudson test the courts should consider whether the regulation in its general application directly advances the governmental interest asserted if it does then it need not advance the governmental interest as applied to the particular person or entity challenging it44 its application to the particular person or entity challenging it is relevant in applying the fourth central hudson factor although this factor too is to be viewed in terms of the relation it bears to the overall problem the government seeks to correct45 the fourth prong is not to be interpreted strictly to require the legislature to use the least restrictive means available to accomplish its purpose instead the court has held legislation regulating commercial speech satisfies the fourth prong if there is reasonable fit between the legislatures ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends46 the supreme court has applied the central hudson test in all the commercial speech cases it has decided since central hudson and we discuss the ten most recent below in chronological order47 in nine of these cases the court struck down the ch allenged speech restriction it has not upheld commercial speech restriction since 1993 in its most recent commercial speech case thompson v western states medical center the court noted that several members of the court have expressed doubts about the central hudson analysis and whether it should apply in particular cases these justices believe that the test does not provide adequate protection to commercial speech but the court has found it unnecessary to consider whether to abandon the test because it has been striking down the statutes in question anyway in cincinnati v discovery network inc the court struck down cincinnati regulation that banned newsracks on public property if they dist ributed commercial publications but not if they distributed news publications48 as for the first two prongs of the central hudson test the court 42 joseph burstyn inc v wilson 343 us 495 501502 1952

or misleading and that the asserted governmental interest in safety and esthetics was substantial as for the third and fourth prongs although banning commerci newsracks presumably advances the asserted governmental interests the distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech bears relationship whatsoever to the particular interests that the city has asserted49 the city therefore did not establish the fit between its goals and its chosen means that is required by our opinion in fox 50 in edenfield v fane 51 the court struck down florida ban on solicitation by certified public accountants even though the court had previously in ohralik v ohio state bar association 52 upheld ban on solicitation by attorneys the court found that the government had substantial interests in the ban including the prevention of fraud the protection of privacy and the need to maintain cpa independence and to guard against conflicts of interest however the court found evidence that the ban directly advanced these interests and noted among other things that unlike lawyer cpa is not professional trained in the art of persuasion and the typical client of cpa is far less susceptible to manipulation than the young accident victim in ohralik 53 the court added more generally that the governments burden in justifying restriction on commercial speech is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture rather governmental body seeking to sustain restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to material degree 54 in united states v edge broadcasting co the court upheld federal statutes that prohibit the broadcast of lottery advertising by broadcaster licensed to state that does not allow lotteries while allowing such broadcasting by broadcaster licensed to state that sponsors lottery 55 the governmental interest in the statutes was to balance the interests of states that prohibit lotteries and states that operate lotteries the broadcaster that challenged the statutes was licensed in north carolina which does not allow lotteries but broadcasted from only three miles from the virginia border which does allow lotteries the broadcaster claimed that prohibiting it from broadcasting advertisements for the virginia lottery did not advance the governmental interest or represent reasonable fit because north carolina radio listeners in its area were already inundated with advertisements from virginia stations advertising the virginia lottery and because most of the broadcasters listeners were in virginia the supreme court upheld the statutes because even if they did not advance the governmental interest or represent reasonable fit as applied to the particular broadcaster they did as applied to the overall problem the government sought to address in ibanez v florida board of accountancy the court held that the florida board of accountancy could not

beer labels from displaying alcohol content unless state law requires such disclosure58 the court found sufficiently substantial to satisfy the second prong of the central hudson test the governments interest in curbing strength wars by beer brewers who might seek to compete for customers on the basis of alcohol content however it concluded that the ban cannot directly and materially advance this interest because of the overall irrationality of the governments regulatory scheme 59 this irrationality is evidenced by the fact that the ban does not apply to beer advertisements and by the fact that the statute requires the disclosure of alcohol content on the labels of wines and spirits in florida bar v went for it inc the court upheld rule of the florida bar that prohibited personal injury lawyers from sending targeted directmail solicitations to victims and their relatives for 30 days following an accident or disaster60 the bar argued that it has substantial interest in protecting the privacy and tranquility of personal injury victims and their loved ones against intrusive unsolicited contact by lawyers61 and the court found that the anecdotal record mustered by the bar to demonstrate that its rule would advance this interest in direct and material way was noteworthy for its breadth and detail62 it was not mere speculation and conjecture63 therefore the rule passed what the court called the second prong of the central hudson test64 as for the final prong the court found the bars rule to be reasonably well tailored to its stated objective 65 in subsequent case the court wrote that in florida bar v went for it inc it had upheld 30day prohibition against certain form of legal solicitation largely because it left so many channels of communication open to florida lawyers66 56 512 us 136 1994 curiously the court in ibanez writes that only false deceptive or misleading commercial speech may be banned id at 142 despite its decisions upholding bans of truthful

state statute that prohibited disclosure of retail prices in advertisements for alcoholic beverages67 in the process it increased the protection that the central hudson test guarantees to commercial speech by making clear that total prohibition on the dissemination of truthful nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons unrelated to the preservation of fair bargaining process will be subject to stricter review by the courts than regulation designed to protect consumers from misleading deceptive or aggressive sales practices 68 the court added the first amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good69 it concluded that the price advertising ban cannot survive the more stringent constitutional review that central hudson itself concluded was appropriate for the complete suppression of truthful nonmisleading commercial speech70 in greater new orleans broadcasting association inc v united states 71 the court applied the central hudson test to strike down as applied to advertisements of private casino gambling that are broadcast by radio or television stations located in louisiana where such gambling is legal the same federal statute it had upheld in united states v edge broadcasting co 72 as applied to broadcast advertising of virginias lottery by radio station located in north carolina where such lottery was authorized the court emphasized the interrelatedness of the four parts of the central hudson test eg though the government has substantial interest in reducing the social costs of gambling the fact that the congress has simultaneously encouraged gambling because of its economic benefits makes it more difficult for the government to demonstrate that its restriction on commercial speech materially advances its asserted interest and constitutes reasonable fit in this case the operation of 18 usc 1304 and its attendant regulatory regime is so pierced by exemptions and inconsistencies that the government cannot hope to exonerate it the regulation distinguishes among the indistinct permitting variety of speech that poses the same risks the government purports to fear while banning messages unlikely to cause any harm at all 73 in lorillard tobacco co v reilly the supreme court applied the central hudson test to strike down most of the massachusetts attorney generals regulations governing the advertising and sale of cigarettes smokeless tobacco and cigars74 the court first found the outdoor and point ofsale advertising regulations

however this statutes preemption provision applies only to cigarettes so the court considered the smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners first amendment challenges to the outdoor and pointofsale advertising regulations further the cigarette petitioners did not raise preemption challenge to massachusetts sales practices regulations regulations described below other than outdoor and pointofsale advertising regulations so the court considered the cigarette as well as the smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners claim that these regulations violate the first amendment the court struck down the outdoor advertising regulations under the fourth prong of the central hudson test finding that the prohibition of any advertising within 1000 feet of schools or playgrounds prohibited advertising in substantial portion of the major metropolitan areas of massachusetts 76 and that such burden on speech did not constitute reasonable fit between the means and ends of the regulatory scheme similarly ban on all signs of any size seems ill suited to target the problem of highly visible billboards as opposed to smaller signs77 the court found that the pointofsale advertising re gulations fail both the third and fourth steps of the central hudson analysis78 the prohibition on advertising placed lower than five feet from the floor of any retail establishment which is located within one thousand foot radius of any school or playground did not advance the goal of preventing minors from using tobacco products because not all children are less than 5 feet tall and those who are certainly have the ability to look up and take in their surroundings 79 the court however upheld the sales practices regulations that bar the use of selfservice displays and require that tobacco products be placed out of the reach of all consumers in location accessible only to salespersons80 these regulations though they regulate conduct that may have communicative component do so for reasons unrelated to the communications of ideas81 the court therefore applied the obrien test for incidental restrictions of speech see the section below on incidental restrictions and concluded that the state has demonstrated substantial interest in preventing access to tobacco products by minors and has adopted an appropriately narrow means of advancing that interest82 in thompson v western states medical center 83 the court struck down section 503a of the food drug and cosmetic act 21 usc 353a which exempts compounded drugs from the food and drug administrations standard drug approval requirements as long as the providers of those drugs abide by several restrictions including that they refrain from advertising or promoting particular compounded drugs84 drug compounding the court explained is

the court found that the speech restriction in this case served important governmental interests but that even assuming that it directly advances these interests it failed the fourth prong of the central hudson test86 in considering the fourth prong the court wrote that the government has failed to demonstrate that the speech restrictions are not more extensive than is necessary to serve the governmental interests as several nonspeechrelated means of serving those interests might be possible here 87 if the first amendment means anything the court added it means that regulating speech must be lastnot firstresort yet here it seems to have been the first strategy the government thought to try88 the court noted that it had rejected the notion that the government has an interest in preventing the dissemination of truthful commercial information in order to prevent members of the public from making bad decisions with the information89 in saying that the government failed to demonstrate that the speech restrictions were not more extensive than is necessary to serve the governmental interests the court was quoting from the fourth prong of the central hudson test but nowhere in thompson did it note that it had previously modified the fourth prong to require merely reasonable fit between the legislatures ends and means and not use of the least restrictive means to serve the governmental interests rather it wrote in previous cases addressing this final prong of the central hudson test we have made clear that if the government could achieve its interests in manner that does not restrict speech or that restricts less speech the government must do so 90 yet the court did not state that it intended to overrule its reasonable fit construction of the fourth prong g6g142g143g138g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 defamation libel is written defamation slander is oral defamation is the intentional communication of falsehood about person to someone other than that

protect children this is because the court has recognized that there is compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological wellbeing of minors 93 however any restriction must be accomplished by narrowly drawn regulations without unnecessarily interfering with first amendment freedoms it is not enough to show that the governments ends are compelling the means must be carefully tailored to achieved those ends 94 thus the government may prohibit the sale to minors of material that it deems harmful to minors so called girlie magazines whether or not they are not obscene as to adults95 it may prohibit the broadcast of indecent language on radio and television during hours when children are likely to be in the audience but it may not ban it around the clock unless it is

and 10 pm97 similarly congress may not ban dialaporn but it may as it does at 47 usc 223 prohibit it from being made available to minors or to persons who have not previously requested it in writing98 in reno v american civil liberties union the supreme court declared unconstitutional two provisions of the communications decency act cda that prohibited indecent communications to minors on the internet99 the court held that the cdas burden on adult speech is unaccep table if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted to serve the governmental interest in protecting children from harmful materials does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech addressed to adults as we have explained the government may not reduce the adult population to only what is fit for children100 the court distinguished the internet from radio and television because 1 the cdas broad categorical prohibitions are not limited to particular times and are not dependent on any evaluation by an agency familiar with the unique characteristics of the internet2 the cda imposes criminal penalties and the court has never decided whether indecent broadcasts would justify criminal prosecution and 3 radio and television unlike the internet have as matter of history received the most limited first amendment protection in large part because warnings could not adequately protect the listener from unexpected program content on the internet the risk of encountering indecent material by accident is remote because series of affirmative steps is required to access specific material in 1998 congress enacted the child online protection act copa pl 105277 title xiv to replace the cda copa differs from the cda in two main respects 1 it prohibits communication to minors only of material that is harmful to minors rather than material that is indecent and 2 it applies only to communi cations for commercial purposes on publicly accessible websites copa has not taken effect because constitutional challenge was brought and the district court finding likelihood that the plaintiffs would prevail issued preliminary injunction against enforcement of the statute pending trial on the merits the third circuit affirmed but in 2002 in ashcroft v american civil liberties union the supreme court held that copas use of community standards to define material that is harmful to minors does not by itself render the statute unconstitutional the supreme court however did not remove the preliminary injunction against enforcement of the statute and remanded the case to the third circuit to consider whether it is unconstitutional nonetheless in 2003 the third circuit again found the plaintiffs likely to prevail and affirmed the preliminary injunction in 2004 the supreme court affirmed the preliminary injunction because it found that the government had failed to show that filtering prohibited material would not be as effective in accomplishing congresss goals it remanded the case for trial however and did not foreclose the district court from concluding otherwise 101 in 2007 the district court found copa unconstitutional and issued 97 for additional information see crs report 95804 obscenity and indecency constitutional principles and federal statutes by henry cohen restrictions on cable

students right to wear black arm bands to protest the war in vietnam the supreme court held that public school students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate 103 they do however shed them to some extent the supreme court has upheld the suspension of student for using sexual metaphor in speech nominating another student for student office104 it has upheld censorship of student newspaper produced as part of the school curriculum105 lower courts have indicated that nonschoolsponsored st udent writings may not be censored106 plurality of the justices found that school board must be permitted to establish and apply their curriculum in such way as to transmit community values but that it may not remove school library books in order to deny access to ideas with which it disagrees for political or religious reasons107 the supreme court has also held that congress may not prohibit people 17 or younger from making contributions to political candidates and contributions or donations to political parties108 most recently in morse v frederick the court held that school could punish pupil for displaying banner that read b ong hits 4 jesus because these words could reasonably be interpreted as promoting illegal drug use109 the court indicated that it might have reached different result if the banner had addressed the issue of the criminalization of drug use or possession110 justice alito joined by justice kennedy wrote concurring opinion stating that they had joined the majority opinion on the understanding that it goes further than to hold that public school may restrict speech that reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and b it provides support for any restriction on speech

speech that enjoys the most extensive first amendment protection may be subject to regulations of the time place and manner of expression which are contentneutral are narrowly tailored to serve significant government interest and leave open ample alternative channels of communication 112 in the case in which this language appears the supreme court allowed city ordinance that banned picketing before or about any residence to be enforced to prevent picketing outside the residence of doctor who performed abortions even though the picketing occurred on public street the court noted that the first amendment permits the government to prohibit offensive speech as intrusive when the captive audience cannot avoid the objectionable speech 113 thus the court while acknowledging that music as form of expression and communication is protected under the first amendment upheld volume restrictions placed on outdoor music in order to prevent intrusion on those in the area114 other significant governmental interests besides protection of captive audiences may justify contentneutral time place and manner restrictions for example in order to prevent crime and maintain property values city may place zoning restrictions on adult theaters and bookstores 115 and in order to maintain the orderly movements of crowds at state fair state may limit the distribution of literature to assigned locations116 however time place and manner restriction will not be upheld in the absence of sufficient justification or if it is not narrowly tailored thus the court held unconstitutional total restriction on displaying flags or banners on public sidewalks surrounding the supreme court117 and time place and manner restriction will not be upheld if it fails to leave open ample alternative channels for communication thus the court held unconstitutional an ordinance that prohibited the display of signs from residences because displaying sign from ones own residence often carries message quite distinct from placing the same sign someplace else 118 when court issues an injunction that restricts the time place or manner of particular form of expression because prior restraint occurs

of speech119 instead of asking whether the restrictions are narrowly tailored to serve significant governmental interest court must ask whether the challenged provisions of the injunction burden more speech than necessary to serve significant government interest120 applying this standard the supreme court in madsen v women s health center inc upheld state court injunction that had ordered the establishment of 36foot buffer zone on public street outside particular health clinic that performed abortions the court in this case also upheld an injunction against noise during particular hours but found that broad prohibition on all images observable burdens speech more than necessary to achieve the purpose of limiting threats to clinic patients or their families 121 it also struck down prohibition on all uninvited approaches of persons seeking the services of the clinic and prohibition against picketing within 300 feet of the residences of clinic staff the court distinguished the 300foot restriction from the ordinance it had previously upheld that banned picketing before or about any residence 122 in schenck v prochoice network of western new york the court applied madsen to another injunction that placed restrictions on demonstrating outside an abortion clinic123 the court upheld the portion of the injunction that banned demonstrating within fifteen feet from either side or edge of or in front of doorways or do orway entrances parking lot entrances driveways and driveway entrances of such facilitieswhat the court called fixed buffer zones it struck down prohibition against demonstrating within fifteen feet of any person or vehicles seeking access to or leaving such facilitieswhat it called floating buffer zones the court cited public safety and order in upholding the fixed buffer zones but it found that the floating buffer zones burden more speech than is necessary to serve the relevant governmental interests because they make it quite difficult for protester who wishes to engage in peaceful expressive activity to know how to remain in compliance with the injunction the court also upheld provision specifying that once sidewalk counselors who had entered the buffer zones were required to cease and desist their counseling they had to retreat 15 feet from the people they had been counseling and had to remain outside the boundaries of the buffer zones in hill v colorado the court upheld colorado statute that makes it unlawful within 100 feet of the entrance to any health care facility to k nowingly approach within eight feet of another person without that persons consent for the purpose of passing leaflet or handbill to displaying sign to or engaging in oral pr otest education or counseling with such other person 124 this decision is significant because it upheld statute that applies to everyone and not as in madsen and schenck merely an injunction directed to particular parties the court found the statute to be contentneutral time place and manner regulation of speech that reflects an acceptable balance between the constitutionally protected rights of lawabiding speakers and the interests of unwilling listeners 125 the restrictions are contentneutral because 119 madsen v womens health center inc 512 us 753 765 1994 in this case the court held that the challenged injunction was contentneutral even though it was directed at abortion protestors because its purpose was to protect patients not to interfere with the protestors message 120 id this is not prior restraint analysis which courts pply to contentbased

because they apply equally to all demonstrators regardless of viewpoint although the restrictions do not apply to all speech the kind of cursory examination that might be required to distinguish casual conversation from protest education or counseling is not problematic126 the law is narrowly tailored to achieve the states interests the eightfoot restriction does not significantly impair the ability to convey messages by signs and ordinarily allows speakers to come within normal conversational distance of their targets because the statute lows the speaker to remain in one place persons who wish to hand out leaflets may position themselves beside entrances near the path of oncoming pedestrians and consequently are not deprived of the opportunity to get the attention of persons entering clinic g11g151g140g146g141g142g151g157g138g149g561g20g142g156g157g155g146g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 some laws are not designed to limit freedom of expression but nevertheless can have that effect for example when national park service regulation prohibiting camping in certain parks was applied to prohibit demonstrators who were attempting to call attention to the plight of the homeless from sleeping in certain washington dc parks it had the effect of limiting the demonstrators freedom of expression nevertheless the court found that application of the regulation did not violate the first amendment because the regulation was contentneutral and was narrowly focused on substantial governmental interest in maintaining parks in an attractive and intact condition 127 the supreme court has said that an incidental restriction on speech is constitutional if it is not greater than necessary to further substantial governmental interest128 however the court has made clear that an incidental restriction unlike contentbased restriction need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of furthering governmental interest rather the restriction must be narrowly tailored and the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long as the regulation promotes substantial governmental interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation 129 the court has noted that the standard for determining the constitutionality of an incidental restriction in the last analysis is little if any different from the standard applied to time place or manner restrictions130 thus the restriction on camping may be viewed as restriction on conduct that only incidentally affects speech or if one views sleeping in connection with demonstration as expressive conduct then the restriction may be viewed as time place and manner restriction on expressive conduct in either case as long as the restriction is content neutral the same standard for assessing its constitutionality will apply 126 id at 722 127 clark v community for creative nonviolence 468 us 288 1984 128 san francisco arts athletics inc v united states olympic committee 483 us 522 537 1987

not prevent the government from requiring that dancers wear pasties and gstring when they dance nonobscenely in adult entertainment establishments indiana sought to enforce state statute prohibiting public nudity against two such establishments which asserted first amendment protection the court found that the statute proscribed public nudity across the board not nude dancing as such and therefore imposed only an incidental restriction on expression131 in 2000 the supreme court again upheld the application of statute prohibiting public nudity to an adult entertainment establishment it found that the statute was intended to combat harmful secondary effects such as prostitution and other criminal activity132 in 1994 case the supreme court apparently put more teeth into the test for incidental restrictions by remanding the case for further proceedings rather than deferring to congresss judgment as to the necessity for the mustcarry provisions of the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 133 to justify an incidental restriction of speech the court wrote the government must demonstrate that the recited harms are real not merely conjectural and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in direct and material way134 the court added that its obligation to exercise independent judgment when first amendment rights are implicated is not license to reweigh the evidence novo or to replace congress factual predictions with our own rather it is to assure that in formulating its judgments congress has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence 135 g21g162g150g139g152g149g146g140g561g21g153g142g142g140g145g561 the first amendment literally forbids the abridgment only of speech but we have long recognized that its protection does not end at the spoken or written word136 thus wrote the supreme court when it held that statute prohibiting flag desecration violated the first amendment such statute is not contentneutral if it is designed to protect perceived need to preserve the flags status as symbol of our nation and certain national ideals 137 by contrast the court upheld federal statute that made it crime to burn draft card finding that the statute served the governments substantial interest in assuring the continuing availability of issued selective service certificates and imposed only an appropriately narrow incidental restriction of speech 138 even if congresss purpose in enacting the statute had been to 131 barnes v glen theatre inc 501 us 560 1991 132 erie v paps am 529 us 277 2000

otherwise constitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit legislative motive139 in 1992 in rav v city of st paul the supreme court struck down an ordinance that prohibited the placing on public or private property of sym bol such as burning cross or nazi swastika which one knows or has reasonable grounds to know arouses anger alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race color creed religion or gender140 read literally this ordinance would clearly violate the first amendment because if there is bedrock principle underlying the first amendment it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable141 in this case however the minnesota supreme court had construed the ordina nce to apply only to conduct that amounted to fighting words therefore the question for the supreme court was whether the ordinance construed to apply only to fighting words was constitutional the court held that it was not because although fighting words may be proscribed because of their constitutionally proscribable content they may not be made the vehicles for content discrimination unrelated to their distinctively proscribable content 142 thus the government may proscribe fighting words but it may not make the further content discrimination of proscribing particular fighting words on the basis of hostility towards the underlying message expressed143 in this case the ordinance banned fighting words that insult on the basis of race color creed religion or gender but not for example on the basis of political affiliation union membership or homosexuality the first amendment does not permit st paul to impose special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored subjects 144 this decision does not of course preclude prosecution for illegal conduct that may accompany cross burning such as trespass arson or threats as the court put it st paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding the first amendment to the fire 145 in subsequent case the supreme court held that its opinion in rav did not mean that statutes that impose additional penalties for crimes that are motivated by racial hatred are unconstitutional such statutes imposed enhanced sentences not for bigoted thought but for the commission of crimes that can inflict greater and individual and societal harm because of their biasinspired motivation defendants motive has always been factor in sentencing and even in defining crimes title vii of the civil righ ts act of 1964 for example makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee because of such individuals race color religion sex or national origin 146 in virginia v black the court held that its opinion in rav did not make it unconstitutional for state to prohibit burning cross with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons147 139 id at 383 140 505 us 377 1992 141 texas v

defendants beliefsas factual matter it is not true that cross burners direct thei r intimidating conduct solely to racial or religious minorities the first amendment permits virginia to outlaw cross burning done with the intent to intimidate because burning cross is particularly virulent form of intimidation instead of prohibiting all intimidating messages virginia may choose to regulate this subset of intimidating messages 148 g5g152g150g153g142g149g149g142g141g561g21g153g142g142g140g145g561 on occasion the government attempts to compel spe ech rather than to restrict it for example in riley v national federation of the blind of north carolina inc north carolina statute required professional fundraisers for charities to disclose to potential donors the gross percentage of revenues retained in prior charitable solicitations149 the supreme court held this uncon stitutional writing there is certainly some difference between compelled speech and compelled silence but in the context of protected speech the difference is without constitutional significance for the first amendment guarantees freedom of speech term necessarily comprising the decision of both what to say and what not to say 150 in the commercial speech context by contrast the supreme court held in zauderer v office of disciplinary counsel that an advertisers constitutionally protected interest in not providing any particular factual information in his advertising is minimal an advertisers rights are reasonably protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the states interest in preventing deception of consumers the right of commercial speaker not to divulge accurate information regarding his services is not fundamental right151 in zauderer the supreme court upheld an ohio requirement that advertisements by lawyers that mention contingentfee rates disclose whether percentages are computed before or after deduction of court costs and expenses in meese v keene however the court upheld compelled disclosure in noncommercial context152 this case involved provision of the foreign agents registration act of 1938 which requires that when an agent of foreign principal seeks

the department of justice the mater ial need not state that it is political propaganda but one agent objected to the statutes designating material by that term which he considered pejorative the agent wished to exhibit without the required labels three canadian films on nuclear war and acid rain that the justice department had determined were political propaganda in meese v keene the supreme court upheld the statutes use of the term essentially because it considered the term not necessarily pejorative on the subject of compelled disclosure the court wrote congress did not prohibit edit or restrain the distribution of advocacy materials to the contrary congress simply required the disseminators of such material to make additional disclosures that would better enable the public to evaluate the import of the propaganda 153 one might infer from this that compelled disclosure in noncommercial context gives rise to serious first amendment issue and nothing in the courts opinion would seem to refute this inference thus it seems impossible to reconcile this opinion with the courts holding year later in riley which did not mention meese v keene that in noncommercial context there is difference of constitutional significance between compelled speech and compelled silence in meese v keene the court did not mention earlier cases in which it had struck down laws compelling speech in noncommercial context in wooley v maynard the court struck down new hampshire statute requiring motorists to leave visible on their license plates the motto live free or die154 in west virginia state board of education v barnette the court held that state may not require children to pledge allegiance to the united states155 in miami herald publishing co v tornillo the court struck

statement does not legitimatize use of the commonwealths power to compel the speaker to alter the message by including one more acceptable to others158 in glickman v wileman brothers elliott inc the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of marketing orders promulgated by the secretary of agriculture that imposed assessments on fruit growers to cover the cost of generic advertising of fruits159 the first amendment the court held does not preclude the government from compelling financial contributions that are used to fund advertising provided that such contributions do not finance political or ideological views160 in united states v united foods inc the court struck down federal statute that mandated assessments on handlers of fresh mushrooms to fund advertising for the product161 the court did not apply the central hudson commercial speech test but rather found that the mandated support is contrary to first amendment principles set forth in cases involving expression by groups which include persons who object to the speech but who nevertheless must remain members of the group by law or necessity162 it distinguished glickman on the ground that in glickman the mandated assessments for speech were ancillary to more comprehensive program restricting marketing authority here for all prac tical purposes the advertising itself far from being ancillary is the principal object of the regulatory scheme163 in johanns v livestock marketing association the supreme court upheld federal statute that directed the secretary of agriculture to use funds raised by an assessment on cattle sales and importation to promote the marketing and consumption of beef and beef products164 the court found that unlike in glickman and united foods where the speech was or was presumed to be that of an entity other than the government itself in johanns the promotional campaign constituted the governments own speech and therefore was exempt from first amendment scrutiny165 it did not matter whether the funds for the promotions are raised by general taxes or through targeted assessment166 as for the plaintiffs contention that crediting the advertising to americas beef producers attributes the spee ch to them the court found that because the statute does not require such attribution it does not violate the first amendment but the plaintiffs contention might form the basis for challenging the manner in which the statute is applied167 158 515 us 557 581 1995 159 521 us 457 1997 160 id 521 us at 471 472 the court found that the

lion broadcasting co v federal communications commission the supreme court invoked what has become known as the scarc ity rationale to justify this discrimination where there are substantially more individuals who want to broadcast than there are frequencies to allocate it is idle to posit an unabridgeable first amendment right to broadcast comparable to the right of every individual to speak write or publish168 the court made this statement in upholding the constitutionality of the federal communication commissions fairness doctrine which required broadcast media licensees to provide coverage of controversial issues of interest to the community and to provide reasonable opportunity for the presentation of contrasting viewpoints on such issues later in federal communications commission v pacifica foundation the court upheld the power of the fcc to regulate radio broa dcast that is indecent but not obscene169 the court cited two distinctions between broadcasting and other

broadcasting is uniquely accessible to children 170 in turner broadcasting system inc v federal communications commission the court declined to question the continuing validity of the scarcity rationale but held that application of the more relaxed standard of scrutiny adopted in red lion and other broadcast cases is inapt when deter mining the first amendment validity of cable regulation171 in turner however the court found the mustcarry provisions of the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 which require cable television systems to devote portion of their channels to the transmission of local broadcast television stations to be contentneutral in application and subject only to the test for incidental restrictions on speech attempting to apply this test however the court found genuine issues of material fact still to be resolved as to whether broadcast television is in jeopardy and as to the actual effects of mustcarry on the

full first amendment protection174 in part ii of its opinion the plurality upheld 10 of the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 47 usc 532h which permits cable operators to prohibit indecent material on leased access channels the cable communications policy act of 1984 had required cable operators to provide leased access and public access channels free of operator editorial control in upholding 10a the court citing pacifica noted that cable television is as accessible to children as overtheair broadcasting has also established uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all americans and can also confront the citizen in the privacy of the home with little or prior warning175 it also noted that its distinction in turner between cable and broadcast television re lied on the inapplicability of the spectrum scarcity problem to cable but that that distinction has little to do with case that involves the effects of television viewing on children 176 applying something less than strict scrutiny the court concluded that 10a is sufficiently tailored response to an extraordinarily important problem177 in part iii of denver area majority of the court six justices struck down 10b of the 1992 act 47 usc 532j which required cable operators if they do not prohibit such programming on leased access channels to segregate it on single channel and block that channel unless the subscriber requests access to it in writing in this part of the opinion the court seemed to apply strict scrutiny finding that protection of children is compelling interest but that not only is it not least restrictive alternative and is not narrowly tailored to meet its legitimate objective it also seems considerably more extensive than necessary 178 in part iv which only three justices joined the court struck down 10c 42 usc 531 note which permitted cable operators to prohibit indecent material on public access channels without specifying the level of scrutiny they were applying the justices concluded that the government cannot sustain its burden of showing that 10c is necessary to protect children or that it is appropriately tailored to secure that end 179 in united states v playboy entertainment group inc the supreme court made clear as it had not in denver consortium that strict scrutiny applies to contentbased speech restriction on cable television180 the court struck down federal statute designed to shield children from hearing or seeing images resulting from signal bleed which refers to blurred images or sounds that come through to nonsubscribers the statute required cable operators on channels primarily dedicated to sexually oriented programming either to fully scramble or otherwise fully block such channels or to not provide such programming when significant number of children are likely to be viewing it which under an fcc regulation meant to transmit the programming only from 10 pm to 6 am the court apparently assumed that the government had compelling interest in protecting children from sexually oriented signal bleed but found that congress had not used the least restrictive means to do so congress in fact had enacted another

inci dent to its power to provide for the general welfare art i 8 cl 1 may attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds and has repeatedly employed the power to further broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance with federal statutory and administrative directives the breadth of this power was made clear in united states v butler 297 us 1 66 1936 where the court determined that the power of congress to authorize expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the constitution thus objectives not thought to be within article is enumerated legislative fields id at 65 may nevertheless be attained through the use of the spending power and the conditional grant of federal funds 181 this means that congress may regulate matters by attaching conditions to the receipt of federal funds that it might lack the power to regulate directly however the court added other constitutional provisions may provide an independent bar to the conditional grant of federal funds one of these other constitutional provisi ons is the first amendment the court has held in fact that the government may not deny benefit to person on basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interestsespecially his interest in freedom of speech 182 similarly in federal communications commission v league of women voters the court declared unconstitutional federal statute that prohibited noncommercial television and radio stations that accepted federal funds from engaging in editorializing even with nonfederal funds183 congress would have the authority to prohibit television and radio stations from using the federal funds they accept to engage in editorializing as the court would view congress in that case not as limiting speech but as choosing to fund one activity to the exclusion of another184 refusal to fund protected activity ie speech without more cannot be equated with the imposition of penalty on that activity185 in rust v sullivan the case in which this quotation appears the court upheld gag order that prohibited family planning clinics that accept federal funds from engaging in abortion counseling or referrals the court found that in this case the government is not denying benefit to anyone but is instead simply insisting that public funds be spent for purposes for which they were authorized 186 in rust v sullivan the court also indicated that it will allow congress to condition the receipt of federal funds on acceptance of limitation on the use of nonfederal funds as well as of federal 181 south dakota v dole 483 us 203 206207 1987 182 perry v sindermann 408 us 593 597 1972 striking down state universitys refusal to renew teachers contract because of his public

of nonfederal funds outside the project that accepts the federal funds187 justice blackmun dissenting feared that under the majoritys reasoning the first amendment could be read to tolerate any governmental restriction upon an employees speech so long as that restriction is limited to the funded workplace188 the court also recognized that the university is traditional sphere of free expression so fundamental to the functioning of our society that the governments ability to control speech within that sphere by means of conditions attached to the expenditure of government funds is re stricted by the vagueness and overbreadth doctrines of the first amendment 189 in national endowment for the arts v finley the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of federal statute 20 usc 954d1 requiring the nea in awarding grants to take into consideration general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the american public 190 the court acknowledged that if the statute were applied in manner that raises concern about the suppression of disfavored viewpoints191 then such application might be unconstitutional the statute on its face however is constitutional because it imposes categorical requirement being merely advisory192 any contentbased considerations that may be taken into account in the grantmaking process are consequence of the nature of arts funding the very assumption of the nea is that grants will be awarded according to the artistic worth of competing applications and absolute neutrality is simply inconceivable193 the court also found that the terms of the statute if they appeared in criminal statute or regulatory scheme could raise substantial vagueness concerns but when the government is acting as patron rather than as sovereign the consequences of imprecision are not constitutionally severe194 in legal services corporation v velazquez the court struck down provision of the legal services corporation act that prohibited recipients of legal services corporation lsc funds ie legalaid organizations that provide lawyers to the poor in civil matters from representing client who seeks to amend or otherwise challenge existing welfare law195 this meant that even with nonfederal funds recipient of federal funds could not argue that state welfare statute violated federal statute or that state or federal welfare law violated the us constitution if case was underway when such challenge became apparent the attorney had to withdraw 187 id at 196 thus grantee who accepts federal f unds to operate family

rust v sullivan on the ground that the counseling activities of the doctors under title x amounted to governmental speech whereas an lscfunded attorney speaks on behalf of the client in claim against the government for welfare benefits196 furthermore the restriction in this case distorts the legal system by prohibiting speech and expression upon which courts must depend for the proper exercise of the judicial power and thereby is inconsistent with accepted separationofpowers principles197 in united states v american library association 198 the supreme court followed rust v sullivan and upheld the childrens internet protection act which requires schools and libraries that accept federal funds to purchase computers used to access the internet to block or filter minors internet access to visual depictions that are obscene child pornography or harmful to minors and to block or filter adults internet access to visual depictions that are obscene or child pornography blocking or filtering technology may be disabled however to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purpose the plurality noted that congress may not induce the recipient of federal funds to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional 199 the plurality therefore viewed the question before the court as whether public libraries would violate the first amendment by employing the filtering software that cipa requires200 does cipa in other words effectively violate library patrons rights the plurality concluded that it does not as internet access in public libraries is neither traditional or designated public forum201and that therefore it would not be appropriate to apply strict scrutiny to determine whether the filtering requirements are constitutional but the plurality also considered whether cipa imposes an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal assistancein other words does it violate public libraries rights by requiring them to limit their freedom of speech if they accept federal funds the plurality found that assuming that government entities have first amendment rights it did not decide the question cipa does not infringe them this is because cipa does not deny benefit to libraries that do not agree to use filters rather as in rust v sullivan the statute simply insists that public funds be spent for the purposes for which they were authorized202 cipa does not penalize libraries that choose not to install such software or deny them the right to provide their patrons with unfiltered internet access rather cipa simply reflects congress decision not to subsidize their doing so203 the court distinguished velazquez on the ground that public libraries have role comparable to that of legal aid attorneys that pits them against the government and there is comparable 196 id at 541 542 197 id at 544 545 546 198 539 us 194 2003 199 id at 203 200 id 201 id at 205 202 id at 211 203 id at 212

benefactors might attach to the use of donated funds or other assistance204 in rumsfeld v forum for academic and institutional rights inc the supreme court upheld the solomon amendment which provides that in the courts summary if any part of an institution of higher education denies military recruiters access equal to that provided other recruiters the entire institution would lose certain federal funds205 fair the group that challenged the solomon amendment is an association of law schools that barred military recruiting on their campuses because of the militarys discrimination against homosexuals fair challenged the solomon amendment as violating the first amendment because it forced schools to choose between enforcing their nondiscrimination policy against military recruiters and continuing to receive specified federal funding the court first rejected an interpretation of th solomon amendment that would have avoided the constitutional issue under this interpretation school excluding military recruiters would comply with the solomon amendment so long as it also excluded any other employer that violates its nondiscrimination policy206 the court instead construed the solomon amendment to require schools to allow the military the same access as any other employer including employers who do not discriminate and whom the schools allow on campus interpreting the solomon amendment as such the court concluded because the first amendment would not prevent congress from di rectly imposing the solomon amendments access requirement the statute does not place an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal funds207 the court added the solomon amendment neither limits what law schools may say nor requires them to say anything it affects what law schools must doafford equal access to military recruitersnot what they may or may not say208 the law schools conduct in barring military recruiters the court found is not inherently expressive and therefore unlike flag burning for example is not symbolic speech209 applying the obrien test for restrictions on conduct that have an incidental effect on speech the court found that the solomon amendment clearly promotes substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation210 the court also found that the solomon amendment did not unconstitutionally compel schools to speak or even to host or accommodate the governments message as for compelling speech law schools must send emails and post notices on behalf of the military to comply with the solomon amendment this sort of recruiting assistance however is far cry from the compelled speech in barnette and wooley 211 it is plainly incidental to the solomon amendments regulation of conduct as for forcing one speaker to host or accommodate another the compelled speech 204 id at 213 emphasis in original 205 547 us 47 51 2006 206 id at 56 207 id at 60 the court stated that congresss authority

that the complaining speakers own message was affected by the speech it was forced to accommodate212 by contrast the court wrote nothing about recruiting suggests that law schools agree with any speech by recruiters and nothing in the solomon amendment restricts what the law schools may say about the militarys policies213 finally the court found that the solomon amendment was not analogous to the new jersey law that had required the boy scouts to accept homosexual scoutmaster and which the supreme court struck down as violating the boy scouts right of expressive association214 recruiters unlike the scoutmaster are outsiders who come onto campus for the limited purpose of trying to hire studentsnot to become members of the schools expressive association215

education the supreme court said that it cannot be gainsaid that the state has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with the regulation of speech of the citizenry in general 216 the first amendment however protects public employees right in certain circumstances to speak as citizen addressing matters of public concern217 in pickering the supreme court held it unconstitutional for school board to fire teacher for writing letter to local newspaper criticizing the administration of the school system the court did not however hold that the teacher had the same right as private citizen to write such letter rather because the teacher had spoken as citizen on matter of public concern the court balanced the interests of the teacher as citizen in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state as an employer in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees 218 in this case the court found that the statements in the letter were in way directed towards any person with whom appellant the teacher would normally be in contact in the course of his daily work as teacher thus question of maintaining either discipline by immediate superiors or harmony among coworkers is presented here appellants employment relationships with th board are not

personal loyalty and confidence are necessary to their proper functioning219 in arnett v kennedy the supreme court again balanced governmental interests and employee rights and this time sustained the constitutionality of federal statute that authorized removal or suspension without pay of an employee for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service where the cause cited was an employees speech 220 the employees speech in this case however consisted in falsely and publicly accusing the director of his agency of bribery the court interpreted the statute to proscribe only that public speech which improperly damages and impairs the reputation and efficiency of the employing agency and it thus imposes greater controls on the behavior of federal employees as are necessary for the protection of the government as employer indeed the act is not directed at speech as such but at employee behavior including speech which is detrimental to the efficiency of the employing agency 221 in givhan v western line consolidated school district the court upheld the first amendment right of public school teacher to complain to the school principal about employment policies and practices at the school which she conceived to be racially discriminatory in purpose or effect 222 in connick v myers an assistant district attorney was fired for insubordination after she circulated questionnaire among her peers soliciting views on matters relating to employee morale223 the supreme court upheld the firing distinguishing pickering on the ground that in that case unlike in this one the fired employee had engaged in speech concerning matters of public concern when employee expression cannot be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political social or other concern to the community government officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices without intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the first amendment we do not suggest however that myers speech even if not touching upon matter of public concern is totally beyond the protection of the first amendment the first amendment does not protect speech and assembly only to the extent it can be characterized as political we hold only that when public employee speaks not as citizen upon matters of public concern but as an employee upon matters only of personal interest absent the most unusual of circumstances federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of personnel decision taken by public agency allegedly in reaction to the employees behavior 224 219 pickering

touch upon matter of public concern and to this extent myers speech was entitled to pickering balancing to determine whether it was protected by the first amendment the court also considered that the questionnaire interfered with working relationships was prepared and distributed at the office arose out of an employment dispute and was not circulated to obtain useful research the court repeated something it had said in pickering it did not deem it either appropriate or feasible to attempt to lay down general standard against which all such statements may be judged225 in rankin v mcpherson the court upheld the right of an employee to remark after hearing of an attempt on president reagans life if they go for him again i hope they get him226 the court considered the fact that the statement dealt with matter of public concern did not amount to threat to kill the president did not interfere with the functioning of the workplace and was made in private conversation with another employee and therefore did not discredit the office furthermore as the employees duties were purely clerical and encompassed confidential policymaking or public contact role her rema rk did not indicate that she was unworthy of employment 227 these supreme court cases indicate the relevant factors in determining whether government employees speech is protected by the first amendment it should be emphasized that the court considers the time place and manner of expression228 thus if an employee made political speeches on work time such that they interfered with his or others job performance he could likely be fired as unworthy of employment at the same time he could not be fired for the particular political views he expressed unless his holding of those views made him unfit for the job thus governmental employer could not llow employees to make speeches in support of one political candidate on work time but not allow employees to make speeches in support of that candidates opponent but secret service agent assigned to guard the president would not have the same right as the clerical worker in rankin to express the hope that the president would be assassinated in waters v churchill plurality of justices concluded that in applying the connick testwhat the speech was in what tone it was delivered what the listeners reactions werethe court should not ask the jury to determine the facts for itself 229 rather the court should apply the test to the facts as the employer reasonably found them to be230 that is the employer need not come to its factual conclusions through procedures that substantially mirror the evidentiary rules used in court but it may not come to them based on evidence or on extremely weak evidence when strong evidence is clearly available231 in united states v national treasury employees union nteu the court struck down law that prohibited federal employees from accepting any compensation for making speeches or writing articles even if neither the subject of the speech or article nor the person or group paying for it 225 id at 154 226 483 us 378 380 1987 227 id at 390391 228 see eg connick v myers supra note 223 461

prohibition did not apply to books nor to fiction or poetry232 the court noted that unlike pickering and its progeny this case does not involve post hoc analysis of one employees speech and its impact on that employees public responsibilities the governments burden is greater with respect to this statutory restriction on expression than with respect to an isolated disciplinary action233 doing the balancing it had mandated in pickering the court concluded that the speculative benefits the honoraria ban may provide the government are not sufficient to justify this crudely crafted burden on respondents freedom to engage in expressive activities234 in city of san diego v roe the court held that police department could fire police officer who sold video on the adultsonly section of ebay that showed him stripping off police uniform and masturbating235 the court found that the officers expression does not qualify as matter of public concern and pickering balancing does not come into play236 the court also noted that the officers speech unlike federal employees speech in nteu was linked to his official status as police officer and designed to exploit his employers image and therefore was detrimental to the mission and functions of his employer237 therefore the court had little difficulty in concluding that the city was not barred from terminating roe under either line of cases ie pickering or nteu 238 this leaves uncertain whether had the officers expression not been linked to his official status the court would have overruled his firing under nteu or would have upheld it under pickering on the ground that his expression was not matter of public concern in garcetti v ceballos the court cut back on first amendment protection for government employees by holding that there is protection pickering balancing is not to be applied when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties even if those statements are about matters of public concern 239 in this case deputy district attorney had presented his supervisor with memo expressing his concern that an affidavit that the office had used to obtain search warrant contained serious misrepresentations the deputy district attorney claimed that he was subjected to retaliatory employment actions and sued the supreme court held that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline 240 the fact that the employees speech occurred inside his office and the fact that the speech concerned the subject matter of his employment were not sufficient to foreclose first amendment protection241 rather the controlling factor was that his expressions were made pursuant to his duties242 therefore 232 513 us 454 1995 233 id at 466468 234 id at 477 235 543 us 77 2004 236 id at 84 237 id 238 id at 80 239

umbehr the court held that the first amendment protects independent contractors from the termination of atwill government contracts in retaliation for their exercise of the freedom of speech243 the court held that in determining whether particular termination violates the first amendment the pickering balancing test adjusted to weigh the governments interests as contractor rather than as employer should be used244 the court did not address the possibility of suits by bidders or applicants for new government contracts 245 in elrod v burns246 and branti v finkel 247 the supreme court held that government officials may not discharge public employees for refusing to support political party or its candidates unless political affiliation is reasonably appropriate requirement for the job in question248 in ohare truck service inc v northlake the court held that the protections of elrod and branti extend to situation where the government retaliates against contractor or regular provider of services for the exercise of rights of political association or the expression of political allegiance 249
