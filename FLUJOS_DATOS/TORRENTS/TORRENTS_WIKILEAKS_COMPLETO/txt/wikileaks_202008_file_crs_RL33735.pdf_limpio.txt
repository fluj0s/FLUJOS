agency that serves as the chief us government agency to help finance american exports of manufactured goods1 congress has direct oversig ht responsibility over the bank which it exercises through various methods including approving the banks charter extending its authority through r eauthorizing legislation annual budget appropriations senate confirmation of presidential appointments to the banks board of directors and the banks president requests for testimony from the banks president and amendments to the banks governing statutes eximbank has three main programs it uses to finance us exports direct loans export credit guarantees and export credit in surance prior to 1980 the banks direct lending program was its chie f financing vehicle which it used to finance such capitalintensive exports as commercial aircraft and nuclear power plants both the budget authority requested by the adminis tration and the limitati on approved by the congress for the banks direct lending we re sharply curtailed during the 1980s and 1990s eximbanks direct lending program is us ed primarily to aid us exporters in instances where they face foreign competito r that is receiving officially subsidized financing by foreign government thes loans carry fixed interest rates and generally are made at terms that are th most attractive allo wed under the provisions of international agreements they are made primarily to counter attempts by foreign governments to sway purchases in favor of their exporters solely on the basis of subsidized financing rather than on market conditions price quality etc and to enforce internationally agreed upon terms nd conditions for export financing the bank also has an intermediary credit progra m it uses to offer medium and longterm fixedrate financing to buyers of us ex ports but us exporters also must face officially subsidized foreign competition to qualify for this program as part of its direct lending program the bank has tied aid war chest it uses to counter specific projects th at are receiving foreign officially subsidized export financing tied aid credits and mixed credits are two of the primary methods whereby governments provide their exporters with official assistance to promote exports tied aid credits include loans and grants which reduce financing costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33735crs2 below market rates for exporte rs and which are tied to the procurement of goods and services from the donor country mixed credits combine concessional government financing funds at below market rates or terms with commercial or near commercial funds to produce an overall rate that is lower than marketbased interest rates and carries more lenient loan terms the united states does tie substantial amounts of its agricultural and military aid to us goods but it generally has avoided using such financing to promot american capital goods exports guarantees and insurance are the main programs the bank uses to assist american exporters both programs redu ce some of the risks involved in exporting by insuring against commercial or political uncertainty there is an important distinction however between the two progra ms insurance coverage carries with it various conditions that must be met by the insured before the bank will pay off claim guarantee is an ironclad commitment made to commercial bank by the exportimport bank that promises full repayment with few if any conditions attached in addition eximbank has wo rking capital guarantee program that it uses to aid small and mediumsized businesses busine sses that qualify have exporting potential but need working capital funds to produce or market their goods or services for export guarantees are offered to qualified lenders primarily commercial banks in order to facilitate loans to small businesses in fy2005 the bank authorized 1394 billion in loans and guarantees to support an estimated 1786 billion in us exports according to the bank this represents 3128 transactions of which 80 percent directly benefitted small business overview of hr 5068 and s 3938 the 109th congress considered hr 5068 and s 3938 both identified as the

of commerce the intern ational trade commission the office of management and budget and the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs and the house committee on financial services the bank is also required to publish any subsequent changes to the pr oposed project in the federal register and provide for comment period beyond these areas of common approaches the two measures provide number of different areas in which they amend th banks charter for instance hr 5068 would have authorized an office within th bank to increase the total amount of loans and guarantees that go to support exports by socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and small business concerns owned by women hr 5068 also would have atte mpted to make the banks operations more transparent by keeping applicants better info rmed of the status of their application for loan or guarantee and it would require the bank to provide broad set of reports to congress on the banks operations h r 5068 would have required the bank to report to congress annually on its efforts to improve the competitiveness of its programs relative to the programs of othe r official export credit agencies hr 5068 would have directed the bank to study how it might assist new or impoverished democracies and provide great er assistance to exports i nvolving renewable energy s 3938 directs the

for operating the banks tied aid facility hr 5068 w ould have reduced somewhat the role of the secretary of the treasury in the operation of the tie d aid program while s 3938 expands the secretarys role by providing formal procedure that llows the secretary to oppose decisions made by the banks board of dir ectors to match an offer of tied aid by foreign entity hr 5068 would have broade ned the current scope of the tied aid program by authorizing the bank to use th program to support new measures on tied aid enforce existing arrangements and to bring into the organization for economic

tied aid fund to match offers of tied aid credits by official export agencies that violate the oecd arrangement on tied aid and to support us exporters w ho are placed at competitive disadvantage as result of foreign offers of tied aid credits hr 5068 would have added to this list the requirement that the bank support u s exporters that face competitors who are receiving support from foreign export cred it agencies that are not party to the oecd arrangement the house measur also would have required the bank to promote compliance with the oecd arrangement among countries that currently are not party to the arrangement hr 5068 also would have reduced somewhat the role of the secretary of the treasury in overseeing the tied aid program by removing current requirements that the bank work with the secretary in administering the program and in determining how the tied aid funds are used hr 5068 also would have provided guidance from the congress to the secretary of the treasury regarding negotiations on the oecd arrangement in particular the secretary would have been required to inform the other participants to the negotiations that the us goals would be to 1 seek compliance with the arrangement among countries with signif icant export credit programs that are not parties to the arrangement 2 identify within the world trade organization the extent to which countries that are not party to the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures are not in compliance with the terms of the oecd arrangement and 3 implement new disc iplines on the use of untied aid market windows and other forms of exports finan ce that seek to exploit loopholes in the arrangement hr 5068 also would have expanded the current set of tied aid principles which requires the bank to have credible information that an offer of tied aid exists before the bank can use its tied aid facility to match the offer instead the bank would have needed only credible evidence of tied aid offer to utilize its tied aid program this change would have eased the burden of proof on the bank in those cases in which the foreign entity is not party to the oecd arrangement and therefore not required to inform other countri of its offers of tied aid the measure also would have required the president of the united states to notify congress in those cases in which the president in cons ultation with the secretary of the treasury and the president of the bank declined to match foreign offer of tied aid because he had determined that such an offer would materially impede the broader purposes of the tied aid program s 3938 charts different approach to tied aid the measure directs the bank to process applications for tied aid according to principles and standards that are developed in cooperati on

export credit agencies or other entities sponsored by foreign government that are not party to the arrangement the bank would also promote compliance with arrangement rules among foreign export credit agencies that are not party to the arrangement the measure would amend the current tied aid process by removing the requirement that the bank administer the program in consultation with the secretary of the treasury the measure would remove the current requirement that the bank work jointly with the secretary of the treasury in determining how the tied aid funds should be used also the measure would remove the current requirement that the bank work with the secretary of the treasury in developing set of principles and standards to use in administering the tied aid program the measure would

support new measures on tied aid enforce existing arrangements and to bring into the arrangement those countries that are not currently party to the arrangement the measure would expand the current set of tied aid principles which require the bank to have credible information about foreign offer of tied aid before the bank can use the tied aid fund to match specific offer by foreign agency in cases where information about specific offer of foreign tied aid or untied aid used to promote exports as if it were tied aid is not available in timely manner or is unavailable because the foreign export credit agency involved is not subject to the reporting requirements under the arrangement then the bank may decide to use the tied aid credit fund based on credible evidence of history of such offers under similar circumstances or other forms of credible evidence the measure would also require the president of the united states to notify the congress in those cases in which the president in consultation with the secretary of the treasury and the president of the exportimport bank had determined that offering tied aid credit in particular circumstance would materially impede the broader purposes of the tied aid program expansion of countries in competition with whom the bank is to provide export financing comparable provision the measure would expand the number of countries with
