version of the agre ement see httpwww streamlinedsalestaxorg agreementhtm it was most recently revised jan 13 2006state tax revenue in fy20042 many local governments also depend on the sales tax local governments derived 11 or approximately 446 billion of their total tax revenue from sales taxes in fy20033 generally this sales tax revenue is collected by the retailer at the point of transaction and remitted to that state or local government while the legal burden is on the consumer the retailer acts as the collection agent for the state states and their local governments are concerned that the expansion of internet commerce and interstate transactions will gradually erode their tax base this concern arises because the us supreme c ourt has ruled that out ofstate vendors are not required to collect sales taxes for states in which they the vendor s do not have nexus usually defined as physical presence4 note that at the time of these court decisions interstate sales were primarily through mailorder catalogues the growth of internet commerce is certa in though the size of the revenue loss is not the census bureau of the depar tment of commerce estimates that internet commerce in the third quarter of 2005 ju mped 27 from the third quarter of 20045 for 2003 alone revenue loss from uncollected taxe s on internet transactions was estimated to be 8 billion6 even though there is significant debate surrounding the current size of the sales tax revenue loss arising from the growth in internet commerce most observers agree that the tax loss is significan t and will likely grow robustly over time given their dependence on sales taxes states have significant incentive to maintain their sales tax revenue streams currently one of the primary goals of many states is to have congress pass legisl ation allowing member states to require collection of sales taxes by remote vendors this effort was formalized by the strea mlined sales tax project sstp whose task was to craft an agreement paving the way for streamlined state sales taxes this agreement is the streamlin ed sales and use tax agreement or ssuta7 the sstp the entity that drafted the ssuta was created in 2000 by 43 states and the district of columbia dc these states and dc wanted to simplify and better synchronize individual state sales and use tax laws its stated goal was to create simplified sales tax system so all types of vendors from tr aditional main street retailers to those conducting trade over the informa tion superhighway could easily collect andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22387crs3 8 jeffery friedman and charles c kearns federal streamlined sales tax legislation introduced in senate state tax notes jan 16 2006 pp 131136 9 for more information see h ttp wwwstream linedsalestaxorgremit sales taxes the member states believe that simplified relatively uniform tax code across states would make it easier for remote vendors to collect sales taxes on goods sold to outofstate customers the sstp was dissolved once the ssuta became effective on october 1 20058 description of the agreement under the ssuta member states request that remote sellers voluntarily collect sales taxes on items purchased by customers outside their home state vendors in participating states who voluntarily collect the sales ta x would be offered amnesty for previously uncollected taxes participating states have agreed to share the administrative burden of collecting taxes to ease tax collection for sellers the states obligations under the ssuta include the following9 agree to uniform definitions for all taxable items states participating in the ssuta must define all goods in the same way for example pumpkin could be defined as either f ood or home décor in many states food is exempt from taxation all states will agree to one definition so pumpkin seller in illinois would know the tax status of pumpkins in all states not just illinois as anothe r example what percentage of fruit juice does beverage need to contain to be considered fruit juice instead of soda if fruit juice is taxed differently from soda as is often the case sellers could be confused by conflicting definitions in different markets each state retains the choice over whether or not the item is taxable all local governments in state must us the same statedefined tax base simplify tax rates it is fairly common for states and local jurisdictions to tax different goods at different rates this complication is mostly remedied under the ssuta as each state will be allowed only one tax rate with an exception for second state rate on food and drugs each state can add one additional local ju risdiction rate ba sed on zip code to compensate for lost local tax revenue the member state must maintain catalogue of rates for all zip codes for zip codes with multiple rates an average rate for that zip code would apply simplify collection businesses will longer file tax returns with each state and sometimes local government where they conduct business as is often the case where the ssuta has not gone into effect instead sales taxes will be remitted to single state agency thus states will bear some of the administrative co st of the technology employed to implement the new system ve ndor compensation is still under negotiationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22387crs4 10 national governors association key

washington and wisconsin nonparticipating states the following states are not participants because they do not levy statewide sales tax alaska delaware montana new hampshire and oregon or they levy statewide sales tax but have chosen not to participate colorado alaska does allow some localities to levy local sales tax but these localities are not represented in the ssuta compact the stakeholders the streamlined sales tax enjo ys the collective support of the national governors associa tion nga the nga has endor sed the ssuta with hopes that the agreement could address the supr eme courts concerns about the burden on interstate commerce of collecting remote taxes the association believes that requiring remote vendors to collect sales and use ta xes under new simplified system could survive legal challenges10 other support comes from large brick and mo rtar retailers who must collect sales taxes and believe the current sy stem provides an unfair advantag to internet retailers who do not collect such taxes brick and mortar companies with strong internet presence such as walmartcom and toysruscom voluntarily comply with ssuta guidelines and use them to collect taxes on remote sales11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22387crs5 12 as described earlier consumers are required to remit consumer use taxes to their state of residence if the remote vendor has not collected the tax not paying use taxes is tax evasion however states typically do not pursue collecti on from these consumers as the tax yield could be considerably smaller than the co st of enforcing use tax remittance 13

the us house small business subcommittee on regulatory reform and oversight held an oversight hearing on the streamline legisl ation s 2152 and s 2153 on feb 8 2006 the submitted witness testimony is available from the subcomm ittee website at httpwwwchousegovsmbizhearingsdatabasedrivenhearingssystemdisplayhearingsasp congress109on the other side of the issue are indivi duals and businesses th at benefit under the current system consumers in states with high sales tax rates can purchase goods online and easily evade paying sales taxes12 businesses that sell goods online to these outof state consumers also benefit as their products absent the sales tax are ma rginally less expensive than the brick and mortar alternative also opposing the ssuta are several anti tax groups who see the ssuta as new tax burden rather than simplification of the current tax system13 antitax groups also argue that states compete to attract businesses and customers through lower tax rates and that this competition is good for consumers many businesses are taking the middle gr ound in this debate they understand the states desire to more efficiently collect sales tax revenue in fair manner but not surprisingly they ask for greater simplifi cation and increased vendor compensation from the states for collecting state sales taxes issues for the 109th congress in the 109th congress s 2152 enzi and s 2153 dorgan would grant fullmember states in the ssuta the authority to compel outofstate vendors to collect sales and use taxes on remote sales14 both bills would respond to the supreme courts recommendation in quill that congress act under the comme rce clause to clarify state sales tax collection rules more specifically the legislation would allow states that have fully adopted the simplified tax system to collect sales taxes from sufficiently large businesses even if those busin esses do not have nexus in the state generally in s 2152 sufficiently large business is one with nationwide sales of greater than 5 million s 2153 in contrast assigns the res ponsibility for defining small business to the small business administration sba with the ultimate approval of congress both bills would set minimum standards of simplifi cation before states would be allowed to demand remittance of sale s and use taxes the proposed gislation would have the court of federal appeals review any dis putes related to tax collection
