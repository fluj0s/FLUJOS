was provided in return pg 49 two meps were found to be paying out full assistance allowance but neither had any assistant actually accredited or registered with the parliament pg 49 one company was registered as the recipient of the full assistance allowance but its accounts show activity its registration and some payments to it were backdated pg 49 several companies paid to provide office and

was paid regular flat fee of 6600 to cover research communication and paying agent services but the fee was never broken down or itemised pg 50 2 dubious large cash payments are made to staff and service providers over and above salaries huge end of year bonuses are being paid often simply to use up as much of the allowance as is left over between 3 and 195 times the recipients monthly salary pg 18 large layoff payments are unclear without proper explanation of why or how they are decided pg 53 3 improper registration and tax compliance of service providers some service provider companies receiving payments may simply not exist one example is given of firm that has an unconfirmed vat number an unregistered company name and an incorrect phone number pg 61 79 of vatsubject transactions have evidence of proper registration or exemption from vat pg 20 7 payments were made to bank accounts in countries other than the location of the companypg 61 83 of service providers were not registered as is legally required with the belgian national company database pg 20 4 invoicing is lax or nonexistent the rules dont require prior invoicing only up to 12 months after the payment has been made pg 67 only 42 of 105 audited payment files actually had invoices submitted in that time and only 5 of those 42 included the minimum required details to make them valid pg 22 5 some meps are paying set amounts straight into the coffers of their political parties pg 77 some parties have all of their meps paying them identical sums for assistant services but the number of assistants the meps actually have is different and there is often link to actual services provided pg 77 43 old queen street london sw1h 9ja 0845 330 9554 wwwtaxpayersalliancecom infotaxpayersalliancecom the taxpayers alliance is company limited by guarantee in england 04873888 examples of dubious invoicing include an internet site paid for by an meps allowances that turned out to be website for his national political movement not him as an mep pg 77 6 social security is not being paid despite the legal requirement to do so 90 of contracts for selfemployed service providers had evidence that legally required social security payments were being made pg 20 26 of assistants and 64 of paying agents have evidence of social security being paid pg 79 7 paying agents expense claims are opaque or even unrecorded none of the paying agents included in the audit submitted statements of expenditure in the time required by the rules pg 86 28 of contracts through paying agents for assistants did not even name the assistant who was being paid for pg 88 8 travel expenses are open to abuse some contracts pay set flat monthly fees for travel with receipts required up to 2200 month pg 84 9 contracts are too varied and imprecise assistants contracts are vague and imprecise with often or little job description pg 47 the variation and complexity of the contracts being used as well as other arrangements expose the institution to financial legal and reputational risks pg 4344 10 strangely whilst the bundestag offers german meps free paying agency service only 30 of german meps choose to use it pg 91 43 old queen street london sw1h 9ja 0845 330 9554 wwwtaxpayersalliancecom infotaxpayersalliancecom the taxpayers alliance is company limited by guarantee in england 04873888
