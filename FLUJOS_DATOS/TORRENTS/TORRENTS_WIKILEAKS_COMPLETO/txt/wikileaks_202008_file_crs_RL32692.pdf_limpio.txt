cases involve the initiation of anticircumvention litigation for what some argue are anticompetitive purposes in the marketing and sale of durable goods the practice of reverse engineering allows others to identify and analyze the creative versus the functional aspects of copyrighted software and to utilize them to some degree in some contexts reverse gineering has been held by the courts to be fair use of copyrightprotected property there is also an express limited statutory exemption for reve rse engineering under the dmca how the practice and use of reverse engineering for commercial

departure into the zone of what might be called paracopyright an uncharted new domain of legislative prov isions designed to strengthen copyright protection by regulating conduct which traditionally has fallen outside the regulatory sphere of intellectual property law anticircumvention under the digital millennium copyright act and reverse engineering recent legal developments background the digital millennium copyright act dmca prohibits individuals from manufacturing selling or trafficking in technology products services or devices that circumvent technology design ed to control access to copyrighted work1 this is known as the dmcas anticircumvention provision enacted in 1998 the law became effective in 2000 the dmcas anticircumvention provisions have proven to be controversial pr oponents argue that they are essential to protect the creation and distribution of and the market for digital intellectual property ip while critics argue that th ey extend the copyright monopoly beyond its intended scope and thwart the publics ab ility to access materials for permissible purposes2 the statute is best known in the cont ext of encryption programs and access control gates interposed between the public and copyrighted digital entertainment media eg music and motion pictures3 here critics of the dmca argue that the anticircumvention provisions allow copyri ght holders to impose new and overly restrictive conditions on content users this new layer of ip protection has been referred to as paracopyright4 it refers to the ability of content owners to use conditions for access in order to extend control over usage of copyrighted work the focus of this report however is another genre of an ticircumventionbased cases making their way through the cour ts these cases

17 usc 1201 that involve commercial interests unrelated to the entertainment industry specifically manufacturers of garage door openers nd manufacturers of toner cartridges for photocopying machines these cases involve issues that have been the basis for criticism of the dmca in slightly different commercial context namely whether the provisions permit ip owners to extend their copyright monopoly beyond its intended scope to cont rol consumer goods exceptions to the copyright monopoly reverse engineering there are several statutory and judicially created exceptions to copyright holders right to control ip among the best known is the publics right to make fair use of protected work5 among the judiciallysanctioned interpretations of the fair use defense to copyright infringement is the right to reverse engineer copyrighted computer program to gain an understanding of its unprotected functional elements6 like all fair use analyses the context for courts decision is intensely factspecific but court considering the legitimacy of reverse engineering as fair use will factor in the public interest in competitive ma rketplace for consumer goods when for example copyrighted

contained in those work s that the copyright act was intended to promote9 judicial determination of what activity constitutes fair use of copyrighted property is fluid and evolving doctrine the anticircumvention provisions of the dmca however establish offenses wholly distinct from copyright infringement in other words reverse engineering that ma be or have been permissible under the copyright act may longer be permissi ble under the dmca to the extent that the dmcas anticircumvention provisions ddress the narrow issue of manipulating or circumventing technology whether or not it is copyrightable in its own right to access copyrighted technology its impact on fa ir use particularly the employment of reverse engineering may have significant impact in the marketplace and there are still many othe r legal doctrines that impact the legality of reverse engineering in any given context for example the dmca itself at 17 usc 1201f contains an express exemption for reverse engineering for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs10 conversely the courts have honored contractual terms under state law such as licensing agreements and terms of use agreements that curtail users right to reverse engineer copyrighted material11 how do the rights remedies and exceptions in the dmca relate to comparable ones in the copyright act in the realm of online entertainment ch as music film and electronic books critics of the dmca argue that it has the potential to curtail the publics right to make fair use of copyrighted material in other commercial contexts litigants argue that the acts anticircumvention provisions may thwart access to the permissible fair use of reverse engineering and thereby permit copyright holder to leverage limited monopoly to control areas outside of that monopoly in the broader world of

independently created computer program with other programs and to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title or violate continuedmicrochip for tseries replacement cartrid ges the court found that lexmark was likely to prevail on claims of copyright infringement and violation of the dmca14 there were two distinct components of sccs microchip one circumvented an authentication sequence embedded in the tseries printer the sequence determines whether the printer will accept the cartridge as authorized and subsequently grant it access to the printer engine program which is resident in the printers controller board the other both circumvented access to and copied lexmarks tlp in its entirety the toner loading program enables the printers to approximate the amount of tone r remaining in the cartridge this information is used to display toner low message on the printer screen the question before the court was twofol d first did the smartek microchip violate the dmca by illegally circumven ting the access control systems to both the printer engine program and the toner load ing program second by replicating the tlp in its entirety did the microchip infringe lexmarks copyright in it the court considered in depth whether the lexmar ks toner program was copyrightable and concluded that it was relying in part upon the fact that the us copyright office granted lexmark of certificate of registration for it it considered and rejected fair use defense it also rejected copy right misuse defense finding that attempting to enforce rights under the dmca to protect access to copyrighted computer program cannot have the legal effect of using copyright to secure an exclusive right or limited monopoly not expressly granted by copyright law15 nor could lexmarks efforts to enforce its rights under the dmca be considered an unlawful act undertaken to stifle competition the court emphasized that under the dmca the right to protect against unauthorized access is right separate and distinct from the right to protect against violations of exclusive copyright rights such as reproduction and distribution16 indeed the authentication sequence which triggered the interface between lexmarks toner cartridge microchip and printer was exactly the ty pe of technological measur that effectively controls access to work designed to be protected under the dmca17 finally the court rejected the argument that the dmcas exemption for reverse engineering was applicable to sccs smartek microchip18 in addition tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32692crs6 18 continued applicable law other than this section 17 usc 1201f3 emphasis added 19 387 f3d 522 6th cir 2004 20 17 usc 102b 21 387 f3d at 535 22 idviolating the dmca by circumventing the authentication sequence to the printer engine program sccs microchip infringed the copyright act because it contained an exact copy of lexmarks copyrighted toner loading program therefore scc was unable to meet the reverse engineering exemption requirement that the circumvention enables interoperability of an independently created computer program the court of appeals the sixth circuit court of appeals overturned the lower courts issuance of preliminary inj unction taking issue with virtually all of the district courts findings19 specifically the court of appeals found that for purposes of upholding preliminary injunction lexmark was not likely to successfully establish that scc infringed its copyright for the tlp or that the smartek microchip violated the dm ca by illegally circumventing access controls the court first considered the tlps eligibility for copyright protection it weighed the basic element for copyrightability original andor creative expression against that which cannot be copyrighted an idea procedure process system method of operation concept principl or discovery regardless of form20 applying this process to computer programs with its concomitant task of separating idea from expression is vexing21 in order to ascertain the elusive boundary line between ideaexpression and between processnonfunc tional expression the court utilized the doctrines of merger and scènes à faire the merger doctrine precludes copyright protection where there is only one way or very few ways of expressing an idea idea and expression are deemed to be merged because granting copyright to the expressive component of the work would extend prot ection to the works uncopyrightable ideas as well the scènes à faire doctrine is related in the computersoftware context it means that the elements of program dictated by practical realities eg by hardware standards and mechanical specifications software standards and compatibility requirements computer manuf acturer design standards target industry practices and standard computer programming practicesmay not obtain copyright protection22 the court noted that lockout codes ge nerally fall on the functionalidea rather than the originalexpression side of the copyright line manufacturers of interoperable devices such as toner car tridges or garage door opener transmitters often employ security system to bar the use of unauthorized components to unlock the system to permit operation of the primary device the printer or the garage door opener the component must contain cer tain code

in component device to permit its use the rger and scènes à faire doctrines often preclude the sequence from obtai ning copyright protection applying the foregoing the court conc luded that the district court erred in finding that the tlp code had sufficient orig inality to be copyrightable it found the tlp to be very brief uncomplicated c ode sequence that functioned as lock out code brevity in computer program does not make it ineligible for copyright protection but creativity and effo rt are reciprocally related the smaller the effort the greater the creativity required to invoke copyright protection23 in view of its finding that the tlp was not copyrightable the court declined to rule on sccs fair use defense it di d however indicate that although the purpose of sccs use of the smartek chip was for commercial gain factor in fair use analysis its use of the copyrighted tlp on the chip was not rather the use of the tlp was to satisfy authentication requirements and to permit printer functionality likewise with respect to the allegedly infringing use on the value of the copyrighted work the lower court had concluded that the smartek chip would diminish the market for sales of lexmarks toner car tridges the proper and more narrow question however was whether replicati on of the tlp on the microchip would diminish demand for the tlp more significantly the court of appeals observed that copyright law is not properly invoked to protect secondary market in consumer goods the district court focused on the wrong market it focused not on the value or marketability of the toner loading program but on lexmarks market for its toner cartridges lexmarks market for its toner cartridges and the profitability of its prebate program may well be dimi nished by the smartek chip but that is not the sort of market or value that copyright law protects lexmark has not introduced any evidence showing that an independent market exists for program as elementary as its toner loading program and we doubt at any rate that the smartek chip could have displaced any value in this market24 the court of appeals then addressed th district courts findings with respect to lexmarks likelihood of success in estab lishing that scc violated the dmcas ban on distributing devices that circumvent accesscontrol measures placed on copyrighted works according to lexmark sccs smartek chip is device that circumvents lexmarks technologi cal measure ie the authentication sequence which effectively controls access to its copyrighted works the toner loading program and printer engine program lexmark claimed that the smartek chip met all three tests for lia bility under 1201a2 1 the chip was primarily designed or produced for th purpose of circumventing lexmarks authentication sequence 2 it had only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circ umvent the authentication sequence and 3 scc marketed the chip for use in circumventing the au thentication sequence the district courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32692crs8 25 id at 546 26 id at 547 27 id at 548agreed and concluded that lexmark had shown likelihood of success under all three provisions for the court of appeals the anticircumvention allegation with respect to the tlp was problematic the microchip did not provide access to the tlp but actually replaced it more important since the dmca prohibits circumvention of access controls for copyrighted work the determination that the tlp was not eligible for copyright protection mooted the dmca charge the charge of illegal circumvention of the authentication sequence for the copyrighted printer engine program was more complicated the district court determined that the authentication sequence controlled access to the printer engine program because it controlled the consume rs ability to make use of the program the court of appeals disagreed assertin g that the authentication sequence did not control access rather it is the purchase of lexmark printer that allows access to the program25 the literal code itself can be read directly from the printer memory without the benefit of the authen tication sequence there is security device protecting the printer engine program while the authentication sequence controls access to the printer engine programs functionality the program itself is not otherwise effectively protected by acce ss controls the data and program can be translated into readable source code he nce the authentication sequence controlled only one avenue of access operational co mpatibility with printer cartridge analogizing access controls to locks on house the court reasoned because the statute refers to control ling access to work protected under this title it does not naturally apply when the work protected under this title is otherwise accessible just as one would not say that lock on the back door of house controls access to house whose front door doe s not contain lock and just as one would not say that lock on any door of house controls access to the house after its purchaser receives the key to the lock it does not make sense to say that this provision of the dmca applies to otherwisereadily accessible copyrighted works26 the court elaborated by explaining why access to the printer engine program is not covered by the dmca in the setting where the dmca applies such as encrypted data on music cd s and motionpicture dvds the copyright content that it protects operates on two planes the literal code governing the content and its manifestation generate d by the codes execution namely the music or movie in the dmcas context restricting use of th work means restricting consumers from making use of the copyrightable expression in the work27 the manufacturer must prevent access to both planes of the copyrighted material and the alleged infringer responds by marketing device that circum vents both levels of protection thus because lexmark did not direct any of its security efforts through the authentication sequence or otherwise to ensuring that th printer engine prog ram could not be readhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32692crs9 28 id at 549 29 id at 551and copied it cannot lay cla im to having put in place technological measure that effectively controls access to work pr otected under the copyright statute the extent to which the court leaves open an invitation to manufacturers to come within the dmca by withholding ll levels of access to copyrightprotected code is less clear it refers to the acts legislative history nd discerns congressional intent to protect the market for inter operable consumer go ods but nevertheless emphasizes its two plane analysis nowhere in its deliberations over the dmca did congress express an interest in creating liability for the circumvention of technological measures designed to prevent consumers from using consumer goods while leaving the copyrightable content of work unprotected in fact congress added the interoperability provision in part to ensure that the dmca would not diminish the benefit to consumers of interoperable devices in the consumer electronics environment 144 cong rec e2136 daily ed oct 13 1998 remarks of rep bliley28 interestingly in concurring opinion circuit judge merritt addresses this very point he advocates broadening the scope of the holding by making clear that in the future companies like lexmark cannot use the dmca in conjunction with copyright law to create monopolies of manufactured goods for themselves just by tweaking the facts of this case by for example creating toner loading program that is more complex and creative than the one here or by cutting off other access to the printer engine program29 in his opinion the cr itical question is the purpose of the circumvention technology because the purpose of the w is to prohibit piracy of copyright protected works such as movies music and computer programs an anticircumvention claim should not be per mitted to go forward unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the ci rcumvention supports piracy broad reading of the statute is necessary he argues to pr event manufacturers from creating monopolies for durable goods such as replacement part s through the use of more elaborate lock out codes and the burden of proof to demonstrate piracy must be on the plaintiff in order to prevent the threat of litigation by powerful manufacturers against smaller rivals and thereby thwart development of devices that facilita legitimate access to consumer goods only then should the bur den of proof

computer program and that it renders the security gdo insecure by llowing unauthorized users to circumvent the security inherent in the rolling code consequently chamberlain contended that skylink violated the antitrafficking cl ause of the dmcas anticircumvention provision 1201a2 us district court holdings in the first of two reported us district court decisions the court considered whether chamberlains rolling code security system was protected by copyright nd whether the dmca applied30 the court in denying chamberlains motion for summary judgment established framework for its anticircumvention analysis noting that it is undisputed that the dmcas application is not limited to the internet31 it was specifically intended to prohibit the trafficking of products or devices th at circumvent technol ogical measures to restrict access to copyrighted work in the second opinion32 the court granted defenda nt skylinks motion for summary judgment determining that the model 39 transmitter did not provide unauthorized access to chamberlains copyrighted software skylinks program to overcome chamberlains rolling code did not satisfy the statutory definition of circumvention without the authority of the copyright owner 33 the court did not require skylink to prove that its use wa s authorized rather the burden was on chamberlain to demonstrate that the us was unauthorized the court found the following criteria persuasive to support its conclusion that skylinks use of the rolling code was authorized chamberlain did not put any restri ctions on consumers regarding the type of transmitter they n eeded buy to operate its gdo chamberlain also marketed universal transmitter and did not advise consumers that they we re limited to purchasing replacements from chamberlain and in order for skylink transmitter to operate chamberlain gdo the homeowner must store the tran smitters signal into the gdoshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32692crs11 34 292 fsupp2d at 1044 35 id at 1045 36 id at 1046memory hence it is the consumer not skylink that authorizes access skylinks model 39 universal gdo tran smitter did not violate the statute because creating and marketing one that is interoperable with the chamberlain gdo was implicitly authorized the court emphasized two factors hom eowner expectations and industry practice in response to chamberlains argument that it never warned customers against using unauthorized transmitters b ecause it had idea that other transmitters could be made to operate its rolling code the court replied that chamberlains failure to anticipate new technology does not re fute the fact that homeowners have reasonable expectation of using the t echnology now that it is available34 the fact that there is history in the gdo industr of universal transmitters being marketed and sold to allow homeowners an alte rnative means to access any brand of gdo negated chamberlains contention that ther was an implied restriction against the use of competing transmitters35 the court compared the absence of an explicit limitation by chamberlain on the use of competing transmitters to lexmarks explicit restrictions against use of third party toner cartridge refills in its shrinkwrap agreement with consumers yet while simultaneously acknowledging the limitations that may be effected by shrinkwrap agreement the court also suggested that legitimate consumer expectations may constitute an independent fair use basis for circumventing access control technology homeowner has legitimate expectation that he or she will be able to access the garage even if the original transmitter is misplaced or malfunctions under chamberlains theory any customer who loses his or her chamberlain transmitter but manages to operate the opener either with nonchamberlain transmitter or by some other means of circumventing the ro lling code has violated the dmca in this courts vi ew the statute does not require such conclusion gdo transm itters are similar to television remote controls in that consumers of both products may need to replace them at some point due to damage or loss and may program them to work with other devices manufactured by different companies in both cases consumers have reasonable expectation that they can replace the original pro duct with competing universal product without violating federal law36 the court assigned significant weight to two factors in issuing the summary judgment in favor of skylink first that the process by which the model 39 transmitter passed chamberlain s rolling code was not creat ed without authorization and second that the burden of proof to monstrate the absence of authorization is on the party alleging violation of the anticircumvention statute it therefore rejected chamberlains contention that skylink viol ated the prima facie requirement of antihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32692crs12 37 381 f3d 1178 1185 1191 fed cir 2004 the court distinguished the case before it from universal city studios v corley 273 f3d 429 2d cir 2001 which focused on first amendment issues in relation to the dmcas anticircumvention provisions 38 381 f3d at 1187 39 id at 119293trafficking under 1201a2 because its transmitter bypasses chamberlains rolling code security measure to gain access to chamberlains copyrighted gdo receiver operating software court of appeals the court of appeals noted that to determine whether skylink was entitled to summary judgment on the grounds that its model 39 universal transmitter does not violate the dmca requires the statutory construction of what 1201a2 does prohibit ma tter of first impression37 it reviewed proceedings before the lower court emphasizing the significance of the fact that chamberlain did not allege that skylink had infringed its copyright or was lia ble for contributory copyright infringement and with respect to the question of unauthorized circumvention the court reite rated that the homeowner who purchases chamberlain gdo owns it and has right to access his or her garage with it chamberlain did not place any explicit terms or conditions to limit the ways purchaser may use its products the homeowner who wishes to use skylink transmitter to operate with the chamberlain gdo must program it to do so hence if chamberlains interpretation of the dmca were correct not only would skylink be in violation of the dmca for trafficking in circumven tion devices under 1201a2 but owners of chamberlain gdo who purchased sky link transmitter would be in violation of a1 which prohibits circumvention38 but the court of appeals departing from the lower courts analysis undertook more expansive interpretation of the anticircumvention statute and did not limit its examination to the question of authoriza tion as component of the statutory definition of circumvention it bega n by examining the essenceof 1201 which it found does not create new property ri ght circumvention is not legally synonymous with infringement this distinction between property and liability is critical whereas copyrights like patents are property liability pr otection from unauthorized circumvention merely creates new cause of action under which defendant may be liable the distinction between property and liability goes straight to the issue of authorization the issue upon which the dist rict court both deni ed chamberlains and granted skylinks motion for summary judgment39 the distinction is evident in the basis for stating the claim plaintiff alleging copyright infringement need only prove owners hip and copying to make claim the burden of proving that the use was authoriz ed falls on the defendant but plaintiff alleging illegal circumventi on or trafficking must prove that the defendants access was unauthorized significant burden of proof which requires the plaintiff to establish that copyright law does not permit the access only then does the burden shift to the defendanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32692crs13 40 id at 1193 41 circumvention is not new form of infring ement but rather new violation prohibiting actions or products that facilitate infringement id at 1197 42 this interpretation the court noted he lps explain why chamberlains warranty conditions and website postings cannot render users of skylinks model 39 unauthorized users for the purposes of establishing trafficking liability under the dmca id at 1194 43 id at 1200the court rejected chamberlains argument that enactment of the dmca renders predmca history in the gdo industry irrelevant and overrides pre existing consumer expectations about th legitimate uses of products containing copyrightedembedded software it reject ed the broader contention that in the absence of explicit authorization circumve ntion of any technological access control measure to use product contai ning copyrighted software is per illegal to subscribe to such an interpretation of the statute would grant manufacturers broad exemptions from both the antitrust laws and the doctrine of copyright misuse40 in other words the dmcas prohibiti on against circumvention does create new and independent cause of action separate fro m copyright infringement41 but in order to establish liability for unauthoriz ed circumvention the complainant must demonstrate that access is indeed linked to copyright infringement and this linkage allows the court to consid er all noninfringing uses including statutorily and judicially established fair uses hence to violate the dmca by circumventing access technology without the authority of the copyright owner means to circumvent for purpose impermissible under the copyright laws not simply to circumvent without the express pe rmission of the copyright owner42 the court examined 1201s construc tion and legislative history and determined that the key to disentangling these relationships lies in understanding the linkage between access and protection tying prohibiti ons agains t access to protectible rights under copyri ght law represents rebal ancing of interests that addresses digital piracy granting c opyright owners unqua lified control over technological access would creat two distinct copyright regimes the first regime permits copyright owners to protect only the rights enumerated in 17 usc 106 subject to the exceptions and limitations of the copyright act owners who attempt to protect their rights by incorporating technological measures to protect against encroachment are able to hold trafficker s in circumvention devices liable under 1201b for putting their rights at risk by enabling users of the devices to infringe under the second regime inherent in chamberlains argument and rejected by the court the owners of work protected by both copyright and technological measure that controls access to that work would possess unlimited rights to hold circumventors liable under 1201a simply for accessing that work even if that access enabled only rights that the copyright act grants to the public this interpretation even under the substantial deference due congress borders on the irrational43 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32692crs14 44 id at 1201 citations and footnote omitted 45 id at 1202 footnote omittedemphasis in originaladdressing concerns of many dmca critics the court explained that the doctrines of antitrust and copyright misuse are inescapable components of right to control technological access to copyrighted work in similar vein chamberlains pr oposed construction would allow any manufacturer of any product to add si ngle copyrighted sentence or software fragment to its product wrap the copyrighted material in trivial encryption scheme and thereby gain the right to restrict consumers rights to use its products in conjunction with competing products in other words chamberlains construction of the dmca would allow virtually any company to attempt to leverage its sales into aftermarket monopolies practice that both the antitrust laws and the doctrine of copyright misuse normally prohibit44 indeed even if the grant to prohibit circ umvention were property right it would still not serve to repeal by implication the rights of those who lawfully possess copyrighted property if lawful ownershi p of encryptionprotected property conferred two separate and distinct rights on th copyright holder the latter would be empowered to prohibit lawful access to the copyrighted content in the instant case the owner of chamberlain gdo has legal right that is fair use right under copyright law to use universal trans mitter manufactured by thirdparty to access the copyrighted software to open the garage door chamberlains proposed construction woul d allow copyright owners to prohibit exclusively fair uses even in the absence of any feared foul use it would therefore allow any copyright owner thr ough combination of contractual terms and technological measures to repeal th fair use doctrine with respect to an individual copyrighted work or even sele cted copies of that copyrighted work again this implication contradicts 1201c1 directly copyright law itself authorizes the public to make certain uses of copyrighted materials consumers who purchase product containing c opy of embedded software have the inherent legal right to use that copy of the software what the law authorizes chamberlain cannot revoke45 while the dmca granted copyright holde rs additional legal protection it did not rescind the basic bargain granting the public noninfringing and fair uses of copyrighted materials the act also permits the various express beneficial uses of circumvention technology such as thos exempted under 1201dfg and j from the anticircumvention ban the court held that 17 usc 1201 prohi bits only forms of access that bear reasonable relationship to the protections that the copyright act otherwise affords owners it speculated that its holding might create some uncertainty and consume some judicial resources but nevertheless conc luded that it is the only meaningful reading of the statutehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32692crs15 46 id at 1203 emphasis in originalbuilding upon its assumptions the court articulated very specific test to determine what plaintiff alleging violation of 1201a2 trafficking must establish plaintiff alleging violation of 1201 a2 must prove 1 ownership of valid copyright on work 2 effectively controlled by technological measure which has been circumvented 3 that third parties can now access 4 without authorization in manner that 5 infringes or facilitates infringing right protected by the copyright act because of product that 6 the defendant either i designed or produced primarily for circumvention ii made available despite only limited commercial significance other than circumvention or iii marketed for use in circumvention of the controlling technological measure plaintiff incapable of establishing any one of ements 1 through 5 will have failed to prove prima facie case plaintiff capab of proving elements 1 through 5 need prove only one of 6i ii or iii to shift the burden back to the defendant at that point the various ffirmative defenses enumerated throughout 1201 become relevant46 copyright owner seeking to impose liability on an accused trafficker must demonstrate that the traffickers device enables either copyright infringement or prohibited circumvention here chambe rlain established connection between unauthorized use of its copyrighted so ftware and skylink s accused transmitter hence the court affirmed the district courts grant of summary judgment to skylink conclusion the major challenges presented by both the lexmark and chamberlain cases are to define the relations hips between and effects of the anticircumvention restrictions on reverse gineering in particular and underlying principles of copyright law in general these cases repres ent the application of anticircumvention principles to access cont rol technology in broader market of consumer goods in both cases court of appeals read the restrictions on circumvention more narrowly than the interp retation asserted by the plaintiff placing the initial burden on the plaintiff to establis h not just the fact of circumvention but its wrongfulness as well in both cases the courts strove to reconcile existing copyright law principles of fair use w ith the newer indepe ndent constraints on circumvention while these decisions may allay some of the dmcas critics concerns regarding anticircumvention and fair use the facts before the courts ensures that they cannot define the outer limits fo r the use of access control technology as means to assert control over durable goods
