only just begun to realize the impact of the digital revolution most realize that continued improvements in technolo gy will enhance mission planning rehearsal and execution the issue is that the army must concurrently establish doctrine and tactics techniques and procedures to aid training to achieve those enhancements one way the army can minimize the ffect of spiraling digital hardware and software changes and the effects of personnel transition is to enable information flow among soldiers units installations institutions and developers information flow will maximize the learning curv and capitalize on lessons learned using the same concepts that digitization brings to the battlefield materiel combat doctrine and training developers in conjunction with digital units must network information collaborate on objectives and insure i nformation is readily accessible to insure situational awareness quick access to an updated centralized information reference source is essential for institutional training new equipment training sustainment training and employment of the army ba ttle command system with its supporting sensors and communication systems that are integral to the digitized force this abcs smart book is one such source of centralized information with many internal references that will enable the reader to further acc ess relevant information by topic 12 overview abcs enhances the basic functions that staffs and subordinate leaders perform in support of the commander provide information make estimates make recommendations prepare plans and orders supervise execution f decisions abcs brings more information to the decision cycle that must be filtered fused and focused by commanders and staffs into battlefield visualization and situational understanding the commander uses this visualization and understanding t apply combat power to achieve situational dominance abcs is faster real time means of exchanging information abcs push and pull information provides more accuracy than previous capabilities and emphasizes multi echelon collaboration and empha sizes physical coordination it creates need for technical staff competence in addition to tactical proficiency collaboration decreases the planning time for the mdmp process facilitates abbreviated and accelerated decision making processes and inc reases time for rehearsal and execution allowing combat units to operate inside the threats decision making cycle and act react faster than he can page 2 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii abcs also enables the commanders and staffs to conduct execution decision making by facilitating transm ission and understanding of the commanders intent and by rapid coordination across echelons and to the platform level for execution of planned or realized branches and sequels to the basic plan with digitization the commander and his staff have at thei r disposal complex array of sensors and collection platforms data sources and globally distributed expertise dynamically updated and integrated models of the battlefield situation and rich variety of automated planning and decision aids these info rmation resources are connected to highprecision weapons and highly maneuverable small unit forces networked in distributed real time information environment success depends on being able to leverage this information environment to

software architecture significant software development and integration effort is ongoing to enhance abcs as it evolves from its current baseline version 62x in july 2001 provides new and enhanced capabilities from the previous version 6 2 go towar package software continues to evolve through multiple enhancements called patches this accounts for the x in the version title for this overview only the main features that are expected to translate across versions will be address ed software architecture software architecture enhancements in abcs focus on finalizing abcs server allocation optimizing client server operations integrating embedded battle command ebc to achieve i nteroperability with lower echelon systems and providing the common tactical picture ctp capability version 62x focuses on continuity of operations and other aspects resulting in an abcs that is warfightable trainable and sustainable significant to the user are new procedures for disseminating data and increased computing speed for accessing data and graphics b ebc abcs integration the objective of this effort is to ensure that force xxi battle command brigade and below applications systems and ebc abcs applications and subsystems can exchange joint variable message format jvmf messages both multicast and unicast jvmf message exchange capabilities are included in version 62x as well as other enhancements to inc lude implementation of communications message processor c communications media the movement of large quantities of digital information across the battlefield places an enormous demand on the radio bandwidth available in the tactical environment while the use of techniques such as bit oriented messages and data compression increases efficiency of the electronic spectrum these techniques alone will not provide the flexibility and effectiveness required of the communications architecture consequently the digital divisions will employ the warfighter information network win for communications two of the major components of win are the tactical internet and the win tactical win t within the win archite cture the is used at brigade and below and at mobile entities at higher headquarters that use single channel ground airborne radio sincgars or the enhanced position location radio system eplrs for data exchange the win t system is sim ilar to the internet used on home pcs the user simply enters the destinations for traffic and transmits without having to switch frequencies or worry about the type of transmitter similar to the commercial internet the win infrastructure resolves this issue and swiftly transmits the information to its proper destination several improvements are being made relative to win nonrouteable gateways have been replaced with routable interface devices ultimately digital divisions will have ne integrated win where user applications will be optimized in effect information can go directly from any abcs bos user host to any other abcs bos user page 9 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii d integrated systems control key to the success of digital divisions is the availability of ne twork management capabilities including tools to

ii d command and control registry c2r the c2r is established based upon the ldif lightweight directory access protocol data interchange format think of the ldif as master network plan if all users are not using the same version of the plan the system will not work thus it is critical during the planning phase that network users document to their s6 and g6 all possible locations where their workstations could possibly be located during the operation the ldif is burned on the computer hard drive brick based on the network plan developed by the g6 basicall it is the map of all the computers in the network and what subnet they belong to each subnet is assigned block of ip addresses to be used statically and dynamically the abcs server and other network devices will be assigned static ip address ll abcs workstations clients will be dynamically assigned ip addresses by the abcs server as they affiliate with the network any computer on subnet may act as the server note it is important when bringing up the network that the designated rver comes up first because the first system to affiliate with the router becomes the server thus if system that was intended to be client is initialized with the network before the server it will be given the server ip and assume the role of abcs server there is also merit in dictating toc bootup plan to facilitate affiliation time each system will receive the same ip address it had before if it boots in the same order once system affiliates with the network and abcs server the ip addre ss and other configuration information it receives will be stored in its c2r if the system being initialized has previously any unused ips in subnet remains for use by any system but will appear as originally labeled eg csscs 4idalocxxx even

potential ip address conflict could occur if the computer system c2r was not previously purged in abcs version 62x this is done by selecting yes to the do you want to reconfigure question the system asks during system initialization once yes has been selected the operator will then have to properly ans wer series of logic questions to purge the c2r when this is complete the system will continue to initialize if computer needs to make an unplanned move from one subnet to another there are two ways to do it field expedient the most field exped ient way is to assign the abcs workstation an unused ip address system identification that is already in the ldif for example you wish to move csscs workstation from its current planned for subnet to different unplanned for subnet the other bnet does not have any spare csscs ip addresses available but does have spare asas address available asas 4id plans3 you would assign your csscs box the asas address it would now appear to the network as an asas box it will still function as c sscs box but must be addressed by its asas short title thus all users on the network will need to be notified of this anomaly and adjust their message handling tables mhts as necessary update ldif update the ldif on every computer in the netwo rk not just the affected subnet additionally you must update every network router and switch configuration page 14

database jcdb the jcdb provides repository of c2 reference information c2r commonly known as the address book embedded battle command ebc is the blue sa data source for the toc server as well as the bottom up feed for red sa data the toc server feeds blue sa to the jcdb and routes red spot reports to the asas correlated red sa is then pulled from asas by the toc server t he toc server incorporates red sa into the jcdb and provides blue and red data over win t to all battalion and above cps f embedded battle command ebc and situational awareness data ebc sends and receives situational awareness data and c ommand and control data to and from the tocs including asas ebc is or will be hosted on all the toc bfa systems but is only started on whichever bfa happens to be the toc server the primary function of ebc is to provide communications path to nd from the fbcb2 systems for situational awareness sa data the current red and blue pictures fbcb2 systems are used on most army vehicles to send and receive situational awareness data to and from the tocs just as ebc does except that the corps div bde asas function stores c2r address book list of all ips assigns ips to

input and send function whereas ebc automatically draws and sends information to the tocs and fbcb2s from the jcdb ebc red situational awareness data process hosted on asas called the red sa client is used to send the red situational data from asas unit equipment data in the asas consolidated database ascdb to the ebc the ebc receives the data and reformats it into jvmf data message the jvmf data is then broadcast to all fbcb2 systems in the same brigade as the ebc the fbcb2 operator uses the current enemy interoperability message to send ascdb data to ebc automatically and may also use the enemy interoperability message from the map to send enemy data interactively ebc blue situational awareness data ebc is also the method by which the blue situational data is received in the toc blue data which consists mostly of location reports is sent from the fbcb2 systems to the ebc on the toc server ebc forwards the blue situational data to two servers in the toc both located on the toc server system only called the blue agent and the live feed server the blue agent receives blue updates from ebc at approximately 5 minute intervals and posts the data to the jcdb the data is then moved around to oth er toc systems using database replication mechanism the user can view the blue jcdb data using ctp overlay explorer filters the live feed server receives updates from ebc at approximately 15second intervals live feed server updates can be received by all toc bfa systems by starting live feed client process the live feed client automatically creates an overlay explorer overlay for live feed and the user will see blue updates automatically posted to jmtk ctp overlay explorer howeve r live feed is not posted to the jcdb the user starts the blue agent live feed server

essence of digita l c2 is the ability to transmit and receive valid useable data digital c2 rehearsal dc2r facilitates verification that abcs is working as planned it provides formal structure to comex simex that normally takes place prior to ctc rotatio n or simulation exercise it is phased operation that tests message threads and abcs collaborative functionality it also checks to ensure that simulation drivers if used are properly passing sa messages to abcs so that the player unit gets proper combination of live feed simulated feed and wrap around to create the common operational picture cop dc2r enables the unit to achieve its communication objectives in particular the dc2r achieves the following objectives the systems and the network are operational operators have correct edi edc settings operators know how to perform the individual communication tasks leaders understand the flow of information the dc2r product is series of spreadsheets and checklists developed by ach system tsm during the jcf 2000 train up to accomplish the above it aids the systematic review of messaging checks the example dc2r product is an updateable example based on abcs 62 and is available for

introduction the principles of command and control do not change with digitization commanders still plan direct and control the operations of their unit digital capabilities however allow the commander to receive timely more accurate information enhancing his ability to visualize the battlefield and make well timed battlefield decisions digital systems allow the same information to be accurately shared across echelons fm 3 0 operations defines this aggregate of shared information as the common operational picture common operational pi cture cop is an iden tical operational picture shared by more than one commandthe cop facilitates collaborative interaction and real time sharing of information between commanders and staffs command and control c2 fuses information from variety of sources while infor mation systems infosys facilitate its rapid distribution in u sable displays the commander must also remember that the cop represents both known and estimated information and that human input may flaw the cop people create information in the digital environment but digital monitoring systems also routinely create it and computers almost exclusively store it it is processed by machines into organized and categorized data and then further processed by people when they retrieve it for specific need when maintained the information becomes the newest source of information immediately available throughout the force the most radical improvement digital c2 provides over an analog environment is the increased situational awareness sa picture displayed with digital graphics sa overlays provide near real time view of the common operational picture cop through the use of dynamic data in joint common database atccs displays the data using software applicati on called the common tactical picture ctp the ctp displays terrain database map friendly blue icons reported enemy unit red icons and geo referenced messages bridges obstacles nbc contamination etc fbcb2 similarly maintains com mon operational picture via dynamic georeferenced messaging among fbcb2 systems and analyzed data update messages from the atccs systems 22 the common operational picture facilitates understanding situational awareness the term situational awareness is frequently used to describe having knowledge or being aware of battlefield activities and situations it can be most simply defined as soldier knowing where he is on the terrain where friendly forces are and where the enemy is one of the key benefit s of digital c2 systems is having this information displayed on screen with the terrain and friendly force array depicted with high degree of accuracy enemy information is portrayed to the fidelity relative to the effectiveness of the intelligence c ollection operation and associated reporting it is depiction of the battlefield it is what is but not what will be or what has to be done it page 18 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii is scientific aspect of control the commander

mixing digital science and bos art 25 digital support to creating maintaining and leveraging the cop the difference between an analog cop and digital cop is that in digital environment all digital cps draw on common set of information available within shared database to create th portion of the cop that shows what respective commanders want to know to fight the battle an analog cop is limited to the content of the reports received from higher and subordinates and limited by the time required to receive and correlate the inf ormation digital systems allow staffs to spend more time analyzing data than gathering data digital information systems infosys minimize the time and effort commanders spend assimilating information and developing understanding they do this by improved page 20 of 42

visual form tailored to the needs of the user digital syst ems convey the cop for decision making and exercising c2 functions digital displays should be meaningful images rather than simply masses of data the battle staff uses standard formats to organize each display and to allow the viewer or reader to know where to look for information information is stored manipulated and disseminated quickly via digits 26 joint common database jcdb the jcdb is family of products developed to efficiently store and distribute data shared by two or mo re abcs systems it is physical database that allows atccs to access identical information to achieve cop the jcdb is designed for intra toc and inter bos communications over cable or wireless lan two major functions of the jcdb are to store and disseminate dynamic changing unit information and battlefield geometry page 21 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii dynamic unit information blue and red sa in order to understand the ctp you must understand the way that sa is created and managed friendly positions or blue sa are automatic each fbcb2 platform derives its location from the enhanced position location reporting system eplrs or its attached precision locating gps receiver plgr and disseminates its position over the blue sa red sa and geo referenced messages generated at the tactical level are received via the tactical internet through the toc server and displayed by the ctp in the cp c2 messages also flow through the toc server and are routed to the app ropriate addressees red sa is result of soldier input spot or contact engagement reports generate red icons that are disseminated across the asas can also provide red sa from numerous sensor sources achieving cop begins at the platform level as users set up their fbcb2 filters there ar filters that apply to the users own system blue and those that apply to how the user sees other friendly platforms there are also red filters that depict how red icons will be viewed filters allow the user to set the icons overlays labels and geo referenced graphics that are displayed as part of the overall sa picture filter settings are driven by mett tc the brigade s3 should dictate sa filter settings to all units under operational control attached or assigned in order to achieve common battlefield picture more information on settings and managing blue and red sa is in the fbcb2 section red sa settings digital enemy c2 spot and contact engagement reports are usually input at the company and b elow level fbcb2 it is critical to pass spot reports via fbcb2 because this creates an enemy icon transmitted within the fbcb2 network the report from fbcb2 should only describe numbers of personnel and equipment senders should not annotate whet her or not the element is squad platoon company etc the sender will address the report to the s2 at battalion or if member of the brigade recon troop or strikers to the brigade s2 the spot report typical filter s ettings platform type time motion vehicle 5 minutes 100 meters aircraft 15 seconds 100 meters dismount 5 minutes 100 meters page 22 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii automatically creates red sa icons on the fbcb2 area network fbcb2 red sa is more timely and focused than asas disseminated sa therefore it should be displayed exclusively when monitoring the close fight operators may be too busy during the close fight to enter the s pot report if so the observer should notify the company cp or 1sg via fm to input the spot report it is not efficient to use the task force cp asas operator to enter spot reports it is too time consuming and the asas operator is monitoring the total red picture b dynamic battlefield geometry geometry can be input to the jcdb to populate the ctp as common view from any atccs system however the jcdb is currently unable to determine the difference between general geometries such as lines circl rectangles etc and actual geometries used by afatds to establish fire support coordination measures fscm fscm coordinated fire line restricted fire area etc triggers coordination requests in afatds during mission processing g eneral geometries do not cause any special processing they are simply displayed this is true even if the mcs operator assigns name to the geometry that implies it is an fscm an fscm created and named in mcs and applied to the jcdb ctp is still jus t general geometry area it will not trigger coordination request if the mcs operator wants to identify genuine fscm and have it established in the jcdb to cause coordination the afatds operator must enter it initially or re enter the data in afatd s specifying the appropriate geometry type nfa rfa fscl etc 27 common tactical picture application the ctp is common software application that allows commander to visualize the cop tailored to his preference and echelon the information disp layed is derived from dynamic vs static dynamic characterizes graphic information that when saved on one system transfers to the joint common database where it replicates to other jcdbs and systems that have accessed or will access the information changes to gr oups of information may be in part or as whole are exact on all systems and are automatically tracked at the lowest graphic symbol level with date time groups static characterizes graphic information that when saved remains on the system on wh ich it was saved when disseminated group of static information has means to remain updated other than by manual update by the receiver which may cause lose of common accuracy or by the sender resending the entire updated product for replacemen t requiring time and feedback to insure implementation page 23 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii cop information stored in the jcdb and system hard drive storage the purpose of the ctp is to display at each echelon the information necessary for the commander and his staff to view and obtain common understanding of the battl efield for purposes of command and control the cop is typically not just one ctp display but many each ctp display retrieves and displays both dynamic and statically stored information using large screen displays the commander is able to see several ctp displays showing much of the cop from various perspectives usually bos related the major portion of data displayed involves the red and blue dynamic sa data and graphic control measures stored in the joint common database jcdb the data is depicted on map overlays that can also be displayed throughout the toc and with other units higher lower and adjacent the major components of the ctp are system window the window that displays active situation maps on map view ctp overlay explorer window the graphic user interface gui window that manages the chart tabs overlays map objects and symbology tools for sit uation maps map areas user set map views that allow the commander and staff to quickly navigate around an active chart tab map areas are set to certain scale zoom and map center when recalled map areas facilitate tracking the battle and disposition page 24 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii of forces over broad area and overcome the limitation of system monitor of showing only small area with 150 250 resolution chart tabs digital m ap boards that display combined live feed input as well as situational sa and operational ops overlays various staff sections and units use chart tabs to display battlefield functional area information for planning and execution chart tabs are di splayed in the system window and are listed in the ctp explorer window although it is possible to display up to five chart tabs operators should limit their number as each chart tab requires system resources and slows system operation an alternative to multiple chart tabs is nested overlays by battlefield functional area on one chart tab static operational ops overlays overlays that contain static information they may contain battlefield graphical control measures but are best used to reflect planned or templated unit locations this overcomes the inability of the system to use dynamic unit icons for planning purposes in sa overlays ops overlays are analogous to digital acetate drops that change only when the system using them updates them currently the common message processor see below transmits only ops overlays sa overlays must be converted to ops when sent to fbcb2 via cmp fbcb2 transmits only ops overlays the plan manager function of ctp will send both sa and ops overlays to other atccs new feature of ctp called the gas gauge tracks the size of the overlay being created and provides visual red warning when the size exceeds fbcb2 reception dynamic situational awareness sa overlays overlays that are particularly useful for planning and execution they are best suited for battlefield graphical control measures sa overlays display dynamic objects that when saved replicate to other users based on system data dissemination settings this means that once another user accesses and posts the overlay all changes made by the originator will update automatically on the users system when monitored for size these graphics best suite both fbcb2 and atccs environments overlay editors allow an operat or to filter query the database for specific map objects that will then populate the ctp explorer window to produce the map view requested by the commander or staff palette bject and overlay editors are available plan manager folder used to group together all things associated with plan and to disseminate them to other systems currently the plan folder has limited dissemination and ops sa overlay storing capabilities it is the only means for disseminating sa overlays the pla n folder will send multiple ops and sa overlays but not nested overlays overlays are automatically posted to the available overlay window and are displayed with the plan tacsop conventions for the use of the plan folder should be established for na ming conventions and notification procedures to accurately track the overlays and graphics associated with sent plan folder plans are located only in the planned tab of ctp explorer the plan folder will allow storage of any number of objects that are associated with plan such as overlays task organizations oplan s opords and sync matrices only overlays within plan may be accessed within ctp folder containing the rest of the non overlay information is created on the system it has t he same name as the sent plan the page 25 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii folder is located in the systems oplan directory accessed through the my computer desktop icon 28 common operating environment message processor cmp the cmp is common software application that can be used in dif ferent ways depending on users needs it may be operated as central processor serving number of client systems on network or it may function as an integrated system component it may also be employed as set of stand alone tools it has two main functions inbound and out bound message and overlay processing additionally the cmp offers various support functions such as importing messages and overlays from external files into the common environment integrating message pre paration with lotus notes etc on the inbound side the software enables the user to process data from inbound messages and overlays and make it available to other users on the outbound side users create an address book that allows them to expedite ssage and overlay processing the atccs components of the abcs employ united states message text format usmtf messages to exchange information among the battlefield operating systems and supporting systems this message format is currently undergoing revision to joint variable message format jvmf see annex for usmtf and jvmf messaging information 29 collaborative tools netmeeting netmeeting is compatible with the sun forum application found in unix based systems it is accessed through co nference call the initiator notifies other computers by placing call through the placing call window each computer called will receive an invitation to join conference the features of netmeeting are whiteboard the whi teboard feature enables diagram information sketch capabilities and graphics display for discussion participants in meeting can either have view access or simultaneous draw and type access items can be copied and pasted from windows and other areas and applications from the desktop to the whiteboard the whiteboards tools can then be used to further illustrate the pasted objects whiteboard pages are synchronized by default if participant moves to another page all other participants will au tomatically see the new page as well whiteboard is an excellent tool to conduct digital rehearsals this tool is also useful in coa analysis digital rock drills and after action review sessions it may also be employed by commander to illustrate his intent to subordinate commanders and to receive back briefs share program to use the share program one computer needs to have the program so that all the participants can work on documents that are shared users ca n only work in file that they have control of this means only one person at time can work in the same document or file to allow other meeting participants to work on your shared computer click the allow control on the sharing dialog box addi tionally people can send and receive files to work on page 26 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii the share program is an excellent tool when time is of the essence the s3 can write the basic order and execute the share program all other staff sections can simultaneously write or update their annexes more than one program can be shared at time if you share windows explorer window such as my computer or folder on your computer you are sharing all explorer windows you have open also once you have shared such window every progra m you start while you are still in the meeting is also shared only the person who has the file open and shared is required to have the software program shared on their computer for example if the brigade s3 chooses to share power point presentation to subordinate battalion s3s for them to input their comments only the brigade s3 is required to have power point on his computer recommend that users do not select the share in true color check box true color causes program sharing to run slowly esp ecially if it is over dial up network connection chat feature this is similar to current chat programs available on personal computers multiple subscribers can communicate simultaneously the chat feature can be encrypted so t hat all meetings are private it is useful tool in gathering information quickly among echelon bos sections for an

part of their s op the following are some standardized procedures the brigade should execute before and maintain during digital operations creating and sending files to fbcb2 users must minimize the size of the files created and sent to or from fbcb2 to 576 bytes so they can be sent multicast see below this reduces transmission times normally brigade needs the task force tf operations overlays company overlays should be built on fbcb2 and merged to create consolidated tf ov erlays users will filter out graphics that are duplicated in other overlays to reduce clutter and transmission time create maneuver graphics in different colors and size according to echelon recommend each task force be depicted in standardized col or division graphics in black and brigade in blue this makes the overlay easier to follow the following recommended method will ensure the overlays stay small and manageable brigade sends the division and brigade overlay to the tf the tf opens the overlay saves it as the same reference name and keeps it displayed on their screen creates battalion overlay adding their operations graphics but prior to saving it filters out the graphics from brigade saves its battalion ove rlay with standardized naming convention and sends both brigade and tf overlays to the company cps company cp opens each overlay and saves it separately reopens both overlays and keeps them visible while building c urrent operations overlay before saving the overlay with company standardized reference name the company filters out both tf and brigade graphics so the overlay shows only company graphics this reduces duplication and keeps the overlay ma nageable page 30 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii forwards each echelon overlay to the platoon leaders and sergeants sends its current operations overlay to the tf s3 tf s3 receives all company overlays merges them as one and sends it to brigade brigade will have three tf overlays on the original brigade overlay b naming files save all overlays with the following naming format unit opord type overlay dtg for example save the engineer obstacle overlay 1bde 0022eng obstactual 190230aug00 note change the dtg with each update to ensure users post the most current version c creating the opord oplan the s3 primarily uses ms word to create the opord oplan once he creates the basic order he distributes and correlates it usin g the shared folder feature to the appropriate staff personnel and receives annexes in return and then distributes the opord oplan via cmp or the ctp send plan function d distributing the order the brigade s3 prepares overlays and order s using mcs and disseminates them using cmp recommend each cp maintain one atcc system to perform the function of digital library that way if subordinate systems lose files opords overlays etc the back up system can easily resend the information another way to distribute orders and other information is by using tactical internet web documents tocs use intranet web server capabilities for posting sharable information with the addition of this web server capabilit numerous documents are posted on the toc lan server and messages are sent to users notifying them of their availability it also minimizes bandwidth use because reports are available to be pulled from the server by users on an as needed basis as pposed to being broadcast in their entirety across the network toc lan availability should be part of sops see previous section on web documents digital vs analog it will be several years before the entire army will be digitally equipped cur rently not all platforms in the brigade are equipped with fbcb2 operations may require interface with units that do not have digital capabilities procedures need to be page 31 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii established for integration and success on the battlefield for both digital and nalog units operations some basic considerations fm and mse will be the primary communications mediums with the analog unit hard copy orders and graphics will be required never use blue sa to clear fires because not all platforms re digitally equipped graphical control measures will require the level of detail necessary to support operations of unit without sa in general this requires more control measures tied to identifiable terrain lno teams will be critical maps the advent of digitization does not mean that acetate and maps have use and will disappear maps remain the best tool at the platform level when maneuvering and fighting on the battlefield or for controlling tracking operations over large area the combination of map with digital sa and terrain database are ideal tools both will be required and extensively used digital lno team integration with analog units can be significantly enhanced by the use of digital liaison team the brigade staff structure contains 9 person liaison section of national guard soldiers its primary functions are receipt and transmission of orders and graphics via atccs receipt and transmission of intelligence data via asas provision of friendly and enemy sa to the analog unit using the abcs provided by the lno team manual creation of the analog unit blue and red sa and transmission back to the brigade fire support coordination and execution coordinat ion of actions between the two elements using appropriate communication systems extensive use of the web page to transmit digital data from abcs to analog units lno team with fbcb2 in some cases simply sending liaison am with fbcb2 can assist in integration for example tracking any small analog element in the brigade area can be aided by sending an fbcb2 equipped hmmwv to accompany the element this would be of great assistance to support elements that may be requir ed to go forward on the battlefield analog skills the staff must recognize that integrating an analog unit into the brigade requires retention of most of the analog control techniques in essence two control systems have to be in operation with particular attention paid to keeping the analog unit apprised of all of the pertinent information that is flowing digitally page 32 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii 33 prepare the brigade should include digital preparation as part of their procedures for deployment the follow ing are some recommended standard techniques the brigade should use to facilitate digital operations rehearsals rehearsing combat actions will continue to be an important part of preparing digital units for operations digital units like their ana log counterparts will execute traditional rehearsals to include combined arms and support fire support css etc rehearsals digital units have new techniques that may be used during rehearsals they have collaborative tools such as the whiteboard the battlefield video teleconference bvtc and application software such as the battle planning and visualization bpv concept demonstrator these digital tools provide units with new rehearsal techniques in addition to the analog techniques listed in fm 101 5 b precombat checks pcc as with analog operations digital pcc are critical to ensure coordinated mission accomplishment pcc help eliminate confusion and uncertainty on the battlefield resulting in timely decisions at all echelons in orde r for digital operations to be effective soldiers and leaders must instinctively know the correct response at the correct time some pre combat checks that will assist in digital preparedness and operations are rehearse digital calls for fire and miss ion threads calculate digital cffs that are mett t driven using the quick send button is the optimal way to initiate planned cff the button can immediately send the cff when the enemy hits his trigger point perform digital communications check by sending free text message flow with an operator response or requirement by the receiver this is covered in the dc2r take two loaded hard drives to the field all systems asas operators should map the drive floppy disk drive before deploying to the field so the drive is useable the brigade s3 should create and save terrain index reference system tirs data before deploying the brigade commander and s3 are responsible to define the overlays map data and sa filters they want displayed in order to have effective coordination this should be sop verify the brigade is knowledgeable and complies with standardized filter settings give standardized settings to opcon units asas operators must go into their nemy interoperability destination screen and turn on ebc in order for ebc to receive the red correlated picture if this does not occur fbcb2 will not receive the red correlated picture the brigade cp has dynamic ip addressing this means ip addresses are assigned consecutively as each system powers up in the cp if an atccs powers down and then back up again its ip address will change since the page 33 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii ip address is what links message to computer an ip address change can result in messag that do not arrive at the intended atccs the s6 should maintain list of all ip addresses in the cp 34 execute the commander or battle captain must be capable of rapid analysis of the tactical situation and able to make quick decisions the desired end state is the ability to make decisions more rapidly than the enemy to control the battlefield tempo in his area of operation ultimately dominating the enemy battle tracking monitoring one of the advantages of digital capabilities is the amount of information the commander and staff have to support their decision making process if staffs do not screen the amount of information provided the commander will reach information overload it is the commanders responsibility to determine specific ccirs for his staff this is especially crucial for new commander staff relationship with time and training the staff can anticipate the commanders requirements for more details see task 71 6522071 wt07 in st 20 1015abcs abcs 62x draft battle staff tasks available on the warrior t homepage httpfioasathoodarmymil b digital vs fm the decision on whether to use fm or digital communications depends on the situation and sops even though b oth systems are critical for effective c2 at the brigade and battalion level fm will remain the primary method for battle tracking at battalion and below level supplemented by the sa display provided by fbcb2 ebc and ctp some general co nsiderations can help guide the understanding of when to use which mechanism at what time fm will be the primary method of communications when elements are in contact throughout the task force and between task force and brigade before and following an engagement the staff and commanders will use digital systems for disseminating orders and graphics and conducting routine reporting during operations the staff will use combination of communications systems to report and coordinate with hig her and adjacent units staffs at brigade and higher echelons must remain sensitive to the difficulty and danger of using digital systems when moving or in contact and not expect digital reports under those conditions c other communications and battle tra cking guidelines managing red sa the fbcb2 spot report picture can be altered network wide once spot report has been sent digitally the originator company level leaders and battalion level page 34 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii and higher leaders can modify or delete the location of sp ot reports it is important that subsequent modifications to or deletions of spot reports when the enemy is destroyed or contact is lost are sent out digitally otherwise the common red picture will become cluttered and possibly misleading ideally the initial observer is responsible for keeping the report and its associated icon updated until the enemy is either destroyed or handed off to another observer it is important to understand what the asas intelligence picture adds to the existing ene my sa already generated by fbcb2 if not properly managed it can cause the screen to appear to have duplicates and cause confusion to avoid this the fbcb2 user has the option to display the fbcb2 red sa picture the asas picture or b oth generally before mission starts the asas picture should be displayed this provides complete enemy picture of the total battlespace when mission begins users should rely on the realtime fbcb2 spot reports as they are more focused and mely unit sop should be to display the fbcb2 spot reports and dictate pre defined times or onorder to look at the asas feed for the correlated picture recommended enemy filter settings as with blue sa the brigade should standar dize red sa filter settings to achieve common operational picture the red sa settings should be based on the type of operation the enemy is executing if the enemy is in the offense dynamic operation the stale and purge settings shou ld be shorter this provides truer enemy picture and prompts users to frequently update spot reports if the enemy is in the defense static operation settings should be longer use of fm radios initial contact at any echelon within the task forc should be reported on fm voice digital enemy spot reports should be entered by designated platform cp or 1sg to generate red sa elements moving about the battlefield not in command posts will use fm voice unless they can stop and g enerate digital message or report emergency logistical requests especially medevacs should be initiated on fm voice with follow up digital report if possible combat elements moving or in contact should transmit enemy spot reports on fm voice their higher headquarters should convert fm reports into digital spot reports to generate sa calls for fire on targets of opportunity should be sent via fm voice users assigned to maneuver task force will send their cff to the battalion fse that is in thei r uto users assigned under direct brigade control for example brt and strikers will send their cff to the brigade fse do not send the cff to both fses obstacle and nbc 1 reports should be sent initially by voice followed by digital reports to gener ate geo referenced sa message portraying the obstacle or contaminated area across the network digital actions page 35 of 42 prepared for dcx ph ii planned calls for fire from fists in the initial part of an engagement should be sent digitally routine logistical reports and requests shou ld be sent digitally routine reports from subordinates to task force prior to and following combat should be sent digitally orders plans and graphics should be sent digitally accompanied by an fm voice call to alert recipients that critical information is being sent to them additionally the transmitting element should request verbal acknowledgement of both receipt and understanding of the transmitted information by an appropriate soldier usually not the computer operator 35 digital command post tt p the digital cp processes an overwhelming amount of information the commander and staff must manage this data to prevent information overload and develop
