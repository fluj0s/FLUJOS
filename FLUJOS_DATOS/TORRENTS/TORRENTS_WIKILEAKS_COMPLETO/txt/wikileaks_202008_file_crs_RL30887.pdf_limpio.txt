pearson v shalala lawsuit filed by supplement manufacturer s who challenged fdas general health claims regulation of supplements and deci sion not to authorize four specific health claims the us court of appeals held that the first amendment does not permit the agency to reject health claims that it determines to be potentially misleading unless fda also reasonably determines that disclaimer would eliminate the potential deception the court directed the ag ency to reconsider the four claims and fda has since allowed two claims with qualifiers the federal trade commission ftc issued an advertising guide for the supplement industry in 1998 ftc addressed such issues as identifying claims and interpreting their meaning claim substantiation and related issues to ensure its enforcement efforts are as consistent as possible with the provisions of dshea and its enabling laws on an international level the uns codex alimentarius has initiated an effort to provide standards and

agencies responsible particularly the food and drug administr ation fda within the department of health and human services oversight of this legislation is likely to be an issue for the 107th congress background following passage of the nutrition beling and education act of 1990 nlea pl 101535 the dietary supplement indus try had number of concerns about the impact of nlea implementation on s upplement products nlea was the comprehensive legislation requiring nutrition labeling on most food products including dietary supplements and allowing nutrient content and health claims to be made on food products if certain relatively strict criteri were met the law required that information on specific nutrients be listed on food bels regardless of whether the nutrients were present while dietary supplements were regu lated under the category of food certain nlea provisions were likely to prove ina ppropriate or impractical for compliance by supplement manufacturers for exampl the nutrition facts panel on the food label required the listing of several nutrients rarely present in many supplements such as protein fat and carbohydrate wh ich would appear with zeros as the amount contained in the products this requireme nt would take up considerable space on the relatively small supplement packages at the same time many nutrient and herbal ingredients that were present would not be allowed to be listed on the nutrition facts panel because they were not on the govern ments list of nutrients with recognized consumption standards for claims the strict criteria that the act specified for either nutrient content or health claim to be made were expected to be virtually impossible for supplement manufacturers to meet both types of cl aims required prior authorization by fda through the use of petition process before they were allowed to appear in product labeling health claim was allowed only if the agency determined that there was significant scientific agreement based on the totality of the publicly available evidence that relationship exists between nutrient and the risk of disease nlea gave fda the discretion to determine whether supplements should make health claims under the same standa rd and procedure as conventional foods the agency determined that the same st andard and procedure for maki ng health claims should behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30887crs2 1

were contained in both types of products however there is dearth of peerreviewed literature on the relationship between most supplement ingredients and health conditions that might be used to support health claims finally nlea listed 10 nutrient and di sease relationships that fda was to review for possible authorization as health claims prior to passage of the act fda had proposed regulations for six of the 10 re lationships listed in the act for review the additional four relationships concer ned supplement ingredients folate zinc omega3 fatty acids and antioxidants whic h were added to the act at the request of the supplement industry when fda reviewed the 10 relationships it initially authorized six claims and has since authorized total of 13 health claims for food products the agency initially did not author ize the four claims that were specific to dietary supplements since then the health claim for folate has been authorized along with fortification requirement for folate in certain foods the other three claims continue to be reviewed by the agency see discussion of the pearson case below in april 1991 thenfda commissioner ke ssler convened an fda dietary supplement task force to examine the i ssues regarding dietary supplements and develop regulatory framework for these products that would best serve the public health the task force was established following fdas ban of the amino acid l tryptophan after nearly 1500 cases of illne ss and 39 deaths were allegedly caused by use of this supplement product1 the task force considered such issues as how to ensure the safety of supplements limit th potential for fraud and ensure that the marketing of supplements did not act as disincentive for drug development in its final 1992 re port to the commissioner the task force concluded that safety should be the overriding concer n for fda in developing regulatory framework for this class of products2 specific recommendations included regulatory changes for vitamin and minerals ami acids and other products regulated as supplements and number of crosscuttin g issues such as good manufacturing practices purity and identity bioavailability consumer education

products that were formulated nd used as either drugs or food additives the supplement industry viewed the ingredie nts in their products as having had long history of use similar to many food in gredients that were viewed as safe and therefore not needing the type of safety testing required for food additives and drug ingredients congressional action since 1992 ultimately the issues of nutrition labeling claims and safety led to the passage of dshea in 1992 congress passed th dietary supplement act pl 102571 which prohibited the secretary of the partment of health and human services from implementing the provisions of nlea th at affected dietar supplements the only nlea provision allowed to be imp lemented for supplements was the one concerning authorized health claims th 1992 act also required that several reports be prepared for congress in preparation fo r subsequent legislation these provisions included report prepared by fda that reviewed the agencys enforcement priorities and practices for supplements4 report prepared by the general accounting office that reviewed the manageme nt activities of fda relate d to supplements compared to other products regulated by the agency5 report prepared by the office of technology assessment that reviewed th relationship between the regulatory systems affecting the development and sa of dietary supplements and health outcomes uncompleted and report pr epared by the library of congress that reviewed the efforts of industrialized nati ons to regulate the manufacture and sale of supplements and the effect of these regulatory efforts on human health6 the rationale for these reports was the percep tion that fda had taken disproportionate amount of regulatory action against supplem ents compared to the other products that it regulated and that the re gulation of supplements in other industrialized countries was seamless process that provided lessons that congress might consider for adoptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30887crs4 7 giorgianni health food stores plan protest day the hartford courant june 18 1993 p d8 8 congressional statement of agreement on dshea dietary supplement health and education act of 1994 pl 103417 140 congressional record october 7 1994 s 14801before the four reports requested in the 1992 act were completed however congress passed dshea in 1994 the di etary supplement industry had through health foods stores and ot her retail outlets promoted successful grassroots campaign to get consumers to sign letters to members of congress seeking support for dietary supplement legislation in ex change consumers were offered discounts on supplement product purchases7 the letters sought relief from the presumed threat that fda was going to ban certain supplem ents and require prescriptions for any supplements left on the market some s upplement retailers staged black mondays where they draped certain supplements in black and refused to sell them on given day in an effort to convince consumers to sign the form letters reportedly thousands of letters were received by each congressional office as result of this campaign there is evidence that fda at that time had plans either to ban most dietary supplements or require prescriptions for their use nor did the agency have the authority or resources to implement such policy while numerous bills on dietary supplemen t regulation were introduced in the 103rd congress bills introduced in th house hr1709 nd senate s784 by congressman bill richardson and senator orrin hatch respectively became the focus of debate there was considerab debate before the act was passed by unanimous consent in both chambers in addition congressional statement of agreement entered into the congressional record for october 7 1994 stated that there would be other reports or statements considered to be legislative history for the bill8 decision which appears to have complicated implementation of the act provisions of the bill are addressed below in the section on implementation implementation of dshea the implementation of dshea has been piecemeal process because of the diverse provisions in the act discussion in this section is in the chronological order in which the promulgation of regulations for the provisions was completed rather than the order of the provisions in the ac t for more information on dshea see crs report 94965 dietary supplement health and education act pl 103417 archived available upon request from crs definitions the act defined dietary supplement for the first time as meaning product other than tobacco inte nded to supplement the diet that contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients vitamin mineral an herb or other botanical an amino aci d dietary substance for us by humans to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake or concentrate metabolite constituent extract or combinations of any ingredient described above the definition further provides th at supplement is product that is intended for human ingestion as tablet capsule powder soft gel gelcap liquid or some other form is not represented for use as conventional food or as sole item of meal in the diethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30887crs5 and must be labeled as dietary supplem ent product marketed as dietary supplement cannot have been on the market as new drug or biologic prior to being marketed as dietary suppl ement or food finally the act specifically excluded dietary supplement or its ingredients from the definition of food additive implementation because this section of dshea provided specific language defining dietary supplement fda did not promulgate regulations instead the agency adopted the language from the act directly into its regulations safety prior to dshea fdas primary safety standard for dietary supplement was whether it failed the general food safety standard ie that it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health under dshea the safety standard itself was amended so that supplement or dietary ingredient was to be considered unsafe if it presented significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury under the conditions of use recommended or suggested in labeling or under ordinary c onditions of use new dietary ingredient for which there is inadequate information to provide assurance that it does not present significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury would be considered unsafe in situations where the secretar declares that an ingredient poses an imminent hazard to public health or safety the department must promptly follow the declaration with statement th at either affirms or withdr aws the declaration the act placed the burden of proof of showing that dietary supplement is unsafe on the us government rather than on the manufacturers before the secretary may report to the department of justice that supplemen t is unsafe for civil proceedings the individual against whom the proceeding will be initiated is to be given at least 10 days notice and opport unity to present both oral and written views before the proceedings begin implementation because this section of dshea provided specific language on the safety standard procedures for re gulatory action and the burden of proof of safety for supplements fda did not prom ulgate regulations instead the agency adopted the language from the act directly in to its regulations proving significant and unreasonable risk to health after it is on the market is considerably more difficult than demonstrating that product or its ingredients ar safe in controlled situations prior to marketing placi ng the burden of proof on the agency to demonstrate that marketed supplement is unsafe was significant departure from the policy for other fda regulated pr oducts for which the manufacturer must demonstrate safety before they are allo wed on the market additionally resources were provided to the agency to implement this provision there is requirement for safety or efficacy testing of dietary s upplement ingredients that have been on the market since before dshea passage ther efore there is database on which to determine whether problems that seem to or are alleged to arise from the use of certain supplements are rious problem or anticipated side effect on which the agency could base its deter mination that supplement or ingredient may be unsafe withdrawal of anpr dshea declared the june 18 1993 anpr null and void and of force or effect the act required fda to publish notice

ig released its findings and recommendations on fdas adverse events reporting system for dietary supplements and its effectiveness as consumer protection tool48 the report finds that fdas adverse

the aers that are collected in addition fda lacks vital information to ad equately assess sign als of possible public health concerns generated by the aers system which is limited by lack of clinical information on both safety studies and consum er use the ig determined that as result of the dearth of information in all aspects of the aers system fda rarely takes safety actions the ig recommendations included facilitating greater detection of adverse events by requiring supplement manufactur ers to report serious adverse events to fda the ig also said the agency s hould obtain the poison control centers aers for supplements and health professionals and consumers need to be better informed about the aers system for supplements second recommendation was to obtain more information

manufacturers and their products to be registered with fda notify manufacturers when fda receives serious aer emphasize to health profe ssionals and consumers the im portance of providing way to

document on guidelines for vitamins and mineral products the committee is seeking comments on the preamble and other changes to the guidelines until the next session meeting scheduled for berlin in november 2002 the codex draft document on guidelines for vitamins and minerals reflects the concern of several governme nts about the current level of regulation of supplements in some countries if

the proposal for directive on food s upplements is part of package of measures being considered on food safety the european par liament and council of ministers have to agree for this directive to take effect if adopted the directive would become effective on may 31 2002 allowing the marketing of products complying with its provisions as of june 2002 and prohibiting the marketing of products
