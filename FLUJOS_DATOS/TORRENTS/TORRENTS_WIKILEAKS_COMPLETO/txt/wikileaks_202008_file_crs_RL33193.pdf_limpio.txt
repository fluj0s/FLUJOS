supreme court addressed the issue of public holiday displays in two separate cases in the 1980s in lynch v donnelly the court applying the lemon test2 held that citys holiday display did not violate

reindeer pulling santas sleigh candystriped poles christmas tree carolers cutout figures representing such characters as clown an elephant and ddy bear hundreds of colored lights large banner that read seas ons greetings and creche or nativity scene4 the court concluded that the city had not impermissibly advanced relig ion by erecting the display and including the creche had not created excessive entanglement between religion and government5 in later case county of allegheny v amer ican civil liberties union the court did strike down the display of crech in city and county owned

of menorah and christmas tree with sign saluting liberty outside the building noting that these display items had secular as well as religious significance and could not therefore be construed as endorsi ng either religion7 in 1999 judge alito writing for the third circuit held that jersey city holiday display was indistinguishable in any constitutionally significant respect from the displays upheld by the supreme court in lynch and allegheny 8 judge alito noted that the jersey city display resemb led the display upheld in lynch in several important respects among them the inclusion of religious and s ecular symbols and secular signs or banners9 the only notable difference in the two di splays was that the display upheld in lynch was on private property while the jersey city display was on public land judge alito found that the supreme court did not attribute constitutional signif icance to the fact that the display in lynch was on private property therefore the fact that the jersey city display was on public land does not in itself provide valid basis for holding the display to be unconstitutional10 similar case before the court two years ter was vacated and remanded after judge alito writing for the court found that the plai ntiffs lacked standing to challenge the display11 the opinion did not address the merits of the case religious expression in public schools with respect to religious expression in public schools the supreme court has addressed number of specific scenarios wit hout addressing the i ssue in broader terms consistently stating that these types of cases are very fact specific judge alitos written opinion in this area concerned the distri bution of materials from religiousbased organization by the school along with mate rials from nonreligious organizations the supreme court has not addresse d this issue specifically but has held that students have legal right to meet together in school f acilities for religious purpos on the same basis as they may meet together for other noncurricular purposes12 and that outside religious groups cannot be discriminated against in th afterschool use of school facilities

constitutionality of excluding student religious publication from college program subsidizin g the printing costs of all other student publications the court held that the exclus ion of the student religious publication from the subsidy program amounted to viewpoint di scrimination in violation of the free speech clause of the first amendment14 the court also found that including the religious publication would not violate the establishment clause15 in 2004 judge alito writing for the third circuit issued an opinion rejecting school districts argument that it prohi bited religiousbased organization from distributing written materials at the school due to concerns about violating the establishment clause16 judge alito rejected the school districts contention that the materials being distributed w ould be considered school or government speech noting that the supreme court in rosenberger held that when school or other government body facilitates the expression of diversity of views from private sp eakers the resulting expression is private17 judge alito noted that while the supreme court has not settled the question whether concern about po ssible establishment clause violation can justify viewpoint discrimination the c ourt has rejected the position that the establishment clause even justifies much less requires refusal to extend free speech rights to religious speakers who participate in broadreaching government programs neutral in design18 judge alito also applied supreme court precedent regarding the endorsement test favored by justice oconnor the lemon test used in number of establishment clause cases and the coercion test favored in cases involving prayer in public schools19 under all of these tests judge alito determin ed that allowing the organizations flyers to be distributed by the school would not violate the establishment clausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33193crs4 20 see supra n 1 the second clause of the first amendment to the

clause20 cases for which judge alito wrote opinions generally address religious exemptions to generally pplicable laws when other exemptions are provided as with the establishment clause cases judge alito appears to consistently apply supreme court precedent in this area in employment division v smith 21 the supreme court held that the free exercise clause was not violated when state denied unemployment benefits to person who for religious reasons violated stat ban on use of the drug peyote22 the court held that the clause was not violated when the burden placed on religious practice was not the governments objective but an incidental effect of neutral and generally applicable law23 the court stated that the mere possession of religious convictions which contradict the relevant concerns of political society does not relieve the citizen from the discharge of political responsibilities24 thus the court conc luded such general laws will not be subject to strict scru tiny under the free exercise clause25 however in so doing the court did not overrule prior preced ent regarding the applicability of strict scrutiny analysis in other types of case26 after smith there are three types of cases where the court still requires compelling interest government actions that intentionally discriminate against religion denials of une mployment compensation to persons who lost their job due to conflict betw een their faith and requirement s of their job and in hybrid cases where free exercise claim is joined with another constitutional claim27 the court expanded on this

interest is required where laws fail to satisfy the smith requirements of neutrality and general applicability29 in 1999 the third circuit considered case regarding the constitutionality of newark police department policy prohibiting the wearing of beards by police officers absent medical condition that makes shaving painful30 judge alito writing for the court found that the policy violated the fr ee exercise clause of the first amendment because while the department made exemptions for medical reasons it did not provide justification for refusing to provide exemptions for religious reasons31 in his opinion judge alito discussed the supreme courts decisions in smith and lukumi and determined that the departments refusa l to make religious exempti ons should be reviewed under strict scrutiny32 judge alito cited passage from lukumi where the court stated that in circumstances in which individualized ex emptions from general requirement are available the government may not refuse to extend that system to cases of religious hardship without compelling reason33 the department argued that it had to allow medical exemptions under the americans w ith disabilities act but contended that religious exemptions were not required by w judge alito rejected this position noting that title vii34 imposed on employers duty to accommodate religious practices and found that the department failed to offer any interest in defe nse of its policy that is able to withstand any form of heightened scrutiny35 in 2004 judge alito wrote another opinion regarding religious exemptions from generally applicable laws in blackhawk v commonwea lth of pennsylvania judge alito agreed with lower federal court in finding that blackhawks free exercise rights were violated when the commonwealth of penns ylvania refused to exempt religiously motivated activities from the permit fee required by law to keep wildlife in captivity36 judge alito determined that since the co mmonwealth

articulated the standard for reviewing prison regulation challenged on constitutional grounds and requires the reviewing court to balance the inmates cons titutional claims with the administrative and security concerns of the prison see 482 us 78 1987nonreligious activities its re fusal to provide an exemp tion for religious activities involving wild animals would be subject to strict scrutiny analysis the commonwealth offered as justification an interest in reducing the number of wild animals held in captivity arguing that keeping such animals captive is inconsistent with state wildlife policy unless doing so provides tangible benef it for the states wild animals37 the court rejected this justification finding that the commonwealth had failed to define what constituted tangible benefit and thus determined that the commonwealth failed to provide sufficiently compelling justification for its refusal38 judge alito writing for the court determined that even if the commonwealths asserted interests were compelling the fee scheme was not narrowly tailored to further those interests since the policy in place does not categorically disfavor the keeping of wild animals in captivity39 opinions joined by judge alito the third circuit considered several other cases regarding the religion clauses of the first amendment while judge alito was on the bench these cases are

exercise43 in nelson v horn the third circuit in per curiam opinion vacated the district courts dismissal of an inmates retaliation and free exercise claims44 the court found that nelson should be allowed to go forwar d with his claims which were based on the parole boards requirement that he participate in religious based drug treatment program and subsequent denial of his parole when he refused to pa rticipate in such program religious expression in public schools in case involving the equal access act45 the third circuit found that the defendant board of education violated the act by refusi ng to certify the plain tiffs bible club as student organization and accord it equal treatment with other student groups46 the court found that east brunswick failed to close its limited open forum which it had created by allowing noncurriculum related student groups to meet on school premises since the school created such forum it could not di scriminate against clubs based on the religious content of the speech at their meetings and was therefore required to recognize the plaintiffs bible club and accord it equal treatment47 in american civil liberties union of ne w jersey v

borough on the plaintiffs free exercise claims52 the plaintiff argued that the borough violated its free exercise rights by intentionally impeding access to its tent revival meetings the court determined that the district court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants by focusing on the wrong issue specifically the court did not consider whether there was sufficient evidence to create material issue of fact regarding whether the defendants intentionally impeded the plaintiffs religious activity53 in an employment discrimination case th third circuit upheld the decision of the district court regarding whether state hospital had reasonably accommodated the religious beliefs and prac tices of staff nurse54 the nurse refused to participate in any procedure
