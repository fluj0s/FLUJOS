philip d murphy for reasons 14 b and d summary 1 c chancellor merkel achieved her goal of solid parliamentary majority for her christian democratic union cdu with its bavarian sister party the christian social union csu and the probusiness free democratic party fdp but will have to contend with selfconfident fdp that is likely to seek major concessions in terms of policy and personnel nonetheless the cducsus 338 percent showing was its lowest since 1949 while the fdps 146 percent was its strongest in the history of the federal republic the spd crashed while the left party and greens were able to score their highest results ever with the left party surpassing the greens overall and overtaking the spd in the eastern german states by wide margin merkel hopes that coalition negotiations with the fdp will be quick and decisive while fdp chairman guido westerwelle widely expected to be the next foreign minister has emphasized his intention to press for the partys goals of fundamental tax reform more emphasis on education and stronger protection of civil liberties merkel and westerwelle already met privately election night september 27 and coalition negotiations should begin soon most likely with the goal of having formal agreement with the selection of cabinet by the time the bundestag convenes month from now end summary overall trend major parties in decline 2 u the results show the decline of the major parties particularly the spd and the strengthening of fiveparty system preliminary results give cducsu 338 percent versus 352 percent in 2005 the fdp 146 percent 98 the spd 230 343 the left party 119 87 and the greens 107 81 the decline in the cducsu percentage is due particularly to the csus losses in bavaria where the party suffered its worst bundestag result ever at 426 percent down from 492 percent in 2005 but it still won all 45 of its constituencies these preliminary results give the cdu 24 surplus mandates because of the high number of constituency seats it won despite its low 338 percent second vote showing see reftel g 3 u the new coalition should end up with control of both the bundestag and the bundesrat upper council based on the preliminary official results the cducsu will have 239 seats in the bundestag up from 226 which along with the 93 fdp bundestag seats previously 61 would give the new government solid majority the spd will have 146 seats in the bundestag down from 222 the left party 76 versus 54 and the greens 68 versus 51 the schleswig holstein election on september 27 also appears to have given the cdu and fdp parliamentary majority in that state with cdufdp governments there and in saxony where the two parties won majority on august 30 the new cducsufdp coalition will soon have majority in the bundesrat and should be able to gain its approval of future coalition legislation 4 c chancellor merkel and her cducsu union are somewhat disappointed by their partys results but are publicly emphasizing that the cducsuspd grand coalition has met its demise and will be replaced by centerright coalition composed of the cducsu and fdp we achieved something fantastic said chancellor merkel now facing second fouryear term we achieved stable majority in germany for new governmentwe can party tonight but there is lot of work waiting for us an uncharacteristically emotional merkel clearly relieved by her victory promised to be the chancellor of all germans old and young entrepreneurs and workers and said the cducsu would be sufficiently dominant in the new coalition to prevail in questions that affect social balance 5 c despite her huge personal popularity however merkel led her cducsu union to its second poorest result in history leaving her vulnerable to future backstabbing within berlin 00001197 002 of 003 her party merkel while happy to be rid of the grand coalition with the spd now faces the challenging task of entering coalition with party that could prove to be more difficult to manage than the spd merkel will start talks with the fdp within days it could however take up to the end of october for the parties to forge the policy compromises and work out the distribution of cabinet posts necessary to seal coalition deal fdp the real winner 6 c the fdp will return to government after eleven years in opposition having achieved its best election results in the partys history its leader fdp party chairman guido westerwelle will most likely become germanys next foreign minister see reftel at the fdp election celebration westerwelle told his party faithful that we want to be part of the government but this means responsibility and we are ready to take on this responsibility westerwelle said his party would work to ensure that germany gets fair tax system and better educational opportunities and that civil rights would once again be respected the fdp will be in very powerful position to demand larger number of cabinet seats in new german government they are likely to expect to get at least the equivalent of what they have had in the past the foreign office either justice or perhaps interior which they led from 196982 economics or possibly finance and at least one other ministry in the past they have had education and economic cooperation ie development however the fdp will find it difficult to negotiate coalition agreement with the cducsu over the coming weeks especially in the areas of tax cuts see reftel f and civil rights including data privacy see reftel d spd hard road ahead 7 c it would be hard to exaggerate the dimension of the spd defeat the party fell more than 11 points to its worst result in the postwar period its share of the eastern german vote was 19 percent behind both the cdu and left party and the fdp came within striking distance of the spd in some western german states including bavaria where the spds 17 percent was just ahead of the fdps 15 percent the spd electionnight party was like funeral and steinmeier and spd party chairman muentefering appeared grimfaced to announce that steinmeier would be the bundestag caucus chairman and thus unofficial leader of the opposition to the new blackyellow government muentefering did not as many expected announce his resignation but it is likely to come by the time of the next party conference in midnovember 8 c exit polls show that the spd lost more than million votes to former supporters who simply stayed home and additional voters to the left party and greens and that the public still blames it for the changes in unemployment insurance and the retirement age enacted during the schroeder government and as part of the grand coalition the spd with only four ministerpresidents and shrunken parliamentary caucus will have to decide how to profile itself against its two fellow leftist opposition parties and the party left is likely to press for coalitions with the left and greens at the state level left overtakes greens 9 c the left party under oskar lafontaines and gregor gysis leadership can also claim electoral victory with their partys best showing ever in parliamentary election having won 119 per cent of the total vote and 20 direct mandates the largest number ever for one of the smaller parties it will be difficult for germanys other parties especially the spd to ignore the lefts steady rise in popularity in east and west germany see reftel b the party successfully stole the spds thunder and was partially responsible for the spds poorest showing ever in german election history the left party can now concentrate on achieving the ultimate prize in german politics in 2013 governing coalition with the spd and the greens berlin spd governing mayor klaus wowereit has already said that this years election must be the last one in which the spd excludes the possibility of cooperation with the left and he and other leftwingers in the spd will likely fight to bring the two parties closer together greens how to stay relevant berlin 00001197 003 of 003 10 c the greens may have celebrated their first double digit showing 107 per cent in parliamentary election but the party was unsuccessful in preventing blackyellow coalition or becoming the third strongest party in the bundestag see reftel party cochairman cem oezdemir who failed to win his direct mandate and was too low on the party list to win seat in the bundestag said that the greens would establish themselves as think tank for social issues and for germany as whole the spds disastrous electoral result will remind the greens that they may need to reach out to the cdu if they are to remain relevant political power for the foreseeable future oezdemir hinted that his party would concentrate on achieving good results at future state elections and plotting their return to power in 2013 comment 11 c chancellor merkels main campaign objective to attract centrist support by outpositioning the spd as the best protector of germanys social welfare state was successful although her cducsu union suffered losses primarily because of the csu she will now have to find way to balance this promise with fdp demands for greater reforms while dealing with the likely struggles between strengthened fdp and csu that is concerned about its continued decline the parties will now enter complex coalition negotiations with pressure to complete them by the time that the new bundestag convenes in late october these talks have the potential to be very contentious merkel will want to stamp her authority on the coalition agreement while westerwelle will be tough bargaining partner for merkel as he aims to extract the maximum amount of policy and personnel concessions from the cducsu finally as weakened spd moves into the opposition it can be expected that it will seek to continue the public debate on the major campaign issues and begin to rebuild itself process that could include its strong repositioning to the left 12 c what does cducsufdp victory mean for the united states on practical level germany will have new foreign minister most likely guido westerwelle who has enjoyed difficult relationship with the united states during his time spent in opposition see reftel d westerwelle will face steep learning curve at the mfa but we should not expect him to play second fiddle to chancellor merkel the foreign and security policy rivalry between the mfa and chancellery during the bush administration will not disappear indeed they may be enhanced with westerwelles attempt to profile and make an international name for himself as quickly as possible making it difficult for us to identify who is in the lead on any given issue chancellor merkel and westerwelle will be competing for attention the latters flamboyant and outgoing style may give him leg up but chancellor merkel will be keen to assert her primacy in international affairs especially on economic and eu matters she has more government and foreign policy experience that will come in handy in this future duel and in an age of international summitry the chancellor rather than the foreign minister calls the shots we should not underestimate her desire to carve out political legacy for herself especially in the international arena and her record of strong cooperation with washington suggests that her dominance is likely to have net benefit for us interests 13 u this cable was coordinated with consulates general duesseldorf frankfurt hamburg leipzig and munich murphy
