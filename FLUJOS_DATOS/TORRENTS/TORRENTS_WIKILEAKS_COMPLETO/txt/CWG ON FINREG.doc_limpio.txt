to implement ipsas by 1 january 2010 the one element impacting itu at this moment is the time it will take to negotiate contract with sap however even with this delay mr barr felt that we could still implement ipsas according to schedule 6 proposed amendments to the financial regulations and financial rules and the glossary of ipsas defined terms 61 mr ba then introduced documents wgrg167 and

66 the group noted the document with appreciation 7 preparation of the draft financial plan 71 mr barr presented for discussion document wgrg1610 which outlined issues to be considered during the preparation of the itu financial plan for 2012 2015 72 the major issues to be reviewed and determined in the financial plan are the level of income revenue expenditure expenses and the level and uses of the reserve account mr barr pointed out that pp resolution 158 speaks of the need to stabilize the itus financial planning process and the secretarygeneral intends to address this by fixing the level of the contributory unit at 318000 chf however the secretarygeneral intends to request that council approve zrg zero real growth budget and not be limited to zng zero nominal growth budget 73 as well the financial plan should deal with issues relating to the prioritization of itu activities and the need to fund certain long term needs such as the building capital fund and the afterservice health insurance fund 74 several delegates spoke of the role of the budget control committees of major conferences and assemblies and how they might play role in the prioritization of itu activities there was consensus that these committees should continue to work within their approved mandates taking into account in particular the financial responsibilities of conferences and assemblies as stipulated in article 13 of the constitution article 34 of the convention and number 4 of the resolves to instruct the secretary general and the directors of the three bureaux of resolution 72 rev antalya 2006 75 regarding the issue of the automatic use of excess reserve funds to finance activities there was agreement that the authorization of such uses was the role of council and such uses should be automatic 76 there was one request for separate report on the projected costs of façade repairs to the itu buildings mr barr agreed to prepare such report 77 one delegation agreed that after period of successive zero nominal growth budgets it was reasonable to assume that some influx of budget funds was necessary however the itu should continue to find efficiencies wherever possible and to also work harder at prioritizing the work 78 on the issue of increased revenue through mechanisms like cost recovery there was consensus that satellite network filing snf was not an area where revenue could be enhanced 79 one delegation noted that the secretariat was proposing changes in many areas the delegation urged that such efforts build on previous work and not start fresh so as to maximize the value of money already spent mr barr agreed that this would be the itu approach 710 on the issue of zng budgets there was agreement that the issue was not really zng or zrg budgets but rather the issue was the effective use of itu budgetary resources as approved by council 711 one delegation spoke of the need to strengthen the planning functions within itu as well there continued to be need to link the operational financial and strategic planning documents and cycles finally the secretariat must continue to find cost savings and efficiencies throughout the organization 712 mr barr thanked the delegates for their input and noted that their concerns would be reflected in future financial plan proposals 8 update of financial issues for pp10 81 mr barr presented for discussion document wgrg169 which outlines financial issues to be reviewed at pp10 the chair noted that in addition to the resolutions noted in the document resolution 66 and decision 5 would also have to be reviewed as well as wtsa resolution 71 admission of academia universities and their associated research establishments to participate in the work of itut and wtsa resolution 74 admission of sector members from developing countries in the work of itu t mr barr agreed and advised that this document was intended to allow feedback on these resolutions in advance of council document in 2010 82 with respect to resolution 72 the issue remains how best to link the operational financial and strategic planning processes of the itu mr barr noted that the secretariat continues to improve its work in this area especially the operational plans of the sectors and the general secretariat 83 where necessary in future as noted in the resolution there may have to be further changes in the itu financial regulations to facilitate improvements in this area there was discussion on this issue 84 with respect to resolution 91 regarding cost recovery for some itu products and services mr barr pointed out that itu uses the same management and policy framework for the various types of cost recovery activities within the organization in his view it would be better to separate the various business processes which result in the cost recovery activity and to design separate policy framework for each separate process delegations welcomed this approach but warned not to change the procedures for snf to which mr barr agreed 85 with respect to resolution 151 mr barr advised that the secretariat was continuing to review this issue and would be proposing improvements in the rbb model in time for council 2010 and pp10 the meeting welcomed this approach 86 with respect to resolution 158 mr barr advised that the secretariat was proposing to stabilize the itu planning process by fixing the level of the contributory unit at its current level although this was welcomed one delegation warned that this might prevent the itu from asking for and receiving inflationary increases in funding 87 mr barr also advised that the secretariat did not want to revisit the issue of increasing the minimum sector member fee this was also welcomed as one delegate advised that in the financial plan itu should not request avenues of approach which had been rejected in the past mr barr agreed with this approach 88 in closing this item several delegates thanked the secretariat for providing this information in timely and transparent manner several delegates felt that these issues should be further discussed at the regional pp preparatory meetings 9 other businessnext meeting 91 in lieu of holding an additional finregs meeting just prior to the council meeting in october the chairman requested that he and the secretariat be authorized to prepare an addendum to the report to council to reflect any additional information on the issues discussed at this meeting the purpose of the request was simply to facilitate the discussion at council by having the most uptodate information available the meeting agreed to this approach 92 the chairman indicated that the next meeting of finregs would likely be held early in 2010 in conjunction with the other meetings of the council
