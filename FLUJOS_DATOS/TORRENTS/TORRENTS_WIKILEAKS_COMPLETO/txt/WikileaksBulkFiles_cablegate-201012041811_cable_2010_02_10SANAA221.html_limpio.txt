of the london meeting and suggested that stability in yemen can be achieved only through dual focus on security and development he commended saleh on actions the royg has taken in recent weeks against aqap elements in yemen and assured saleh that he could count on continued operational support and intelligence sharing from the us president saleh said he was satisfied with counterterrorism ct assistance to date and with secretary clintons speech at the london conference but said he would like to be more satisfied in the future and appealed for the acceleration of additional support specifically citing helicopters and vehicles with iedjamming devices describing americans as hotblooded and hasty when you need us but coldblooded and british when we need you he asked for moderate blood temperature and measured approach note also present were deputy prime minister for defense and security rashad alalimi national security bureau director ali alanisi and political security organization pso director ghalib mutahir algamish with whom benjamin met separately after the conversation with the president end note 3 snf ambassador benjamin reiterated the usg desire to ensure

for sharing information on passengers traveling via air to and from yemen as well as foreign nationals who have come to yemen to study at language or religious institutions when approached with the upcoming transportation security administrationantiterrorism assistance tsaata visit saleh agreed to the idea but deferred to his supreme security committee alimi et on the details in the followon meeting alimi and anisi both concurred with the upcoming atatsa visit and expressed support for increasing airport security anisi however had reservations about sharing information on foreign students in yemen and complained that the usg request was too broad comment according to grpo reporting the royg is willing to share information with the usg on american students in yemen and would likewise share information with other embassies about their nationals while western governments would presumably share information among themselves this system would still leave intelligence gaps about nonwestern countries such as nigeria end comment 4 snf citing saudi arabias decision to suspend its military operations in saada and abdul malik alhouthis public acceptance of the roygs conditions for ceasefire ambassador benjamin asked saleh if he saw an end to the fighting saleh dismissed these points arguing that the saudis gave ceasefire ultimatum to the houthis and will resume fighting in two

that the february followup meeting in riyadh would help determine concrete steps to move forward qirbi agreed that smaller group focusing on gulf cooperation council gcc member countries rather than broader donor group would be more constructive qirbi said that the royg wanted to focus on the top ten economic reform priorities over the course of the next year but would need donor assistance to accomplish these goals he expressed support for discussion at the gcchosted meeting of funding for an extremist rehabilitation center indicating that an educational institute with longterm plan would do much to counter radicalization and address issues of poverty and unemployment particularly in areas where aqap has hold qirbi and other royg officials expressed support for us intervention with gcc
