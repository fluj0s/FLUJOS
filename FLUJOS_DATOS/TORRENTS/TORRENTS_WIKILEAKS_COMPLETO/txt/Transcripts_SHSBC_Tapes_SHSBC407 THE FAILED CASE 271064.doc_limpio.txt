the failed case lecture given on 27 october 1964 thank you now this is what date audience october 27 august you were saying audience october october 27th now ad 14 saint hill special briefing course all right youre going to have good lecture today for change joke i have to get these jokes in you see because and the name of the lecture is the failed case youre about to have put in your paws the book of remedies which takes all of these failed cases and all you have to do is look up and find out what your pc is doing and whats gone wrong and it tells you what to do and if you follow the directions intelligently why youll find out the case ceases to be failed case in almost all instances this lecture that i am giving you has some bits and pieces of that in it but is mostly devoted to the or in part devoted to the real failed case that will fail in any event there is such case and i have begun to understand this of recent times that we cannot totally 100 percent now theres always going to be failed case you can just make up your mind to that and you can get just as starryeyed as you want to in saving the whole of the human race and so forth but youre still going to collide with the totally failed case and the reason for this i must make very clear right at the outset does not lie with the auditor and does not lie with scientology does not lie with technology lets begin at the beginning on this along about 1954 i went into spate of research on the subject of people who had turned against dianetics and scientology and i tried to find common denominator amongst these people by which they could be understood so i looked them over very carefully and i listed their names and so forth and i finally was able to collect irrefutable evidence something you couldnt contest that about twentyone different people had been in dianetics and scientology but had been during that entire period very active against dianetics and scientology and its caused great deal of trouble for us and so then i made it my business to run down these blokes and i got up to seventeen names youve heard of this little project before ive never laid it out to this degree because frankly i never really understood it until the other day not in its total entirety its first echelon is very easy to understand seventeen of that twentyone had criminal records i thought that that was very very significant i thought that was very very interesting because these people had all had auditing and the other common denominator is they had had case change slightest faintest case change the reason why i havent got twentyone criminal records is because i got tired of looking them up at number seventeen because they had so far all the way up the line been one for one this was totally failed case well i started thinking the other day not the other day few months ago on the subject of case remedies and put together this book of case remedies and i have to add to it this little addendum this is not in the book of case remedies it is mentioned in passing but it is very highly specialized type of case and the other day i realized what the other factor was the other factor with this totally failed case now he doesnt have to be totally failed case that is to say you could do something to make it not totally failed case do you understand if you understood the mechanics of what would otherwise be totally failed case do you und do you follow but this is as far south as far south as you can get is communication possible of any kind whatsoever that by the way just goes south of the english language and actually goes south of what you normally call unconsciousness it goes into almost total absence because you can take puppy dog you know and you can process that puppy dog up tone the like of which you never heard of you know well that doesnt require any language see so you could processing exceeds language and right now knowing that people get hung up on definitions in study and that sort of thing well hurrah weve now exceeded language dont you see so what does this case do that is the failed case now you in the kindness of your heart are always thinking about his past and youre always willing to give somebody break and not hold his past against him but youre not dealing with the mans past and thats whats fooled you in the totally failed case youre dealing with his present he commits more overts between sessions than can be picked up in session do you see that ratio at once he commits more overts between sessions than can be picked up in session now in view of the fact that it takes you quite little while to dig for and get up an overt dont you see he doesnt asis things well life is on big beautiful alterisness of it all you know hes going to ch hes changing everything around its all sort of dub its all sort of justified hes pretty detached this was freuds failed case too by the way only he never realized it and ive never spoken of it in these terms before the person had responsibility for any place he was or anything he was doing freud called him detached case i dont know why hed be detached i think hed be dead in his head to end all deadinyourheads see undetached case itd take you quite while to get in communication with this bloke and his responsibility level would be down around zero see the responsibility level would be very bad well it takes some degree of responsibility to put ones self into the scene do you see you know my hand my hand stole the pocketbook well thats an irresponsibility to end all irresponsibilities dont you see and it wouldnt asis because he hasnt said the rest of the communication you see which is i saw the pocketbook and i picked it up with my hand he doesnt say that so you dont get really an asisness of the action do you follow the action then doesnt vanish or key out or deintensify hes putting an alteris on the line you say what have you done he said well ive picked up pocketbook but he says this because its social dont you see just to use i but if you question him very closely you would find out that actually his hand had picked up the pocketbook he hadnt had anything to do with it at all hes quoting you something it said off the police blotter these people are not all criminals by the way theyre not theyre not caught theyre not this theyre not that but you understand here that he isnt really giving you factual answer so therefore isnt answering the auditing question you say what have you done and he says well ill be sociable about it and ive done this and ive done that and sometimes the auditor is completely spun in by the fact that this guy is getting off fantastic overts see fantastic crimes of some kind or another guy just sits there and gives them to you by the bucketload dont you see and you say well good heavens anybody getting off that much would undoubtedly experience case change and you find out that his case sits just exactly where it was thats because he never answers the auditing question youre saying to him what have you done or something like that or what overt have you committed or something like that and he never answers this he answers something like the society has forced to commit or my hand picked up the pocketbook you see and it was purely an accident that the money was found in my pocket but youre saying what have you done but hes not answering what have you done because hed be incapable of assuming that much social responsibility so what hes doing is answering some putoff as far as youre concerned yes hell say the things which occurred in his lifetime but in his own mind he isnt answering any auditing question it doesnt really matter to him it didnt matter if he did these things and then theres the fellow who turns around and tries to make himself look good all the time dont you see and his concentration is totally on how he looks to the auditor you see hes got to look good hes got to put up social presence so he never gets off harmful act dont you see well thats peculiar to this failed case any either one hes either giving you tons of things he didnt do in his own mind he never did these things he says well thats social response im in sort of police court thats where i am its not an auditing session all right well ill tell them all these crimes doesnt matter and or hes saying hes done some wild things dont you see some crazy things and hes withholding these things like crazy oh ive always been good boy the one that sticks in mind was pc who was the sweetest dearest old lady you ever laid your eyes on who had led an exemplary life but had had lot of bad things happen to her and it wasnt until we used one of the remedies in the book of remedies which youll find there today of after finding out completely that she had never done anything in her whole life you know never even stubbed her toe life was just one beautiful song you see lot of things had happened to her though why we got the happy idea of asking her had she murdered anybody questions of that character total exaggeration you see had she ever raped any small children dont you see this dear sweet old lady it was quite obvious that if shed had this many motivators in her lifetime that she herself must have been very very busy see but according to the record that she was putting up she was just looking nice and sweet and social to the auditor and the trick that was worked there you see is by presenting well have you ever murdered anybody you know oh thats so terrible well ive never murdered anybody but of course i made somebody awfully sick once and its the trick its the trick of oh you can look much sadder than that dont you see its the trick of giving them much worse overt than they had committed as yesor type of question and they start unloading real overts you see but im just showing you then the normal run of cases and this i would consider the normal run of cases you have problems and you have to apply special remedies very often to get off overts sometimes auditors blunder in getting off overts because they dont get the pc in communication with the auditor you know very well that there are people youd say good morning to but they are not people that you would tell your family troubles to well similarly the pc is willing to sit there and say good morning to the auditor you know but not go any deeper into his life than that you see its standoff sort of an attitude toward the auditor well the auditor would have to work on that the pc is in this condition of perfectly willing to say good morning to the auditor and say yeah its all right to be audited but thats about the end of the intercourse dont you see thats as far and as personal as this must go and then the auditor says at once all right now tell harmful act you have committed well good heavens the person really wouldnt even describe breakfast with the auditor see you know youd have to build up this communication gradient what are you willing to talk to about which is far more effective process than you ever realize until some day you run it on some pc youre having trouble with you find out well hells bells youve been auditing him for twenty hours and theyve not been willing to talk to you about blessed thing and you get these long comm lags on what are you willing to talk to about well finally they get an answer thats real to them you know well im willing to talk to you about this room youve been trying to get overts off this guy see oh poo youve been trying to run ten thousand volts on wire and it just wouldnt go you see or too thin wire too little communication line and thats so tiny wire that if ten thousand volts ever started over it itd blow up the wire and youd have an arc break of course see so that therere all these all those little nuances this is by the way where an auditor lays the most eggs is in the field of overts thats where they chicken the most thats where they buy the wrong things and so forth so it is difficult zone of auditing i wont say that its unsurmountable because its pretty confounded easy ive gotten to be an old war horse on this now and the pc says well i have withhold i thought the other day that you were i say oh yes thats very interesting im very glad you can think now i want something that youre withholding from well i was withholding that im afraid you werent even bothering to withhold that you were simply being critical now i want the withhold thats back of this see i just dont ever let pc get in there and chop to ribbons and i sit there you know and say well thats the lot of an auditor you know you think this will produce an arc break the other way is the way you produce an arc break because youve just got missed withholds by the ton on the case by after while what you do is the guy starts to get off withholds about you and starts to get off withholds thats somebody elses withholds you know i was well i have an awful withhold here i was auditing betsy ann the other day and she told yapyapyapyapyapyapyapyapyap when i run into that in pc i go pheew chop now look were auditing were interested in you were not interested in other peoples withholds were not interested in what youre withholding of critical thoughts nothing of that sort and so forth i want to know what youre really withholding and the needle goes beuuuw i spilled all whole ashtray full of ashes over your new rug the other day oh hohoho and you can still see em all right thank you any other withholds now they give them to you very cheerfully you dont get these circuitous critical thoughts of the auditor and other peoples withholds and all this kind of nonsense dont you see but as i started to say before and complete saying pulling overts is dependent upon the degree of communication with the pc the degree of responsibility of the pc the its also in the ability of the auditor to really know what one is and pull the right one in other words were dealing here with stuff that cant be done crudely were dealing stuff that has to be done rather slippily and very well an auditor has to be right on his toes well even if you were right on your toes the case thats the failed case still couldnt have his overts pulled fast enough in session to keep up with pt and thats why hes failed case so its his present that youre in collision with not his past he leaves your session he cuts you to bits with his friends walks up on the front porch sees the dog lying there happily asleep in the sun gives him good solid swift kick in the ribs goes inside finds out that his sister hasnt got dinner on time breaks couple of plates finds somebody elses piece of mail steams it open and reads it rather incredible i want to interject note here which seems not apropos of anything else just as an aside here at this particular point but did you know that you could audit all the sex and so forth you want to on pc it isnt going to do very much but you can audit any gods quantity of it because it doesnt happen to be an end word you very often find gpms and that sort of thing what that they are things that it can lock on in root words and end words but it itself is humanoid action and the gpms arent dont you see so you could pull all the sexual overts that you want to dont think that its going to make all that difference to the case however because you arent on down to the roots of the reactive bank youre just taking the very surface locks off i think why freud did this is because thats about as far as people could go you know but he probably has some lot of second dynamic overts on the subject you see he has probably all kinds of tangles and withholds but his life is just one long harmful action see active man active not the crimes of omission even good and active and you never spot these so therefore the case remains undetected because you cant even get off his shallow overts dont you see from his past so youre not about to get off these overts in his present now you wouldnt even have to classify this fellow as criminal personality maybe this fellow is simply foreman of the works or something like this and hes always figuring out how to get somebody sacked and hes doing this and hes doing that and hes just chopping them up left right and center dont you see and taking the stuff out of the company till in the bargain the guy the guy is really heavy at it you know hes working hes working at it you know hes dedicated and you get him in session and you just cant pull those overts fast enough to keep the case in balance to return any degree of responsibility and you wouldnt really know what you were looking at you just wouldnt really know what you were looking at until you got right down to brass tacks and put shadow on his trail throughout the entire day which is outside the province of auditing because you see hes so irresponsible that those things dont react on an emeter an emeter reaction takes certain degree of reality certain degree of responsibility and the reason you take always take your biggest action is youve got that thing the pc feels the most responsibility for the emeter works then at the level where the pc has reality and responsibility at any given time and therefore if you run things that you know the pc has done but which dont react on the emeter you are then either running something thats already been run out or you are running into zone on which he has responsibility or reality and in either case you will practically do him in see asking guy to run out something thats been run out is pretty grim but trying to run out something for which he has responsibility of any kind whatsoever is almost fatal you can take list and the key word this is auditing by list you can take the key word on the list isnt reacting but you through some insight or observation of the pc determine that this is the key word you take that thing and you audit it and youll have an awful sick pc on your hands didnt react on the meter see but you knew it must be so you audited it therefore the thing that falls best is the thing thats nearest and realest to the pc in r6 if you skip gpm you of course havent got the thing which is nearest and realest to the pc so you dont get much reads thats practically the total source of small reads on r6 youre just running him where he aint so if youre running him where he isnt why youve bypassed something where he is and on if you had him where he was and so forth another little remedy that goes along with this you go over arc break lists you know in auditing by lists you go over your l6 and or l4 at lower levels and you dont get any reads on this well that doesnt mean anything except that the pc has got lists suppressed thats all that means the lists are all perfectly accurate so what you do there is very simple remedy if the pc is getting small reads and you cant find out where he is because he doesnt respond on any of the lists then you must assume theres something wrong with the lists now theres two things can be wrong with the lists hes never learned the parts of the gpm or the bank if youre auditing some green pc as some auditor undoubtedly stupidheadedly will do sooner or later uneducated totally uninformed pc one recently by name that i wont mention but i will send bill to for not mentioning sent student into the academy in washington the other day with orders that they must not audit her because she had been run on r6 and the understanding was that if anybody had been run on r6 they couldnt be run on anything else thats just about as wild and crazy datum as you ever heard they cant be run on processes which involve words thats all they cant be audited on process whereby youre trying to get them you see to define whole tracktype words like clay table clearing or definitions of earlier subjects or something like this something involving words youre going to lay an egg because this person is already into the slot of the gpms and of course the only thing thats going to read is the nearest gpm and youre just going to key them in so eventually if you were stupid enough to force them into some word that they considered was wrong which was way down the bank someplace youd bypass all that theyd turn on tremendous somatic and theyd feel like the devil but its just those things which those processes which would use words now you actually could get them to define scientology terms except some of those terms are also in the bank thats liability but you could get them to do that if you watched it and if your meter started to go high or something like that youd say whats the matter and youd better jolly well find out whats the matter dont you see youd have to take it very delicately even to do scientology definitions but you definitely could not do definitions of clay table clearing and you definitely couldnt do definitions of earlier subjects and you definitely couldnt list words to assess those things would practically wreck your pc but good god as far as i know that leaves some hundred thousand processes and you know there isnt single process in the book of remedies that violates it except the earlier subject definitions of thats all all the rest of those processes in the book of remedies whether they came from 1950 right straight on up the line all these tons of processes that are on tapes and everything else could be audited on somebody whos running r6 out of his ears and the other thing is who ran r6 well well well thats the clue so if somebody is running r6 and theyre not running r6 well well you possibly dont even have the liability of clay table theyre not in the slot theyre not going down the bank lord knows where they are you might even be able to run clay table clearing on them or run any stupid kind of definitions or run anything that comes into your head or anything in the book of remedies on them youre not going to do anything to them and you could prepcheck them perfectly valid to prepcheck them on various things providing you prepcheck very often people go completely astray by taking prepcheck and think prepcheck is very harmful or upsetting because of end words that might occur in the prepcheck when as matter of sober fact they dont know how to run prepcheck well if you overrun the suppress button on prepcheck you of course got all the other answers he would have thought of on the other buttons coming up and hitting him in the face and then you make some recommendation i think i will have to have this pc itsa this happened right here the other day i wont have any withholds and having overrun suppress madly you see audited the process wrong why of course the pc now had all kinds of additional answers so the auditors solution to it was to go off prepchecking and go on to itsa because the pc had so much to say the only thing that had happened the pc had all of his answers to invalidate and change and every other darn button in the prepcheck you see hed been run the tone arm action had been run out of the suppress button see you dont you dont flatten prepcheck button to point where steamroller appears to have run over it you know the pc says well i really havent got any more answers well youd better get another answer im still getting tone arm action on it the tone arm action is on the process its not on the button if you dont think its flat go through the buttons again in rotation and so forth and see if you get anything but thats actually the mechanics of it youd have to prepcheck properly you have to audit properly to get proper auditing results and one of the things is is when the pc hasnt got any more answers and he really hasnt got any more answers you dont ask any more questions i mean it sounds elementary i know of auditing situation where the pc who has been getting proper tone arm action proper tone arm action in the session who says i dont have any further answers to it has ever had any further answers to it i know of such situation but occasionally youll get pc who is getting wonderful tone arm action on something like ow who runs into mea culpa latin morals of the catholic church i am ashamed or its my blame or its my fault mea culpa i mean thats they practically never got off mea culpa as therapy the catholic church could be very pleased with this boy because he really now knows shame blame and regret see and he doesnt bother to give you the withhold he just simply says well i dont have any more answers well actually if you if you took pair of magnifying glasses and looked across the table at your pc and cut the smog out of it and so forth even in angeles you could tell that this pc has not answered all of his answers because hes sitting there theres various symptoms that you could notice you know like chewing his fingernails looking cringing like this you know hes backed up in his chair hes turned bright red hes sweating the palms of his hands running rivers of moisture i mean there are some small indicators that says hes simply hit something he dont want to talk to you about more brother hes not going to say any more about it hah uh oh well at this point of course in ow you press it home but its only in ow that you press it home if he says i havent got any more present time problems you say cheerily cheerily good he can withhold all the present time problems he wants really without getting him in or anybody else into very serious trouble hell only withhold them if theyve got overts connected with them that hes ashamed of and youll get that on the overt line dont you see not to push it home but you could actually run run prepcheck so that it looked like you were restimulating end words and messing up the pc dont you see you could run it in such way that it looked like catastrophe that was occurring the only thing that was occurring is you just happened to have flattened the button and you arent listening to the pc in the session he says well thats all the answers i got there arent any more answers and you say well i think youd better answer this two or three more times or five or six more times and hmmmmmmmmm about that time he starts imagining answers and dreaming up answers you now have condition where he isnt answering the auditing question and because prepchecks are prepchecks you now start getting answers to the other buttons on the same subject so he now doesnt answer the auditing question at all so now he looks like hes got floodgates of niagara would open at any minute see because hes thought of this to tell you but that doesnt answer the question and theres way he can well what fouled it up in the first place you see somebody forcing him to answer question he had more answers for now some pcs change faster than others and on this particular course you can get very very used to case going at certain pace or rate of change and all of sudden be totally thrown for loop the case will start to change at faster rate and its the auditor that worries in this particular case case is changing at faster rate than is believable according to auditing experience and so processes are madly overrun particularly at the lower levels you see and we on the direction now because of the of the supervision and other factors involved in the course dont you see its very tight auditing youll find the rate of change of the pc is increasing its faster hes changing faster and very often why we run into the of overflattening dont you see the case will suddenly come up with cognition now we try to audit this process again and its blown that wont happen with gpms youll find out the gpm was just suppressed at the time and youll go back couple of days later after youve run something else and all of sudden why its got all of its reads too but rate of change of the case increases in ratio to the auditing the slowest change period of the case is at the start of the case so if youve actually started case then its rate of change increases do you understand your very failed case coming back more solidly to that doesnt experience any rate of change at all there is rate of change but one see and that will change more slowly as you go on because the case is failed case do you follow this the length and rate of change you say well this actually has very definite indexes you can measure how long it takes for pc to get cognition on something how many hours of auditing does it take pc to come up to cognition on something fundamental about himself lets say it starts out early on when hes being audited at the has levels or something like this and its about twentyfive hours or something like that and he comes up to some recognition about himself you see some bigger recognition and youll find out as he goes on up the levels why it would take him maybe an hour to come to some conclusion of similar magnitude dont you see about some facet of his life at higher level you get what i mean rate of change and you sometimes can get somebody who has been audited well and whose case is moving very well who almost audits by inspection and this gets pretty weird and sometimes then the auditor will overestimate the power of the engram or something that the pc has collided with and think he can get rid of that because he got rid of all of the others you see and audits him too short on it and comes bit of cropper dont you see its variable thing it doesnt stay constant but it goes also along with comm lag how long does it take the pc to answer the question and one of your indexes of rate of change is the posture of the pc in auditing pc always assumes the same physical posture while being audited never assumes an additional or changed posture really always comes back to one posture if they do change to another posture it isnt any particular posture youll just have to understand it like that the pc is always dropping into rodels rodins or whoever it was thinker dont you know youll see that the pc is very frequently in session the pc has his head cocked way over here something like that some posture he keeps returning to this posture he keeps returning and returning and returning to the posture dont you see always auditing like that being audited like that has habit of doing certain type of fiddle with the can always has this mannerism in auditing to the degree that the pcs mannerisms in auditing remain constant he is not experiencing rate of change of progress do you follow that you can do that by inspection you see some pc hes always sits down he always slumps in some position or he always sits in certain way or he always looks in certain way in session always seems to return to this mechanism in some way or another i mean this posture this pose this diddle fiddle that thing keeps recurring you want to watch for that as an auditor because that case is parked that case is definitely parked quite important for you to recognize that when you see that you know that youre looking at case which needs remedying and if you start that means that youve got to look this case up in the book of remedies and do something about it you understand rate of change now the rate of change hasnt changed at all i mean the case has still got the same posture same reactions you know very often the same overts but you dont have to go off into that direction to find out that theyre stuck theyre not progressing and you can tell that actually from the consistent physical posture in session as simple as that and tone arm action on such case is minimal very little tone arm action their other symptoms are all there they just go on down your bad indicators are all there i mean everything that youd shake stick at is present but as an auditing supervisor as an auditing supervisor you actually can go through room on monday tuesday wednesday and if your memory is very good by the time youve gone through wednesday and its this its this fast rate of change is what is expected you notice that you still got pc by george you still have pc who is sitting there with his cans like this he always holds his hes on monday tuesday and wednesday he held his cans flopped down at his sides with his back bowed and his head hanging and thats the way hes being hes responding in auditing well you wouldnt have to look at his auditors report or anything else you wouldnt have to look at his auditing you wouldnt have to study anything particularly and so forth to know the case wasnt changing follow that now that you know the case isnt experiencing rate of change now lets look at the case now lets look at the at the auditing reports were trying to find something wrong and youre trying to find that and match that up against the book of remedies and when you get those two things matched well you give those directions and if you did it wednesday night by the end of session on thursday you would find the pc sitting with his cans in his lap hes longer sitting like this hes sitting like this you get the idea i mean its that superficial an observation you follow that theres nothing very nothing very fantastic is required in the way of instinct to know somebody isnt changing theyve always had green complexion theyve still got green complexion well you know their rate of change must be lousy nonoptimum condition persists is another way that you spot this well when person starts in in auditing in spite of everything you do in spite of anything anybody else does in spite of all the think and everything else and the sweat and so forth youve got one thing left that isnt in the book of remedies because thats book of remedies but it could very easily include this one of course but it wouldnt necessarily emphasize it youve got this present time condition of concatenation of overts which is too rapid to be picked up and thats your boy thats your boy if after hundred hours of auditing and all the sweat and change particularly with the book of remedies in your paws you didnt see any change in this pc there is reason for you as the d of t or the auditing supervisor or something like that or the auditor to go considering that you have failed in some particular line i mean you havent failed in any line you did your best youd better start looking at the pcs pt youd better look at that pt environment whats he do when he leaves this auditing session its giving it fair trial dont you see thats long look you know well whats he doing you dont know of any big flubs that werent corrected you nothing been done to victimize this character one way or the other yet there he is change well thats the other zone which you yourself would not find it very easy to inspect but which youd better jolly well find some way to inspect if youre going to do anything with this case at all youre going to be horrified at the conduct of some parts of the human race youre going to stand your hair on end on some of these characters you know and its so pathetic because theyve done so many overts they get so many motivators you see its not oneforone even i dont suppose its that neat ratio but its type of overt for type of motivator so you could actually run it down in auditing you could search this thing out you must realize its not something the person has done but its something the person is doing now its pretty hard to spot that this is what youre handling because of course you never get any communication about this from the pc but there is one method of spotting it and that is what the pc complains about in the conduct of others and you could just get him busily complaining about what he complains about in the conduct of others and go over this right on down the line and youll finally find out that one of them is very very consistent well that is what the pc does between sessions now you see you wouldnt go to an heroic measure like this pc has merely got some motivators and theyre talking about this and that and their pt is their present time is all upside down or something like this but youre auditing him and youre getting change of case see well you dont take any such measure im talking about the fellow who was audited and everything is done for him that can be and he still comes around he says what are you going to do what are you going to do about my lumbosis they drive the medical doctor mad what are you going to do about it youve done nothing for it you know youve done in and so forth now youre probably part of the part of the overt motivator package hes got enough overts against you out of session you know to make make book like fanny hill anyway we got whole bunch of stuff going on here that is outside the observation zone of the auditor so the auditor is looking at his mind hes looking at his past and hes looking at his own auditing of this pc dont you see well those are legitimate areas of inspection but there is another area and thats what im calling to your attention and that is the failed case that other area its the present time series of overts and i could add the word involvements but this is rather false because its not really hes involved because of overts and dont kid yourself otherwise you see now thats the pt of this pc who keeps coming back after 150 hours saying you havent done anything for his lumbosis theres your boy overts comes down to straight dead on the line and this case could be so bad and his environment could be so enturbulated that you just did not have prayer of being able to pull any part of the overts which he commits you audit him for five hours in day that leaves nineteen you can audit him on ratio of five to nineteen of that nineteen lets say he sleeps eight lets give him credit then for not committing overts during one of those hours that leaves ten hours of the day for five hours of your auditing and its already two for one now if it takes three times as long in auditing to pull the overt as it did to commit it youre just straight up against nothing but pure honesttogod arithmetic thats what youre up against and i dont care these people are the first to tell you how innocent they are and how inactive they are theyre the first they you give them stack of bibles mile high and theyd do something about it now that person is failed case where it comes to general practice for this one reason is you cant monitor his environment strongly enough hes walking into your zone of influence which extends maybe the size of the organization maybe the size of your house or your auditing room dont you see maybe even to your front sidewalk thats your zone of immediate influence as far as this case is concerned see your zone of influence may be much wider than that but as far as that case is concerned thats your zone of influence now the second he steps one foot beyond that zone of influence hes away and the way you handle this case if you could handle the case would be to establish your zone of influence as far as the case is likely to go between sessions for long enough to pull the case out of it now it would mean shift of environment this isnt the normal thing whereby the guy is simply in an enturbulated environment and so you change his environment during the period of auditing see thats common remedy and that is not enters into the failed case this other fellow would take lot more hed take lot more than just that if you changed his environment dont you see hed go on committing the same overts over longdistance telephone or something hed do some way you know hes getting even with all of existence now where you have such case and where you do not have control of the environment you can be absolutely certain that this will become failed case the only possible remedy that you could have is to project the fear of the auditor or something like that to such degree that perhaps you keep him under but then youre defeating yourself of course because youre spoiling your arc and youre doing an overwhelm of the pc and youre more likely to get religious reaction the fellow kisses the hem of your tablecloth before he leaves you know keeps facing your front door as he goes back up the walk dont you see you havent got anybody in very healthy frame of mind so thats selfdefeating too but you can do some of it you can do some of it and its worth its worth trying recognize what youre looking at you see you dont have control of the society in which this fellow lives or his family or something like this well recognize what youre looking at here you can say to him now look the reason your case isnt progressing is because you are doing things which you suppose i have inkling of between sessions and youre thinking things and youre saying things and youre acting in certain ways between sessions which is highly diffi highly detrimental to your case now if you change these habits and actions and cease to frequent the same places that youve been frequenting and so forth why maybe we can go on and even then i would have to be very very convinced before i would pick up the meter on you again see its this kind of thing now you actually at this point have simply to some degree located and indicated the bypassed charge because this would be true youve audited the bird for hundred hours and hes had rate of change and youve applied the whole book of remedies and youve done everything under the sun moon and stars and this guy isnt changing in any way shape or form and he isnt getting any better ah well youve only got one left and that one left is his environment is being so reacted upon by him that he is laying in more overts than you can get up and thats all there is to that you could try lot of things but that one i dont think you will ever totally catch up with until youve totally controlled the environment in which the person exists now you could say well now if youll go to the bideawee hotel and let put couple of guards on your door if youre willing to go through this for couple of months and pay the price of the wespyforyou detective company to relay put relay of watch and shadow on you during this particular period why ill go on auditing you but not otherwise see you might you might you might you see just on the occasional one crack through and so on but you wouldnt you wouldnt do 100 percent because these people are dedicated environment the environment looks so dangerous to them or so provocative or so hostile or so something we dont care just that were not just talking about particular type of reaction to the environment but it looks so something that the only way you can exert your livingness at all or even breathe is to do certain line of actions which even though they are socially unacceptable nevertheless are vitally necessary and the persons conviction along these lines are to the degree that if you told them to stop them you have practically told him to stop eating or stop breathing see it just totally violates his reality now therefore you sometimes look for the fast one the fast fast process whatll get in and undercut this case you know zooommm well there isnt anything to get in and undercut that case because in the first place youve got to be able to have the case in communication with you the guys got to be able to be in communication with you before you can do anything for the case and its going to take more than one session to get him in communication with you but of course after youve gone to the second session you now have bunch of overts in which youre included in the perimeter of overts and this will just go on going in that particular direction so there is the social liability now that gives us an avenue for an activity known as doesnt give us one but that gives justification to the psychiatrist one he didnt have any processes well one he didnt have any understanding of the situation two he didnt have any processes to handle the situation but those cases then which cant normally respond just by talking to somebody about their troubles and you know that wouldnt be very many cases you know i mean the case that wouldnt get well just because he said well i been sick lately thatd be pretty pretty hightoned case that can do that see all the rest of these cases look crazy to the psychiatrist and look unsolvable to the psychiatrist now because weve gone so far in an understanding of the subject in which we are dealing because weve gone so far in having processes because weve now gone so far in having remedies for these particular odd difficulties which the people come up with we of course could get very very cocky and say well we can go the whole way and i call to your attention the axiom absolutes are unobtainable youre always going to have this case unless you can exert unless you could exert what amounts to political control of the activities of the environment dont you see almost to that degree you wouldnt be able to sweep them all in and even then i imagine hed still find ways to commit overts in locked room do you see this now about the furthest south process that operates on such case you im sure would be very interested in and that is you already got it its justifications but id like to id like to id like to put in word here if you can get the person to talk to you why youve already won your first round with overts this is true of all overt running the first round youve got to win is to get the person to talk to you about things see without being reticent as he would be with stranger see that degree hes got to be able to talk to you and then you can get off some of his lighter overts and then you can get off some of his heavier overts you see and thats about the gradient that it will go on dont you see now you actually oddly enough can audit the case who isnt obsessively committing overts but hes been so busy in the past that hes got them stacked up to the roof now that case is actually not today very hard to audit as long as you remember to get the case in communication with you as the first requisite of all overt pulling and as long as you dont ask for the whole basketload with the first auditing question why you can you can do this dont you see but this bird you will run into and hes commoner fortunately than the bird who is committing the overt during the auditing session to committing overts to such degree that he cant possibly catch up with it dont you see so you would handle this they look quite alike by the way they one is theyre both very detached theyre both very irresponsible they very often will give you fantastic things they have done in life and expect you to be shocked over them or something of this sort but they arent theres all kinds of odd manifestations which make these cases look similar so you can you can make mistake so on either type of case you would try this one youd try to get them into communication with you it wouldnt matter what case it was you would do that dont you see or what you were trying to do and then on gradient youd get more and more heavier and heavier more voltage on the line and you could go deeper and deeper on the subject and remember this one that for that long gone case who can take responsibility whatsoever for his overts or for the recurrent overt the guy keeps giving you the same overt you know he really cant get off of having done this terrible thing the secret of what holds it in that overt has become problem then hasnt it well the anatomy of problem is postulatecounterpostulate isnt it you got that as the anatomy of problem its exactly balanced so therefore floats in time you see it theres just as much force against it as its pushing see and youve got this thing exactly poised in time here and its floating along with present time well he cant get this overt off and he cant get rid of this overt you must recognize that you are dealing in actual fact with problem as far as the overt is concerned dont you see well you dont bother to address it as problem im just showing you that having hes got this overt and he tells you about it but that doesnt get it off this is true of any of these whether its from total irresponsibility you see or the guy just feels so guilty about it you know whatever it is the answer is the same at both ends of the scale it wasnt an overt in his view it was justified now i want to give you note on running this process because youve run off the rails on it occas wherever ive heard it being run and when i was wrestling with it i tried to straighten it out here in the class and i may have succeeded and may not have succeeded but if i had to fight that hard to get it back on the rails im sure its gone little bit off the rails again so just let make few notes particularly for those who werent here when i was fighting to get it on the rails let make this few notes here about this and that is there is process of justifications which is really not repetitive process which is wideopen invitation to run as repetitive process what have you done how wasnt that an overt you could say this see you could you could sit there as an auditor with silly smile on your face going yeah being hes totally irresponsible as an auditor and run repetitive process called what have you done and how did you justify it what have you done how did you justify it what have you done how did you justify it what have you done how did you justify it well thats the essence of the process but it is not repetitive process let clar call that to your attention it is not repetitive process it requires handling you can say well what ham well they dont care what words you use what harmful act have you committed what harmful act have you really really committed now let see it well the fellow now this is not repetitive process you see and its not itsa this is taking up the case see crash and he says well i did this and i say all right and you dont challenge it or anything and i did that and i did something else and hes giving you lot of balderdash as far as youre concerned because you and the society at large dont consider these things very harmful acts fine let him get them off hes just trying to run some variety of ow okay but that isnt what you ask him and so you just go on getting your auditing question answered and you doesnt take you if you doesnt matter if it took you twenty five hours to get this auditing question answered you get something that he really did that he thinks was an overt act it was harmful action thats what youre looking for and its sort of chitterchat dont you see its not what have you done how have you justified thats not the process let put this other form of action across here its lets sort it out and he finally says well i threw my little brother in the river one time and that was one hell of an overt act youve got its fine with you that he says something like this now youve got your meat now lets cook it i dont care if it took you one minute or twentyfive hours to get an answer that both you and he would consider an overt act were not dodging around now about social mores and some peoples considerations are different so the both of you consider this thing as an overt act all right thats fine now thats the one you start to put on the front burner and this is the way you put it on the front burner and you say all right now lets just start out and count them up now how wasnt that an overt and thats not repetitive question because hell just go on answering that and hell get lost after while and go off maundering someplace and you say the auditing question was how wasnt that an overt because you havent got that one answered yet either do you understand these are two auditing questions youre getting answered and its going to take you sometimes one awful long time to get each one of them answered and its not tossoff process the way those repetitive processes are dont you see its not process by which you could say recall time you communicated with somebody good recall time you communicated with somebody good recall time you see its not process what would you confront what would you rather not confront and so forth because hes got certainty on these questions youve asked him right into the guts of aberration youve asked him this question what have you done that was harmful act you see now that actually actually he has to clip that thing in his mind hes got to get ahold of something that answered that question see youre not going up on it on some gradient and hoping some accident will occur youre driving right down the center of the road now and youre driving all the way as an auditor and you want to know just that what have you done that was harmful act or action and so forth thats what you want to know it doesnt matter much how you phrase it and so forth and hell give you something that yes he even he at the moment considers it harmful and its something that you recognize as harmful as the auditor and we finally got this one shaken out and we can even get into arguments with the pc about whats harmful and what isnt thats all part of the game dont you see we got this one now hes clipped one side of it now lets take the other side out with how wasnt it an overt act how wasnt it harmful why was it justified i dont care how you phrased it he really in his first sputterings is not really answering that question he isnt telling you what he really justified what he really thought was unharmful about it why he really had to do it so he hasnt really answered the question dont you see and its going to take an awful lot of answers before you really get the answer to the question when you finally get the answer to the question it goes something like this you see holy suffering godfrey i hated his guts id been trying to get rid of him for years oh is that so yeah i guess thats why i thought and youll notice change to past tense i guess thats why i thought it wasnt harmful act to throw my little brother in the river now what do you know about that well well well well well and you see you get what do you know it was one overt and it was one reason do you see in the getting of it you got fifty overts to choose from you got twentyhours worth of reasons but there was one reason which kept the violence of the action pinned into this thing of postulatecounterpostulate see he and society really considered this an overt and there was an awful good reason for it and there it is hung and its accumulated locks and its influenced his whole life dont you see and if youve got patience and skill as an auditor to go through that drill youve got what i first released as justifications and which easily degenerates into some lousy relatively unworkable process in which nobody is answering the auditing question dont you see you can ask what have you done what have you done what have you done what have you done what have you well youre not asking for anything what have you done well i ate breakfast all right thats fine thats perfectly valid answer he knows hes done that but i shudder to think of how many answers you could get to that before you would get the gradient is so long that its very worthwhile to go at it on this other basis you see and cut it down to size because this other basis can be reached because hes been sitting in that ever since the day he threw his little brother in the river now the unchanging condition comes from postulatecounter postulate so an overt which created an obsessive problem or which sought to solve one hangs in time and becomes both an overt act and present time problem even though its not in present time according to time span and calendars its in present time according to the mind and youll find out that most overts are committed as solutions so you have another little in whereby you could trip this case into change and you could trigger off chain reaction in this case thats committing overts all the time its just accidental that you would you would hit it because hes not much in communication you see hes almost every session hes further out of communication than before you see hes really sending himself over niagara falls without even barrel and publicity agent and nothing could be drearier could it youve got this other one is you handle the overt as ptp that he is trying to solve and you cut in try to cut in back of it you understand youre trying to do this with this guy whos the failed case whos committing these overts youre trying to do this with somebody who isnt in communication with you anyhow but is just pretending to be see so dont pat yourself on the back and say well we can always trigger it because you wont its worth its very worth trying and its very valuable on other cases see its very valuable on cases who arent who are just normally going along trying to get better very valuable process is just find out what present time problem theyre trying to solve with their overts its very amusing its very amusing that youll all of sudden have stream of overts pour into view that the person doesnt even remember having done this is very amusing i mean if you want to suddenly expose to the pcs view over here whole chain of actions that he never suspected that he himself had done or would never have considered an overt and has now totally got occluded just start approaching overts as solutions to some problem go in through the back door dont you see theres thousand ways you could dream up to do this even on repet im not trying to run down repetitive processes the repetitive processes are can be repetitive processes only when they can be answered see when they can be answered with good reality on the part of the pc and he knows hes answered the question why you can ask repetitive but you cant ask him on something that is far fetched as what have you what harmful act have you committed you know that you consider harmful and he says well i did so and so and he doesnt think so and its not harmful act and hes got it totally justified and so it doesnt answer the auditing question so the guy is even further out of session afterwards but approaching this other one now approaching that as an overt harmful act is an effort to resolve problem ninetynine percent of the cases you collide with oh higher percentage than that this just works like bomb terrific process all the time but it even works on the guy who is categorized at some tiny percentage of the time see you find out well all men are martians or something wild see thats the problem hes trying to solve how to get rid of the martians or itll be probably some crazy problem that hasnt got anything to do with reality see this is fact itll be some problem that existed long time ago that doesnt exist any longer or something but the obsessive commission of overts means that their the pc must have some oddball problem thats got tremendous lie connected with it somehow or another and all things that persist have lies connected with them and you could try it from that door you could try to open that door the only reason that would fail is you dont get problems you get whole bunch of motivators out of such case normal case you say well what problem are you trying to solve with overts you said something like that and hed say something like this well hed say well continuation of my business i have to commit one godawful number of overts to keep afloat well how do you have to commit these overts well actually i commit them against the customer by cheapening the product and i commit them against the staff by demanding more work at less pay and uh actually you know its the goddamned government if they werent taking and then hed say something like this to you you see if they werent taking the additional profit that i might be making you see then i might not have to commit that many overts hey you dont suppose im trying to make the government guilty do you my god i am hummm see one of these brassy ten thousandvolt cognitions dont you see youve all of sudden done something very tricky with case that looks absolutely magical see what you did is you recognized that overts are an effort to solve some problem not all overts are efforts to solve some problem some are accidental some are habitual see i mean some are just ignorance there are different kinds of overts that are harmful acts guy can commit see he didnt intend to commit an overt well an overt and harmful act normally requires some intention dont you see even the law accidental death you know is manslaughter and homicide is premeditated even the law makes difference between what was intended to happen and what happened dont you see well all of these various wild considerations they you neednt tangle yourself up and get too involved with them im just trying to say that it isnt true to say that every overt that was ever committed was an effort to solve problem dont you see thats one of these data like jewelers never go anywhere see its completely non sequitur to anything type of data you see its total generality it doesnt work not all harm in the in the world stems from the existence of problems see you could run this down youd probably make pretty good case for it dont you see but its going to its logic is going to fail some place or other along the line but where fellow is absolutely dedicated hombre where this bird gets up in the morning and crosses his heart and takes the hilt of his tie pin and presents it to his forehead and before the mirror on how hes going to get even today hes solving problem and this person is going around saying well i really dont want to commit the overt but ive got to this also gives us strange view to it all see hes withholding committing the overt but hes got to commit the overt and so forth well now look at that get an insight on this hes obviously trying to solve some problem isnt he other avenue of solution so he commits the overt as the last resort usually an intentionally committed harmful act this is ordinary in life an intentionally committed harmful act is committed in an effort to resolve problem and so when you get some horrible thing that the person has done in life as threw his little brother in the river he agreed it was an overt he knows its an overt now it wasnt just an accident he didnt drop him in the river he picked him up and he threw him in the river see and weve got this thing now and he knows its bad thing and you know thats bad thing too its not its not done and now hes answered the question dont you see well when you ask him on the reverse current you see why that wasnt an overt youre unlocking the door to an ancient problem of some kind or another see and youre taking locks off of it so you let him chatter on and on and on and give you more and more and more on this one question until all of sudden the real reason the real reason it wasnt an overt shows up and youve unlocked it he will say quite incidentally and pass it off shortly after his cognition that that was hell of thing to do hell say well i just didnt figure i just didnt figure id ever have anything if he was that young he always used to tear up my things parents would buy everything for him youve already heard all these things why it wasnt an overt dont you see but he explains it to you hell sum it up it was problem it was problem actually in havingness so why he threw his brother in the river was problem in havingness dont you see and you can sometimes be completely magical with this and very lucky if your pc is very bad off youre very lucky if you make this work dont you see because his recognition of responsibility is out the bottom hes not about to be responsible for any quarter of anything hes doing or has done and he therefore hes not even responsible for sitting and being pc in your auditing session you see so trying to reach this gone character this totally failed case is blahh but this may even occasionally work with him dont you see treat his overts as an effort to solve problem i dont care how you treat it you say what problem are you trying to solve now you know lets see what have you done this is good gambit on such thing lets see what have you done in the last twenty four hours that was pretty antisocial ahhh but he before he starts to even say ohohohoh well nothing you know well you already got this guy taped you know just brush it off dont even acknowledge it its lie anyhow lets see now what would it be in the vicinity of would it be something to your family or somebody around thats close and near and dear to you or would it be or the organization well the needle just fell on now what have you done to actually the last time he left the session he you couldnt find your overshoes well he took them and threw them in the garbage can or something like that see you run it down you say all right now lets take this lets take this lets take this action now and what problem were you trying to solve with that see lets go at it on kind of head on proposition so he really doesnt get the motivator off sometimes by lucky chance youll come through you could ask him well why wasnt it an overt act he could give you lot of justifications dont you see he could give you lot of other things and so on but you could also undercut the thing and have some chance of getting through just with blunt well what by being mean to my possessions what problem are you trying to solve and hell some way or another start coming up with well im trying to solve the problem of how the hell im going to stay sick of course your immediate response well why do you want to stay sick see you probably would ask him that really before you could check yourself youd be too startled something like that an auditor should never be startled but they occasionally are amongst them ah hed say well id cease to draw pension well what problem are you trying to solve by getting auditing to show them how sick i am but im afraid this really failed case would not have that much insight or that much directness to approach it you can try you understand with other cases that are having trouble and so forth oh yes this will work theyve got some responsibility for life theyre going to do something in life theyre of some use and benefit to somebody in existence and so forth yes these processes are terrific i probably err in putting such processes at this lowest unworkable level dont you see im showing you just trying to show you these processes are terrific processes work on almost any case on this case they sometimes nudge it sometimes budge it sometimes get it off of the kick sometimes straighten it out and get it along the line but you must know what youre dealing with when youre dealing with this failed case you must know what youre dealing with you are not dealing with person who has committed overts in the past you are not handling problem that has to do with the past you are handling problem that has to do with today youre handling problem that has to do with the session yesterday to the session today time period youre handling that consistently and continuously you handle that with every case that you have anything to do with one way or the other to some degree dont you see well with this case its all totally hidden its all gone youre never going to find out about it and hes not enough in communication to tell you and you probably cant hire enough detectives to find out about it dont you see so you are actually not failing in any quarter except failing to restrain an individual from committing so many overt acts that he cant be audited and that case is the failed case and thats the only one there is you can say all right well theres another failed case the fellow who died i dont know that hes failed case well pick him up later on you keep scientology going and workable you pick them all up see matter what happened to them so that doesnt classify see and of course somebody whos unconscious and cant be talked to and that sort of thing you can get them into communication with their pillow and wake them up i mean thats quite interesting and we got dog up to the point now where all she does is try to talk its probably its having an awful time trying to get along without vocal cords trying to make up for vocal cords yummm wumm gumm yumm yumm through little bit of processing from day to day or from every couple of days to every couple of days and that sort of thing just touch assists sort of thing you know why shes coming up in tone i notice her communication level is rising rising rising rising rising and shes up to point now where she well at first she would only moan and groan around about her chow see something very intimate now she moans and groans around because shes glad to see you and now shes gotten up to point where shes moaning and groaning around in other using other voice intonations now complaining about how cold it is outside so these things these things are not terrific barriers see you can process almost anything or anybody up along the line providing you havent got this other condition and what youve got to recognize in dealing with cases at large is that when easy auditing isnt there with continuous case progress when that isnt present that you are facing circumstance which has to be remedied before ordinary auditing works theres something odd about the case or something peculiar theres something that has to be handled about the case and this is very very general this isnt isolated but it is handleable its very easily handleable its only when you dont recognize that something is there which has to be handled that you then have any trouble with the case and that you would fail on case you see now theres big difference between that you see and the failed case now cases which have appeared to fail in your hands have only failed for technical reasons and for lack of remedies and you have the book of remedies now it is very easy to use and itll be out in few days this you will see is going to make an immediate difference because i notice in doing auditing session reports on somebody whos busted down in the line of auditing and so forth we dont give them anything new were giving them stuff thats very old and creaky and antique and so forth look over the auditing report and find the first time the pc set sour goal now go back to the session immediately ahead of that and sk and investigate that session its almost perfect formula see pc set sour goal he hadnt been running well since 1958 what well it doesnt have to be that extreme but you might run somebody down to an unflattened process dont you see or something of that sort and you set that up and they all of sudden flatten that process up and zooommm theyre away dont you see something has happened theyve left process unflat or process has been messed up or something has occurred and so forth its just sensible material of this particular kind and it takes that sort of thing i recognized that i had not in actual fact released all the technology of scientology through not having released the auditing remedies used by in case supervision which was done over the many many years and that was to point when the student came to saint hill why of course he got case supervision of one type or another he got case supervision see and then in trying to relay this material on the material was too complex to be relayed at breath dont you see there are lot of them there are lot of them therere well its around hundred or less but they look they look bewildering at first glance you know i mean if you if you didnt have any book and you had guide and you had map chart of anything of this sort and you try to teach somebody sit down and teach him he actually would have had to have had each one one each almost of all these various case manifestations which arent very many there are less than hundred of them each one of them would have had different manifestation dont you see hed had to have handled the case each time well they dont happen that frequently and its very hard to train on practical experience basis and i all of sudden realized that section was missing and so got together and writ it up and then i corralled mary sue who is oldtime experienced supervisor from way back when in hgcs and so forth and i went over all of those and that she could think of and we got bunch more and put them all together in readyreference type of form youll have to learn how to use that book but that takes care of the cases that you normally are considering cases that are hard to audit or cases that youre failing on and so forth i wanted to make it very clear from this point on what failed case was and case that is utterly an unauditable god help us catastrophic bust with you with the book of remedies with some area of auditing with somebody able to do something for the case the case doesnt progress at all youve still got this one case left you see hes committing overts faster than you could ever get them off and through that why you will occasionally spell yourself disaster so im pointing that one up as great big great big set of rocks that lie under the water up there someplace on some case and if after youve done your very very best to handle the case and done everything possible that you could possibly think of and you so forth and so on why just hark back and recall this one there is such case now if you want to hire have him hire couple of private detectives to chase him around and lock him up in hotel room and so forth you could still solve his case you understand but under ordinary auditing conditions his case is unsolvable and so therefore would be failed case okay thank you
