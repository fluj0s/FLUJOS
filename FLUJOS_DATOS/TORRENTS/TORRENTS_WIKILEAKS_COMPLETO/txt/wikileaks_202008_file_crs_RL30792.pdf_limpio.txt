consideration of economic factors summary the endangered species act pr ovides for the listing and protection of species that are found to be endangered or threatened species that might become extinct the listing of species as endangered triggers the prohibitions in the act against taking killing or harming individuals of the protected species unless permit is obtained to take individuals incidental to an otherwise lawful proposed action or an exemption for the proposed action is obtained unauthorized taking of listed species can result in civil or criminal penalties these prohibitions and potential penalties can affect various activities including development and use of land with attendant economic impacts therefore the extent to which likely economic impacts can be taken into account under the has generated interest and discussion the determination of whether species should be listed as endangered or threatened must be based solely on the ba sis of the best scientific and commercial data available commercial data here refers to trade data the data that may be considered at the listing stage may incl ude facts related to species population habitat distribution etc as well as thr eats to its continued survival but must not include economic factors however economic factors may be and in some inst ances must be considered in devising responses to the listing of sp ecies eg in the designation of critical habitat in the process for obtaining an exemption for particular proposed action from the prohibitions of the and in th development of the recovery plan for listed species economic factors also play less direct roles in the permitting processes parts of the relate to commercial importation and trade in listed species this report does not address those

and protection of species that are found to be endangered or threatened species that need conservation efforts because they might b ecome extinct the listing of species as endangered triggers the prohibitions in the act against taking killing or harming individuals of the protected species unless permit is obtained to take individuals incidental to an otherwise lawful propos ed action or unless an exemption for the proposed action is obtained unauthorized taking of listed species can result in civil or criminal penalties these prohibitions and potential penalties can affect various activities including the use nd development of land with attendant economic impacts therefore the extent to which likely economic impacts can be taken into account under the has been of interest some part s of the act relate to importation and commercial trading in listed species2 this report does not address those issues but discusses th generally and how some of its provisions aside from the commercial context relate to the consideration of economic factors it will be updated as circumstances warrant background the defines an endangered species as any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or significan t portion of its range excepted from this definition however are species of the class insecta determined by the secretary to constitute pest whose protection under the provision of this chapter would present an overwhelming and overriding risk to man this language appears to recognize the economic or health threats that some insects present threatened species is one likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or significant portion of its range the secretary of the interior with respect to terrestrial species and the secretary of commerce with respect to anadromous fish and certain other marine species decide whether to list species as endangered or threatened the listing

endangered species or threatened species because of any of the following factors the present or threatened destruction modificati on or curtailment of its habitat or range continueda species triggers certain duties for fede ral agencies and applicants for federal permits authorizations or f unding to consult with the secretary in practice either the fish and wildlife service or the national marine fisheries service respectively if proposed action may affect listed sp ecies this consultation will determine if the proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of species or destroy or adversely modify habitat of species determined by the secretary to be critical3 if so the secretary is to suggest reasonable and prudent alternatives to the proposed action that would avoid jeopardizing the listed species listing species as endangered also means that the prohibitions of the regarding the taking of endangered species apply taking means to harass harm pursue hunt shoot wound kill trap capture or collect or to attempt to engage in any such conduct4 the meaning of harm is elaborated on in regulations to include destruction of habitat severe enough to actually kill or injure wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns including breedin g feeding or sheltering5 current regulations provide that unless special rule has been promulgated for threatened species threatened species shall receive the same protections as endangered species6 exceptions to the taking prohibitions are allowed as result of either the consultation pro cess under 7 of the act or under the 10 provisions that allow incidental take permits to be issued if development or activity cannot be m odified so that it avoids jeopardizing listed species the person or agency proposing the action must either desist risk penalties for unlawful takes or pursue the exemption process provided under the to exempt that activity not the species from the penalties of the act this report will discuss the role of economics in the listing of species designation of critical habitat the ex emption process and the development of recovery plans the listing process the determination of whether species should be listed as endangered or threatened must be based on several factors that relate to the surviving numbers of species and threats to its continued exis tence but do not

1411 9 hrept 97567 at 1920 1982caused by development or other economic activities listing determinations are expressly to be made solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available the word solely was added in the 1982 amendments to the act8 to clarify that the determination of endangered or threatened status was intended to be made without reference to extraneous c onditions such as economic factors the committee reports elaborated on this point and also state that commercial data refers to trade data the principal purpose of the amendments to section 4 is to ensure that decisions pertaining to the listing and delisting of species are based solely upon biological criteria and to prevent nonbi ological considerations from affecting such decisions to accomplish this and other purposes section 4a is amended in several instances section 4b of the act is amended in several instances by section 1a2 of hr 6133 first the legislation requires that the secretary base his determinations regarding the listing or listing of species solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available to him the addition of the word solely is intended to remove fro m the process of the listing or delisting of species any factor not related to the biological status of the species the committee strongly believes that economic considerations have relevance to determinations regarding the status of species and intends that the economic analysis requirements of executive order 12291 and such statutes as the regulatory flexibility act and the paperwork reduction act not apply the committee notes and specifically rejects the characterization of this language by the department of the interior as maintaining the status quo and continuing to allow the secretary to apply ex ecutive order 12291 and other statutes in evaluating alternatives to listing the onl alternatives involv ed in the listing of species are whether the species should be listed as endangered or threatened or not listed all applying economic crite ria to the analysis of the alternatives and to any phase of the species listing process is applying economics to the determinations made under section 4 of the act and is specifically rejected by the inclusion of the word solely in this legislation section 4b of the act as amended provides that listing shall be based solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available the committee did not change this information standard because of its interpretation of the word commercial to allow the us of trade data retention of the word commercial is not intended in any way to authorize the use of economic considerations in the process of listing species9 the conference report confirms that it was the intent of both chambers that economic factors not play role in the listing of species for protectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30792crs4 10 hrept 97835 at 19 1982 11 ibid at 20 12 16 usc 1533a3 the reference to prude nce reflects the fact that it is necessary to take into account whether designating the habitat of listed species would result in specimen collecting or other public intrusion into that habitat to the triment of the species the word determinable refers to whether it has been possible factually to determine the extent of the critical habitat if the facts rele vant to the designation of critical habitat are not yet available the secretary may postpone desi gnation for an additional year eventually habitat is to be designated to the maximum extent it is prudent to do sosection 2 of the conference substitute amends section 4 of the act in several ways the principal purpose of these amendments is to ensure that decisions in every phase of the process pertaining to the listing or delisting of species are based solely upon biological criteria and to prevent nonbiological considerations from affecting such decisions10 the committee of conference hereaft er the committee adopted the house language which requires the secretary to base determinations regarding the listing or delisting of species solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available to him as noted in the house report economic considerations have relevance to determinations regarding the status of species and the economic analysis requirements of executive order 12291 and such statutes as the regulatory flexibility act and the paperwork reduction act will not apply to any phase of the listin g process the standards in the act relating to the designation of critical bitat remain unchanged the requirement that the secretary consider for listing thos species that states or foreign nations have designated or identified as in n eed of protection also remains unchanged11 therefore the act makes it clear that the decision as to whether species is endangered or threatened is to be sc ientific one in whic h economic factors do not play part once this determina tion has been made however economic considerations may be and in some instances must be considered in analyzing what actions may be taken this process has been analogized to making diagnosis of whether patient has cancer solely on medical grounds but later considering economic factors in deter mining appropriate treatment once the patient has been diagnosed designation of critical habitat in contrast to the process for listing species as needing the protections of the in which process economic factors ar not to play part economic factors expressly are to be considered in the designation of critical habitat for species concurrently with determining species to be endangered or threatened the secretary to the maximum extent prudent and determinable is to designate the critical habitat of the species12 when the secretary designates critical habitat the secretary must take into consideration the economic impacts of doing sohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30792crs5 13 16 usc 1533b2 14 see crs report rs20263 the role of designation of critical habitat under the endangered species act by pamela baldwinon the basis of the best scientific data available and after taking into consideration the economic impact and any other relevant impact of specifying any particular area as critical habitat the secretary may exclude any area from critical habitat if he determines that th benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat unless he determines based on the best scientific and commercial data available that the failure to designate such area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species concerned13 therefore although economic factors are not to be considered in the listing of species as endangered or threatened economic factors must be considered when deciding whether and where to designate critical habitat and some habitat areas may be excluded from designation based on such concerns unless the failure to designate the habitat would result in the extinction of the subject species the significance of designating critical habitat is debatable the fish and wildlife service has asserted that designation does not add substantially to the protections afforded listed species critical habitat designati ons are inordinately expensive compared to listing determinations and that the agency would prefer not to use scarce resources to designate critical habitat in fact critical habitat has been designated for less than one fourth of liste d species on the other hand modification of critical habitat may trigge r 7 consultation may affect finding of harm and may facilitate development of recovery plans14 exemptions federal agencies and nonfederal persons may seek to have particular action exempted from the penalties for taking endangered or threatened species in order to allow an activity or project to proceed even if that activity or project would destroy individuals of listed species and might even jeopardize the continued existence of that species as originally enacted the act was an absolute prohibition against activities that would jeopardize endangered species wh the prospective impoundment of water behind the nearly completed tellico dam threatened to erad icate the only known population of the snail darter small fish the suprem court concluded that the plain language of the act at that time mandated that the dam not operate concededly this view of the act will produce results requiring the sacrifice of the anticipated benefits of the project and of many millions of dollars in public funds but examination of the language hi story and structure of the legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30792crs6 15 tennessee valley authority v

court decision the was amended to include process by which economic and other impacts could be reviewed and projects exempted from the restrictions that otherwise would apply16 an endangered species committee committee consisting of specified cabi net officials and one individual from each affected state reviews applications for exemptions federal agency the governor of the state in which an agency action will occur or permit or license applicant may apply to the secretary for an exempti on the application must describe the consultation process carried out and provi statement as to why the proposed action cannot be modified to conform w ith the requirements of the statute to be eligible for an exemption th agency concerned and the exemption applicant must have carried out the cons ultation processes requi red under 7 of the act in good faith and must have made r easonable and responsible effort to develop and fairly consider modifi cations or reasonable and pr udent alternatives to the proposed action that do not jeopardize the c ontinued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modifica tion of critical habitat of such species they also must have conducte d the required biological ssessments and to the extent determinable within the time provided refrained from making any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources that would foreclose the formulation or implementation of reasonable and prudent alternative meas ures to avoid jeopardizing the species and habitat in question these qualifying requirements are to ensure that the exemption process will be meaningful one and that the consideration of the issues will not be preempted by the commitment of resources and preclusion of alternatives through ac tions already taken the secretary in consultation with the other members of the committee holds hearing on the application and prepares report the report reviews whether the applicant has made any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources discusses the availability of reasonable and prudent alternatives and the benefits of each provides summary of the evidence concerning whether the action is in the public interest and is nationally or regionally significant and outlines appropriate and reasonable mitigation and enhancement measur which should be considered by the committee17 economic impacts may play part in the evaluations of public interest and national or regional significance and in the development of mitigation and enhancement measures the committee then makes final determination of whether to grant an exemption the committee shall grant an ex emption if based on the evidence the committee determines that i there are reasonable and prudent alternatives to the agency actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30792crs7 18 16 usc 1536h 19 16 usc 1536j 20 16 usc 1536i 21 16 usc 1536p 22 16 usc 1536h 23 16 usc 1536 lii the benefits of such action clearly out weigh the benefits of alternative courses of action consistent with conserving the species or its critical habitat and such action is in the public interest iii the action is of regional or national significance andiv neither the federal agency concerned nor the exemption applicant made any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources prohibited by subsection d of this section commitments as described above that jeopardize species or critical habitat 18 the committee also must establish r easonable mitigation and enhancement measures as necessary and appropriate to minimize the adverse effects of an approved action on the species or critical bitat these measures must be funded by the applicant again economic impacts may well be factor in several of these evaluations and measures an exemption must be granted for an agency action if the secretary of defense finds the exemption is necessary for reasons of national security19 the committee may not grant an exemption that the secretary of state finds would violate treaty or other international oblig ation of the united states20 the president is authorized to make exemption determinations for project for the repair or replacement of public facility in major disaster area if the president determines it is 1 necessary to prevent the recurrence of the natural disaster and to reduce the potential loss of human life and 2 to involve an emer gency situation which does not allow the ordinary procedures to be followed21 an exemption is permanent unless the secretary finds that the exemption would result in the extinction of species that was not the subject of consultation or was not identified in the biological assessment and the committee determines that the exemption should not be permanent22 the costs of required mitigation and enhancement measures specified in an approved exemption must be included in th overall costs of continuing the proposed action and the applicant must report nnually to the council on environmental quality on compliance with mitigation and enhancement measures23 the obligation to fund mitigation continues throughout the impacts of the exemption the act expressly states that any action for which an exemption is granted is not to be considered taking of any endangered species with respect to any activity necessary to carrying out the exempted action and that any taking that is inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30792crs8 24 michael bean and melanie rowland t he evolution of national wildlife law 264 265 3d ed 1998compliance with the terms and conditions specified in written statement issued by the secretary after the consultation process is not to be considered taking of the species concerned in other words the penalties that normally apply to the taking of an endangered or threatened species do not apply to takings resulting from exempted actions there have been only very few exem ption applications filed and only two exemptions granted one was in re the grayrocks dam and the other was to approve 13 timber sales sought by the bureau of land management in the department of the interior but this latter exemption request was withdrawn before the completion of appeals one application was denied in re the tellico dam which was later allowed by congress to proceed one was dismissed as premature in re the proposed pittston oil refinery in maine and two others were withdrawn before committee consideration one commentator has speculated that the low number of exemption applications may in part be because the process is rigorous but also because the incentive to negotiate compromises is strong the main reasons for the low number of applications probably include the small number of jeopardy opinions issued the stringent substantive standards for the grant of an exemption and the complexity of the process likely additional factor is that most institutions public or private recognize that merely by seeking an exemption they risk being perceived as hostile to endangered species conservation as long as public support fo r conservation is believed to be high there is an incentive to compromise and avoid the need for an exemption24 another factor may be that the harm to species resulting from an exempted action must be taken into account in review ing other proposed actions that also may affect that species more vigorous conser vation actions may be necessary elsewhere to compensate for the exempted harm in order to recover the species in question this fact also may make exemptions less desirable recovery plans once species is listed the secretary is to develop recovery plan for that species that will assist the species in recovering to the point that the protection of the is longer needed to the extent practicable the secretary is to develop recovery plans for those species that are most likely to benefit from such plans particularly those species that are or ma be in conflict with construction or other development projects or other forms of ec onomic activity recovery plans are to set goals for the conservation and surviv of the species and set out objective measurable criteria that would result in determination that the species could be removed from listing recovery plan is also to contain estimates of the time required and the cost to carry out those m easures needed to achieve the plans goalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30792crs9 25 16 usc 1533f 26 see the surprises rule and policy 63 fed reg 8859 february 23 1998 50 cfr 1722b5 which limits the changes the go vernment

impacts may play role in the development of and choosin g among recovery measures although all options must achieve recovery the most costeffective option may be selected provisions with less direct economic effects other provisions may involve economic factors less directly than those discussed above especially as implemented administrativel permit applicants may confer on possible impacts on species th at have been proposed for listing and informal consultation is available with respect to preliminary project planning for actions that may affect listed species both of these processes may assist with development of economic projects and activities so as to avoid both conflicts and the expense of modifying actions late r on in addition certain administrative actions afford landowners nd developers greater certain ty in moving forward with development activities26 these rules combined with other agency policies and guidelines for improved processing of permit applications have been seen by many as facilitating economic activ ities and development otherw ise affected by the
