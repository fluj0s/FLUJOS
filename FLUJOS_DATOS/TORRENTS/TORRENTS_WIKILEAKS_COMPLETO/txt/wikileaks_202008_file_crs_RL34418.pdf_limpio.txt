both revenue from the estate tax and revenue losses from permanent repeal of the estate tax should be interpreted with caution the forecasts should not be used to pproximate revenues for different

from federal tax for every estate2 the value of the exemption is not indexed for inflation nor is it set in relation to any specific definition of wealth instead congress has intermittently raised the

3 million but under tra of 1997 the 5 surtax applie d from over 10 million only up to 17184 million5 in addition to raising the exemption in large increments egtrra significantly reduced the top marginal estate tax rate over period of six years column 2 of table 1 at the outset egtrra eliminated the 5 surtax and reduced the maximum tax rate from 55 to 50 effective in 2002 it subsequently reduced the top tax rate by one percentage point per year from 49 in 2003 down to 46 in 2006 and finally to 45 for 2007 through 20096 for decedents dying in 2010 there is estate tax for 2011 and

filing population internal revenue service statistics of income soi bulletin vol 27 1 summer 2007 figure b p 114which law is reflected in revenue for particular year the tax law that applies to an estate is the law in effect in the year of the persons death however the estate tax return is not due until nine months after the persons death and an extension of six m onths is not uncommon complex returns may be granted longer extension it follows that estate tax returns filed in any given calendar year will include few returns of people who died in that ear mostly the returns of people who died in the previous year and some returns from deaths in prior years that are filing under an extension of estate tax returns filed in calendar ears 2001 th rough 2005 roughly 10 were filed in the year of d eath 72 in the year after death 14 two years after death and 3 three or more years after death7 consequently for given filing year calendar year this report refers to the exemption that was in effect for death in the prior calendar year as the prevailing exemption for that filing year for example the prevailing exemption for most estate tax returns filed in 2006 would be the 15 million exemption in effect for deaths in 2005 revenue in particular fiscal year is most likely to reflect the estate tax law in effect in the previousnumbered calendar year recall that the estate tax return is not due until nine months after the date of death and that the fiscal year runs from october 1 of the previous calendar year until september 30 of the samenumbered calendar year so for exampl deaths in calendar 2006 w ould be reflected in estate tax returns filed on time in th last three months of 2006 nd the first nine months of 2007 which comprise fy2007 unexpected patterns an increase in the estate tax exemption would be expected to reduce the number of estate tax returns file d the number of taxable returns and the total amount of estate tax paid with those returns but this is not always the case in particular from 1998 until 2000 the number of taxable returns continued to increase even though the prevailing exemption was gradually rising total estate taxes paid remained nearly the same between 2002 and 2003 even though the number of taxable returns fell by 26 and between 2004 and 2005 when taxable returns fell by 29 whether the number of taxable returns and the amount of tax revenues decline depends upon whether the increase in the exemption outpaces th increase in the value of wealthy decedents estates broad market fluctuations in the value of widelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34418crs5 8 internal revenue service statistics of income bulletin spring 2007 selected historical and other data table 17 p 279held assets such as stocks or real can override the relationship that would otherwise be expected between an increase in the estate tax exemption and the number of taxable estate tax returns filed the next year estate valuations are likely to be unusually high in years of market peaks and unusually low in years of market crashes this is likely to cause the number of taxable estate tax returns filed in the next calendar year to be higher and lowe r respectively than would otherwise be expected the standardized measurement of taxable estate tax returns expressed as percentage of deaths has been tracked ove r time as an indicator of how deeply the estate tax reaches into the population when this percentage has risen above politically unacceptable level the congress has at some point raised the estate tax exemption in order to bring the percentage back down to the typical historical level during the previous two decades for ears of death from 1982 through 2003 taxable estate tax returns measured as percentage of adult deaths fluctuated within the range of just under 1 088 to 2308 increase in exemption and nu mber of taxable returns the relationship between the increase in the prevailing exemption amount and the number of taxable estate tax retu rns filed each year from 1998 through 2006 is illustrated by the juxtaposition of figures 1 and 2 the data underlying these two graphs are presented in colu mns 1 and 2 respectively of table 2 to help highlight the relationships between these tw measures columns 1 and 2 of table 3 show the percentage change from the previous year for the prevailing exemption and the number of taxable returns initially from 1998 through 2000 when the prevailing exemption was rising in annual increments of 25000 or bout 4 from 600000 in 1998 to 625000 in 1999 and 650000 in 2000 the number of taxa ble returns nonetheless continued to rise modestly the rising pattern holds whether measured as the absolute number of returns column 2 of table 2 or standardized as tax returns as percent of deaths column 3 of table 2 the number of taxable tate tax returns rose from 47475 or 205 of deaths in 1998 to 52000 or 217 of deaths in 2000 this suggests that value of assets broadly held by wealthy d ecedents was generally rising more rapidly than the exemption from 1997 to 1999 th stock market for example was generally rising over this period the number of taxable returns declined ve ry slightly by half percent in 2001 when the effect of the higher 675000 exemp tion first registered this suggests that at 675000 the level of the exemption had cau ght up with the value of assets held by wealthy decedents in 2000 between 2001 and 2002 the number of taxable estate tax returns dropped by 13 even though the prevailing exemption remained at 675000 this suggests that the value of ssets widely held by wealthy decedents fell between 2000 and 2001 the stock market for example peaked in march 2000 and stock prices continued to fall til october 2002 it was not until 2002

as percent of deaths fell from 186 in 2002 to 136 in 2003 this suggests that at the 1 million level the exemption amount had outpaced the grow th between 2001 and 2002 in the value of assets held by wealthy decedents in 2004 the number of taxable returns dropped further by modest 6 from 33302 in 2003 to 31329 in 2004 as the 1 million exemption continued to prevail this suggest that there was

nearly 2000 or 6 in the number of taxable returns even more surprising taxes paid rose ve ry slightly by 03 to 217 billion in 2005 even though the numbe r of taxable returns dropped by 29 although the number of taxable estate tax returns filed in 2005 was less than half that in 1998 essentially the same nominal not inflationadjusted amount of estate tax was paid for both years 217 billion in 2005 compared with 203 billion in 1998 what explains the persistence of revenue s despite dramatic drop in the number of taxable estates while large in number the smallest estates as group contributed relatively little in taxes although the two lowe st gross estate size classes accounted for 33179 or 64 of the 51736 taxable returns filed in 2001 they contributed only 27 billion or 11 of the 235 billion in estate taxes paid the large decrease in the total number of taxable returns between 2001 and 2005 can be explained by the elimination from taxability of the large number of estates in the two lowest gross estate size categor ies under 1 million and 1 million up to 15 million after the prevailing exemption rose to 1 million in filing year 2003 there was further large decrease in the number of taxable returns in the 1 million to 15 million category and smaller decrease in the 15 million to 2 million category in filing year 2005 when the prevailing exemption rose to 15 million between 2004 and 2005 the 14 billion loss in estate taxes paid by these two smallest size classes plus 07 b illion loss in the 2 million to 35 million gross estate size class was more than offset by the 21 billion increase in taxes collected from the largest size class with gross estates of 20 million or more httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34418crs10 table 4 number of taxable returns filed in 20012006

luckeybetween 2005 and 2006 estate taxes paid increased by 138 to 247 billion even though the number of taxable returns increased by only 25 there was an increase in the number of taxable returns in each of the six size classes of over 15 million in gross estate this was accompanie d by an increase in the amount of estate taxes paid by each of the five size cla sses of over 20 million in gross estate totaling an additional 29 billion gift tax revenues fell after 2001 tax act gift tax law the gift tax is levied on the taxable tr ansfer of assets dur ing donors lifetime10 under the law prior to egtrra the estate and gift tax exemption was unified that is the exemption could be used to protect any combination of lifetime gifts andor bequests at death that added up to the dollar amount of the exemption for the year of death under the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra the unified applicable exclusion amount or exemption for lifetime taxable gifts together with bequests rose gradually from 600000 in 1997 to 675000 in 2001 the same graduated tax rate structure that applied to estates applied to cumulative taxable lifetime gifts in excess of the exemption amount in contrast under egtrra the exemp tion for cumulative lifetime gifts was capped separately at 1 million effective from 2002 onward even as the combined exemption for gifts and bequests rose from 1 million for decedents dying in 2002 and 2003 up to 35 million for decedents dying in 2009 refer back to table 1 furthermore under egtrra the gift tax is to remain in place in 2010 with cumulative lifetime exemption of 1 million ev when the estate tax is repealed the egtrra law means that beginning in 2002 once an individual has given away 1 million cumulatively over their lifetime they will owe gift taxes on any further gifts payable in the year followi ng the gift any amount of the gift taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34418crs12 11 for further explanation see crs report rl34374 estate tax legislation in the 110th congress by nonna noto 12 the revenue numbers cited in the remainder of this report differ from those presented in the last column of table 2 in at least three ways 1 they include gift taxes in addition to estate taxes 2 they are on fiscal year rath er than calendar year basis and 3 they are based on revenue collections data rather than on sampling of estate tax returnsexemption up to 1 million used by person during their lifetime is to be subtracted from the combined exemption applying in their year of death to determine the amount of the ex emption remaining to protect the estate from taxation so for example if an individual who has already given away 1 million in lifetime taxable gifts died in either 2006 2007 or 2008 when the combined exemption is 2 million per decedent there would be 1 million in exemption remaining for the estate in 2010 under egtrra the maximum gift tax rate will be capped at 35 equal to the maximum individual income tax rate under egtrra on cumulative lifetime taxable transfers over 500000 this is wer than the maximum rate of 45 scheduled to apply to estates and gifts in 2007 through 2009 under the bills that would permanently repeal the estate tax by simply repealing the sunset provision of egtrra this gift tax w ould remain in place after 201011 gift tax revenues through fy2001 gift taxes accounted for significant percentage of combined estate and gift tax revenues12 ever since the adoption of egtrra in 2001 with its announcement of estate tax repeal in 2010 ther has been substantial decline in the revenue collected from the

assets until after death that was present in prior law and remains in practic effect for small estates under egtrra recipients are likely to owe less in capital ga ins taxes when they sell capital asset received from bequest after death rather than from lifetime gift because of the difference in treatment of basis under bot h egtrra and prior law assets transferred by gift receive carryover basis the donors purchase price in contrast to stepup in basis the value at the time of the transfer under the law in effect through 2009 while the estate tax remains in effect recipients of assets transferred at death receive stepup in basis this cancels potential capital gains tax liability on the increa in the value of the asset during the decedents period of ownership under egtrra assets transferred at death during years when the estate tax is repealed 2010 and possi bly subsequent years if extended will receive modified carryover basis there is st epup allowance of 13 million per decedent plus 3 million for surviving spouse both indexed for inflation after 2010 these stepup allowances are likely to shelter most capital gains in small tates from income tax when the heirs sell the assets 14 for information on state revenues from these types of taxes see crs report rs20853 state estate and gift tax revenue by steven maguirea possible explanation for the decline in gift taxes is that many wealthy people chose to forgo the certainty of gift taxes if they transferred assets while they were alive in the hope that the estate tax woul d be repealed permanently and they would then be able to pass the assets along to beneficiaries taxfree upon their death13 forecasters at the us treasury department predict that revenue from the gift tax will remain low in the years remainin g prior to fy2011 but will be higher in fy2011 reflecting gifts made in 2010 before the scheduled re turn of the estate tax in 2011 estate and gift taxes contribute less than 2 of federal revenue as

estimates are based on the assumption that taxpayers would immediately begin to reduce taxable gifts during their lifetimes if they knew that the estate tax woul d be permanently repealed in 2010 in addition it is expected that enactme nt in 2008 of permanent repeal of the estate tax effective in 20 10 would modestly affect revenues from the individual income tax in two opposing ways fi rst lifetime charitable donations and accompanying tax deductions would fall thereby increasing income tax revenues second and larger in effect capital gains realizations by the elderly would fall as they wait to pass on their assets taxfree after death thereby decreasing current income tax revenue treasury project ed that for fy2008 through fy2010 net reductions in income taxes would add to the
