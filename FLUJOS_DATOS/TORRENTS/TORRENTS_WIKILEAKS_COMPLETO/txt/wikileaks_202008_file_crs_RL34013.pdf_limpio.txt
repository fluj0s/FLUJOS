to have given little consideration as to how its provisions might affect the various possessions and territories of the united states the first offshore jurisdiction to request exception from th flsa was puerto rico which in 1940 along with the virgin islands was given an exception under the act special industry committees were appointed to visit th caribbean islands and to recommend minimum wage rates consistent with the insular economies in the wake of world war ii new attention was focused upon the pacific islands american samoa basically had industry other than harvesting of copra the dried meat of the coconut and an ec onomy very different from the mainland in the early 1950s the department of the inte rior contracted with the van camp sea food company to move onto the island nd develop fish processing plant however the flsa minimum wage was regarded as too high to be competitive and in 1956 van camp appealed to congress to extend the puerto rican special industry committee sic model to american samoa thereafter the secretary of labor would review economic conditions and establish minimum rates the sics were admonished to reach as rapidly as is economically feasible without substantially curtailing employment the american standard under the flsa while the rates established by the committees were lower than those prevailing on the mainland the device was regarded as temporary during the 1980s and 1990s special treatment of puerto rico and th virgin islands was phased out and those islands came fully under the flsa of the three jurisdictions only american samoa remained under the sic structure fish processing has become samoas primary privates ector industry in early 2007 the minimum wage for the industry was 326 per hour the federal minimum wage was 515 per hour however in late may 2007 congress adopted hr 2206 pl 11028 which through series of step increases over several years would raise the federal minimum wage to 725 per hour at the same time the sic for american samoa was abolished and the insular minimum wage was raised through more prolonged series of step increases until the federal minimum level whatever that may ultimately become might be reached at least since the 1950s the companie s involved in fish processing have suggested that were the minimum wage to be raised to the national rate they might consider leaving the island and operating out of country where wage rates were more favorable now with the new wage rate for american samoa in effect what will be the reaction of the tuna canning companies will they improve

to provide minimum wages and overtime pay to limit child labor and to restrict industrial homework although the act w ould seem to have applied to the states and the territories to puerto ri co the virgin islands etc little thought appears to have been given to how that act might be applied to jurisdictions that were in significant ways economically different from the us mainland shortly after its pa ssage the act was modified in response to industry complaints puerto rico and the virgin islands were exempted from the full force of the act 1940 being placed under special industry committee

such evidence as may be necessary or appropriate the committee shall recommend to the administrator the highest minimum wage rates for the industry which it determines having due regard to economic

emphasized that few industries were located in the islands this company at the behest of the department of interior s gone to pago pago for the purpose of endeavoring to establish fishery and fish processing and canning plant it is on trial basis he suggested in the first 12 months of our experiment it has been found that the american samoans are adaptable to catching cleaning and processing fish and seafood but it takes 3 to 5 people to do nd perform what one american laborer or worker in the states can do if federa l wagehour sta ndards continue to apply in samoa there will be incentive for amer ican concerns to move in and build up the island10 further orme lewis assistant secretary of the interior doi wrote suggesting the need for special consideration for am erican samoa he

payments on the part of contractors perfor ming work for the department of defense were to be made at higher wage scales than those generally prevailing in the area these wages thomas stated would obviously distort the local economy and in some instances objections have been received from foreign governments thomas advised the speaker in addition such paym ent would result in higher costs to

appeared before the senate committee on labor and public welfare may 1956 seeking flsa amendment the industrys perspective william moore spoke for the company in 1952 doi had circulated an invitation to bi d on an unused facility at pago pago moore went out to the islands and presente d discouraging report noting that the supply of fish was not apparent and that the local refrigeration plant government owned was in rather poor re pair further moore stat ed we were aware or soon learned during our survey that the wagea ndhour laws applied to american samoa and it was very unlikely lthough we had not gotten into any operation at that time whether or not our company could pay th minimum wages as required in the united states nonetheless van camp bid on the opera tion and was awarded 5year lease with the provision that the first year would be an experimental period14 under the lease signed with the government of ameri can samoa the firm agreed to provide for improvement of the

house hearings 1956 p 19 moore explained that though the compan was operating at loss the loss was gradually diminishing and that the compan was the only industry that has come into the island from the outside15 in 1956 the company had about 300 employees reportedly mixture of british and american samoan16 their productivity it was explained was somewhat less than cannery workers on the mainland climatic conditions are not particularly conducive to energy and activities th temperature runs about 70 to 90 degrees throughout the year but there is high humidity upward of 80 in terms of turnover moore stated i am quite sure that the changeover in personnel there is less than it is stateside he adde d most of our employees are women17 moore then turned to the wagehour law stating that the cannery paid from 27 cents an hour to 1 an hour which is only paid 1 employee representative james roosevelt dca then suggested you come before this committee to establish the fact that you are having difficulty making any profit and that this payment of not less than the minimum wage would serious ly impair your profit picture or your chances of making profit the witness roosevelt stated comes as something of special pleader for his company there fore it seems to incumbent that you show us what effect it would have in some relation to your cost of operation or what it would do to you if you had to pay let us say 75 cents an hour or 1 an hour or whatever the wage law would require18 roosevelt then turned to another issu what would happen to regular us workers in canning factories on the west coast were the wage hour statute modified for american samoa moore responded that from january 1954 through january 1956 the total production was 3 ½ percent of the tota l production of van camps stateside plants for the same period roosevelt was not entirely satisfied mr roosevelt what i am trying to get at is that i want to make awfully sure that i understand from you that this is not going to be substantial part of your operation the plans of your compan and you and everybody else are such that they are not aimed at making this substantial part of your production mr moore that is true it is not going to be substantial part of our operations19 moore stated there may be some adva ntages gained on the one hand but these advantages are definitely offset by add itional expenses that we do not normally have stateside20 moore pointed to costs for the t he transportation of cans and cartons and oil and salt and labels and everything that goes into the product and everythinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34013crs6 21 house hearings 1956 p 16 22 house hearings 1956 p 19 23 house hearings 1956 pp 2122 24 house hearings 1956 p 37 25 house hearings 1956 p 39 has to be transported to samoa21 as for wages moore observed we have plan in effect now 2 cent an hour raise nnually that will increase those wages22 roosevelt further questioned moore on hi s statement that closing the cannery would have deleterious effect on the ge neral economy of the is land and would deter other firms from entering insular commerce might that be threat he reasoned by implication he suggested that means to that if you cannot get this relief that you would feel that it would be im possible for you to continue the operation representative roosevelt stated in other words what you have in essence said is that this is important to the economy there and which i believe it is and on the other hand i have to be shown that without this re lief it would not be possible for you to operate i for one would want and i think the committee would want some information to back up the statement that you would not consider this possible of continuation unless the relief which you seek is granted moore queried are you asking that we give you statement that says that unless we get this we will not continue roosevelt suggested that the interpretation had been correct to which moore answered mr moore it would put our costs out of line mr roosevelt and therefore in order to maintain the operation at approximately the same cost as your westcoast operation you would have to have this relief in order to stay in the islands mr moore that is right sir23 support from officials of government as the hearing progressed there was considerable speculation about the impact of the minimum wage for samoan workers phil landrum dga asked wayne aspina ll dco witness who had visited samoa what in his judgment would happen to van camp seafood co if the minimum wage were enforced in the islands it would fail aspinall stated it would close up and these people w ould be put out of employment24 but aspinall acknowledged that samoa has certain cultural advancements or attributes which are to necessary to have retained among those people just how far he added in reference to the samoan way of life or faasamoa you can go in bringing in industries and uprooting their traditiona

roosevelt from his understanding of th bill under consideration stated that they are not asking for complete exemp tion from the wage and hour law we are using the same machinery which is ready in effect in puerto rico so that the wage scale will be r eviewed and establishe d from time to time italics added roosevelt suggested that the possibility ex ists for instance that another industry might come into the area and we certainly would not want to just make blanket exemption and invite industry to co down and exploit these people27 it will readily be seen said willia m arnold assistant director office of territories doi that any application of stateside wage scales to industrial activity in american samoa would completely disrupt the local economy impose price inflation upon the people and create serious personnel and financia l problems for the territorial government to say nothing of the impact which such situation would exert on the prevailing economic conditions of neighboring islands and territories28 letter from richard barrett lowe governor of american samoa was read into the record the governor explained the modest character of economic life in the islands and stated as his first choi ce placing decisions concerning the minimum wage in the hands of the secretary of labor he urged congress at an early date to enact legislation that will exempt american samoa from the fair labor standards act29 the views of organized labor walter j mason aflcio legislative representative took different approach he pointed to the first and foremost challenge facing this committee as th removal of unnecessary and unjust exemptions now provided in the law he chose not to support further exemptions turning to the islands mason stated that samoan exemption would simply feed grist to the mills of the communist propaganda machine our relationship with the peoples in underdeveloped areas esp ecially those under us administration must be exemplary and beyond criticism30 if an exemption were made for american samoa he stated it might provide the precedent to permit interested parties to request other exemptions fro m coverage under the act that could

to placing the entire discretion within the hands of the secretary of labor32 finally he saw excuse for condoning past violations of law nonpayment of th minimum wage by extending retroactive immunity from prosecution to t hose who knowingly failed to comply with the acts requirements33 representative sam coon ror asked if mason would insist on payment of the minimum wage of 75 cents even though it would put them out of business mason replied i want them to stay in business and make money but i also want to see that the samoan workers get fair wage coon referred to the insular temperature as debilitating force mason responded what i am saying is that we should take look at it and consider all as pects of what the repercussions may be he affirmed i do not think th ere is any need for hasty action34 if other options were not sustainable roosevelt questione d what course might be acceptable to labor mason reluctantly suggested the virgin islands formula with committees set up on tripartite basis so that all parties concerned will take part in arriving at fair determination of what the minimum wage should be again if samoa should be exempted from the st atutory minimum i be lieve the procedure should follow along the same lines that we have for the virgin islands35 others voiced economic concerns the seafarers international union explained that van camp tuna canneries located in san diego and rminal island calif employ approximately 2000 tunacannery workers and pay 165 and 185 for women and men respectively tuna from lowwage labor in samoa enter the continental united states duty free and ar sold to consumers under the same van camp label as tuna canned domestically this he suggested is unfair competition to the domestic tuna industry and its workers36 and representative earl chudoff dpa suggested as possibility that goods would be manufactured in possession at very cheap labor rates and would be sent into the united states and sold cheaper than our own people could manuf acture them chudoff was open to the establishment of industry board s or something to provide for fair labor scale in samoa37 the senate hearings of 1956 moore spokesman for van

with female employment increasing steadily because of outmigration of workers especially in the 2029 age bracket large number of skilled craftsmen in the islands were from western samoa or tonga about 3660 peopl roughly 35 percent worked for the american samoan government about 6740 were in the private sector with the majority of these employed in the tuna canneries57 thus the government and the canneries were primary employ ers and held substantial and continuing interest in employee compensation within the tuna industry about 65 to 70 of cost was attributable to raw fish the price of fish is negotiated between the vessel operators and the processors and the contract period varies from several months to several years depending upon perceived harvesting conditions and an ticipated demand however cannery workers with little organization in west ern industrial context received low wages that kept labor market expenses down it is this situation that has enabled imports to capture so much

it seems to have shared an interest in keeping wages low one witness argued that an increase to 335 per hour would have deleterious impact for the insular budget yet the director of nursing stated that nurses and other workers in the government medical center were grossly underpaid with resulta nt shortage of qualif ied help which has adversely affected the quality of health care in american samoa having heard the witnesses the committee concluded that an increase in the minimum wage to 335 an hour spread over twoyear peri od would not significantly curtail employment opportunities65 witnesses for the tuna industry pointed to the precarious position of the industry confronted with fish from othe r lowwage areas and argued that there should be increase in the industrys minimum wage rate66 however there was another side to that equation evidence presented to the committee showed that production costs for the as american samoa tuna canne ries between 1983 and 1985 declined substantially while the value of tuna shipments from as increased very substantially from 1983 to 1984 the latest available data also the committee heard evidence that the tuna industry in as enjoyed substantial advantages including favorable tariff posture compared to foreign producers an exemption which permits raw fish to be landed in as in foreign vessels not permitted in puerto rico or the mainla nd resulting in lower raw fish prices which constitute 60 to 70 of total costs and minimum wages 46 lower than average lowest regular wages for tuna canning in puerto rico and 135 lower than in the mainland us the committee further pointed to tax incentives provided by the samoan government with other similar advantages that have further contributed to highly favorable economic situation for the ca nneries reluctance of the industry to present evidence even unde r seal from the committee emed to raise further doubts the committee raised the industry standard to 33567 gradually from one

situation in samoa committee that met this year failed to adequately comprehend the reasons that congress had determined that special minimum wage should apply in th territory italics added udall explained the rate increases could cost the territorial government 7 million by fy1988 cost the federal government might have to make up in addition there were clear indications that it would also force the tuna canning industry which directly and indirectly accounts for half of the private sector employment in the territory to substantially shift its operations to foreign locations the new rates udall stated have already discouraged proposed investment from locating in the islands and would make american samoa more uncompetitive than it already is as place of doing business he continued reasonable increases are warranted and we would favor increases as great as are reasonable the proposed increases he stated are not reasonable however72 udall stated that the language of the insular areas regulation act does not amend the flsa nor does it modify the st atutory system for periodic review and revision of minimum wages in american samoa instead he stated it merely suspends the current wage order and continues the prior minimum wage in effect pending the recommendations of new industry committee convened in accordance with existing law he admonished any further committee to

time montoya referred to the plight of the t canneries and othe r business and stated that an increase in the minimum wage w ould be counter productive to efforts to to expand the employment base in the private sector of the american samoan economy ultimately montoya recomme nded the committee grant increase in any of the minimum wage rates at this time79 the committee was reminded of representative udalls comments 1 the extent to which rates facilitate maximum employment 2 the extent to which they enable american samoa businesses to be competitive within the region and 3 the potential impact on the insular and federa l budgets it was noted that such considerations could be related to the committees assessment of the impact of any possible changes in the current flsa minimum wage80 emphasis added the new committees recommendations the committee commenced with the two major industries of the islands representatives of the government and the tuna canneries presented great quantity of economic data gove rnment witnesses emphasized budget and fiscal constraints spokesmen fo r the tuna industry suggested the increasing competition from foreign imports from lowwage count ries and stated that the various economic advantages of performing thei r operations in american samoa were lessening the committee was unable to agree on whether an increase in the minimum wage would substantially curtail employment and so made recommendations thus the old wage remained in place government workers and cannery employees would not receive raise81 similar controversies swirled around other industries in petroleum marketing evidence was presented to the committee however the largest employer stated that his business was heavily dependent on business from the fish processing and canning industry82 so they voted 4 to 2 against an increase in shipping and transportation testimony suggested that much of the business activity in this category depended in some way upon the fish processing and canning industry one segment was given 10 cents the first year and 10 cents the second83 in construction workers would receive 10 cents the first year and 10 cents the next84 other

the timing of the committees work was deferred improving the quality of evidence when establishing an sic for american samoa in 1956 it was assumed that the committee would operate under the same ru as committees in puerto rico and the virgin islands however in the early 1970s group of agricultural workers in puerto rico argued that their rates under the flsa should be increased because their employers had not established beyond reasonable doubt that they were not able to pay higher wage without substan tially curtailing employ ment gradually the issue led to the courts affirming substantial documentary evidence 1974 regulations of the period suggested that tangible objectiv data must be assembled to show that employers were not able to raise wages to the federal minimum standard for puerto rico it seems data may not have been possible to obtai n the farmers were often poorly educated and may not have had p rofit and loss statements or balance sheets in such situations the sic c ould make recommendations on the basis of evidence which is available but the c ourt argued those recommendations must be sustained by the evidence in the puer to rican case it found the record devoid of single subsidiary finding to support the committees conclusion86 when reporting legislation that would evolve into the 1974 flsa amendments the house committee on education and labor referred to the puerto rican case and explained that congress intended that findings of the sics would be based on recordevidence adequate to reveal th financial and econo mic condition of

that as long as it is part of the procedure to have these industry co mmittees let them be required to support their conclusions with s ubstantial documented evidence89 thus in the 1974 flsa amendments there appeared an explanation that there must be substantial documentary eviden ce including pertinent unabridged profit and loss statements and balance sheets for representative period of years or where the employees are of the government ther appropriate in formation that documentation must establish that an indus try or predominant portion thereof is unable to pay that wage90 controversy over the minimum wage rate 1990 gradually dol began to distinguish between puerto rico and the virgin islands on the one hand and american samoa on the other91 in the 1976 report to the congress it noted if the committee has objective data tablishing the industrys inab ility to pay the mainland rate the committee except in american samoa is required under the 1974 flsa amendments to recommend the mainla nd rate without regard to the other criteria92 italics added in the late 1980s american samoa was in effect company town or more precisely three company island it may not be surprising therefore that the canneries and the samoan government opposed minimum wage in creases and where increases were unavoidable soug ht to keep them to the lowest possible level in so doing the canneries have been afforded relatively low wage workforce and the government with doi support has kept its budget accordingly low conversely there seems to have been little alternative to existing work at whatever the wage rate given the isolated location of american samoa when in march 1990 secretary dole announced appointment of sic 19 special reference was made to evid entiary requirement s on ju ne 12 1990 samoan governor peter tali coleman wrote to the department of the interior on that issue governor coleman stated the provision requires the industry committee to impose the mainland

hardship the language of the amendment makes it clear that the evidence necessary to justify special wage orders relates to economic and competitive conditions on the island which affect the employment situation for samoans104 thus the measure passed the house the amended version requi red reconsideration by the senate and on october 27 the nate agreed to the housepassed bill105 the

welfare and wellbeing of american samoan workers whom he suggested were sometimes neglected nd overlooked in the crush of other important national issues our objective he noted is to bring the samoan wage up to par with the federal rate as rapidly as possi ble without curtailing employment107 comments from public officials governor peter tali colemans testimony submitted for the record began the american samoa government vigorously opposes this bill it woul d raise artificially the minimum wage of american samoa without taking into account the status of its economic development coleman urged an apprecia tion of the uniqueness of our culture and its impact in the workplace describing samoa as group of very small islands with few natural and human resources he stated we are heavily dependent on the economic strength of our largest private sector employers the tuna canneries these two companies starkist and van camp are responsible for much of our economic growth coleman added that he wa s especially troubled by the potential for substantial increases in unemployment emphasis in the original he continued we lack the diversity capital raw material s skill levels market or transportation systems of the united states geographically the territory is remote and isolated our natural resources are severely limited tuna canning continues as our primary private sector em ployer rather than improving the income levels of our people thousa nds may be thrown out of work with present job alternatives the sic system works well in american samoa under that system statistical data and economic conditions are examined to determine whether the territorys minimum wages can be increased without substantially curt ailing empl oyme nt coleman concluded this is simply an ill conceived piece of legislation it fails to take into account how the present system is working or the tremendous adverse consequences that coul d result from enactment108 delegate faleomavaegas

answer to why american samoa unlike people in other us territories are told they must be satisfied with the substandard wages t by the department of labors industry committees it may be faleomavaega suggested that starkist and van camp invaluable mainstays of our territorys economy are overly sensitive from media reports one hears of highly compensated executives whose corporate income is many times more than the combined annual salari of the 2500 cannery laborers gutting tuna in pago pago such reports may be w rong or outright lies but perhaps the canneries should open their books and t their financial records speak for themselves he observed continuing to fail to divulge relevant financial information while pleading lack of funds for wage increases will only be seen as sign of bad faith still he suggested that it was licate economic balance that must be struck to keep our canneries in the territory109 john r fraser deputy wagehour administrator resisted any increase there was concern that the industry might re spond to larger increase by shifting production to lowercost areas possibly resu lting in very significant reductions in employment in the american samoan canneri this was of special concern in an economy dominated by only two major employers and where there is scant evidence that the territory can significantly expand its employment base in other areas to provide add itional job opportunities110 donald senese deputy assistant secretary for territorial and international affairs doi was equally ca ndid he recalled the abor tive sic 17 and suggested that hr 4011 was essentia lly the same proposal detailed economic studies suggested he stated that any large increase in minimum wages would encourage the tuna canneries to move at least some of their operations from american samoa in our view he concluded the artificial settin g of wage rates at the us minimum would be very likely to eliminate the tuna canning industry and in turn threaten to destroy the entire private sector economy of american samoa111 comments from the industrial sector in over 30 years as an executive with starkist robert w hetzler stated i have seen the tuna industry change from homebred domestic industry to the foreigndominated business it is today he added as this shift has occurred the industry has suffered massive job losses first in california and more recently in puerto rico as tuna processors have moved to lower labor cost areas such as thailand indonesia and the philippines as costs to us producers rise compounding the cost advantages of foreign producershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34013crs27 112 house hearing 1992 pp 5152 113 house hearing 1992 pp 5253 in subse quent testimony p 84 jose munoz ceo of van camp agreed that the majority of lower

the absence of routine living costs most cannery workers do not pay rent ther is property tax clothing costs are minimal due to the singleseason climate and medical costs are covered nearly 100 percent by the government some workers were not american large majority of cannery workers in american samoa are from western samoa113 the government hetzler stated continues to add costs to us industry through labor regulations environmen tal controls and numerous ot her measures there is simply replacement industry and way to recover the cost increases in the marketplace further if government desires to place such wage and other controls on industry job and business transfers to foreign low cost areas will result114 jose munoz president and ceo of van ca mp argued that the

american samoa 2003 us department of bor employment standards ad ministration wage and hour division may 2003 p 9 concluding summary throughout most of the united states the minimum wage is floor the lowest wage that can legally be paid to covered workers in american samoa the minimum wage tends to represent both fl oor and ceiling though some rates do go up few cents beyond the minimum it ppears that most fish processing workers in samoa are paid at or near the minimum wage through now fifty years 19562007 american samoa had been under the special industry committee structure during the early years that option included puerto rico and the virgin islands ho wever during the late 1980s and into the 1990s puerto rico and the virgin islands graduated to full minimum wage leaving only american samoa under the sic umbrella where the two caribbean territories have special characteristics that have allowed for the gradual elevation to full minimum wage american samoa is in somewhat different position samoa evidences serious or sustained moveme nt into an industrial world with diversified economy123 american samoa is isolated 2300 mile s southwest of hawaii the population though modest by mainland standards s been expanding perhaps now to about 60000 or little above distances render ma jor tourism unlikely there may be some market for handicrafts but hardly enough to sustain even nativeresident workers under current marketing arrangements in spite of relatively high level of samoan unemployment somewhere in the teens during recent years124 workers often arrive from western samoa former british colony now independent to engage in fish canning and to replace those workers who migrate to the states there would seem to be little interest in trade unionization and it appears the territory offers little reward for national labor federations in the early 1950s the department of the interior sought tenant for vacant fish processing plant at pago pago the search seems to have been difficult but van camp sea foods took up the challenge soon the firm was confronted with payment of federal minimum wage in order to sustain its insular existence van camp sought two concessions from the congress first the minimum wage for the island should be overturned pl acing responsibility in the hands of special industry committee under the secretary of labor as d been done for puerto rico and the virgin islands second it sought immunity from past underpayment of the minimum wage in samoa in each case congress concurredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34013crs31 125 see amerika samoa the

private sector as the primary employer for workers in the canneries there would seem little option but to take jobs at whatever wages the companies chose to pay assuming that the sic and the congress would agree second option less desirable by insular standards would have been to migrate to the states or elsewhere with the first dispatch of sic to the islands in 1957 the native economy was assessed and minimum wage wa s assigned to be updated every year or two at first cannery workers were to be paid 38 cents an hour petroleum workers earned 45 cents an hour shipping 40 cents and miscellaneous workers 35 cents the upward movement was slow until in 1986 si c 17 determined that the federal minimum wage 335 per hour could be instituted without endangering employment however under pressure from the canneries and the insular government the judgment of sic n 17 was overturned and congress urged reestablishment of lower rate125 what some may have seen as furthe r setback occurred in 1990 when congress enacted legislation reducing the level of evidence required in or der for an employer to affirm his or her inability to meet minimum wage payroll further in 1992 legislation was introduced that would have increased the insular minimum over time to the full federal minimum rate but with industry in full opposition the bill was not adopted since that time little new s developed in 2001 sic 24 visited the islands and raised the wage for fish cannery workers from 320 to 326 further increases in that category of work it seems have been instituted though committees were dispatched in 2003 and 2005 and would have met in 2007 other rates of pay for insular workers have remained similarly low in 1992 john r fraser of dol explained that there is concern that the industry tuna might respond to large in crease in the minimum wage by shifting production to lowercost areas and for that reason the department opposed legislation to provide equality with the general federal rate126 robert w hetzler of starkist was more blunt were the tuna industry to disappear the entire samoan economy will collapse resulting in massive social welfar costs to the government of american samoa and the united states there is he stated simply replacement industry and way to rec over the cost increases in the market place127 that rationale however justified by insular economic conditions
