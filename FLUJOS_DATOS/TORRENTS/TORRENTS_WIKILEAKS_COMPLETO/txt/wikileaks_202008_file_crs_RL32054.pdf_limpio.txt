demands for greater public commitment to home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities have drawn the attention of federal and state policymakers for some time spending on longterm care by both the public and private sectors is significant in 2001 spending for longterm care services for persons of all ages represented 122 of all personal health care spending lmost 152 billion of 124 trillion federal and state governments accounted for almo st twothirds of all longterm care spending by far the primary payer for longterm care is the federalstate medicaid program which in 2001 paid for almost half of all longterm care spending many states have devoted significant fforts to respond to the desire for home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities and their families nevertheless financing of nursing home care chiefly by medicaid still dominates most states spending for l ongterm care to assist congress understand issues that states face in providing longterm care services the congressional research service crs undertook study of 10 states in 2002 th is report one in series of ten state reports presents background and analys is about longterm care in florida florida has the largest proportion of elderly in the nation 28 million persons are over age 65 representing 176 of its tota l population the dramatic rise in the number of persons age 65 and over in florida over the next 20 yearsestimated to total 263 of total populati onwill further stretch the already limited resources of the state aware of the pressing demand for longterm care services well into the 21st century policymakers in florida have be gun seriously to review options for improving financing and livery of longterm care for the frail elderly and persons with disabilities federal and state medicaid spending in florida was 26 billion in fy2001 and 305 of medicaid spending was for long term care in fy2001 753 of total medicaid spending was for institutional care slightly less than 25 of medicaid spending was channeled towards home nd communitybased services although institutional care dominated medicaid spending there has been slow but steady expansion of home and communitybased rvices funding both through the use of medicaids waiver programs as well as significant support through state sources among the major issues facing longterm care in florida are the fragmentation of longterm care services among state and local agencies an imbalance in financing that favors institutional care rather than home and community based care shortage of health care workers and welltraine d staff throughout the longterm care continuum and disparities in availability of services across the state the 10state study was funded in part by grants from the jewish

current federal financing system paid through medicaid is structurally biased in favor of institutional care state gove rnments face significant challenges in refocusing care systems given the structure of current federal fina ncing many states have devoted significant efforts to change their longterm care systems to expand home and communitybased services for persons with disabilities and their families nevertheless financing of nursing home care primarily through the medicaid program still dominates most states spending on longterm care today while some advocates maintain that the federal government should play larger role in providing support for home and co mmunitybased care congress has not yet decided whether or how to change current federal policy one possibility is that congress may continue an in cremental approach to longterm care without major federal policy involve ment leaving to state governments the responsibility for developing strategies that support home

choosing to modify their programs for longterm care face significant challenges financing of nursing home care has dominated longterm care spending for decades the federal financing structure that created incentives to support institutional care reaches back to 1965 number of converging factors have supported reliance on nursing home spending prior to enactment of medicaid homes for the aged and other public institutions were financed by combination of direct payments made by individuals with their social security old age assistance oaa benefits and vendor payments made by states with federal matching pa yments on behalf of individuals the kerrmills medical ssistance to the aged maa program enacted in 1960 predecessor to medicai d allowed states to provide medical services including skilled nursing home services to persons who were not eligible for oaa cash payments thereby expanding the eligible population1 in 1965 when kerrmills was transforme d into the federalstate medicaid program congress created an entitlement to skilled nursing facility care under the expanded program the social security amendments of 1965 required that states provide skilled nursing facility services and gave nursing home care the same level of priority as hospital and physician rvices amendments in 1967 allowed states to provide care in intermediate care facilities icfs for persons who did not need skilled nursing home care but needed more than room and board in 1987 congress eliminated the distinction between skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities

functional eligibility requirements for entry into nursing home he or she is entitled to the benefit these early legislative developments we re the basis for the beginnings of the modern day nursing home industry sign ificant growth in the number of nursing homes occurred during the 1960s from 1960 to 1970 the number of homes more than doubled from 9582 to almost 23000 and the number of beds more than tripled from 331000 to more than one million2 today there are about 17000 nursing homes with 18 million beds3 during the latter part of the 1960s and the 1970s nursing home care attracted great deal of congressional oversight as result of concern about increasing federal expenditures and pattern of instances of fraud and abuse that was becoming evident between 1969 and 1976 the subcommittee on longterm care of the senate special committee on aging held 30 hearings on problems in the nursing home industry4 home care services received some congressional attention in the authorizing statute home health care services were one of the optional services that states could provide under the 1965 law three years later in 1968 congress amended the law to require states to provide home health care services to pers ons entitled to skilled nursing facility care as part of their stat medicaid plans effective in 1970 during the 1970s the department of health ducation and welfare now health and human services dhhs devoted attention to alternatives to nursing home care through variety of federal research and demonstration efforts these efforts were undertaken not only to find ways to offset the high costs of nursing facility care but also to respond to the desires of persons w ith disabilities to remain in their homes and in community settings rather than in in stitutions however it was

secretary of dhhs may waive certain medi caid state plan requirements to allow states to cover wide range of home and communitybased services to persons who otherwise meet the states eligibility

covered as an option of states and under the law persons are not entitled to these services as they are to nursing facility care moreover states are allowed to set cost caps and limits on the numbers and types of persons to be served under their wavier programs notwithstanding wide use of the section 1915c waiver authority by states over the last two decades total spending for medicaid home and communitybased services waivers is significantly less than institutional care about 144 billion in 2001 compared to 531 billion for nursing f acility care services and care for persons with mental

devoted to longterm care in fy2001 nursing home spending represented almost twothirds of total medicaid longterm care spending in fy2001 florida spent 551 million on medicaid section 1915chome and communitybased waiver programs twelve times the amount spent in 1990 even after adjusting for inflation according to consumer advocates most of the public spending for longterm care for the elderly has been for nursing homes and there has been significantly less emphasis on home and communitybased services however the opposite is true for the developmental disabilities programs where there has been large increase in public funds for supporting home and communitybased care both state and federal funding for deve lopmental services increased 94 from 5028 million in 1998 to 975 million in 2002 issues in financing and delivery of longterm care fragmentation of services at all levels and across all agencies is significant problem according to state officials there are many instances where three or four ag encies are responsible for portions of single program accordin g to state documents fragmentation in the delivery system creates unnecessary delays in delivery of services florida has eleven discrete medicaid waiver programs eachcovering discrete populations wh ich has led to categorical approach to service delivery to the frail elderly and the disabled and those with mental retardation and developmental disabilities while the waiver programs have ex panded opportunities for home and communitybased services accordin g to state officials and stake holders having severa l waivers covering di fferent populations with different sets of elig ibility criteria has further complicated access to services recurring theme discussed by state officials is the view that thefederal financing system under dicaid guarantees heavy use of institutional care this is largely due to the fact that nursing facility care is an entitlement under medicai d for persons needing such care who meet its eligibility criteria whereas home and communitybased services is not according to state officials and consumer advocates consumers inflorida do not have access to si ngle source of information about longterm care creating statewide system that is consumer friendly has been challenging to state administratorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32054crs7 background demographic trends with

supplemental security income and ssdi social security disability insurance and to service providers through the medicaid program and significant litigation brought on behalf of persons with mental

several decades large st ateoperated institutions have been closed or downsized development that has been prompted by litigation the majority of the states initiatives fo r providing non institutional services for persons with developmental disabilities and mental retardation have been driven by class action law suits filed against the state of florida to prevent the state from unnecessary institutionalzation of these individuals in major law suit wolf prado steinman et v bush et al67 advocates within the developmentally disabled community argued that individuals who participated in fl

longterm care services has evolved over time incorporating federal state and local initiatives and has emerged as loosely connected set of programs florida is f aced with many challenges in the implementation and delivery of longterm care services the following discussion highlights the key issues identified in state reports and task forces as well as issues that surfaced during crs interviews with state officials providers consumers and advocacy groups institutional bias recurring theme in discussions of longterm care with state officials is the view that the federal financing system guarantees heavy use of institutional care this is largely due to the fact that nursing facility care is an entitlement under medicaid for persons who need such care and meet the eligibility criteria financing of institutional care is federal mandate home and community based care is not although states ma choose to provide home and community based services under various medicaid opti ons state officials indicate that state funding constraints and the provider system that was created as result of the institutional entitlement make it difficult to reorient the system according to state officials the majority of public funding for longterm care is medicaid spending for institutional care which leaves little funding to promote care in the community which many prefer officials noted that while the rhetoric regarding changing the institutional bias has intensified over the years actually accomplishing this objective is difficult and moving very slowly they indicated that the impetus for heavy reliance on institutional care is built into the incentive structure for providers resulting in vast funding disparities between institutional care and home and communitybased care state officials and stakeholders stated that the institutional bias has resulted in provider culture that is ofte n counter to the desires of the population needing long term care services and supports another major impediment for states in pl anning an effective and efficient long term care system is the difficulty of managing the interrelationship of incentives between the medicare and medicaid financing systems and the effect that care of acute illnesses has on the eventual need for longterm care additionally states have little control over the admission of patient into nursing home since the initial portion of nursing home stay is financed by medicare if person needs skilled care or through persons own income nd assets once person longer needs skilled care or persons income and resources are exhausted medicaid may finance nursing home stays one method to address the perceived th institutional bias is to control or downsize institutional capacity according to the interim project report by the florida senate the state regulates th number of nursing home beds via the certificate of need program the program requires that health care providers obtain state approval before offering new or expanded nursing home services it is designed to ensure that the supply of be ds does not greatly exceed demand and slowshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32054crs45 87 florida senate interim project report 2002136 nov 2001 p 3 88 the federal communication commission f cc on july 21 2000designated the 3digit telephone number 211 for easy access to community human service information florida is one of the states in the nation th at has implemented 211 program the expansion of nursing homes87 senate bill 1202 enacted on may 15 2001 comprehensive longterm care reform bill placed moratorium on the construction of nursing homes with the intent to limit the increase in medicaid nursing home expenditures and invest the saved funds in communitybased care see earlier description of the program unde r trends in institutional care state officials and stakehol ders indicated that the sy stem should be changed so that nursing homes are an exception rather than the rule from their perspective home and communitybased care should be consid ered first and then if services are judged to be inappropriate or unavailable the alternative would be an institutional placement in addition stat officials note the need to have in place methods to divert people from nursing homes who in ar danger of spending down their income and assets and thereby establishing medicaid eligibility for instance florida has implemented the nursing home diversion waiver program in selected counties to provide home and community based servi ces to persons who otherwise may seek nursing home care lack of statewide home and communitybased services system while florida has made significant strides in developing initiatives to improve its longterm care services it still lacks strong home and communitybased system according to state officials and consum er advocates consumers in florida do not have access to single source of information about longterm care creating statewide system that is consumer friendly has been challenging at present the state is experimenting with creatin g an eligibility access system that is integrated with an information and referral system the 211 pilot project88 is being implemented by ahca and dcf in duval county where the eligibility determina tion process will be merged with an information and referral system sponsored by the united way of north east florida according to state officials and stakehol ders having severa l waivers to cover different populations with diffe rent sets of eligibility cr iteria has further complicated access to services for instance florida has eleven discrete medicaid waiver programs each covering disc rete populations leading to categorical approach to service delivery to the frail elderly and persons with disabilities they indicated that provider participa tion has been complicated by excessive bureaucratic requirements such as separate enrollment in each waiver program and complex set of rules governing each waiver the procedures for locating the appropriate waiver or other service program and the administering agency and trying to fit needs into the prescribed waiver requirements can be burdensome for clients according to recent report presented to the state legislature by the cares program physicians know very little about community based longterm care

care decisions are made families ar often in crisis and do not know that there may be alternatives to institutional care90 fragmentation of respons ibilities for longterm care according to state officials and stakehol ders there is still too much fragmentation and duplication in the administration of longterm care in the state this fragmentation stems from the multiple agencies that are responsible for administration and implementation of longterm care at the state and local levels while one agency is responsible for determining functiona l eligibility another agency is responsible for determining financial eligibility this makes coordination of services very paperand staff intensive according to report published by the office of program policy analysis and government accountability oppaga n office of the florida legislature the medicaid waiver financial eligibility process can be laborintensive and time consuming which may make it difficult for some frail elders to complete the report further stated that 1274 clients who had applied for medi caid waiver program financial eligibility in august 2001 had to wait an average of 59 months for their eligibility to be determined91 moreover according to the cares report due to the time it takes for financial eligibility determination f amilies are more willing to place family members in nursing facil ities from an acute care setting knowing medicare will pay the bills for the short term92 most of the challenges are attributable to lack of understanding or agreement among the parties involved with respect to final administrative authority and financing of coordinated programs the report found that given the complicated administrative structure and many bureaucratic layers the department of elder affairs had not been able to provide cce lead agencies area agencies on aging and local service providers with clear guidelines and timely technical assistance to enable them to effectively implement policy changes93 of the longterm care system in the state to address coordination issues the legi slature established an office of long term care policy housed in the departme nt of elder affairs as part of

the governor and the stat legislature in february 2003 according to the report fragmentation of services at all levels and among agencies creates unnecessary delays for clients and duplicative functions for agencies94 as with longterm care services for the elderly several agencies share responsibilities for providing services for the disabled there are 5 different agencies that handle disability issues in florida medicaid services are handled by the agency for health care administration the depar tment of health is responsible for the licensing of healthcare workers the st ate department of education provides vocational rehabilitation and blind services the department of elder affairs is responsible for disability issues with regard to elderly citizens in florida and the department of children and families dcf is responsible for administering the developmental disabilities program for both children and adults quality of longterm care like many states florida has grappled with issues related to the quality of care provided by nursing homes and assisted living facilities quality of care was the basis for large number of law suits filed against nursing homes the state legislature accepted suggestions from the task force on the availability and affordability of l ongterm care and dur ing its 2002 session passed senate bill 1276 which was signed in to law on ma 1 2 002 am ong its provisions was the creation of managed in tegrated longterm care pilot program this program will test the feasibility of having single entity coordinate the continuum of statefunded programs for the elderly in addition the law provided for establishing consumer directed care pr ogram to provide elders with choices in their longterm care and more direct role for the department of elder affairs in the longterm care ombudsman program anot her key piece of legislation was senate bill 1202 comprehensive longterm care reform bill this bill significantly affected the funding opera tion regula tion liability coverage requirements and litigation aspects of nursing homes and assisted living facilities alfs longterm care staffing perhaps the most notable provision of sb 1202 is the requirement for new staffing ratio s in nursing homes and assisted living facilities the legislation directed the agency for health care administration to adopt rules specifying minimum staffing standard for certifie d nursing assistants of 23 hours of direct care per resident per day beginning january 1 2002 26 hours beginning january 1 2003 28 hours beginni ng january 1 2004 and increasing to 29 hours beginning january 1 2005 the nursing assistant staff ratio is never to fall below one certified nursing assistant per 20 residents minimum licensed nursing standard of 10 hour of direct resident care per resident per day is also established the licensed nursing staff ratio is neve r to fall below one licensed nurse per 40 residents each nursing home is required to document compliance with these staffing standards and post the name s of staff on duty dailyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32054crs48 95 the florida senate interim project report 2001025 feb 2001 96 office of program policy

are set at less th an 10000 but cannot exceed 25000 previous fines for these type of deficiencies were from 5000 to 25000 the agency must levy such fines notwithstanding the correction of the deficiency penalties for class ii deficiencies those that have direct or immediate relationship to health safety or security of residents are set at an amount less than 5000 not to exceed 10000 the penalty for class iii deficiency an indirect or potential relationship to health safety or security of re sidents is set at less than 1000 not to exceed 2500 for each deficiency another issue that faces the state is the medicaid and medicare reimbursement methodologies that do not provi adequate incentives for staff retention house bill 1971 passed by the state legislature in 1999 created panel on medicaid reimbursement to make recommendations for florid as medicaid reimbursement plan the panel determined that quality of care for nursing home residents is likely to be affected due to the difficulty providers are experiencing in hiring and retaining staff and improving the physical facilities95 waiting lists for home and communitybased care waiting list for frail elderly and disabled according to the office of program policy analysis and government accountability oppaga report significant barriers to home and communitybased services have resulted in waiting lists for services during sfy 2002 69482 applicants at risk for nursi ng homes placement were assessed by cares staff and of those 235 of appli cants were referred for waiver services according to the cares barrier re port for sfy2001 2232 clients who were recommended for home or communitybased placement could not receive such services and were placed in nursing homes among the reasons attributed for this situation include the following many clients did not have caregivers to help them stay in the community of the 2232 clients for whom home and community based services were recommend ed threequarters did not have caregivers and were subsequently placed in nursing homes some persons were placed in nursing homes before home andcommunitybased services starte d in fy2001 87 of clients were on waiting lists for waiver services when they were placed in nursing homes and some individuals who applied for community based care neededspecialized services such as assisted living facilities that offer mental health services of the 2232 clients placed in nursing homes 59 were placed in such institutions because there was lack of specialized community services 96httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32054crs49 96

disability advocates stated that when g overnor jeb bush took office there was large number of pending law suits regarding waiting lists for services for those with developmental disabilities the number of floridians w ith developmen tal disabilities who were being fully served was less than 10000 instead of contesting these law suits the governor proposed more funding to eliminate the waiting list from 1999 2002 state funding for developmental servi ces increased by 94 to total of 975 million however the waiting list issue still remains when more people came into the program there were not enough providers to meet the demand the legislature was not pleased that the increase in funds was not eliminating the waiting lists after the events of september 11th 2001 and the economic recession governor jeb bush requested all state agencies to cut back on spending due to decline in state tax revenue the developmental disabilities program cut back by broadly defining medical necessity and publishing new service directory due to the vocal advocacy of consumers family member s and advocacy organizations the governor expressed his desire for system redesign to addr ess the issues facing the developmental disabilities program the department of children and families is working with the agency for health care administration on viable longterm redesign of the service delivery system that is consumerdirected and choicebased th longterm redesign also seeks to increase efficiency and flexibility in both administrative and programmatic areas the completed system redesign was scheduled for delivery during july 200397 for the state fiscal year 20022003 gove rnor bush has requested large amount of funds to reduce the waiting list fo r developmental disability services the governor had requested 90 million increas in funding for the developmental disabilities program and the state legi slature appropriate d 60 million however according to consumer advocates the wa iting lists do not include people currently residing in intermediate care facilities icfsmr or state institutions who would like to move out additionally individuals who would like to move out of these institutions are
