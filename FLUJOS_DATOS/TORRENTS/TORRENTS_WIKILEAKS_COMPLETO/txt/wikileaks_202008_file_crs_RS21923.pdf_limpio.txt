growing the united nations united nations childre ns fund unicef and the world health organization who have expressed their views that fgm is violation of human rights and have made number of recommendations designed to end the practice in addition number of international declarations and conventions have deemed female gen ital mutilation to be violation of human rights including the universal declaration of human rights the international covenant on civil and political rights the convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degradi ng treatment or punishment and the declaration on the elimination of violence against women7 the united states considers fgm crime and us immigration courts recognize it as form of persecution in asylum adjudications it appears however that only few women have been granted asylum in the united states and elsewhere under these terms the united states largely through the us agency for international development usaid seeks to eliminate fgm through number of strategies first in september 2000 the agency incorporated fgm eradicati on into its general development agenda particularly within its family planning initia tives second usaid collaborates with other groups to advocate for research policy ch ange and public awareness on the harmful effects of fgm finally it advocates be havior change and alternative rituals8 despite the international efforts antifgm legislation has not ended the practice in many countries for example although brita in banned the practice almost 20 years ago an estimated 74000 african women have

rl32480 immigration consequences of criminal activity by michael john garcia and larry m eiggaww advocates for stiffer penalties including the prosecution of parents who force or allow their daughters to undergo fgm11 analysts contend that current laws are not wholly effective in combating the practice because they are rarely enforced and are limit ed in scope and juri sdiction some argue that the laws should be expanded to punish those who help the practitioners such as parents extended family members and co mmunity members additionally advocates call for greater regional coope ration critics of gislationonly approaches to combat fgm point out that while the african union has created legal framework to help countries enforce antifgm laws only 16 afri can countries have adopted such laws12 proponents of antifgm initiatives argue th at the inability of women and girls to make decisions about their own health and bodi contributes to the continuation of the practice fgm is cultural practice that is traditionally established and strongly protected in many areas many women and girls fear that uncircumcised girls will be considered unmarriageable in response some countries have tried variety of initiatives including creating alternative rites of passage and educating midwives to become trained health care workers who receive monthly stipends in parts of ghana and kenya some groups have begun to replace fgm with other practices such as pricking other parts of the body to let out small drop of blood or eliminating bloodletting entirely congressional actions and issues domestic policies in the mid1990s congress debated and enacted provisions aimed at preventing fgm in the united stat most importantly 645 of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant respons ibility act iirira of 1996 pl 104208 criminalized the practice of fgm13 iirira further required in 644 that all intending immigrants and foreign visitors be provided information concerning the potential legal consequences in the united states for perfo rming fgm or allowing child under his or her care to be subjected to female genita l mutilation under criminal or child protection statutes or as form of child abuse an yone who is convicted of circumcising girl under the age of 18 in any form is to be fi ned andor imprisoned for up to five years noncitizens who are convict ed under this provision moreover are subject to deportation14 while some maintain that these provisions impose sufficient penalties others argue that they should be strengthened the latte r note that the law does not include punishment for those who send the girls abroad to be circumcised advocates argue that if the law were expanded to punish those w ho attempted to circumvent u s law then it might deter parents from sending their children abroad to have the procedure done opponents of thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21923crs5 15 in 1968 the united states became party to th 1967 united nations protocol

protective services would remove the child from the home for extreme child abuse if fgm is reported the immigration and nationality act ina provides immigration protections to aliens who have well founded fear of persecution most notably in the form of refugee and asylum status aliens seeking asylum must demonstrate wellfounded fear that if returned home they will be persecuted ba sed upon one

united states although both refugees and asylees must demonstrate wellfounded fear of persecution16 legal guidance for asylum officers issued in 1995 stated that severe sexual abuse does not differ analytically from beatings torture or other forms of physical violence that are commonly he ld to amount to persecution17 most importantly the us board of immigration appeals held in matter of kasinga that subjective punitive or malignant intent is not required for harm to constitute persecution and in the landmark case granted asylum on the basis of fgm in199618 some advocate amending the inas definition of refugee and asylee to expressly mention fgm as was done for resistance to coercive population control policies19 proponents argue that such provision would strengthen the policy and speed up the lengthy asylum adjudication process others argue against changes to refugee and asylum law that would itemize the grounds for grantin g relief warning that specifying the types of persecution could limit future grants to only those types of persecution specified in the law they maintain that current law affords adequate protections for females fleeing fgm international policies

are becoming aware of the prevalence of fgm some suggest that existing legislation could be used more creatively to raise awaren ess about the dangers of the practice for example some propose amending

areas severely affected by hivaids tuberculosis and malaria proponents of this idea argue that combating fgm is an integral part of the global fight against hivaids particularly in heavily affected countries us health care professionals partic ipating in the pilot program could train health care workers in target areas to raise awareness about the intersecting risks of hivaids and fgm residents of the area could also be sensitized on how hiv can be transmitted through the prac tice opponents of further changes in the law maintain that the administration may accomplish efforts such as these within current law still others object to any us policies that might be perceived to interfere with cultural norms and indigenous practi ces in other parts of the world
