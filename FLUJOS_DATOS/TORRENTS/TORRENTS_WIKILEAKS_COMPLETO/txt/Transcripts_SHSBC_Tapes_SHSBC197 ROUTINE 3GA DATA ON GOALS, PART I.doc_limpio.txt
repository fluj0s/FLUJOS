routine 3ga data on goals part i lecture given on 7 august 1962 well i should be much better off now after weeks layoff here should be much better off indeed and just worse than ever thats what i get for taking vacations all right this is what 7 aug ad 12 saint hill special briefing course lecture one you are very lucky to hear this lecture extremely fortunate in fact if i didnt give you this lecture youd all be in the zoup its one of them kind of lectures and this has to do with goals 3ga data and materials concerning now this is not lecture of complete embracive rundown on everything there is to know about clearing but im going to give you some fast ones on the subject of hcob aug 1 and hcob aug 1 issue iithe drills and its routine 3ga goals nulling by mid ruds and the nulling drills that go along with it now this material is taken care of pretty well in the bulletin there is nothing particularly that one would alter in these bulletinsgives you quite bit of data im going to duplicate some of that data and im also going to give you lot more tips and an amplification of the material lot to be known about this first thing you will want to know is what if you find wrong goal on somebody and their head swells up five times the size and they get palpitations of the platina what happens what do you do thats the first thing you want to know because youll do it sooner or later this will happen even to you most of the data on this by the way is subjective got good subjective reality on this and good objective reality on this for instance somebody came to see today from far off on which goal had been found wrong and had been listed vociferously with considerable enthusiasm by one who is now amongst you but who was not then saint hill studentso he can be forgiven possibly hes not amongst you at the present moment i wont identify him any further and i said well thats the way it is wrong goal and sent her down to ask reg out of the magnanimity of his heart if he would not check out these goals now of course he thought he was checking goal out and she thought so too but in actual fact i sent her down to get patched up because the way you correct there are two ways of correcting wrong goal one is to check out the wrong goal that was foundor any wrong goal that was foundwithin an inch of your life in other words really check that thing out now of course it ceases to fire it ceases to read it ceases but it must cease with all somatics and sensations and with all misemotion when you have got everything off of it there is nothing left on it got it in other words by prepcheckingthis is very valuable databy prepchecking out the goal that was found wrong you shuck off the consequences of having listed it interesting isnt it marvelous you should have such luck but thats the way that one is find wrong goal on somebody and with vast enthusiasm list it for five or six or eighteenthousand items you see and the person puts on two hundred and fifty pounds of weight and few other minor things like this occurring their eyeballs keep leaking blood and palpitations have begun in the heart and gastronomic upsets are occurring as the order of the day and medicos have been called in morticians and so forth and have made diagnosis of plumbosis of the platina and they must operate inconsequentially why thats what you doyou just prepcheck the living daylights out of the goal that was wrong and found matter how much it was listed at first it wont read you cantwont get much out of it you get all the suppression off of it and you get the reads on it and the suppressions off of it and the reads back on it and the reads off of it and so forth and you go on and on and onand you finally get rid of this thing but you may need few more little buttons to go along with your mid ruds and i will give you list of those buttons to make very thoroughgoing checkout of anything you may find these buttons of some use on the goals check hcob mistake been made is added to the little list thats the short instructors check well please add has mistake been made on to the question that must be cleared there now thats for the short form now add thatthis is for longer formmistake been made protested asserted youve now got the bulk of it confusion about and ignoredbeen ignored youve just about got everything that is significant that will even produce shadow of side read on the other things you see the basic things which make wrong goal read are of course suppressthat doesnt make it read that prevents the invalidations from readinginvalidate suggestof course thats evaluate thats also assert and mistake now those are the things which give you clean tick the suppress of course pulls off the suppression and the errors now read the errors on the goal dont read till you get all the suppress off now lets look at it and we realize invalidation can give it tick just like goals tick except it doesnt look like goals tick if you get to be an old veteran and seen lot of them now goals tick is rapidly inspired input with fast decay it goes phew it fires fast off the beginning and slows down rapidly whereas these ticks are just ticks they go thud thud thud and theyre of equal speed more or less but they can be mistaken very easily and of course if goal has charge on it then it can be invalidated you see and the invalidated picks up the charge you see but it still looks like an invalidation but that invalidation has chargenot because of the invalidation but because there was charge on the goal you understand youve got question of transferred charge youve got charge on the goal but the goal doesnt read but the charge transfers over if the goal is invalidated now invalidated reads the charge transfers over to suggest evaluate assert suggest is the best of those phrases but you can also say evaluated you can say assert make it meaningful the mistake mistake calls for sort of ridge because its special kind of an invalidation it comes down to the fact that goal reads on the two oldest lines of the auditors codeevaluation and invalidation but you see either one of these have different ways you could describe it now youll get tick out of those things it looks like goal it goes tick tick tick of course if your needle is rising rapidly the tick isjust slows the riseor itll just stop the rise so it looks like halt but actually theyre throwdown they fire over here from left to right and the usual ticksomething like thatif the needle were quite still well itd be about anything from sixteenth of an inch to half an inch from left to right in the direction marked fall on mark iv emeter itsbe sixteenth of an inch to half an inch and goal read that is clean and clear is very remarkable it looks like small rocket taking off that slows down rapidly it doesnt look like these other things but youll get used to that by and by every once in while on nulling goals list by the way youll see this phenomenon it isnt the goal but youll see goal ticka real goal tick you get it clean everything is fine and youve been saying ityouve said it couple of times before and taken invalidations off of it and so forth and you get it all clean and you get down there and you say to be tiger and pow and you say boy weve really got something here you know you know make it like that at that point make enough excitement to throw the pc out of session you see and you say you say to be tiger it doesnt read anymore you see check it all over again if you ever get one to fire for gods sakes check it over again check it all over again to be tiger its dead itll never fire again rip youve taken it off the goals chain see it read like the goal once now thatsthe goal charge transfers over to secondary goal which merely fires once as it frees itself from the main goal chain but that charge while it remains on secondarynot the goal but close cousincan transfer over to an invalidation or an evaluation you see you get substitutes got series of substitutes here see so you pick off the invalidations and evaluations and then you pick off the charge off the secondary goals on the list and then you hit the goal and the goal goes powand it goes like that every timepow pow pow now of course if somebody invalidates it it ceases to go pow until the evalinvalidation is picked up somebody evaluates for the pc it ceases to fire until of course that evaluation is picked up you can always get this thing to fire again howeverwhich is quite remarkableuntil it has been listed completely out and when its listed completely out youve got free needle all right its series of substitutions in other words the charge goes from here to there it isnt that evaluation is going to ruin the pcits merely going to ruin the goal read and youd think it would ruin the pc if you saw some of the somatics that can occur because of it but the whole force of it is derived from the goal itself see the whole force and charge of goals list is derived from the goal for instance if you havent got the goal on the list the list will be hotter than pistol even if its five thousand goals long you cant cool it off thats all it just wont cool off until youve got the goal on it and when it goes complete fishflabby cold as list youve got the goal on it someplace it isnt the number of items quantitatively that is entirely responsible for discharging the goals list its monitored by whether or not the goal is on the list yet and it will stay charged up till you get it on theres couple of ways of making sure of this but im getting ahead of my story now that charge there transfers over to the secondary goals and then that transfers over to evaluations and invalidations and charges this thing up when youve gotten wrong goal then you have simply added to the charge residual every time you listed one more itembecause youre not only evaluating for the pc you are saying this is your goalto have pie face or something like thisand its not you see and at the same time you are invalidating the actual goalwhatever it was so these two things are happening simultaneously and the more you list the more this thing charges up and this can get gruesome if you ever were adventurous enough to list two or three thousand wrong items on each one of the four lineswell its almost case for the mortician its horrible i couldnt overemphasize the thing the pc would just be walking around in circles usually there is abundant sensation the pcs getting dizzier and dizzier the pc will start passing out if you go too far pc just goes blah you knowbe walking down the hall and go bang see i mean actually pass out fainting sensation and that sort of thing goes along with it and theres all kinds of these wild things see nothing to worry about because long before the pc got into this state an auditor would start saying whats going on here you know but they will think they are in bad enough state if theyve only had few items listed on wrong goal you can list four on wrong goal and start picking up sen if you find goal on the pc you havent checked it out yet and the pc says oh geewhiz ive got my goal you knowadding another assert to it you see ive got my goal nice suggest you know yeah thats fine he leaves the session and he goes home and he sits down and he says lets see who would want to be pie face you know who would want to be pie face oh well yeah pie man yeah thats good and who would oppose being pie face people who didnt have one and who would not retard pie facing i dont know if ive got that right or not theyll do it youll see somebody do it somebody go out of session right after you found their goal you havent had chance to check the thing outfound it right at the end of the session theyll come back in theyve done some experimenting on the thing and theyll be going wogwogwog you knowif its the wrong goal see if its not the right one theyll really catch it so this is something you must know great deal about dont think of it on the basis that oh well this all applies you see providing i none of this applies ill just check every goal out that comes along you see and ill check them all out and ill be very careful and then none of these things will happen to any pc i audit who are you kidding just who are you kidding first place you dont know if its the right goal you dont know if its the right goal until youve listed two or three hundred items on it then is the first time youd lay your paw on stack of bibles put dianetics the modern science of mental health on top of it to make it fact and swear it was the right goal see see thats the only time youd really know because one of the tests is does the goal when listed turn on somatics on lines 1 you see and 3 and does the goal turn on dizziness and sensation and emotion and what we generally call and refer to as sen on lines 2 and 4 now if the goal while you are busily listing iton line 1 turns on dizziness and on line 2 turns on somaticsman youve got it backwards thats allits just backwards you have been misfortunate enough you should have gotten up and given session that day why did you have to get up and give session that day why didnt you have an appointment elsewhere because you found the oppgoal now frankly there are four goals that you can find ill make you secure make you confident make you happy and going about your business without ever care there are four goals theres the goal for line 1 the goal for line 2 the goal for line 3 and the goal for line 4 the goal is the goal for line 1 thats the pcs goal but the opposition goal of course is really another goaland although it phrases out beautifully if you just say who or what would oppose catching catfish you see that will work out and its all fine there isactually you are listing another goal there theres really another goal sitting right there see itll be something or other to preserve our piscatorial friends or something like this you see opposition to catching catfish its because theres another goal sitting there and as far as retarding goals are concerned on lines 3 and 4 there are two other goals there tooand you know they will all fire theyll all fire witness 3d old routine 3d you can find 4 goals in row that will all fire now the pcs goal is the one you want and that is the one which fits on line 1 and that is the one that gives somatics and that ordinarily is the one you check out but beware one of these terribly long goals lists if they are terribly long then the pc is listing all four goals on the same list hes listing hiss and theirss and his allies and his covert enemiesand hes listing them all on the same list hes saying to catch catfish to protect and preserve our piscatorial friends will occur consecutive he will list 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 sometimes as nice as you please you understand he doesnt know whether hes himself or his worst enemy or what you see the gpm is so snarled up that just picking out anything out of it he doesnt know whether its friend or foe and as you are running down goals list hell say that one made feel dizzy youve picked up an opposition goal that goal is either line 2 or line 4 goal got hmmm he saidor i feel so despairing whenever you say that goal line 2 and line 4 sensation is emotion goodness i am so frightened whenever you say that line 2 line 4 you seesensation emotion theres only one thing you want on line 11 and 3of course is good solid honest pain now somebodys going to come along and tell you sometime that it is somatic of course somatic covers pain and sensation and that somatic is somatic and theyll say they have painswhen as matter of fact they mean they have pressures you dont get confused about this you have to make this very definitive you say they have pressure on the side so they tell you they have somatic and then you think they said pain you ask them well was it pain and they will say yes its heavy pressure but they maybe not say its heavy pressure see theyoh yes i have pain in my side they mean its some kind of pressure dont you see so you have to describe what you mean by pain well does it feel the same way if you took knife and pushed it into your side and twisted it around bit it would be painful oh nothing like that youll hear pc every once in while you know if you stuck pin through your finger is that the way it would feel oh well nothing like that theres just little solid pressure there something like that you know because pain is pain there is substitute painit hurts it isnt uncomfortableit hurts and thats what we mean by pain now the real goal gives pain on line 1 and little pain on line 3 line 3 sometimes mixes it up with pain and sensation see because its harder closure see because line 3 of course is opposing the opposition so it gets the sensation of the opposition and so forth it can get more mixed up see so its not reliable test and line 4since line 4 is simply covert opposition of some kind or anothersometimes has some pain mixed up in it as well as sensation whereas its basically and ordinarily sensation on line 4 it sometimes can get little pain mixed up into it the guy gets feeling of heavy pressure with little zzst that goes down the front of it that hurts see well its mixup dont you see so therefore lines 3 and 4 on listing are not reliable as indicators at all and shouldnt be taken to heartunless down toward the end of the line the guy insists on getting sensation all the time and forever dont you seesensation is continuous and that sort of thingon line 3 for instance well that would be very unusual it should become more and more predominately painful when anything occurs there so it comes back to the sole indicators which are lines 1 and 2 and line 1 has got to have pain in itperiod must not have sen in it but when you first start to patch up goal that has been misrun youre liable to get some sen coming off of it or something like that because its been too invalidated and then it will come into pain dont you see you might get little sen off of line 1 before you got any pain off of line 1 but dont count on it and line 2 shouldnt have any pain in it at all but occasionally on running items down the line the pc gets his items mixed up the items that should be on list 2 are occurring on list 1 and vice versa you say who or what would try to catch catfish or who or what would want to catch catfish lets get the proper goals here and you say who or what would want to catch catfish and he says fish and game warden you say well good thank you who or whatyou know dont challenge the pcs answerand youd say who or what would oppose catching catfish and he says catfish fisherman it all seems sensible to him well you recognize what is happening there the closure is so tight the pc is all mixed up and hes liable to get some sensation and some pain misplaced on these lines once in while but your standard run of the mill action is pain and that is the test by which you guide by that is one of the basic tests as you go running down the line you say who or what would want to catch catfish ouch who or what would notwould oppose catching catfish mmmmmm ohohohoh see why are you swimming auditor who or what would retard the opposition to catching catfish and its mmmm ouch see and who or what would pull you back from catching catfish would be mmmm ick thats the way these things fit you get it however the wording of the lines goes now finding the goal originallyif you are doing very good job an excellent job if you are right there right in there pitchingin other words if your model session and your auditor presence is good and if by some accident you can read the emeter whats going to happen every goal you find on the pcs goals list that has any sensation or pain in it by reason of being touched and read on the list will be clean as whistle by the time you leave it were going down the list were going down the list pocketapocketapocketapocketa see and weve got this goal to be waterbuck see and weve got this goal to be waterbuck and the guy goes whaag and so forth and one of the things youre not doing right now that you certainly had better dotwo things goal that actually bangs all by itself you put circle around the x see cross it out but put circle around itbecause you could use that data various ways in other words that means it fired all by itself when i got it all cleaned up when i got it all cleaned up it fired all by itselfand then went null of coursebut it did fire all by itself put circle around the x thats just for future reference and you can very often use that and get the pc to tell you when he has pn and when he has sen and put it down now those two things you really ought to do i used the fact of what goals were rock slamming the other day to plot out what the pc had overts on to run ow on to turn off dirty needle and its now off thats pretty slippery isnt it i expect you to do that as matter of routine action but i justi found there were about four or five goals that rock slammed i went down through the line and i figured out by asking few little test questions of the pc what the pc had overts on that was giving him dirty needle all the time and just ran ow on that and bangthat was the end of the rock slamming needle quite interesting pc had to be pretty well insession before that could have occurred but there was the use see of notations on goals list let us say rather unusual expedient but this was also rather unusual to have halfadial rock slam see i had to get it off in order to get anyplace so i just decided to take it all off in batch and i made this test took thetook about five goals that had rock slammed and i had noted down on the borders after they went out id noted that when i hit these goals they rock slammed added them up and said it must be to this thing asked couple of questions checked it out ran ow on that and that was the end of the dirty needle it was just an experimental action but it worked beautifully and this other one of course you can figure out which way the pc is goingand you can figure out whether youve got goal or not by going back and looking at those circled xs just look at them and they had pn circled xpn and then x with circle on it it banged all by itselfgoals line see after we cleaned it all up it had one bang in it and it had pain on it now we see what kind of goal that was its huntingtype goali want to get at men men men you know something like thatgoal something like that seehuntingtype goal outflowing huntingtype goal see the next one that stayed in madly i want to shove it down their throats and make it stickpn circle and the goal we had found is to kill them all damn themto kill them all you see and theres one in here to be sweet and peaceful child it fired once but it had sen after it ah we see where this pc is built dont we we can do an analysis of it and it safeguards us from listing an opposition goal as the pcs goal obviously to kill them all damn them to kill them allright in keeping with the rest of the goals that produced pain and stayed inpcs goal see of course we dont know that for sure after weve listed it for while but we can pretty well guarantee it on that spot check see the use of that audience mmhm yeah youve got to be slippery youve got to outguess the pc if left to his own devices you understand the pc would give you the wrong goal the opposition goalwould insist that you check it out i never saw the like of it pcs will sit there and theyll pick some favorite goal you knowto wear tall hats in court you know they think my thats nice goal you know for some reason or other theyre enamored of this goal do you know that twentyfive percent of the pcs will try to do this but your model session is so rigged today that they cant if you didnt have model session the way it was today twentyfive percent of your pcs would theyd lift their finger every time you saw that to wear tall hats in court they can get it pretty well timed too they know at what point to lift their finger off to give you an instant read you see another one is to go into convulsion they sell you the goal by going into convulsion you know i just never will take goal that will throw pc into convulsion anymore i just wont mary sue has system she says sit back there and dont you move now im going to read the goal its very effective system too and she can check the thing out but you get pcs going into writhing convulsion or something every time you read the goal to put out the devils eyes you see and they love that goaland theyll actually knowingly go into convulsion knowing you cant check out the goal they are selling that goal man theyll just sell that goal and sell that goal wow well people commit suicide we just had notable example tonight any one of you girls could have done very well with that mockup that knocked itself off in hollywood in the last day or so im sure that she would have thought that was quite nice here she is going and knocking herself off you know the body herself see she didnt have any use for it why didnt she put an ad in the paper well shes probably crying in some maternity ward right nowand somebody will be saying well give her sedative yeah but they will theyll just commit suicide just like that got everything to live fortheres the auditor good auditor ready to audit him everything else and then they have got to sell you this corny goal they get very anxious you knowtheyve got to have goal theyve got to have the goal theyve got to have the goal hehh theyve just got to have one regardlessany old goal so pingoff goes the finger pingoff goes the finger pingoff goes the finger convulsions and so forth youd be amazed what weve seen around here on that its absolutely fantastic its twentyfive percent of the pcs thats small percentage and theyll do it and an auditor who will buy pcs goal is not only fool hes practically murderer and yet man the sales talk you will get why down at the car agency they dont know arf well its always been my goal to catch catfish it always has been my goal i you know studied fishing when i was in college and so forth but i couldnt pass any of the courses see theyve learned all of the rules on which goals are goals i was never any good at it its always been someits always given terrible headache every time i go down by the river banks you know and look at all the other similar goals in there look at the other similar goals to this and so forth to be bank telleryou see similar goal sales talk sales talk sales talk sales talk its when it gets that hot you have to pull this suggest as assertwhen you are checking them out and you get marvelous parade of these goals going by well anywayyouve got to get the pcs right goal and you cant be overwhelmed by bunch of wrong goals and one of the little incidental tests is you tell the pc every time you feel dizzy or faint or something like that you tell and youve got to tell him that every few goals hell forget it you know youve got to ask him and you ask him if hes had any pains or sensations you see and then tell him well when you get any you want to speak right up and tell you see hell keep forgetting it they eventually will groove in so they will tell you but you can mark those down and then by comparing that to the very few goals that stay inon nulling by mid rudsyou can sort the pcs goal out and know whether you are running the right goal or not before you start listing it all right thats sorting technique now this is what i wanted to tell youthat you mustnt go by one of those goals and leave somatic on it whether its pain or sensation you mustnt mustnt do that in other words you say to this person to catch catfish and he has horrible pain in his mouth and he says dit doesnt say anything to you about it and you clean off the suppressions and the invalidations the suggestions the fails to reveal and the mistakes and hit it ask the suppression you dont see anything on there now listen theres another test if you are very alert the pc has been telling you when he had pains and if there is anything remaining of that pain youve got goal behind you which is hung up and after while the goals list gets jammy now what i am telling you is thisthat goals nulling by mid ruds turns out to be fantastically therapeutic action it isnt just sitting there grinding away now if you know this other fact the pc just comes up shiningif you know this other factthat you mustnt leave sensation or pain of any kind on the pc when you leave the goal if that goal turned it on youve got to get all the invalidations and everything else off of it it isnt really as vigorous as it sounds it only takes you few minutes to do this i mean you just do it just in the normal course of human events or inhuman events just straight drill but one of the things that you should make sure of is if pain came on when you read that goal that all of those somatics are gone at the time you leave it the somatic you might say goes slightly deeper than the meter so youve got to check now you get to listening to this pche says to catch catfish he gets pain in his mouth and you get the invalidations and you get the suggestions the failures to reveal and mistakesjust normal just like you are doing ityou dont have to push for anything else off of this thing you read it and get the suppressions and it doesnt read hes still got pain down here in his stomach somewhere so if pain came on you go back and you find out theres little piece little tiny old piece of an invalidation stuck in there that you didnt get off see you didnt ask the invalidation question again see you thought you got invalidations cleaned up but remember you took some other things off then when youinvalidation was still tiny little bit hot in the normal course of finding goal it wouldnt be enough to destroy goal perhaps or keep goal from readingbut its enough to keep the somatic in so dont go so careful you drive your pc berserk and only get six done in three hours of auditing but just be careful that when sensations and somatics come on that you keep taking off your suppressions invalidations suggestions failures to reveal and mistakes and if they dont all come off get curious about this you know use another word like asserted evaluate you know its almost like final checkout only you dont go into big prepcheck youd be surprised what facility you can develop just to knock off that last little sticking piece you see well you can go by one of these things like this and you say to catch catfish and the pc goes mmmp thats it thats it you say has this goal been suppressed and you dont get much of response on it and you go on and pc had somatic at the beginning of this goal well if youre having trouble cleaning this ask him the kingpin question any somatics been suppressed on this goal because what happened is you said to catch catfish and the pc put on every brake in the bank on the somatics and somehow or another it doesnt cross in his mind and if you didnt know this you would go right on down the line pocketapocketapocketa and youd leave that goal hung and the accumulated hanging up of four or five such goals then leaves the pc rather uncomfortable by session end and he shouldnt be uncomfortable by session end if you do goals nulling by mid ruds properly your pc is just as smooth as silkmuch better at the end of session than at the beginning now if you dont do thisand one other factor added which is the reassurance factorif you dont do this your pc is going to get nervy anxious upset only one other thing can make him that upset and thats to go by his goal and not find it ooohh god you remember henny penny and the sky was falling you know that was thyeh thats purely fairy tale compared to pc whose goal has been passed on the list his goal was to catch catfish and its back there now about three goals and he suddenly starts waking up are you sure you can read the emeter yes well i have quite pain in my side here why dont you hear what i am telling you the room is much too hot here we go you know you cant keep the session together you cant keep anything itd just go to pieces you pull missed withholds you pull more missed withholds it doesnt do any goodthe missed withhold is the goal it gives all the responses with exclamation point of missed withholds all of them occur right at that point except he might not wake up for half page see if hed just wake up that instant that you tried to leave it or something like that but they dont it goes by and when its well by the pc says hey where are we going where are we going he gets set of dunlap tires you know puts skid marks on the auditing track about hundred and fifty yards long he isnt going anyplace poor auditor and by the way this is complicated by the fact that pcs can also act that way without their goal but not quite so much its matter of degree if you are leaving somatics on the goals as you go by then the pc starts getting nervy you went by one to be tiger and he went ooooh then you went on to the next one to eat waterbuck hes still going ooooh he never got out of the tiger deal see hes still there hes still got sensation on this thing if you picked upnow hear this real wellif you picked up all the invalidation that you would normally get in sessionnot backtrack or anythingall the invalidation all of the suggestion all of the failed to reveal and all the mistake been made and all the suppressif those things were all picked upno somatic or sensation would be left on any goal contacted now add that in to the other side of this which is if goal has been found that is wrong goal even though it has been listed and upset the pc god help us if you take all of the suppressions invalidations fails to reveal you see and mistakes off of that wrong goal your pc will come back to battery get them all off man you really have to get in there and sweat it isnt that it takes long time to do its just that it takes an accurate look over you have to get them all off why the pc will come right back to battery there he was with two feet in the grave and both of his hands on banana peels and hell come right back outand hell come right back out its quite remarkable now if pc has had several wrong goals found on him one after the other take them in sequence take every goal that has been found on you not found and proved out see every goal that has been found on you like goals that have been suspected and goals that you had to have checked out the next day but they didnt check out you get what i mean now by every goal found on the pc whether found and proved or just you know just found and you can even add those he was absolutely sure were his goal see and just make list of those thingsjust write them all down in order of sequence as they happened see clean up each one with nulling by mid ruds pc will feel wonderful there will be liability to having found wrong goals thats very well worth knowing isnt it thats patchup now that doesnt mean that you can do careless job of goals finding or careless job of listing just because you can patch it up because the patchup is never quite as good as the original article its something like rebuilta rebuilt typewriter dont you see or rehabilitated girl they are never quite the same sleek condition as the original article but it permits you to go on and find the right one without any consequences got the idea youwell you see it yourself you list five thousand items on wrong goal and wow well there actually would be reason whatsoever to take the time necessary you see to erase every single slightest thing they had ever done or said in listing youd clean the goal up is what youd do clean it up so its slick as whistle and you cant get it to fire you cant get any of the other things to fire and you cant get couple of others to fire as i just gave them to you cant get anything to move now and it all appears fairly clean thats good enoughnow you can go on and find yourself new goal dont say the pc wonthe wont feel bad about it but hell look little seedy around the edges if youve gone that far you understand dont expect him to come out clear and shining if i left you the idea that they would come out into cleared state then we would have new method of clearing you just find wrong goal on the pc list it and then clean it up there is substitute for doing it right in the first place your actions here in doing thati want you to know this real wellin doing these drills on this bulletin of august 1st youve got two things that if you want to keep pc really shining you must do is polish up any goal that has been found or is being found or anything else in other words get the sensation somatics off any goal as you go down the list see or if you are picking up pc who has had the wrong goal found on him then get every wrong goal that was found on the pc and clean all those things up see cleaning up the goalsthat all comes under the heading of it and if you go down the nulling list and you go on down the nulling list pocketapocketapocketa on throughclean up every one you go by dont say oh well to wrap peppermint candy around lampposts in chicago theres sense in cleaning that up obviously isnt the pcs goal hahahahaha you know to wrap peppermint candy around the lamppost in chicago thank you has that goal been suppressed thank you thank you very much next goal you know youll find yourself doing that sometime late at night be alert even though its pt thing there might have been nice somatic on it or there might have been some sensation on it that might be in what the hell is he doing putting down present time goal like that if it isnt on the goals chain dont you see clean it up just as carefully as you would clean upas though it were the right goal now you treat every one of these goals of course thenjust in summation of thattreat every single one of these goals as though it is the goal they are all the goal the moment you get onto them it is the goal until proven otherwise and the other one is the reassurance factor and that is the other thing that isnt necessarily the two main things in auditing these things but these are the two things that will get you in most trouble by omitting the reassurance factor youve never heard of it before its time you did pc needs some pats on the back when hes going over the jumps on this heeeyyy whwhwherewherewheres his goal you know where is it you know and he thinks of terrible situations and the horrible things that are going to happen you know and the terrible awfulnesses of it all if he doesnt find his goal or supposing its behind him worry worry worry worry worry worry worrysee well you best counter this with reassurance do perfect job of auditing but dont sit there like wooden image with never pat on the back for the pc tell him once in while well take it easy im cleaning each one up now as matter of fact i overclean and that is the reason why you are little bit upset i sometimes clean clean on you just to make sure thatthats all right im justeverything is going along fine and you are doing fine weve got long way to go now you just keep telling when you have somatics and you sit there comfortably and when you get dizziness or sensation you tell too everythings going to be fine got the idea you make that pervade your goalsfinding sessions and by keeping them all clean as you go by them and reassuring the pcnot falsely its perfectly factualhell be all right why youll have much easier much happier sessions those are the two primary things now there are several secondary things to all these things and there are other things of importance on this and i actually havent really begun to fire on the subject of goals listing so well have to continue into the second lecture thank you thank you take break
