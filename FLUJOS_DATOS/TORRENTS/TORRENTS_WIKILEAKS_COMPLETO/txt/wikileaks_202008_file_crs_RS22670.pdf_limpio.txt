this case att holds patent on speech software program upon which microsofts windows operating system infringes microsoft ships abroad master version of windows either on disk or via encrypted

states 1 whoever without authority supplies or ca uses to be supplied in or from the united states all or substantial portion of the components of patented inventi on where such components are uncombined in whole or in part in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such components outside of the united states in manner that would infringe the patent if such co mbination

is especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use where such component is uncombined in whole

is software program that is capable of converting spoken words into compact code or vice versa3 att brought suit against microsoft in 2001 alleging that the speech codec included in microsofts windows operating system infringes its patent microsoft filed motion to exclude evidence of alleged liability arising from foreign sales of windows pursuant to 271f of the patent act microsoft exports overseas limited number of usmade golden master disks containing the machinereadable software code of its windows operating system4 foreign computer manufacturers may use these disks to replicate the master disk in generating multiple copies of windows for installation on foreignassembled computers that are then sold to foreign customers5 in support of its motion to limit liability and an damages award microsoft argued that 1 software is intangible information such that it could not be component of patented invention within the meaning of 271f and 2 even if the windows software were component actual components had been supplied from the united states as required by 271f because the copies of windows installed on the foreignassembled computers had all been made

dowagiac mfg co v minnesota moline plow co 235 us 641 650 1915 the right conferred by patent under our law is confined to the united states and its territories and infringement of this right cannot be predicated of acts wholly done in foreign country 13 att 414 f3d at 1373 rader j dissenting 14 microsoft corp v att corp 127 s ct 467 2006the district courts opinion in considering microsofts motion the us district court for the southern district of new york fi rst cited previous federal circuit decisions supporting the proposition th at software is patentable7 furthermore the court explained that 271f does not limit components to only physical machines or tangible structures but rather could incl ude intangible information or da ta thus the district court rejected microsofts argument that software could not be component of patented invention under 271f8 as for the copies made abroad from the golden master disk sent from the united states the district court held that such copies still came within the scope of 271f in light of the legislativ intent of the statute to prohibit the circumvention of infringement through exportation9 the federal circuits opinion after microsoft appeale d divided panel of the federal circuit affirmed the district court s decision the appellate court relied on prior federal circuit case law that had held th at without question software code alone qualifies as an invention eligib for patenting and stat utory language does not limit section 271f to patented machin or patented physical stru ctures such that software can very well be component of patent ed invention for the purposes of 271f10 the federal circuit also ruled that because t he act of copying is subsumed in the act of supplying the exportation of the golden mast er disks with the specific intent that they be replicated abroad is an act that come s within the meaning of 271fs supplied or caused to be supplied in or from the united states11 in dissent federal circuit judge randall r rader objected to the majority opinions view that supplies within the meaning of 271f includes the act of foreign copying judge rader expressed concerns that such an interpretation is in effect an impermissible extraterritorial expansion of us patent law because it reaches copying activity overseas12 in his view atts remedy lies not in us law but rather the law of the foreign country in which the infringement due to copying occurred13 the supreme courts opinion the supreme court accepted microsofts petition for writ of certiorari in october 200614 in order to answer two questionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22670crs4 15 chief justice john g roberts jr recused hims elf from consideration of and the rendering of decision in this case 16 microsoft corp v att corp 550 us ___

not itself combinable component 20 id at 1756 1759 21 id at 175556 22 indeed the court acknowledged that if it were to accept atts position it would not matter that the master copies of windows software dispatched from the united states were not themselves installed abroad as workin g parts of the foreign computers id at 17541 whether digital software code an intangible sequence of 1s and 0s may be considered component of patented invention within th meaning of section 271f1 and if so 2 whether copies of such component made in foreign country are supplied from the united states in 71 decision15 issued in late april 2007 the cour t reversed the federal circuits judgment holding that microsoft was not liable for patent infringement under 271f as the statute is currently written when foreignmanufactured computers are loaded with windows software that has been copied abro ad from master disk or an electronic transmission sent by microsoft from the united states16 in regard to the first question posed in the case associate justice ruth bader ginsburg writing for the majority explained that there are two ways to conceptualize software one can speak of software in the abstract the instructions themselves detached from any medium an analogy the notes of beethovens ninth symphony one can alternatively envision tangible copy of software the instructions encoded on medium such as cdrom she et music for beethovens ninth17 abstract software code doe s not qualify as component for purposes of triggering liability under 271f because it is an id ea lacking physical embodiment and thus it cannot be usable combin able part of computer18 justice ginsburg analogized software in the abstract to detailed set of instructions similar to that of blueprint19 but information sent abroad that instructs someone on how to build the components ofa patented invention does not come within the scope of 271f she observed that congress in enacting the statutory provision did not include the export of design tools such as blueprints schematics templates and prototypes 20 thus for the windows software to be consider ed compone nt unde r 271 f the software code must be encoded or otherwise expresse d in some sort of tangible medium computerreadable software copy such as cdrom21 the court thus declined to adopt atts characterization of software in the abstract as combinable component that qualifies for 271f liability22 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22670crs5 23 id at 1757 24 id internal quotations and citations omitted 25 id at 1758 26 id at 1759 27 id 28 id at 175960 citation omitted 29 id at 1759 30 id at 1757 emphasis added and internal citation omittedin reaching its answer to the second ques tion the court largely agreed with judge raders dissent from the fede ral circuits opinion the copies of windows used for installation on the foreign computers had b een made abroad those copies were not supplied from the united states even thoug h the master disk from which they were duplicated had been exported according to justice ginsburg this distinction is legally relevant for liability purposes under 271f furt her such liability is not affected by the ease of copying software23 noting that keys or machine parts may also easily be copied from master she observed that 271f contains instruction to gauge when duplication is easy and cheap enough to deem copy in fact made abroad nevertheless supplied from the united states24 furthermore justice ginsburg argued th at the traditional presumption against extraterritorial application of united states law particularly in patent law would help favor the court construing 271f in manne r that excludes intangible software code and copies of software made abroad25 echoing judge raders advice justice ginsburg observed that if at t desires to preven t copying abroad its remedy lies in obtaining and enforcing foreign patents26 at the end of the opinion justice gins burg conceded that the courts decision effectively creates loophol for software makers to avoid liability under 271f27 however she explained that the court w ould resist using the dynamic judicial interpretation that would be needed to adju st the patent law to account for the realities of software distribution28 the majority opinion expressl invited congress to consider whether this apparent loophole in favor of soft ware companies to the extent that it may exist merits closing29 interestingly the majority opinion of the court excluded footnote number 14 which was supported by only four justices justi ces kennedy scalia souter and ginsburg this footnote reads as follows microsoft suggests that even disk shipped from the united states and used to install windows directly on foreign computer would not give rise to liability under 271f if the disk were re moved after installation we need not and do not reach that issue here 30 associate justice samuel alito in concurre nce joined by justices thomas and breyer would have decided that particular issue ra ised in footnote 14 in favor of microsofts assessment of liability under 271f justi ce alito asserted that component of anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22670crs6 31 id at 1761 alito j concurring 32 id at 1762 33 id at 176162 34 id at 1762 35 id at 1762 stevens j dissenting 36 id 37 id 38 406 us 518 1972infringing physical device under 271f must be something physical31 thus because physical object originating in the united states was combined with these computers there was violation of 271f32 he further observed that physical aspect of windows cdrom original disk or copy is ever incorporated into the computer itself because the cdrom is removed from the computer after the installation process copies the windows code to the computers hard drive33 therefore it is irrelevant that the windows soft ware was not copied onto the foreignmade computers directly from the master disk or from an electronic transmission that originated in the united states to be re if these computer s could not run windows without inserting and keeping cdrom in the appropriate drive then the cdroms might be components of the com puter but that is not the case here34 in lone dissent associate justice john paul stevens explained that he would affirm the federal circuits majority opinion in the case because he deemed that judgment to be more faithful to the intent of the congress that enacted 271f35 in his view abstract software code wh ether embodied in physical medium or detached from it should be considered component within the meaning of 271f because it has other intended use except for installation onto computers hard drive therefore it is component used for assembly of an infring ing machine and microsoft would be liable for exporting it36 he also objected to the courts comparison of abstract software to blueprints because unlike blueprint that merely instructs user how to do something software actually causes infringin g conduct to occur it is more like roller that causes player piano to produce sound than sheet music that tells pianist what to do37 concluding observations the outcome of the microsoft decision is not unlike that of the deepsouth packing co v laitram corp opinion in 197238 in deepsouth the supreme court interpreted the patent act as it was then written to exclude from infringement liability the making in the united states of the unpatented parts of patented shrimp deveining machine and exporting such unassembled parts to foreign buyers for combination abroad congress th enacted 271f as specific response to deepsouth to expand the scope of patent infring ement activity to include the supply of patented inventions component from the ited states for combination abroad now in microsoft the supreme court has expressly inv ited congress to consider whether it is desirable to revise patent infringemen t liability under 271f to include exporting software with the intent that such product be copied abroad for use on foreign computers
