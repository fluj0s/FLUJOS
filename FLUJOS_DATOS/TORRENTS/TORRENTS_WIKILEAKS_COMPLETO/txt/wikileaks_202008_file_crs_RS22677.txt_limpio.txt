administrative support for the medicare program ssa enrolls medicare beneficiaries withholds parts b and d premiums and calculates incomerelated part b premiums ssa also identifies lowincome beneficiaries who might be eligible for part d drug benefit subsidies and makes lowincome subsidy determinations increasing workload ssas administrative responsibilities have increased creating pressure on the agencys budget two major factors have contributed to ssas workload legislative changes and increasing benefit rolls the medicare modernization crs5 act mma pl 108173 created ongoing administrative responsibilities for ssa as outlined above ssa received additional funding in fy2004 for mma startup costs figure 3 social security benefits claims processed fy1996fy2007 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22677 source ssa performance and accountability reports fy1998 fy2007 at httpwwwssagovfinance note disability claims include only social security disability insurance di benefits not ssi benefits all initial disability claims are processed by state disability determination services dds as shown in figure 3 the number of initial social security benefit claims processed is also rising from 57 million in fy2003 to 64 million in fy2007 change of 20 the number of retirement claims is expected to grow further as baby boomers become eligible for benefits in 2008 disability claims are also expected to increase figure 4 pending initial disability claims and ssa hearings fy1996fy2007 source ssa performance and accountability reports fy1998fy2007 note all initial disability claims are processed by dds crs6 increasing backlogs as the ssa workload has increased so too have the backlogs of pending claims and hearings ssas backlogs primarily affect disabled applicants for social security and ssi benefits for example the number of hearings pending grew from about 600000 in fy2003 to about 800000 in fy2007 as shown in figure 4 above the number of initial disability claims pending remained about the same over that period decreasing program integrity activities ssa has been completing fewer ssi nondisability redeterminations and fewer continuing disability reviews cdrs these reviews determine whether current ssi beneficiaries and social security disability beneficiaries continue to be eligible for benefits thus maintaining the integrity of the programs and saving money over the long term ssa estimates that for each dollar spent on an ssi redetermination 7 is saved and for each dollar spent on cdr 10 is saved6 the presidents budget and the congressional budget resolution for fy2009 would each provide ssa with administrative funding above discretionary spending caps in order to complete more ssi redeterminations and cdrs from fy2003 to fy2007 the number of ssi redeterminations decreased by more than half from about 24 million to about 10 million as shown in figure 5 at the same time the number of cdrs decreased almost httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22677 by half from about 14 million to about 800000 figure 5 ssi redeterminations and continuing disability reviews completed fy1996fy2007 source ssa performance and
