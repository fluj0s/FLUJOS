goals problems mass lecture given on 28 february 1963 well good evening we have lecture here tonight on the gpm and this is the 28th of february ad 13 now the difficulty with this lecture that im about to make to you is its liable to bring your gpm loose from its moorings and if so im very sorry for that im very sorry for it but we will be able to pick it up as we go along so dont feel too upset gpmwhat is this what is this the goals problem mass is what it stands for why is it the goals problem mass it is that mass which accumulates after the postulation of goal resulting in problems only these problems are not the problems of postulatecounterpostulate but theyre identitycounteridentity in handling the gpm we are actually handling identities now let put you in focus with regard to where we have gone to in processing the first processing resulting in clears was simply keyout cleargetting somebody to confront his bank and his actions on gradient scale and that is as old as 1947 now as we move forward we find that clears as we move forward in this technologywe find that clears were not continuous permanent and stable as the years went along and that anything from three days to many years after being cleared something would bite something would cave back in something would happen and they would cease to be clear all right what is this something well this something is actually what made them nonclear in the first placethe goals problem mass now an individual goes through this type of cycle and action he makes postulate he becomes an identity to make the postulate stick and in the process of doing that he is opposed by various elements out of his own fancy or the determination of others which causes aan opposition identity to materialize and the presence of the opposition makes the individual believe that to accomplish his goal he must now become another different identity in order to handle the new opposition which has appeared and because he is this new different identityall in the same goalnew oppositiona new opposition identity occurs in his vicinity and because this second opposition has now occurred he believes that it is incumbent upon himeither because he is losing or winningto assume third identity in sequence he assumes this identity and as soon as he assumes thatthis new identity he now has new opposition form well ill give you an idea we mean opposition like this man decides to be smoker lets not put it on the gpm basis lets put it very finite man decides to smoke he therefore becomes an identity known as smoker youve seen them in the ads they look very placid if they smoke cigarettes they chase pretty girls and if they smoke pipes they chase fireplaces you know and weve seen this whatever this identity was hes assumed this identity and then he gets married and his wife objects to his being smoker so now he has an opposition known as wife so he assumes new identity which is dominating husband in order to handle the identity wife but now we have new identity show up we have something called the ladies aide society and his wife has joined that and their combined forces are going to cause him to stop smoking so now he has to become wealthy selfdetermined individual you see that and the ladies aide societies then get bunch of quacksmembers of the amatogether and they say that if you smoke it produces cancer they dont know what produces cancer but they say that smoking does theyyou see thats the ghostshirt messianic thing they have solution to it they cant cure it so they pick on something and they say well everybody spits in the water so thats what causes typhoid fever they dont know you see so now he has counteridentity called the american medical association you see and thats an identity so this fellow now in desperation to handle this situation becomes political genius you see because you have to be political genius these days to handle the ama thats the only place where they operate effectively dont operate effectively in the operating room anymore only in congress so here he is now genius you see political genius now the political genius runs into an opposition party so you have an opposition partythe democrats you see thats the next oppterm and thats about the high tide of the whole thing let us say notno reference to the number of items you really have youve got deterioration of this situation he now starts getting lesser identities and the opposition on the subject starts to get bigger so he sayshe becomes then ward politician and the opposition in this particular case as ward politician becomes the nation and then he becomes an idea called political bribery and his opposition is the world and then he becomes fellow who wouldntcant stand the idea of smoke and the opposition is the atom bomb you see this is thethe termoppterm list im giving you but im giving it from the goal upwards not as you the auditor contact it all right well lets take it now at the point of the fellow who cant stand smoke versus the atomic bomb which is the most smoking thing which there is on the planet you see and those are the first two terminals you run into thats pardon the first two items you run into ris and the first terminal you run into for the preclear is fellow who cant stand smoke and the opposition you run into is the atomic bomb so as you list this goal oppose list you run into the atomic bomb and he says thats the most smoking thing i can think of the goal is to smoke or to be smoker so therefore i am the atomic bomb of course you are immediately backwards instantly backwards because the first items you run into the goal has gone into deterioration on the terminal side and an amplification on the oppterminal side so the amplification of the oppterm means that it is the top dog type of item and the individual as the term is the degraded type of item you never quite know what you are going to run into it isnt fair for an auditor to totally make up his mind so that listing or anything else can prove him wrong because its the mechanical facts of listing im just talking now about the gpm not so much how you audit it that is what it looks like that is what it looks like from standpoint of making the postulate to be smoker going through these various phases as terminals and meeting these various oppositions well now we know that problemthe reason its called goals problem mass is we know that problem is very balanced situation consistent problem is oneis consistent and continuous only because it is so well balanced between its two poles in other words the amount of violence contained in each one of the sides of the problem are more or less equal so the problem continues well when we look at gpm we find actually that it is composed of black masses and that is said advisedly you say what is mass well mass is mass if you had bunch of black cotton or something of the sort heaped up in the middle of the floor that is what the gpm looks like of course that whole black mass is composed of these little parts these terminals and opposition terminalsand each one of those is black mass well now we say problema problem consists of postulatecounter postulate which means an intention versus an intention and the husband wants to go to the movies the wife doesnt want to go to the movies so we have problem and if theirif their determination were equal it would be an unresolvable problem there are these determinations were exactly equal and it would hang just like that and it would go on interfering with their married life and itd become more and more solid and more and more reinforced and it would hang up now actually problems are almost impossible to balance in this fashion one side is stronger than the other and they overbalance therefore the residual of two hundred trillion years is composed of few sections few goals and relatively few of these items because they have to be so delicately and intricately balanced the opposition is hung up against the terminal and these things have to be very very very carefully delicately balanced in order to ride forward youll notice the odd part of it is that if you want something to ride forward in time you make two counteropposed efforts you have to have effort versus effort b counteropposed and if you get those things counteropposed they will rideit will ride forward in present time now the whole gpm is tending to ride forward in present time and its characteristic is instantaneousness because it has time in it that is because every time one of these firm identities has been opposed by firm opposition and where the balance necessary to hangup has been achieved we got timeless situation this thing started drifting forward in time with each click of the clock we werent able any longer to overbalance one and the other so there they are fist against fist incapable of being disturbed nothing disturbs these things and then we get two more on top of this and two more on top of this so those are jammed and then two more on top of this and two more on top of this and those jam and we eventually get this situation which is riding forward in time actually this goal has produced literally billions of identities but those arent the identities which we process billions of them but they didnt hang up in time do you see that because they werent accurately and exactly opposed they didnt hang up in time only those which hung up in time are those which have to be addressed what happened to these other identities well they just dropped off and asised and skipped it and so forth and thats fortunate for you because two hundred trillion years if you write it down on the wall and figure out that an identity was achievedoh every three or fourthree or four times century or even if an identity was achieved once every hundred years youll find out that you have an incalculable number of identities which have an incalculable number of oppositions and you just would never be able to process them there are just too many numerically it is just too many but fortunately its only those that were exactly balanced the terminal is exactly intentioned against the opposition which is exactly intentioned that match it with absolute precision that permits all this thing to drift forward forwell the first one has been drifting forward for two hundred trillion years thats how old it is pretty moldy thatsbut its what saves us in processing this thing is the almost incalculable rarity with which you got total hangup we dont always have the problem i want to go to the movies and you cant go to the movies we dont just have that hanging in life ordinarily the husband says well honey actually i think we ought to go to the movies because as we were passing the drugstore i was going to get you box of candy and she says well i think we better go to the movies huh and or conversely conversely she breaks out rolling pin hits him over the head and of course he cant go to the movies or anyplace else in other words the problem resolves itself there see one side overweights the other side but you get tenuous holding of one against the otherno matter what violence was interchanged they tenuously hold against each other and exactly balancedthat problem has never been solved so the gpm could be said to be that accumulation of identities and oppositions which have never been resolved from the beginning of time now of course some of those originate in relatively modern times but the earliest of them has been with us since the beginning of time now whatwhatwhy do we call this then the goals problem mass well we call it the goals problem mass because its generated by the effort on the part of the thetan to execute goal he has postulated thats goals problem because it is in terms of an identity versus another identity which has hung up as problem and we call it mass because this pair banging against each other has given us in the bank massgoals problem mass and that is why it is called that all right by the way its brandnew discovery in scientology so there is similar terminal to bei mean similar designation there arent even words for these terminalsfor opposition terminals i mean this has to be new nomenclature because there is absolutely nothing to measure up to this these things have never been observed before in the human makeup for instance were new as its new as this we were the ones who identified field what is field you know black field or different moving field or that sort of thing what is this were the first one that ever found out people had it and actually although few people have called attention toi think beginning about at 1913 somebody mentioned the fact that some people could see pictures i think thats about the earliest reference on it the lock secondary and engram are all original with us and then we take it one step deeper and we get the mass which is the result of having an identity and we call that circuit and oddly enough itll continue to talk itll continue to think itll continue to do lot of things when energized and we find people with these circuits and so forth those circuits are fringe that we normally see in operationare fringe parts of the gpm and were actually looking at the gpm when we look at circuits well we are the ones who have found these things and therefore our terminology for them is quite new but it can be nothing else because never having been discovered anyplace else it of course had terminology now look at the cycle of processing getting back to that first we started to make clears by accustoming people to look at their banks and be able to see that bank and just these little pictures and to the degree that they could confront those pictures you would get keyout that is to say the individual would longer let them bother him and going in on gradient scale you could do this todayits long and arduousyou could get the individual more and more accustomed to confronting his bank and more and more accustomed to it you could show it to him get him so he could see it so he could face it and the next thing you know hed see more and more things in it and more and more things in it be less and less flinching and next thing you know his needle on the emeter over herehis needle would go clean and you would have keyedout clear you could do that today actually you can tackle the gpm this way you can take 3m and you can call off items well you dont have to you can just sayafter youve listed the list you can say to the preclear which one of these is your item he tells you the wrong item he never tells you the right one by the way well not unless hes about one goal down youve already got his his cognition level is picking up and hes beginning to see these things auditors shouldnt be dissuaded however they should go on and get the item that reads but anyway you say which one of these is your item and he will inevitably particularly on the first goal and part of the secondcall it wrong and now if you took that item and you opposed ityou know it didnt readand you opposed it in some wayyoure doing listing as auditingand you got another list and you said which one of these is your item and the individual said well its that one thats wrong too because this list by the way doesnt rr and then you said all right which one of these is your item and the individual would say oh soandso theres some chance that you would produce keyedout clear this is quite interesting but theres some chance that you would do so theres always an equal chance or maybe superior chance that you would continue to drop him through into heavy areas and earlier gpms which made him go clank you know i mean justjust caved him right in just dragged him into zones and areas where he had business being so this is sure cure method but youre going to hear from time to time as the years go on some wild indian jumping up suddenly and learning how to make keyedout clear and trying to pass for the real thing weve been making keyedout clears now for sixteen years there is particular reason to make any more of them now theyve been enough worry to us thank you thewhat im getting at here is our first address then was really to locks and i almost fell out of my auditors chair back in 1947 or 48 when i found out that people could confront their birth now those engrams werent run see they could see prenatals they could see this they could see that they could see the other things and actually it was less confront i was throwing them into it more and more heavily see and i was not building them up and when i started to train auditors they didnt handle this smoothly and the next thing you know we were involved totally with mechanics and we were not involved in any way shape or form with the preclear you see the difference so therefore we got pcs going into engrams which were very hard to run indeed and this got us into dianetics in 1950 now we can do some marvelous things running engrams there is doubt about that and its quite remarkable running engrams but do you recognize that every individuality which this individual has had all the way along the track every person he has been had complete bank now look at that do you know how much bank there is in this current lifetime in pc well theres lot of bank man theres lots of pictures lots of locks lots of secondaries and you sit down to run out just one lifetime all the engrams in one lifetime and youre really biting off large chaw of tobacco thats big bite i dont think you could do it takes too long you realize that every thirty forty fifty sixty seventy years hes accumulatedif he were in body linehes accumulated complete bank you know complete bank as we see it in lifetime and that for every well lets say three times century or once century or some intermediate figure from here back two hundred trillion years at leastsee two hundred trillion years at leastfor every one of these lifetimes he has complete set of what he has in this lifetime you understand how many pictures that is it gets into some astronomical figure and if you had to erase each one of those pictures youd be in bad way as an auditor in other words erasing the whole bank got mixed up with keying out the bank and the defeat of dianetics was simplyto the degree it was defeated was simply undertaking to wash out to erase the whole bank not to key it out you understand big difference there the early techniques were very feathery they were very lightweight the pc did just exactly what he could confront i can remember vividly getting pc to go out and walk in the office three four five six times and shut his eyes each time and see if he could see picture of the office until he finally could see lock of the office and then id ask him if he could confront it and what he could confront in that in other words i made him make his own pictures these were people with fields and so forth but i hadnt myself seen field so i didnt know how to get people out of them when i found they were in them i could get people out of them as long as i didnt know they were in them you see but then when it was finally pointed out to by people that they were in fields and therefore couldnt see pictures i bought this because id never had any difficulty before i remember one time mary sue had big win this way one time we were just fooling around out in phoenix and she said shed never felt any effort ah old effort processing you know so i said oh you never felt any effort well lets see so i had her go aroundyou know shes quite featherweight and pick up the heavy end of the couch and then walk back and see if she could feel the effort of picking it up without picking it up got that and i made her do this and then feel the effort of doing it and then pick it up and she was actually you know phoenix is sort of warm but she finallyshe got away from it and sheand she could feel the effort she could get the idea of the effort and its the first time she ever had any idea of effort actually she hasnt had any trouble with any recognition of it since that was actually the type of processing which the earliest processing was walk in the room and close your eyes and see if you can see picture of the room oh you couldnt all right go on go on outside and walk in the room take look at the room and shut your eyes now just tell everything you did coming in the room and everything you did coming in the room and every can you see the picture you cant do it yet all right go outside and walk you got the idea it was just the idea you can got pictures and you can confront them that was the whole idea hereeffortyou can lift up the couch and then go over and get the idea of lifting up the couch and feel the effort of lifting up the couch after youve lifted up the couch you see actually thats getting the mental image picture of the effort is whatreally what it is it as kid you probably have leaned against two sides of the door with the backs of your hands you ever do that you get your two backs of your hands against the two jambs of the door and say hold yourself there very solidly you tell some other kid the second that you do this and step out of the door the residual effort in the muscles will make your arms go up without volition well thats quite interesting because thats actually not muscular action thats taking place thats mental image picture action youve postulated that the arms go out and they havent gone out so therefore the image starts running out you can do that with effort you can do it with all these things now that was keyout that was keyout as opposed to erasure you have big difference here because this is where we started making keyout clears 1947 and keyout clearing is successful but it isnt stable now the two things which had to be brought together occurred then with the first book which is the erasure of mental image picture and usually this was done withwell without much arc with the pc and when there was not much arc with the pc you didnt get chance to build up anything with the pc his confidence did not increase yes you could get rid of the immediate somatics you could get rid of the illnesses which were coming directly from that engram yes they were being caused by specific engram which could be located and yes the individual wasnt likely to have them again yeah all these things are true but the pcs ability to confront the bank had not been especially raised and in view of the fact that it had not been raised you did not get the keyout clear phenomena but look this started us on long run next thing you know were into past lives very unpopular subject very unpopular subject people dont like to be reminded of their last death rattles thats about all it amounts to it isnt that the church or state is against it they obliterate their memories and they sell everybody on the idea you only live but once that sure makes nothing out of people doesnt it youre only seventy years long when actually youre two hundred trillion years long thats method of making nothing out of things so we got into past lives and that was very unpopular i remember old joe winter he made classic statement i would rather err with galen than be right with hubbard and they actually passed ruling that we mustnt investigate past lives one time and it was very very fascinating imagine uproar the popularity of technology any time you worry about popularity when youre doing research whyand pervert the truth just so that you can be patted on the back as very smart fellow or something of the sort or very agreeable fellow or well liked fellow youre heading for being very badly hated fellow so there we werethere we were into the soup and with the idea of erasure addressing this to past livesmyself and other auditors were engaged all through 1951 exploring the length and breadth of the track exploring the length and breadth of the whole track wow the fda is probably spinning itself in right now on the old book history of man or what to audit that was one of the books they seized over there i hope they read it i hope they read it and get overtsget overts on it you knowand say it isnt true this grim weeper hawhawhawhaw haw you know boohoohoohoo you know eyes red for the nexti hope it doesnt key out i dont wish them any hard luck i just hope they get stuck there forever anyhow you could imagine it they get overts on book like that see god some people are adventurous anyway we concluded nah i concluded yeah we could find thi i have found things on the track that grim weeper amongst them that you can get sixteen dials of dropsixteen dialsone two three four fiveall consecutive consecutive falls just down down in other words whole tone arm drop like this down down down down down down down down this thing going on falling falling falling falling falling thats just one fall on one of those old engrams you like that thats steep man thats what some of those beach engrams will fall do wonderful things with them i audited guy nine hours one time i did lock scan i did an engram scan in order to lock him up in the engram he was stuck in an old trick found the engram he was stuck in he was stuck as clam at high tide with the sunlight shining in his face and my golly what it didnt do for that bird it took about nine hours to erase this engram marvelous change in the individual heard from him the other day by the way hes getting back on the bandwagon again he feels hes been out of it too long and so on well there are remarkable effects to be gained from that and that was the main trouble you could get terrific effects but we werent making clears what happened to the clears you know well what happened to them is that we were on different approach different approach we were trying to erase the whole ruddy lot and actually i backed off and began to investigate something else and this became scientology i finally found out what we were investigating we were investigating spirit i dont care whether you call it thetan or not its just the spirit in final analysis and we found that the spirit was the man now by george you know thats quite discovery because its long since been forgotten these people going around talking about my spirit i know that im out of my head we heard the early theetieweetie say because i am over there in that corner oh yeah youre over there all right hohoho the man is the spirit all there is alive in man is the spirit he is and probably its the first time in twentyfive hundred yearsstudied the subject of exteriorization there was undoubtedly successful study of it before psychiatry by the way had heard of exteriorization they considered it an insane manifestation which was some sort of delusion because people would tell them they were out of their heads at distance and they knew this was crazy so they never investigated any further than that but it had been remarked that some people were in this condition now this study had to was this much of hill climb man longer believed in this period of timeman longer believed that there was such thing as soul i mean in probablyin early christianity it would have been ball probably some of those fellows still thought of themselves as spirits they didnt say i will have to be good because my spirit wont go to heaven or something you know they probably thought of themselves as spirits they said well if im not good ii getting out of my skullwon1 go to heaven thats the way they probably figured it but all that had been lost and not only that had been lost but man had totally lost grip on this thing called the spirit it was something esoteric they believed in god because they had been taught to and so on they had reality on the situation at all nineteen fiftytwo saw an advent of exteriorization and that was for the first time in twentyfive hundred years that we have any record of at all buddha was the last one who was dealing with this now we didnt come into this because we were following buddha we came into this because we were studying the truth thats always something to remember we are not necessarily the inheritors of buddhism although youre liable to lay yourself wideopen trap there we walked into the side and found that there were certain truths and that this condition had existed and had been known twentyfive hundred years ago and was called bodhi bodhi hence buddha and called bodhi because when he first did it and blew out of his ead he was sitting under bodhi tree and thats where we get buddha well when i was fooling around with this why it was sitting under yucca tree so we should call it yucca see we should all be yuccas but i dont think that sounds very good so well skip that i didnt have such an approach to it the only approach i had to it at all was the fact that i was trying to locate what was it that was looking at these pictures because i found the pictures were absolutely inexhaustible in number thats terrible fact youll find that theyre infinite in number and nobody could erase them matter how good your technology of erasure was you certainly better find out what youre erasing with and what we were erasing with was thetan spirit we were it was the thetan who was doing this so of course i thought isnt this interesting all we have to do is exteriorize this fellow from the middle of all these pictures and hed be clear and sure enough you can produce well right now you could produce oneminute clear very easily you could tell somebody to be three feet back of his head and then tell him to be three back of the black mass he was in and he would be in verylots of cases he would be the first auditing process on exteriorization which has great validity was the commandwas figured out by evans farber and he came up and he sat up all night outside my window until i finally would come out and listen to this command and i did and he fed it to and i went three feet back of ead and there was yucca trees thereabout and few palm trees i guess itsthe conflict is whether or not we should be called palms or yuccas you see that makes us abandon both you see and he says you see it works it works you were right you know you c exteriorize and heres the command its try not to be three feet back of your head of course hed run into the negative flow and hed figured it out very carefully hed taken some of the recent pabs and hed figured it all out and he figured out the exact command that would produce this phenomena and bang so i blew him out of hishe blew out of my head and i blew him out of his head that was two thetan exteriors we had to our credit and so on anyway all this was very interesting but nobody would stay outside sometimes theyd stay outside for three days and then theyd be driving down the road hundred feet above their car and theyd hit traffic light or something of the sort and then theyd forget they were driving the car and go off and look at something or other and the traffic jam would occur and somebody would start manhandling the body into an ambulance something like that would occur or just start to occur and the individual would say oh nobodys going to take my body away from and hed go back in his head and you couldnt get him out again you say try not to be three feet back of your head and hed say haha haha well out of this i developed the theory of havingness it was obvious that havingness was more important to thetan than entrappedness isnt that interesting but of course somebody who is trapped in the middle of spikes doesnt like to be trapped but somebody who is only mildly uncomfortable doesnt mind it so much and when it comes to losing the body and going out of communication with everybody and losing the game and getting death restimulated and all thatwell theyd rather stay in their heads this still has an interesting series of workability i had an insane woman one time exteriorized her had an intelligent conversation with her got all the facts of the case and what it was all about she went back into her head again i did that on several occasions heres the point the point is that exteriorized out of his bank the thetan is sane and in his bank hes nuts thats it he has tremendous abilities and the funny part of it is as youll find in the philadelphia lectures thetans abilities are all measured taped everything else we know what thetan can do all that sort of thing see ive researched all that and all our work since has been sort of in reverse now recently1958 1957we start producing keyedout clears using techniques which were cross between being able to confront and mechanical erasure see the two techniques at the same time still produced keyedout clear but using them both in combination keyedout clear was produced do you see that all right nowi want you to get this nowwith 3m were producing an erasure clear see this isthis is different see this is different thing its an ultimate near ultimate you see why well having found the exact mechanics of this gpm i can make all these masses you see as you audit the fellow suddenly discharge and of course they cant hang up and the next pair of massesthey suddenly discharge and they cant hang up do you know what you do every time you blow couple of those items well there probably isnt just one lifetime packed into one of those items it may be dozens it may be hundreds of lifetimes and every one of those lifetimes has bank as long as this current lifetimes bank haha were blowing were not blowing locks were not blowing engrams were not chipping off few circuits were blowing packages of lifetimes and actually you can do it in thirtyfive minutes finding one item isnt that remarkable because i found out the only way it can hang up theres way for it to reassemble itself and i myself now have got terrific subjective reality on how this is done you blow itnothing can hang up and they just go they dont go back on the track they just go because theres nothing making them hang up and nothing generating the creativeness inherent in them so theres nothing to keep them created and thats all thats actually what youre doing its astounding its an utterly astounding fact every time you look at one of these things all right weve run into this item called smoker versus wife see and we find this ri smoker and we find this is the bottom two on the chain weve come all the way down the chain and we find the opposition wife well the charge when it goes off of this meter is the only charge that was holding both of those pair in suspension and in view of the fact that thewhen the meter charge went out you had nothing to keep them in suspension in time and that wasnt much charge it just went ffstffstffst and you get to the wife the goal itself is probably your next thing up and the next item you get is the goal to be smoker and that goes pshew pshewpshew and fire and youre not going to find anything of that gpm sticking around to amount to anything there would be few little locks and few little this and that in other words weve gone right down the center channel of that gpm thats whats caused the blow these gpm items are each one package of lifetimes each one several identities usually crowded into each one and theyve summated one way or the other under some heading and therefore they register on the emeter and the oppositions theres just countless numbers of oppositions connected with that one opposition phrase these two things are in total balance with that rocket read they blow one against theeach other and theyre gone there is way to hold that there is goal there to hold it there is bottom two terminals to hold it the rest of the gpm goes but youve got to come all the way down or you dont find the bottom terminals so you blow this charge this charge this charge this charge this charge blow the bottom two charge blow the goal charge and thats the end of that gpm youll sit there and look at free needle now you havent got keyedout clear this guy isnt going to cave in in another three years theres nothing hes going to have to live two hundred trillion to get that many accidental hangups see its not permanent its only probably worth another two hundred trillion see now ill buy that thats good enough for at the moment now heres the composition of the gpm when you first enter the case you find person who is usually so agitated in this lifetime that you couldnt even find the basic goal of it youve got to give him some auditing to smooth him out to get him up so that he can confront things enough so that youve got this lifetime one of the best answers to that is problems intensive something like this now when you startyou start making goals list the goal itself being postulate can be read all through this gpm so its the commonest read to the gpm so thats why you can find goal reading before you can find an item reading it travels on the wings of thought and its common denominator to whole gpm very simple your next action then is to find this fellows goal and youll get this goal firing now what would this goal oppose and youll run into either the first terminal or oppterm each item found has to be terminal or oppterm on its own merits not because of how it was opposed and then from that you find the next item and sometimes people wanting to make things complicated give headache today i found out that people are packaging 3m with four items you dont do 3m that way you have big line plot and this is terminals and thats oppterms and you just put down every terminal you find and every oppterm you find on the line plot in the chronology of found and that is what you do and if that is too simple im sorry but that is the way it is you dont make fourway packages and then take each one that is left over and try to oppose it independently and get every oh christ you know why do something like that look all it is is spiral staircase you enter thisyou find the goal by reaching to the bottom of this thing with an emeter and find the common denominator to it all and then you find out what the goal opposed and it runs you into the top of the spiral staircase and then that gets you to the next terminal and then that gets you to the oppterm and that gets you to the terminal and that gets you to the oppterm and that gets you to the next terminal and that gets you to the next oppterm that gets you to the next terminal and that gets you to the next oppterm and that gets you to the goal and it all goesits going boom boom boom as youre getting these things and then it all goes psheuuuuuuu and thats the end of that and you got free needle now why do you want to make it more complicated than it is its awful simple yeah you say but every once in while you wind up with something that wont package oh do you well if you find something here that wont package youre going to find an extra item over here that would fit up there anyhow and the pc will recognize it so why worry just put them down chronologically put them all down chronologically on your terminals and oppterms on the plot and it will all come out right eventually the thing sometimes will get down to here and the terminal that was missing up here will suddenly come off of this but if you put it here it also belongs here but the pc will say hey that belongs there so you just write it in there too dont get so complicated man i worked it out so its so simple now youre going to spend the rest of your life making this thing involved look the miest universe doesnt need your help its got us involved enough already its actually very simple mechanism what happens when you get to the bottom of this gpm whats it look like from there ill tell you secret the next gpm alongside of it is what the first gpm would not oppose and the next gpm below that may be an opposite to the second one found but your gpms run in pairs just like items run in pairs and your gpm is hung up on the counterinteraction of the goals only its hung up on fourway packet so youve got positive and youve got negative and youve got notopposenotoppose the first two gpms youll find are on the postulate notoppose each other i dont care what the goals are they just wont oppose each other theyre pals and theyre hung together by affinity and the couple below them are hung together by opposites but this tells you something interesting it tells you that when you first enter the pcs goal channel you actually might enter any one of the four goals any one of the first four goals now somebodyeager beaver around the organization actually ought to build gpm so they can see what it looks like and use colored spheres and if they used colored spheres these colored spheres would look like this youd have rope of spheres these are greengreen spheresall hung together and with toothpicks or something they would connect another rope of green spheres with black stripes thats just to show you its the same gpm but the black striped ones are oppterms cowboy in the black hat you know so youd get these two ropes and theyre hung together the goal is down at the bottom and then they go terminal oppterm terminal oppterm matching each other knicketyknock up to the top of this thing all right thats two ropes of spheres thats oneone gpm section or cycle see that whole thing is hung up on one goal now lets take sometwo more ropes just as though we strung these great bigoh you know like croquet balls or somethingand we strung these things all together lets havelets have pink ones pink croquet balls and lets make two ropes of pink croquet balls and hang them together with toothpicks the twotwo opposite balls on the rope you seerope rope b so the first ball on rope is pinned against the first ball on rope b dont you see and that goes down balls opposite balls till we get to the bottom of this thing and at that point we have another goal an entirely different goal but oddly enough these twotwo chains of two are interrelated so weve got theseweve got these two gpms well we hang them smash together like that theyactually their items dont oppose the items across but the goals at the bottom are connected theyre pals they have affinity now lets take two more such sets in other words set of two ropes of spheres with goal at the bottom and another set of two ropes of spheres with goal at the bottom and we hang them onto the bottom of these first two now weve got four sets havent we weve got four goals do you see that weve got four goals one goal influences two ropes of similar color which each item of which opposes the item on the other rope you got that picture all right in doing goals assessment you will have many things fire youre liable to see many rocket readstwo three four five some of these things fire very slightly some of them fire quite well do you know that you actually could be do you know that you actually could be on one of the other three rather than the first one up now as we hang up this gpm let us say that the pink one here that i described first is number one up and the other one hangs just out of phase with it just little bit lower but do you know its goal will also read with an occasional rocket read it may be tiny but it occasionally will read the one you want is the pink one and thatll rocket read every time and yet youre liable to enter this thing on the basis here of the second gpm you see and youre only going to get little reads and thats going to sweat you to death running that one itll follow all the rules but youveyoure running the little tiny one and you should be running the big one see because it looks small to you because the reads arent very big really youd getitd be very easy running this first one the pink one whereas youre running maybe the red one that i described now oddly enough theoretically you could also get down to the lower two and boy that would read flick once in blue moon and if you tried to run one of those things it would practically kill the pc you would never get it to rocket read to amount to anything it would be more like tick or something but youll have trace of it now you get family of goals then which have these gpms connected with them its family of goals and these goals will all have something in common smoker is let us say is your top goal that was ready to be plucked but right alongside of it and just bit junior to it as far as your meter reads the first time but actually far beefier when you really get to running it is second goal to be fireball now actually fireball wont oppose smoker and smoker wont oppose fireball its notoppose situation and then we get down below smoker and we find its associated goal this third gpm pair of ropes that i was talking about that third one and were going to have something like to be pure man without bad habits this is just talking off the cuff you see and thats going to oppose member of the ymca see to be member of the ymca we dont care what thewhat these goals are theres four goals these two down here wont oppose each other and the two close to the top up here theythey wont oppose each other but theres an opposite one down underneath it isnt that interesting so they go these goals go by association but notoppose is the keynote but they all have something in common even though theyre opposites you understand the first pair that you run into is to have real bad habits the next pair you get will be to have real good habits therell be something about the next pair each one of them will have that in common and thats how they get locked up one upon the next i consider it quite interesting that theres frequency amongst gpms which is the message im giving you this evening which is rather amusing because youre all engaged in trying to find the first goal see im already telling you well the gpm goes in frequencies youre trying to find the first pair of the dumbbell that goes together you got goal oppose and gee will that ever fire and will you ever find the next one against and so on im just telling you offhandedly that theres four sets of these things which are set in amongst themselves and that isnt the end of it not by long ways because there are other of these gpms your saving grace is is the deeper you go the higher toned the pc is its mechanical proposition it isnt so much matter of confront its what hes confronted although you have to hold his morale up to keep his meter reading and you got these next ones and of course theres other sets of gpms but not an infinity now i consider it very interesting that the possibility exists of getting the first goal that you get on this pc of being actually the second goal ready to be run thats the misbehavior the difficulty of the goal that sort of thing there may be very available goal which is right up to the top which youve just missed well what im telling you about all this if you have two gpms which notoppose each other if your first item that you encounter thats the top items is senior in opposition and junior you see and degraded in terminal see the oppterm is more smacking of the goal than the terminal thats the truth of the matter you see the pc is pulled less and less away from the goal and the opposition has become more and more like the goal as he has accumulated masses well i consider this very interesting because it gives you way to get goals you can dream up things of that because he considers his own goal is an opposition in other words the opposition terminal is more germane to his goal than he is so you get such questions as what goal would be impossible to achieve all right lets say you find goal that sporadically goes bang and that sort of thing and wont really prove out and wont rocket read you realize you might have the notbecause you said impossible to achieve you might have this second mass over here you might have the goal of it its not ready to be run yet but you say what goal would not oppose the goal you just found and all of sudden he will give you immediately the family goal you know that is ready to be found do you see the gates that this opens to goal finding this is theoretical lecture descriptive lecture not lecture of whole series of techniques im just showing you here now what about this top one well you get such questions as what action in present time makes you go frantic if you fail at it see youll find out thats always the common denominator of the goal ready to be run it is very common in present time he considers it part of his life he possibly wont even put it down on the list because it is so much part of his life and he does it all the time anyway and that is his personality but you just ask him what does he get frantic about if he cant do it and he will present you with his goal you take series of actions like that you could assess these things and then write goals for the point that you got youim not trying to give you technique im just showing you here that thereif you know these mechanics which i have just given you on the subject of goalsif you know these mechanicsthen theres possibility that you could work the pcs goal out in other words he considershe may only consider that his goal would be difficult to achieve or he may consider its something he doesnt want to have to achieve or something he would find it very tiring if he found to do or something that would make him very frantic if he did it why because its most representative terminal which is closest to present time is very very weak and the most representative terminal to the goalthe goal itself is the oppterm so therefore he must be fighting at this stage of the game the enemy and so you will find it work out hes fighting hes busy every day of his life fighting the enemy its his own goal imagine the poor fellow that had to go up against kaiser bill or hitler who had the goal to conquer earth yet of course he knew of course that was very evil even though it was his own goal so you get his goal you say all rightyou knew that this made him very unhappyyou say wellyou get hitler see as an oppterm that firesand you say all right what goal did hitler have that would bethat you would find very antipathetic and he gives you to conquer earth and that rocket reads because that is the pcs goal you get the idea you get the mechanics the way it is now supposing it just went tick and it rocket read once and then you couldnt get it to rocket read again then the chances are that youre in the family of goals thats ready to be found but youve got the goal of one of the other gpms well you possibly could do something like this you could find out what wouldnt oppose it or what would be the opposite of this goal that rocket read once and the pc gives you the right goal to be run in other words im showing you that there are elements here and there are mechanics here andin the anatomy of the gpmwhich bid fair to make goal finding easier and to make the gpm run out very very well because you try to run out the wrong gpm first and youre going to be in bad trouble because your reads are going to be bad and everythings going to be bad and youre going to have trouble all the time and the frequencies are going to be the same but you wont be able to read the metera lot of things like that are wrong but as far as the gpm is concerned it is mechanical proposition and all you have to do is just get the charge off each pair of items and then after youve got this gpm runyou dont run one gpm against the other gpm but after youve got gpm one run you go to gpm two thats from the top down counting and you get its discharge gpm three will be ready to come up gpm four will be ready to come up you dish around for another goal youll find another set that is just waiting there to be run and you get those things apart and its just blowing charge because you blow that charge youve blown up these accidental hangups which are almost impossibly mathematically for them to have existed that this problemthink of it and this is what led us into the discovery of the gpm is i realized that problem which has endured for two hundred trillion yearsoh man that must be the most delicate balance ever known to man that must be pin versus pin both of them meeting with their points to travel ahead this long the balance must be so perfect that none of his livingnessnot getting shot or killed or ruled by kennedy nothing seewould absolutely unsettle this for two hundred trillion years well this is kind of weird contraption so i sat down and figured out what kind of contraption that would be that would endure that way and came up with the gpm and it worked therefore we have mechanical address your job is just to get these consecutive points missing in other words blow the charge between these two items and they go you dont have to do anything more with them its like humpty dumpty all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put humpty dumpty together again but theres nothing easier than to drop an egg all youall im asking you to do is drop few eggs simple all right by knowing this anatomy and giving you now what ive know of the gpm objectively theoretically i extrapolated all this from the top of the thing and then imagine my surprise to walk in and find it this way and even neater it gives you way to find goals it tells you what you can do with goals that you have found occasionally it tells you what kind of terminal to expect coming up it tells you really what you have to do in running the thing it tells you what youre looking for in other words it gives you lot of data and should give you lot of success the material contained in clearing will actually only be complicated to you to the degree that you try to make it complicated now in just the last hour and five minutes or something like that i have been able to describe to you bangety bangety bang i think so that you could duplicate it certainly if you heard the lecture again you could dead easy i think youve got good grip on what this is i think you see what youre going up against and so forth this isthis man is the riddle of the ages what makes man the way he is i mean what is the bank what is the reactive mind what is all these things what are they composed of and so forth well its actually in actual fact contained in this very very short lecture the thing is not very esoteric subject you try to get more involved in it than youre involved you try to involve it more than it needs to be involved you try to put it together in packages which are the square root of fortytwo because that was after all the talmuds figurei dont know where you got all thatand youre going to have lots of trouble i dont want you to have trouble with the thing the thing is very simple all you do is go down the spiral staircase and blow all the item packages that you run into you dont go packaging things you just blow them you ask the pc every once in while if it confronts this and if that oppterms that and if the goal refers to that thats just to keep him happy not to get anything done and you get on down to the bottom of the thing the goal blows and youre into the next gpm and you do the same thing and you run that out and youve got permanent erased clear this is new thing it isnt keyedout clear and so actually were on the border of ot because frankly you never would have made an ot with keyedout clear because the whole bank that i have just described to you stood as barrier between him and the accomplishment of those activities and at any time he committed an overt that referred to that bank it would have keyed in with him again so the route is open to ot which would be the route to total freedom and that has just opened up here in the last few months thank you very much thank you good night
