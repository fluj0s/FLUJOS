ym counter terrorism subject president saleh to as bloomfield new manpads classified by ambassador thomas c krajeski reasons 14 b d 1 c summary assistant secretary of state for political military affairs lincoln p bloomfield jr discussed proposed us manpads buyback and destruction initiative with yemeni president ali abdullah saleh on september 1 saleh not only agreed to move forward with the modalities of the buyback but pledged to as that the royg would not seek to buy any new systems despite salehs attempt to extract more money out of the buyback offer post expectshopes to conclude an agreement in the next two weeks as bloomfields august 31 meeting with minister of interior alalimi chief of military staff qassemi and national security bureau saleh covered septel end summary saleh we have to get them off the market 2 c as lincoln p bloomfield jr and ambassador met with yemeni president saleh on september 1 to discuss the proposed us manpads buyback initiative saleh welcomed as bloomfields visit and the manpads initiative describing it as part of continuing us yemeni joint security efforts in the arabian gulf and the middle east as bloomfield thanked the president for his countrys cooperation and partnership in the gwot emphasizing that manpads in particular pose grave threat to us and yemeni global security interests should they fall into terrorist hands saleh readily agreed adding these weapons in the hands of qaida or jihadists threaten yemens security forces we have to get them off the market 3 c as bloomfield outlined the manpads buyback initiative explaining it was very specific proposal to purchase and destroy systems collected by the royg in addition to compensation for each system us technical training and assistance would be provided to ensure the safety of manpads collection and transportation and to conduct destruction as bloomfield stressed that there was 90day window in which to buy and destroy current royg illicit stocks and that while the program did not have time limit the funding was indeed finite 4 s saleh told as bloomfield that the royg was currently in possession of 1435 manpads including 500 he had recently collected from private people just prior to his departure to london for an official visit on september 25 the president made clear that these systems would be offered up for sale and destruction according to the proposed initiative adding that he estimated there were another 150 200 still in private hands which the royg is targeted for collection note on august 31 as bloomfield viewed 79 recovered manpads stored in mod facility the 1435 appear to be some combination of these 79 plus the other 1029 emboffs observed in the same facility in 2003 and number of other illicit systems we were unaware had been collected we will seek clarification on these numbers from nsb deputy director ammar saleh end note 5 c president saleh assured as he was serious about cutting off the possibility of manpads leakage from official stocks he said he had given the order to collect all systems from the yemeni armed forces in the field and return them to storage immediately as commended the presidents actions to get these dangerous missiles out of dangerous hands emphasizing that yemeni manpads must remain under the lock and key of the authorities actually saleh responded we dont need them saleh promises new manpads 6 c saleh pledged to as bloomfield that yemens national defense did not require manpads to the contrary the current crisis in sada proves it was big mistake to allow such weapons to fall into the hands of our enemies where they can be used against our own forces i assure you said the president there will be new deals we will not trade in them bloomfield responded you have made very important statement that manpads are more useful to terrorists than to your military 7 s as told saleh he is engaged in ongoing discussions with source country governments in eastern europe to stop exporting manpads but that we have indications arms dealers claiming to represent yemen continue to shop in these markets for advanced manpads saleh advised you cannot prevent north korea china ukraine russia or belarus from producing or selling weapons i do not believe you will be successful although he continued maybe you can convince them to sell through official government contracts and not through brokers as bloomfield agreed that controlling weapons production was not easy but explained that arms firms in nations working with the us to limit production of manpads report that yemen remains potential client replied saleh we do not need them 8 s as bloomfield asked the president if our friends in eastern europe tell they have contract with yemen may i tell them you do not saleh replied yes tell them the contract is canceled stop it one has deal to sell such weapons to yemen unless they talk to as replied that salehs pledge not to acquire new manpads should not be underestimated as it would enhance yemens reputation in washington and the international community in exchange for one million dollars 9 c rest assured saleh continued yemen will not have such weapons anymore but everything has price you will have to payone million dollars for each strela note after an awkward silence saleh laughed indicated he was exaggerating and promised the price would come down in fear some uncertainty remained the palace translator turned to as saying i feel it is my duty to make sure you understand this is joke end note how much are you willing to pay pressed the president as responded that that the price for each manpad was fixed and not negotiable fixed but well above what we believe to be the market price alhouthi lessons learned 10 s saleh told as that the recent events in sada where royg forces are embroiled in an increasingly bloody fight against the wellequipped supporters of rebel shiite cleric alhouthi has proven that it was big mistake to allow these weapons to reach enemy hands saleh reported to as that 250 soldiers had been killed and 10001500 injured in addition to 300350 rebels note post believes the number of royg casualties to be much higher end note 11 s as bloomfield replied that the us was aware of the cost to yemen of the recent fighting and that this hurts us too as told saleh that the embassy is looking to see how else we can help and the kitchen sink 12 s as expected saleh raised extending the buyback to include other types of weapons he reported that the royg has been buying back all types from the grey market since 911 including sa2 and sa3 surfacetoair missiles machineguns antitank missiles mines rpgs and explosives we have already paid 9 billion rials approximately 49 million usd to keep these weapons out of qaida hands claimed the president we are ready to destroy them we hope you will not limit the program to manpads note the royg claims it has collected 32 million usd in assorted swla and is seeking to recover this expense although we doubt the claim of 32 million we understand from mod and nsb contacts that the royg has yet to reimburse the arms dealers it contracted to collect these weapons and minister of defense alaiwa is under considerable pressure to make good on the deal end note inventory control assistance 14 s as emphasized that the program on the table is urgent and specific it targets several countries with large numbers of these dangerous systems he stressed that the current proposal is for manpads only and he is offering to buy them for significantly more than market price we hope that this important first step will be completed as soon as possible said as adding that he was prepared to explore ways the us can assist the royg in controlling its official stocks such as providing inventory controls computer systems stockpile security and training saleh replied that he looked forward to learning the details of this assistance give us our spare parts 15 c saleh complained to as of ongoing licensing difficulties which had grounded f5s and augusta helicopters and rendered m60 tanks and m109 artillery inoperable we have made request after request he said why doesnt the us respond the president repeated common theme telling as bloomfield that he pays high political price in the region and internally for his ct cooperation with the us our cooperation he said will be commensurate with yours as much as you move we will move 16 s as bloomfield responded that the usg appreciates its cooperative relationship with yemen in the gwot and pointed out that as demonstration of our trust yesterday i gave military chief of staff qassemi c130 licensing agreement interrupted saleh that is transport plane we need our f5 in sada as assured the president that he would personally look at each yemeni licensing request when he returned to washington and would make sure that they received full consideration note when as bloomfield handed the c130 license to chief of staff qassemi on august 31 the general said sarcastically these few parts to transport plane represent the biggest step forward in our military to military cooperation in years end note comment what wont haggle 17 s all joking aside saleh appears serious in trying to push up the price per system it is hard to imagine shrewd operator like the president paying more than market price for strela 2s approximately 2000 usd it would be true to style for saleh to try to extract as much possible from the usg in exchange for his security cooperation on the margins of the meeting nsb deputy director and salehs nephew ammar saleh recommended as bloomfield send the president followup letter to our meeting listing other benefits to yemen that may result from the agreement and urging him not to break the deal over prices that cannotwill not change end comment krajeski
