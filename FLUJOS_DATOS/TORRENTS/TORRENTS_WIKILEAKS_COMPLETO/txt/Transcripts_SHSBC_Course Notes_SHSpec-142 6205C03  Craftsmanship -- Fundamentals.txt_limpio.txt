6205c03 shspec142 craftsmanship fundamentals session missed withhold is anything the pc thought but didnt tell the auditor that is fins for the session but in prepchecking you want meat not skim milk you want meaningful acts it isnt necessarily antisocial or unmannerly acts like masturbation or nosepicking embarrassing acts that you are looking for what you are looking for is overts not just seamy withholds there is difference comments on the above tvd you can have chain based on notknowingness even if there is nothing there to be notknown this isnt common missed withhold of nothing you never give up on the fundamentals when the pc gets nattery he has missed withhold whether the natter has any basis in reason or not not many you audit by those you should get your own reality on this it can be crammed down your throat but it is better understanding since stable datum fixed in by confusion and not by understanding isnt available in tight spot this leads to auditing by being reasonable fundamentals are meant to be used if i tell you something is fundamental dont just believe it is find out if it is or is not in your own universe it will be but if you never find this out for yourself you will just keep going on by rote and ritual if you do find this out for yourself you will not need all your old stable data or superstitions what i expect of an auditor is to audit the pc that is right there in front of him by the most fundamental fundamentals that he can command and understand he will always get wins that way and he wont be in fog about any of it he will be able to evaluate importances in the ritual in prepchecking your what question will often miss the mark by bit because after all until you have done the prepcheck you dont know exactly what the chain is and if it is that unknown to the pc how could you know all about it before you found out from the pc besides all basic incidents must be unknown at least in part or the chain would blow auditing by fundamentals you know enough about the chain to formulate what question that will come close enough to get what you need as you go earlier you find yourself asking about similar things but not the exact same overt at the earlier time you get what question that describes the incident in workably general terms and go from there hoping for the best all you have to null is the incident that you got the what question from prepchecking is not an exact activity it depends on the pc in front of you because it is inexact you must do it in the framework of total exactitude that is given in model session trs metering all your fundamentals that must be known solidly when you have that you can play by ear with confidence and results any craftsman can create the illusion of terrific ease and offhandedness however the common denominator of all great art is great ability to do small detail if one tries to shortcut the ability to do the details and just does the offhanded action the result is slop an auditors tiny details consist of the meter trs model session etc how do you get to be superb auditor by knowing all these small parts perfectly if you find yourself wondering about any one of them you must practice drill to get it straightened out you can go over these items and ask yourself if any of them have been shaky in recent sessions and work on what you find dont let embarrassment stop you from finding out what needs to be worked on only when you have mastered the detail will you be free to audit the pc in front of you you wont be free to audit the pc in front of you as long as you are enslaved by dont knows among your auditing tools because you get chain of error that mounts in she session based on the basic notknowingness dont think that you will get results real honesttogod results if you are anything less than master of the craft that is the discouraging point of auditing the running of repetitive processes without attention on the pc hoping far the best does make lot of people well as does engram running this could get longtime auditors stuck in win but we havent had techniques prior to 1962 that reached all cases we have them now but they require precision auditing masters touch you have to find out that the technology we have does give the pc wins you find that out by auditing and seeing the results if you know all the parts trs metering model session etc then you can audit by fundamentals with confidence and ease there is more tension
