health care whose price has tended to rise faster than overall prices other things being equal that would suggest that the cpiw tends to understate the inﬂation experience of the average elderly

developments warrant background the federal government in an effort to protect the purchasing power of social security benefits indexes those benefits to increases in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers cpiw there is concern however that the cpiw may not accurately reflect the inflation expe rience of the elderly population it has been asserted that the elderly face higher inflation rate because they tend to spend larger share of their household budget on goods and services whose prices have been rising faster than average more to the point it is argued that increases in social security benefits have not kept pace with increases in the prices of those goods and services purchased by the elderly and that some other index might be more appropriate as

the index which is used to determine costofliving adjustments colas for benefits the cpiw is published monthly by the bur eau of labor statistics of the department of labor bls it is designed to measure changes in the prices of goods and services purchased by those who earn more than half of their income from clerical or wage occupations and have been employed at least 37 weeks in the previous year1 this group accounts for about 32 of the total nonins titutional population but it only tracks the employed to the extent that retirees purchasing patterns differ the effect of inflation

dollar expenditu res and how those expenditures were allocated across different categories of goods and services in the survey consumer unit refers primarily to households it may be fa mily an individual or group that pools its income for consumption purposes the figure s show the distribution of expenditures in 2006 for the population as whole as well as for the elderly population the largest differences in spending patte rns between the elderly and the general population are found in the shares of ex penditures accounted for by health care2 those aged 65 and older spent more than twice as large share of their total outlays on health care than did the overall population with re spect to the population aged 75 and older the share of their spending allocated to health care was close to three times as large as that of the total population three other expend iture categories differed by more than 2 percentage points for the over65 population shelter insurance and pensions which includes life insurance premiums and contributions to social security and other pension plans and cash contributions which are paym ents to persons outside the household and include alimony

costs have consistently risen more rapidly than the average price level between december 1982 and december 2007 the cp iw increased at an annual rate of 30 compared to 54 rate of increase fo r the medical care com ponent of the cpiw because the elderly consume greater than average share of good whose price has tended to rise faster than overall prices the cpiw may nd to understate the inflation

population may differ from that of the population at large so too are there diffe rences within the elderly population itself summary inflation measure for rge population group will exactly account for the experience of each member of that gr oup differences in spending patterns in combination with different rates of price chan ge for all of the various goods and services included in the cpi mean that individua l inflation rate experiences may range significantly above or below the measured averag if there is great deal of variation in both the general population and within subgroups such as the elderly small difference in average inflation rates between groups may not be significant3 suppose the average inflation ra of the elderly population is slightly higher than the rate for the overall population but that the di stribution of individual inflation rates among the elderly is widely dispersed in this case all of the elderly would be better off if their benefits were indexed to an inflation measure based on the average elderly household within the elderly population however there would be several different consequences first there would be so elderly whose infl ation rates would be understated by the overall rate but exaggerated by the elde rly inflation measure second there would be those elderly whose inflation rates were higher than either the overall measure or one based on elderly consumption patterns finally there would be number of elderly whose actual infla tion rates would be lower than either the overall measure or one based on the elderly one study of the distribution of infl ation rates across th population found with regard to inflation rates that differen ces between demographi c groups were small in comparison with the variation within those groups further it was found that differences between groups tended not to be stable over time this study argued that one group suffered disproportionately from inflation4 if the variation in consumption patterns is great among the elderly and if the average inflation rate of the elderly is not dramatically different from the average rate of the overa ll popu lation then arguments for separate index for the elderly populati on might be less compelling bls experimental cpi for the elderly in 1987 congress amended the older amer icans act of 1965 to direct bls to develop an experimental price index to track inflation in the population age 62 and older bls has calculated estimates of such an index that go back to december 19825httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20060crs5 6 ernst r berndt et prescrip tion drug prices for the elderly monthly labor review september 1998 pp 2334table 2 presents those estimates alongside actual data for the cpiw and the consumer price index for all urban consumer s cpiu the cpiu measure is based on larger population than the cpiw and unlik the cpiw takes the elderly population into account the cpiu is the measure of infl ation most often cited in press reports the figures show that there have been only two years 1983 and 2007 in which either of the two official indexes rose more rapidly than the experimental one the average annual rate of change between december 1982 and decem ber 2007 for the experimental index was 33 over the same period the cpiw rose at 30 rate and the cpiu rose at 31 rate that the cpiu was closer to the experimental index than the cpiw was due at least in part to larger weight given to health care outlays because its marketbasket is influenced by the spending patterns of the elderly although the differences in the three indexe s are usually in the direction that might be expected there are number of considera tions to keep in mind because this is an experimental index fewer resources were us ed in its development for example the survey on which its marketbasket is based was considerably smaller than the surveys used for the cpiw and cpiu and so is subject to greater sampling error further additional survey was conducted to determine if the elderly shop in different outlets than the population as whole if bls were to in itiate an official cpi for the elderly program it would involve more resources and might yi eld different results from those presented here the experimental index s hown here is based on diffe rent weights assigned to different categories of goods and services however there may also be substantial differences in consumption patterns within t hose categories that could also change the figures shown in table 2 study by bls looked in pa rticular at spending by the elderly on prescription drugs6 among other things this study found that there was considerable variation in the types of drugs purchased by ag however the study found strong evidence that there were significant agerelated differences in prescription drug inflation policy considerations aside from the practical considerations such as how much of difference having separate price index for th elderly would make there ar number of other things to consider for example if the primary purpose of developing separa index is for social security cost of living adjustments it should be kept in mind that not all social security recipients are elderly thus the elderly population might not be the appropriate one to measure in adjusting social security benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20060crs6 table 2 consumer

appropriate to have separate elderly price index for adjusting social security benefits should that new index be used to adjust income tax brackets of elderly taxpayers which are currently indexed to the cpiu finally because there is substantial variation in inflation rates am ong individuals and between di fferent groups of individuals any single measure of inflation is going to over or understate the inflation actually experienced by many
