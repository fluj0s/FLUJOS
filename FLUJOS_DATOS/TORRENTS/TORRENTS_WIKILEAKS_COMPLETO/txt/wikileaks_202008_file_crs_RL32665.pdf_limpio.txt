summary in february 2008 as part of its pr oposed fy2009 budget the navy submitted to congress the fy2009 version of its annua l 30year shipbuilding plan the 30year plan is intended to support the navys go of achieving and maintaining 313ship fleet the navy first presented the 313 ship plan to congress in february 2006 although the fy2009 30year shipbuild ing plan if implemented would generally be adequate to ach ieve and maintain fleet of about 313 ships it does not include enough ships to fully support certain elements of the 313ship fleet consistently over the long r shortfalls would occur in areas such as amphibious lift capability and the number of attack submarines the fy2009 30year plan moreover includes new assu mptions about extended rvice lives for amphibious ships and destroyers if these longer service lives are not achieved it could increase the shortfall in amphibious lift capability and create shortfall in the number of cruisers and destroyers the navy this year has increased its timate of the average annual cost to fund the 30year plan by about 44 in real i nflationadjusted terms the navys new estimated cost for implementing the 30year plan is about 7 less than estimates issued by the congressional budget offi ce cbo the navy downplayed cbos estimates in 2007 referring to them in tes timony as worstcase analysis or as an extremely conservative estimate the increase in the navys estimated cost for implementing the plan is so large that the navy longer appears to have clearly identifiable announced strategy for generating the funds needed to implement the 30year plan at least not without significantly reducing funding for other navy programs or increasing the navys programmed budget in coming years by billions of dollars per year concerns about the

table the fy2009 30y ear shipbuilding plan if implemented would generally be adequate to achieve and maintain fleet of about 313 ships under the fy2009 30year plan the navy is to reach total of at least 313 ships in fy2019 th ree years later than under the fy2008 30year shipbuilding plan primary cause of the threeyear delay is the fy2009 plans 13ship reduction in the total number of ships planned for proc urement in fy2009fy2013 most of the 13 ship reduction is due to an 11ship reduction in the number of littoral combat ships lcss planned for fy2009fy2013 which is consequence of the

ships to fully support certain elements of the 313 ship fleet consistently over the long run shortfalls would occur in areas such as amphibious lift capability and the number of attack submarines the navys report on the 30year plan states while in the main this plan achieves the necessary raw numbers of ships and sustains the shipbuilding industrial base there are certa in time periods where the ship mix and therefore inherent capability of the force varies from that required as result of funding constraints and the timing of legacy fleet service life limits5 the fy2009 30year plan includes new assumptions about extended service lives for amphibious ships and destroyers if these longer service lives are not achieved it could increase the shortfall in amphibious lift capability and create

marine corps states that fully meeting the requirement for an amphibious force capable of lifting the assa ult echelons of 20 marine expeditionary brigades mebs would require 33ship amphibious force that includes 11 lpd17s b although the fy2009 30year shipbuilding plan includes 12 replacement ssbns rather than the 14 called for in the 313ship plan the navy has testified that the 12 new ssbns would be sufficient to perform th missions of todays 14ship ssbn force because the 12 new ships would be built with lifeoftheship nuclear fuel cores and consequently would not require midlife refue lings the navy states that the need for todays ssbns to be taken out of service for some time to receive midlife refuelings is what drives the need for 13th and 14th ssbn amphibious ships although the fy2009 30year shipbuilding plan would support force of 32 or 33 amphibious ships as opposed to total of 31 called for in the 313ship plan this 32 or 33ship force would include 9 san antonio

11 lpd17s and 11 lsd4149 class amphibious shipsclass amphibious ships as opposed to the 10 called for in the 313ship plan6 the navys report on the fy2009 30year shipbuilding plan states while the mix of the 33 amphibious ships reflected in this plan differs slightly from the usmc requirement it represents acceptable risk considering the amphibious ships planned for decommissioning are not scheduled for dismantling or sinking to permit mobilization at later date if required the decommissioning ships are being replaced with newer more capable lpd 17 and lha 6 class ships the navy will maintain the 33ship requirement for amphibious shipping through the fydp while these new ships are integrated into the battleforce consequently there will be amphibious ship capability gaps through at least fy 20197 the marine corps states that liftin g the assault echelons of 20 marine expeditionary brigades mebs re quirement that reflects marine corps responsibilities under us war plans woul d require 33ship amphibious force that includes 11 lpd17s8 table 6 shows the marine corps calculation of the amount of amphibious lift relative to the 20 meb lift goal resulting from the 32 or 33ship

the 20 meb lift goal for that lift element figure of 15 would exceed by 50 the 20 meb lift goal for that element and figure of 075 would meet 75 of the 20 meb lift goal for that element as can be seen in the table the marine corps calculates that the projected 32 or 33ship amphibious force would roughly meet the lift goal for vtol aircraft spaces exceed the lift goal for troops space for cargo and

navy official was quoted after the fy2009 30year plan was released as stating that the navy had not yet officially approved the idea of extending the service lives of those ships11 one potential oversight issue for congress is why the 30year plan assumed 5year service life extension for the ddg51s if the navy had not yet officially approved the idea if the navy approves the idea second potential oversight issue for congress is whether the navy will actually be able to extend the service lives of the ddg51s and operate them in costeffective manner for 40 years given the wear and tear that might accrue on the ships in coming years as well as the ddg51 designs space weight and electricalpower capacities if fiveyear service life extension for the ddg51s proves infeasible or not costeffective shortfall in cruisers and destroyers similar to that shown in the fy2008 column in table 5 might reappear mpff ships the projected twoship shortfall in mpff ships is due to decision to

the issue is discussed further in another crs report13 affordability and xecutibility of shipbuilding plan overview one of the most significant features in the fy2009 30year shipbuilding plan compared to the fy2008 30 year plan is an apparent increase of roughly 44 in real inflationadjusted rms in the navys estimated average annual cost to implement the 30year plan this roughly 44 real increase is not due to significant changes in the composition of the 30year plan because the types and quantities of ships to be pr ocured under fy2009 30year pl an are generally the same as those in the fy2008 30year plan14 in 2007 the cong ressional budget office cbo estimated that last years version of the 30year plan would cost r oughly 35 more per year to implement than the navy was estimating the navy in 2007 downplayed cbos higher cost estimate referring to it in testimony as worstcase analysis15 or as an extremely conservative estimate16 the navys estimated cost for the fy2009 30year plan however is about 7 less than cbos estimates for the cost of the plan in 2006 and 2007 the navy had clearly id entifiable strategy for achieving the shipbuilding budget that the navy then timated would be needed to implement the 30year shipbuilding plan crs and cbo di scussed in reports and testimony in 2006 and 2007 how the navys strategy for ex ecuting the shipbuilding plan depended on series of five assumptions concerning th future size and composition of the navys budget and the costs of future navy ships as noted by both crs and cbo in 2006 and 2007 all five of these assu mptions could be viewed as risk items for the plan because there were grounds for questioning whether each of th em would be borne out for additional discussion see appendix d the new increase in the navys estimated cost for implementing the 30year plan is so large that the navy longer appears to have clearly identifiable announced strategy for generating the funds needed to implement the 30year plan at least not

procurement is the most effectiv way to balance the need for quantity versus capability across the spectrum of naval requirements considering likely budget constraints for shipbuilding procurem ent it is evident that the longrange plan is unaffordable the committee is also concerned with shortterm affordability the key to efficient shipbuilding is stability in programs and commonality between programs with stability the shipbuilder can reasonably invest in infrastructure improvements for increased efficiency commonality allows savings in order quantity across programs as well as lifecycle savings in maintenance and repair parts the goal of 313ship fleet will never be achieved until very difficult decisions are made concerning quantity capability affordability and stability the committee remains committed to building capable naval force in sufficient quantity to protect the nations interests this force must consist of major combatant vessels with multiple warfighting capabilities it must also include ships with specific roles and missions from operations in the littoral regions to the projection of power ashore from seabase the balance of capabilities within this

might not be reliable yardstick for assessing the appropriateness of the navy s proposed 313ship fleet particularly if the historical figures are more than few years old because the missions to be performed by the navy the mix of ships that make up the navy and the technologies that are available to na vy ships for performing missions all change over time the navy for example reached latec old war peak of 568 battle force ships at the end of fy198732 and as of june 5 2008 had d eclined to total of 280 battle force ships the fy1987 fleet however was intended to meet set of mission requirements that focused on countering sovi et naval forces at sea during potential multitheater natowarsaw pact conflict while the june 2008 fleet is intended to meet considerably different set of mission requirements cen tered on influencing events ashore by countering both land nd seabased military forces of potential regional threats other than russia includi ng nonstate terrorist organizations in addition the navy of fy1987 differed substa ntially from the june 2008 fleet in areas such as profusion of precisionguided ai rdelivered weapons numbers of tomahawk capable ships and sophistication of c4isr systems33 in coming years navy missions may shift again to include as possible example greater emphasis on being ab to counter impr oved chinese maritime military capabilities34 in addition the capabilities of navy ships will likely have changed further by that time due to developments such as more comprehensivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32665crs24 35 navy force

450ship plan but called for decreasing to 416 ships by end of continuedimplementation of networking technology and increased use of shipbased unmanned vehicles the 568ship fleet of fy1987 may or may not have been capable of performing its stated missions the 280ship fleet of june 2008 may or nor may not have been capable of performing its stated missions and fleet years from now with certain number of ships may or may not be capable of performing its stated missions given changes over time in mission requirements ship mixes and technologies however these three issues are to substan tial degree independent of one another for similar reasons trends over time in the total number of ships in the navy are not necessarily reliable indicator of the direction of change in the fleets ability to perform its stated missions an increasing number of ships in the fleet might not necessarily mean that the fleets ability to perform its stated missions is increasing because the fleets mission requirements might be increasing more rapidly than ship numbers and average ship capability similarly decreasing number of ships in the fleet might not necessarily mean that the fleets ability to perform stated missions is decreasing because the fleets mission requirements might be declining more rapidly than numbers of ships or because averag ship capability and the percentage of time that ships are in deployed locations might be increasing quickly enough to more than offset reductions in total ship numbers previous navy force structure pl ans such as those shown in table 1 might provide some insight into the potential ad equacy of proposed new forcestructure plan but changes over time in mission require ments technologies available to ships for performing missions and other forcepla nning factors suggest that some caution should be applied in using past force struct ure plans for this purpose particularly if those past force structure plans are more than few years old the reaganera plan for 600ship navy for example was signed for cold war set of missions focusing on countering soviet naval forces at sea which is not an appropriate basis for planning the navy today35httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32665crs25 35 continued fy1999 b original total of about 305 ships was incr eased to about 310 due to increase in number of attack submarines to 55 from 50 c plan

gilmore assistant director and eric j labs principal analyst on potential costs of the navys 2006 shipbuilding plan testimony before the subcommittee on projection forces committee on armed services us house of representatives march 30 2006appendix d affordability of navy 30year plan in 20062007 in 2006 and 2007 the navys position was that for its shipbuilding plan to be affordable and executable fi ve things needed to happen the navys overall budget needed to remain more or less flat not decline in real inflationadjusted terms navy operation and maintenan ce om spending needed to remain flat not grow in real terms navy military personnel milper sp ending needed to remain flat not grow in real terms navy research and development r d spending needed to decrease from recent levels and remain at the decreased level over the long run navy ships needed to be built at the navys currently estimated prices the navy said that the first four things were needed for the navy to be able to increase the shipbuilding budget from an average in fy2002fy2007 of about 96 billion per year in fy2008 dollars to l ongterm average of about 154 billion per year in fy2008 dollars an increase of about 60 in real terms36 the fifth thing on the list the navy said was needed if all the ships in the shipbuilding plan were to be affordable within an average annual shipbuilding budget of 154 billion in fy2008 dollarshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32665crs26 some observers in 2006 and 2007 questi oned whether all five of the above things would happen arguing the following the need in coming years to fund an increase in army and marine end strength could within an overall dod budget that remains more or less flat in real terms require funding to be transferred from the air force and navy budgets to th army and marine corps budgets which could for time at least lead to real decline in the air force and navy budgets dod in the past has not been fully ccessful in meeting its goals for controlling om costs the navy does not have full control over its milper costs they can be affected for example by decisions that congress makes on pay and benefits while the navy may be able to decrease rd spending in coming years as number of new syst ems shift from development to procurement it may be difficult fo r the navy to keep rd spending at that reduced level over the long run because the navy at some point will likely want to start development of other new systems several navy shipbuild ing programs have experienced significant cost growth in recent years and cbo estimates that navy ships will cost substantially more to build than the navy estimates if one or more of the five required things listed above did not happen it was argued in 2006 and 2007 it might become difficult or impossible to execute the navys shipbuilding plans the risk of the plan becoming unexecutable it was argued might become particularly acu starting in fy2011fy2013 when the navy planned to increase procurement rates for cr uisers and destroyers and for submarineshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32665crs27 37 some publications have stated that the na vy reached peak of 594 ships at the end of fy1987 this figure however is the total numbe r of active ships in the fleet which is not the same as the total number of battle force ships the battle force ships figure is the number used in government discussions of the si ze of the navy in recent years the total number of active ships has been larger than the total number of battle force ships for example the naval historical center st ates that as of november 16 2001 the navy included total of 337 active ships while the navy states that as of november 19 2001 the navy included total of 317 battle force ships comparing the total number of active ships in one year to the total number of battle force ships in another year is thus an appleto oranges comparison that in this case overst ates the decline since fy1987 in the number of ships in the navy as
