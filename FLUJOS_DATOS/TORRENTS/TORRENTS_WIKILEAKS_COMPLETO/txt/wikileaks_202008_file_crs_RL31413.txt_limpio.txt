july 5 2002 julie lynn stone analyst in social legislation domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress medicaid eligibility for the aged and disabled summary medicaid is meanstested federalstate matching program that provides medical assistance for persons who are unable to afford needed medical and health related services since the programs establishment in 1965 it has become the largest single source of financing both private and public for longterm care for those elderly and disabled who are lowincome or who have depleted their income and assets on medical and longterm care expenses in order to be eligible for medicaid individuals must meet certain eligibility criteria these criteria are determined by broad federal requirements and state decisions about whom they want to cover under their medicaid programs the financial eligibility standards that states do use are shaped in large part by estimates of spending that will occur with these standards the elderly and disabled are the most expensive groups that are covered under medicaid largely because medicaid covers nursing home and other institutional longterm care and because this care is expensive eligibility for the programs benefits has traditionally been linked to eligibility for cash welfare assistance that is person receiving welfare assistance under certain programs can also become eligible for medicaid for the elderly and disabled groups the cash welfare program linked to medicaid eligibility is the supplemental security income ssi program it provides federal cash welfare assistance to needy aged disabled and blind individuals who have little or income and resources medicaid law generally requires that states cover persons receiving ssi medicaid however also covers elderly and disabled persons who are not poor and who may have income in excess of ssi welfare standards it does so through options in medicaid law that allow states to cover persons who need help with medical expenses one of these options is medically needy program by which states may cover persons regardless of income who incur medical expenses that deplete their income to levels that make them needy medicaid also allows states to use higher income standard up to 300 of basic ssi payment for those who reside in nursing homes or other medical care institutions or who are eligible for certain longterm care services offered in the community it is through these two options that medicaid ends up covering longterm care expenses for many nonpoor elderly persons to make sure that persons with income and assets exceeding the welfare standards apply their resources toward the cost of their care medicaid eligibility rules include additional provisions that impose penalties on individuals who give their assets away in order to gain medicaid eligibility sooner than they otherwise would and require states to recover assets from beneficiarys estates up to amounts paid for longterm care services after their death medicaid eligibility rules also result in diverse disabled population receiving coverage many disabled persons become eligible because they cannot work and are dependent on welfare assistance from ssi however medicaid provides incentives for other disabled persons to work and retain medicaid coverage the disabled population also includes children who need broad range of home and community based care as well as some who need nursing home care contents introduction 1 elderly and disabled medicaid beneficiaries 3 longterm care and other services for the

for the aged and disabled introduction medicaid is federalstate matching entitlement program that provides medical assistance for certain groups of lowincome individuals the program was established in 1965 under title xix of the social security act and has become the largest single source of financing both private and public for longterm care1 for the elderly and disabled who are lowincome or who have depleted their income and assets on medical and longterm care expenses2 of the 403 million individuals who were enrolled in medicaid in fiscal year 1998 fy98 approximately 4 million 101 qualified on the basis of being elderly and 69 million 172 qualified on the basis of disability3 although the elderly and individuals with disabilities comprise only 273 of medicaid enrollees they command disproportionate share of program spending in 1998 they accounted for 71 of the total medicaid spending this can be largely attributed to medicaids coverage of longterm care benefits that provide widearray of institutional and communitybased services not generally covered or in some instances only partly covered by other public programs such as medicare or private insurance plans of the approximately 101 billion spent by medicaid on elderly and disabled individuals in 1998 more than 60 618 billion was for long term care of those dollars 71 442 billion was for institutional care including nursing facilities intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded and mental health facilities and the remaining spending 29 176 billion was paid for home and communitybased services including range of services such as home health personal care adult day care care coordination home modifications transportation and respite for caregivers4 1 longterm care offers wide range of personal social and medical support services through institutions and communitybased programs 2 medicaid also plays significant role in the provision of preventive primary and acute care for millions of lowincome children families and pregnant women 3 data prepared by congressional research service crs based on analysis from health care financing administration form 2082 crs report rl30733

beneficiaries fiscal year 1998 medicaid statistics program and financial statistics fiscal year 1998 health care financing administration pub 10129 aug 2000 based continued crs2 medicaid is meanstested program intended to provide assistance to persons who are unable to afford needed medical and healthrelated services within broad federal guidelines states have flexibility to determine eligibility criteria in general the federal government mandates states to meet minimum eligibility standards but states also have great deal of flexibility in using standards that are more generous or more restrictive the financial eligibility standards that states do use are shaped in large part by estimates of spending that will occur with these standards the elderly and disabled are the most expensive groups that are covered under medicaid in 1998 spending averaged 9058 per disabled medicaid beneficiary and 10193 per elderly medicaid beneficiary as compared to 1442 for children under age 21 and 2292 for nondisabled adults5 eligibility for the programs benefits has traditionally been linked to eligibility for cash welfare program assistance that is person receiving welfare assistance under certain programs can also become automatically eligible for medicaid for the elderly and disabled groups the cash welfare program linked to medicaid eligibility is the supplemental security income ssi it provides federal cash welfare assistance to needy aged disabled and blind individuals who have little or income and resources medicaid law generally requires that states cover persons receiving ssi in addition to the ssi eligibility pathway into medicaid the statute includes other provisions that allow states to extend medicaid eligibility to other elderly and disabled individuals these individuals must also meet financial standards to become eligible financial standards are defined as the maximum amount of income and resources such as cars savings accounts bonds stocks and real estate an individual is allowed to have and still qualify for medicaid not only do states have flexibility within broad federal guidelines to use specific financial standards for different eligibility groups but they also have flexibility in the rules they use to define income and resources for example when counting an individuals income to determine whether an individual is medicaid eligible some states may count all pensions social security payments and annuities but disregard 20 dollars for miscellaneous costs and 200 dollars for housing expenses other states may not have such income disregards state flexibility has led to variation in income and resources requirements as well as the means by which income and resources are counted across states in general individuals in similar circumstances of need for medical or longterm care may be automatically eligible for coverage in one state but may be required to assume certain portion of their medical expenses before they can obtain coverage in second state and not eligible at all in third state statewide variation concerning income and asset requirements makes generalizations about eligibility as it applies to particular individual or the nation difficult 4 continued on data from the health care financing administration hcfa form 64 reports 5 data prepared by crs based on analysis from health care financing administration forms 64 and 2082 crs report rl30733 crs3 brief profile of elderly and disabled beneficiaries as well as the variety of eligibility pathways outlined by federal law and implemented with significant variation by states will be described in this report elderly and disabled medicaid beneficiaries in 1998 there were approximately 109 million elderly and disabled medicaid beneficiaries across all states comprising 273 of all medicaid beneficiaries four million of this number were elderly and 69 million were disabled this section presents some of their characteristics as well the acute and longterm care services they receive through medicaid the elderly are defined as persons 65 years of age and older demographic projections show record rates of growth in the elderly population in the year 2000 the nations elderly population totaled approximately 34 million persons6 this number is expected to more than double over the next half century7 this growth will impose significant pressure on federal and state budgets that fund medicaid the congressional budget office cbo estimates that the federal share of medicaid spending will grow from 12 of gross domestic product gdp in 1999 to 37 in 2040 in part because of the aging of the population8 the population of disabled medicaid enrollees is diverse with individuals experiencing variety of physical impairments including conditions related to vision hearing communication or mobility severe mental and emotional conditions and functional limitations such as bathing dressing eating getting in or out of bed or chair preparing meals shopping or doing housework9 medicaid covers both disabled adults and children the blind are grouped within the category of individuals with disabilities under the medicaid statute people with disabilities are more likely to be poor than individuals without disabilities as result disabled individuals are more likely to rely on medicaid for 6 enid kassner and robert w

the community and rely on medicaid to pay for their preventive and acute care needs there are however significant number who rely on longterm care services paid for by medicaid about 467451 aged and disabled individuals received longterm care services in the community under home and communitybased waiver services described later and approximately 18 million individuals received longterm care services while living in institutional settings such as nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded11 all states determine eligibility for longterm care services based on test of an applicants functional limitations the design of these tests varies across states but often includes tests to determine an applicants limitations in his or her ability to carry out

to elderly disabled and blind individuals across states welfarerelated pathways coverage of persons receiving supplemental security insurance ssi traditionally medicaid eligibility for aged and disabled individuals has been linked to the federal welfare program supplemental security income ssi under title xvi of the social security act the ssi program is administered at the federal level and cash benefits are reserved exclusively for the aged disabled and blind ssi is meanstested income assistance program for aged blind and disabled individuals who have low incomes and limited resources in fy 2001 about 67 million individuals received ssi benefits generally states are required to provide medicaid coverage to recipients of ssi and rely on ssi eligibility rules established at the national level as the basis for medicaid eligibility in order to qualify for ssi person must satisfy the program criteria for age or disability and meet ssis income and resources requirements in addition applicants must meet certain citizen and residency requirements categories of individuals who qualify for ssi elderly the elderly or aged are defined as persons 65 years and older the aged comprised approximately 30 of the ssi recipient population in fy 2001 and totaled approximately 2 million individuals because the incidence of disability increases with age many elderly individuals are also disabled but in these cases are classified generally as elderly for medicaid program data collection purposes adults with disabilities individuals with disabilities are defined under medicaid and ssi as those unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity sga by reason of medically determined physical or mental impairment expected to last for continuous period of at least 12 months the test of substantial gainful activity is to earn 780 monthly in counted income as of 2002 with impairment related expenses subtracted from earnings for disabled individuals who are blind defined as having 20200 vision or less with the use of correcting lens in the persons better eye or those with tunnel vision of 20 degrees or less different sga level applies sga for the blind is earnings of 1300 month in 2002 and is adjusted annually to reflect growth in average wages12 generally the individual 12 the passage of this provision under pl 95216 in 1977 gave rise to controversy concerning the blinds preferential treatment under the law proponents of liberalizing the sga amount for the blind maintain that adverse employment experiences for the blind including high jobrelated costs and unemployment are greater than for persons who have other disabilities opponents on the other hand argue that there are many other impairments that could easily be viewed as needing special compensatory relief such as continued crs6 must be unable to do any kind of work that exists in the national economy taking into account age education and work experience individuals with disabilities aged 18 to 64 comprised the majority of ssi recipients totaling about 57 or approximately 38 million individuals in fy 2001 children with disabilities children may qualify for ssi if they are under age 18 or under age 22 if fulltime student unmarried and meet the applicable ssi disability or blindness income and resources requirements pl 104193 the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 prwora established new disability definition for children under age 18 which requires child to have medically determinable physical or mental impairment which results in marked and severe functional limitations and which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for continuous period of not less than 12 months parents income is considered when determining the eligibility of children ssi requires that some of the income of ineligible family members ie parents be deemed available to meet the basic needs of children before extending eligibility to those children individuals with disabilities under age 18 comprised about 13 approximately 865700 individuals of the ssi recipient population in fy 200113 financial and resources eligibility criteria income an individuals income is used to determine eligibility for ssi and to calculate the benefit payment two types of income are considered earned and unearned earned income includes wages net earnings from selfemployment and earnings from services performed all other income including social security benefits other government and private pensions veterans benefits workers compensation and inkind support and maintenance not derived from current work is considered unearned in an individual has income dollarfordollar reduction is made against the maximum federal ssi benefit which is 580 in 2002 in 2000 the benefit level was 512 the federal ssi benefit for couple with both members qualifying for ssi is 817 in 2002 in 2000 the benefit level was 769 resources in addition to income criteria ssi limits the countable resources persons may have in order to qualify for benefits countable resources generally refer to liquid assets such as money in bank accounts stocks and bonds mutual fund investments and certificates of deposit eligibility for ssi is restricted to otherwise qualifying individuals whose resources do not exceed 2000 for an individual and 3000

benefits disabled recipients who lose federal ssi eligibility because of earnings above the substantial gainful activity level may continue to retain eligibility for ssi and medicaid under section 1619 pl 96265 of the social security act for more information about these rules see the discussion rules applying to disabled individual engaged in work on page 32 below coverage of persons in 209b states while 39 states and the district of columbia extend automatic medicaid eligibility to persons receiving ssi 11 states do not these states are socalled 209b states when ssi was enacted in 1972 certain states expected that the number of elderly and disabled cash assistance recipients would grow significantly to protect states from potentially large increases in their medicaid expenditures for the aged and disabled populations section 209b of the social security amendments of 1972 pl 92603 gave states the option to continue using the financial standards and definitions for disability they had in effect in january 1972 to determine medicaid eligibility for the aged blind and disabled residents rather than making all ssi recipients automatically eligible for medicaid under the 209b provision states may elect the option to use income and resources standards that are more restrictive than those in effect on january 1 1972 these states may require persons to meet lower income standard than ssis or may use more restrictive policies for defining countable income they may also have lower limits for the amounts of resources person may have each of the 209b states has at least one eligibility standard income resources or definition of crs8 disability that is more restrictive than ssi standards the 11 section 209b states are connecticut illinois hawaii indiana minnesota missouri new hampshire north dakota ohio oklahoma and virginia of these three have income standards below the 2000 ssi level of 512 per month and five states use resource threshold lower than ssis standard of 2000 in other cases states standards may be the same as ssis or even more liberal it is important to note again however that states count income differently this means that persons with income levels higher than the states standards as listed in table 1 might still be able to qualify for medicaid in addition to the income standards table 1 shows resources standards used by the 209b states states that use more restrictive eligibility rules under section 209b must also allow applicants to deduct medical expenses from the individuals countable income when determining eligibility this process is sometimes referred to as the 209b spenddown an example of 209b spenddown is as follows if an applicant has monthly income of 700 not including any ssi or ssp payments described below and the states maximum allowable income standard for spenddown eligibility is 600 the applicant would qualify for medicaid after incurring 100 in medical expenses in that month as will be discussed later the spenddown process is also used in establishing eligibility for the medically needy table 1 medicaid income and resources limits for individuals living in states using the section 209b option

the ssi benefit standard may provide too little income to meet an individuals living expenses supplement ssi with additional cash assistance payments made solely with state funds states use variety of different policies for providing these state supplemental payments ssp and are granted flexibility in determining whether they will make such payments to whom and in what amount14 these supplements paid on regular monthly basis are intended to cover such items as food shelter clothing utilities and other daily necessities determined by the individual states supplementary payments allow state to provide an income floor that takes into account geographic differences in living costs and individualized special needs in manner that the nationally uniform federal benefit standard used in ssi cannot do some states provide supplemental payments to all persons who receive ssi other states may decide to make payments to elderly persons living independently in the community without special needs while still others may require that the elderly have special needs such as requiring inhome personal care assistance or home delivered meals as the result of impairment or frailty in all of these cases states may extend medicaid coverage to persons receiving ssp on the same basis as they do to persons receiving only ssi they may also decide to extend medicaid eligibility to only some groups of ssp recipients or decide to extend it to all states are not required to index ssp payments to inflation as of january 2000 27 states provide some form of optional state supplementation to individuals living independently and one state north dakota allows its municipalities to determine whether and to whom payments are provided combined ssissp benefit when states that provide automatic medicaid eligibility to persons receiving ssi provide medicaid coverage to persons receiving ssp the combined federal ssi and state ssp benefit payments becomes the effective income eligibility standard for medicaid for 209b states however the effective 14 federal law prohibits those states that provide ssp from changing their payment levels for ssp as federal ssi payments are increased to reflect cost of living this rule was made for the purpose of prohibiting states from lowering their ssp payments when federal ssi payments increase as result of adjustments based on cost of living

caretaker services medically needy coverage in addition to welfarerelated pathways medicaid also provides states the option of covering elderly and disabled persons who are not poor by ssi or ssp standards but who need assistance with medical care expenses under the medically needy pathway individuals who live in state that exercises the medically needy option can qualify for medicaid if they have income and resources that exceed the standards established by the states for the medically needy programs but only if they incur medical expenses that spenddown or deplete their income and resources to specified levels crs15 spenddown refers to process by which persons with income above the applicable limit may reduce their income to the state limit by spending on medical care16 this process is similar to the spenddown process used in 209b states for example if an individual has monthly income of 600 and the states medically needy income standard is 300 the applicant would be required to incur 300 in medical expenses ie spenddown before he or she would be eligible for medicaid once medicaid eligibility is triggered beneficiaries must still apply their income toward the cost of their medical care the state may set its medically needy monthly income limits mnil for family of given size at any level up to 133 of the maximum payment for similar family under the states afdc program in place on july 16 199617 often these levels are lower than the income standard for ssi benefits in 11 states the spend down limits are less than 50 of the federal poverty level fpl for an individual the spenddown limits range from 92 in louisiana18 to 708 in vermont this in effect is an income threshold for medicaid eligibility it also represents for persons living in the community the amount of monthly income individuals may retain for their needs after incurring medical expenses that deplete their income to the state standard although there is some variation across states most states use the ssi resources limit of 2000 for an individual as the medically needy resources standard state monthly income and resources limits for medically needy programs are shown in table 4 note that some 209b states have medically needy programs states that choose to have medically needy eligibility pathway are required under federal law to cover at minimum certain children under age 18 and pregnant women who except for income and resources would be eligible as categorically needy they are not however required to cover the aged blind and disabled nor to cover longterm care services under their medically needy programs but most do as of november 2000 34 states and the district of columbia had medically needy programs 16 medical expenses that are considered when calculating an applicants spenddown include certain medical and remedial care expenses incurred by an individual family or financially responsible relative that are not subject to payment by third party unless the third party is public program of state or territory or political subdivision of state or territory some insurance premiums deductibles or coinsurance charges including medicare premiums and cost sharing charges for persons eligible for both programs can also be deducted from countable income 17 in effect as of may 11 2001 hcfa regulation 42 cfr part 435 will increase state flexibility in establishing the income disregards used to determine eligibility under medicaids medically needy pathway the new regulation will allow states to apply more liberal income disregards under section 1902r2 of the social security act thus increasing the amount of protected income medically needy eligibles can retain to pay for such things as food clothing or housing whereas the income standard for family of given size could still not exceed 133 of the maximum payment for similar family under the states maximum afdc payment described above states could in effect enable applicants to keep more income to spend on housing food transportation etc 18 the mnil standard varies by geographic region in louisiana crs16 the medically needy pathway enables many elderly and disabled persons needing nursing home care to qualify for medicaid at an average cost of about 56000 per year nursing home costs can quickly deplete the resources of an elderly individual especially after prolonged stays states however are not required to include nursing facility care among the services covered under their medically needy programs as result not all states with medically needy programs covering the elderly provide coverage to persons in nursing homes five among the total 34 states and the district of columbia that reported having medically needy spenddown programs did not cover nursing facility services states not covering nursing facility care are arkansas florida iowa oklahoma and oregon other aspects of spenddown states use specific time period for calculating persons medical expenses ranging from 1 month to 6 months as of november 200019 the calculation becomes the basis for determining the amount of persons spenddown requirement generally shorter time period is more beneficial to the applicant for example if the state has 1 month spenddown calculation period the individual would be required to incur 300 in medical expenses in month after which services would be covered by medicaid on the other hand if the state had 6 month calculation period the individual would have to incur projected amount of 1800 300 times 6 in medical expenses before medicaid would begin coverage the length of the spenddown period does not significantly affect total outofpocket expenditures for persons with predictable and recurring medical expenses such as persons with chronic illnesses or disabling conditions however individuals faced with acute nonrecurring problems generally benefit more from shorter calculation period states that do cover nursing facility care under their medically needy programs have the option of using either the medicaid or private pay eg private insurance or outofpocket nursing facility rates as standard for determining an applicants eligibility this means that states compare persons monthly income to the cost of nursing home care in that state either in terms of the total amount that would be paid by medicaid for month medicaid rate or the total amount that would be paid out ofpocket private pay rate often the medicaid monthly rates are lower than the rates paid by private insurance or outofpocket when the medicaid rate is lower it is harder for applicants to spenddown to the required level and thus may result in fewer applicants gaining medicaid eligibility in general if an applicants income minus the cost of the medicaid reimbursement or private pay rate whichever is used by the state exceeds the state income limit then the applicant cannot qualify for medicaid coverage of institutional care under medically needy option states policies on using either medicaid or private pay rate are shown in table 4 as the spenddown basis for institutional care 19 congressional research survey of selected medicaid eligibility and

needy programs for making persons eligible for institutional care21 states that use both pathways are able to make those persons with incomes below the 300 rule automatically eligible for coverage so as to avoid the spenddown computation necessary under medically needy programs when medical expenses and income must be estimated for 1 to 6 month time period22 in november 2000 18 states used only

oregon south carolina south dakota texas and wyoming however with change in law in 1993 these states are now required to use what can be considered delayed spenddown process states must allow individuals to place income in excess of the special income level used by states in trusts and still be eligible for medicaid these trusts are often referred to as miller trusts miller trusts prior to an amendment included in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra 93 persons living in states using only the 300 rule could not qualify for medicaids coverage of their nursing home care if they had income in excess of the limit this meant that persons with as little as 1 more than the limit could not qualify for medicaid coverage of their nursing home care matter how insufficient their income and assets might be to cover the cost of their care as result of the obra 93 amendment medicaid law now requires those states that use only the special income rule to allow applicants to place income in excess of the special income level in special trust or miller trust and receive medicaid coverage for 21 two states missouri and ohio have 209b spenddown programs and also use the 300 rule

personal attendant services states may also limit services to individuals who have certain conditions such as aids or illnesses such as the chronically mentally ill although states may amend the waivers to serve additional recipients states may also set overall limits on the total number of persons to be served under waiver this ability to define and limit eligibility allows states to control

designing measures to adequately and uniformly assess applicants physical cognitive and mental conditions difficult the measures used by states to determine an applicants eligibility for longterm care services vary survey of 42 states conducted by the american association of retired persons aarp in 1996 found the following three types of measures to be those most commonly used 1 states that score specific factors and require minimum score for eligibility 2 states that require minimum number of specific impairments or needs for eligibility and 3 states that use level of care definitions and guidelines to determine eligibility this study found that those states requiring minimum score and those states that counted number of impairments considered medical and nursing needs mental and physical impairments activities of daily living adls and instrumental activities of daily living iadls when determining an applicants eligibility24 the survey also found that those states using criteria based on definitions and guidelines to determine eligibility provided the assessor with greater amount of discretion than those applying the other two assessments in general rather than requiring an assessor to determine whether an applicant has three out of five adl impairments an assessor in state using the third approach may be required to determine whether an applicant meets one of number of general criteria including need for nursing services25 24 adls refer to activities necessary to carry out basic human functions and include the following bathing dressing eating getting around inside the home toileting and transferring from bed to chair iadls refer to tasks necessary for independent community living and include the following shopping light housework telephoning money management and meal preparation 25 for example arkansas 1996 guidelines acknowledged the potential for the functional eligibility test to be applied inconsistently it states that they cannot be used

coinsurance for medicare covered benefits specified lowincome medicare beneficiary slmb slmb benefits are available to medicare recipients whose income is greater than 120 of fpl the asset test is the same as that for qmb under this medicaid pathway benefits include only the monthly medicare part b premium medicare part b provides coverage for physicians services laboratory services durable medical equipment hospital outpatient department services and other medical services medicaid coverage for qmbs and slmbs is limited to medicare costsharing charges other medicaid covered services such as nursing facility care prescription drugs and primary and acute care services are not covered for these individuals unless they qualify through other eligibility pathways into medicaid eg via ssi medically needy or special income rule qualifying individuals qi1 and qi2 if medicare recipients income is between 120 and 135 of poverty the qi1 option may pay the monthly medicare part b premium for these individuals if medicare recipients income exceeds the qi1 criteria but does not exceed 175 of poverty he or she may qualify for cost sharing assistance through the qi2 option under qi2 state medicaid programs pay that portion of the monthly part b premium attributable to the gradual transfer of some home health visits from medicare part to medicare part b26 26 in general medicaid payments are shared between the federal government and the states according to matching formula however expenditures under the qi1 and qi2 programs are paid for 100 by the federal government from the part b

period january 1 1998 to december 31 2002 crs30 qualified disabled and working individuals qdwis medicaid is authorized to provide partial protection against medicare part premiums for qualified disabled and working individuals qdwis are persons who were previously entitled to medicare on the basis of disability who lost their entitlement based on earnings from work but who continue to have disabling condition medicaid is required to pay the medicare part premium for such persons if their incomes are below 200 of the federal poverty line their resources are below 200 of the ssi limit 4000 and they are not otherwise eligible for medicaid states are permitted to require individuals whose income is between 150 and 200 of poverty to pay portion of the premium based on sliding scale qdwis are further discussed below other pathways under the pickle amendment pl 94566 section 503 state must cover former ssi recipients who 1 are receiving social security benefits oasdi 2 formerly qualified for medicaid because of simultaneous eligibility for ssi or ssp and 3 would be eligible for ssi or ssp but for the costofliving adjustment cola in social security benefits after april 197727 in addition colas paid to the individuals spouse or parent cannot be deemed available to the individual in 209b states medicaid must be provided to these persons when their income after disregard of the cola and spenddown of incurred medical expenses falls below the state standard special rules for children with disabilities children with disabilities can become eligible for medicaid through each of the welfarerelated and medically needy pathways described above in addition there are other eligibility rules that apply only to children with disabilities these are described below for child under the age of 20 and living at home the income and resources of the childs parents are automatically considered available for medical care expenses that is they are deemed to the child if the same child is institutionalized however after the first month away from home the child is longer considered to be member of the parents household and only the childs own financial resources are considered available for care this policy had resulted in some children remaining in institutions even while their medical needs could be met at home this situation was dramatized in 1982 by the case of katie beckett child who was dependent on ventilator and was unable to go home not because of medical reasons but because she would longer have been eligible for medicaid and her family was unable to afford alternative health coverage 27 pertains to all costofliving increases made after april 1977 crs31 to address this issue congress amended medicaid to include provision sometimes referred to as the katie beckett provision that allows states to extend medicaid coverage to certain disabled children under 18 who are living at home and who would be eligible for medicaid if in hospital nursing facility or intermediate care facility for individuals with mental retardation the state must determine that 1 the child requires the level of care provided in an institution 2 it is appropriate to provide care outside the facility and 3 the cost of care at home is more than institutional care states electing this option are required to cover on statewide basis all disabled children who meet these criteria as of may 2000 20 states covered this group of disabled children under medicaid these states are alaska arkansas delaware georgia idaho maine massachusetts michigan minnesota mississippi nebraska nevada new hampshire rhode island south carolina south dakota virginia vermont west virginia and wisconsin children with special needs might also qualify for home and communitybased longterm care services if the state in which they live has chosen to implement 1915c waiver program for children with disabilities to qualify children would need to otherwise require institutional care such programs have capped enrollment and are often limited to defined geographical location county see above for more information on 1915c programs disabled children who are not able to become eligible for medicaid under these special rules could of course become eligible through the programs traditional pathways that are not specific to individuals with disabilities disabled children can become eligible for medicaid through povertyrelated pathways afdcrelated pathways as well as through medically needy programs28 rules applying to disabled individuals engaged in work because many disabled workers may not have access to affordable or adequate health insurance through their jobs the risk of losing medicaid coverage due to employment earnings can be disincentive to work29 prior to 1980 disabled ssi recipient who worked faced substantial risk of losing both ssi cash benefits and medicaid in response to this and other work disincentives congress created variety of special rules for the purpose of protecting working individuals with disabilities from losing their ssi and medicaid benefits 28 furthermore children have access to medicaid through the state childrens health insurance program schip for more information on eligibility groups see crs report rl30632 reaching uninsured children are medicaid and schip doing the job by trish riley and elicia herz 29 medicaid offers individuals coverage of certain benefits such as mental health care medications and personal attendant services that are not often available through private health insurance crs32 in order to qualify for ssi and thus become eligible for medicaid applicants must establish disability status under the criteria determined by the secretary of the department of health and human services dhhs these criteria are linked to an individuals ability to work or earn income from work commonly referred to as an individuals ability to engage in substantial gainful activity sga current regulations provide that an individual is able to engage in sga if his or her earnings exceed 780 month for nonblind disabled and 1300 for blind in 2002 with impairmentrelated expenses subtracted from earnings30 if persons applying for ssi have demonstrated the ability to engage in sga they will not be able to establish disability status see section entitled welfarerelated pathways of this report for more information for those who are already covered by ssi however different set of rules applies section 1619a of ssi law for example provides for the continuation of special ssi cash benefits for those persons receiving ssi on the basis of disability even if they are working at the sga level as long as there is not medical improvement in the disabling condition the amount of their special cash benefits is gradually reduced as their earnings increase under an income disregard formula until their countable earnings reach the ssi benefit standard or what is known as the breakeven point in state with state supplemental payment this earned income eligibility limit is 1175 per month in 2002 for person who has unearned income eg veterans pension oasdi payments etc for states that supplement the federal ssi benefit standard the breakeven point increases 2 for every 1 of state supplementation above the federal benefit standard blind and disabled individuals can continue to be eligible for medicaid even if their earnings take them past the ssi income disregard breakeven point special eligibility status granted by section 1619b1 under which the individual is considered an ssi recipient for purposes of medicaid eligibility although he or she is not actually receiving ssi applies as long as the individual 1 continues to be blind or have disabling impairment 2 continues to meet all the other requirements except for earnings for ssi eligibility 3 would be seriously inhibited from continuing to work by the termination of eligibility for medicaid services and 4 has earnings that are not sufficient to provide reasonable equivalent to the benefits that would have been available if he or she did not have those earnings from ssi state supplementary payments medicaid and publicly funded personal care31 to further reduce work disincentives and improve opportunities for individuals with disabilities who rely on medicaid for their health care needs to participate in the labor force congress enacted legislation in 1997 and 1999 this legislation expanded state flexibility in creating medicaid buy in opportunities for individuals with disabilities the first piece of legislation was added by the balanced budget act of 1997 bba97 bba97 allows states to elect to provide medicaid coverage to 30 generally to qualify for ssi the individual must be unable to do any kind of work that exists in the national economy taking into account age education and work experience 31 similar provision to 1619b exists under medicaid law in section 1905q the provision refers to this group of individuals as qualified severely impaired blind or disabled individuals under age 65 crs33 disabled working individuals whose family income does not exceed 250 of the fpl the second piece of legislation was added by ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 pl 106170 twwiia twwiia allows states to further expand medicaid coverage to the working disabled between the ages of 16 and 64 with incomes above 250 of the fpl in addition assets may not exceed standard ssi limits under both of these provisions disabled persons who are working may have to purchase or buy into medicaid coverage through the payment of premiums andor copayments these options were designed to expand the number of disabled individuals who could continue working while maintaining their medicaid coverage as of april 1 2002 27 states had enacted legislation for medicaid buyin program of these 19 states had implemented buyin program 16 states have over 1 year of implementation experience the remaining eight states were in the policy refinement and preimplementation phase several other states have introduced medicaid buyin bills to their respective state legislatures32 rules applying to individuals who are homeless elderly and disabled individuals who are homeless may also be eligible for medicaid in order to qualify an individual must still meet the programs financial and categorical eligibility criteria however state may not exclude from coverage any eligible person who resides in the state regardless of whether the residence is maintained at fixed address states are required to provide method of making eligibility cards available to eligible individuals who do not reside in permanent dwelling or do not have permanent home or mailing address rules applying to the transfer of assets some years prior to the passage of omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra 93 congress began to be concerned with practice commonly referred to as medicaid estate planning medicaid estate planning is means by which elderly people shelter their income and assets in order to qualify for medicaids coverage of longterm care services sooner than they would if they had spent their income on the cost of care such practices included 1 converting countable assets into exempt assets 2 sheltering assets in trusts annuities and other financial instruments that are deemed not available to the medicaid applicant to pay for nursing home care or 3 transferring assets through joint bank accounts the goal of this practice was to protect resources for the individual andor heirs while appearing to be poor enough to qualify for medicaid to try to ensure that medicaid applicants apply their assets to the cost of their care and do not give them away in order to gain medicaid eligibility sooner than they 32 see crs report rl31157 ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 implementation status by jennifer hess crs34 otherwise would obra 93 established penalties under medicaid for the transfer of assets for less than fair market value specifically medicaid has required that states delay medicaid eligibility for institutionalized individuals and for certain services including home and communitybased services provided under waivers provided to noninstitutionalized persons who dispose of assets for less than fair market value on or after lookback date this date is 36 months prior to application for medicaid or 60 months if the transfer is made through an irrevocable trust in other words transfers are prohibited during the 3year or 5year period prior to application for medicaid the law also prohibits spouses of these persons from transferring assets during this same period if the state has determined that transfer occurred then applicants may be subject to delay in eligibility certain transfers are permitted to spouses to minor or disabled children or to trusts solely for the benefit of disabled persons under 65 the length of the period of ineligibility for institutionalized and non institutionalized individuals is determined by dividing the total cumulative uncompensated value of all assets transferred on or after the lookback date by the average monthly cost to private patient of nursing facility in the state or at the option of the state in the community in which the individual is institutionalized at the time of application for example transferred asset worth 60000 divided by 5000 average monthly privatepay rate results in 12month penalty period there is limit to the length of the penalty period this period of ineligibility begins with the first month during which the assets were transferred medicaid estate recovery congress also included other provisions in obra 93 to address concerns with estate planning since obra 93 medicaid statute has mandated all 50 states and the district of columbia to recover from the individuals estate amounts paid for nursing facility services home and communitybased services and related hospital and prescription drug services in addition states are given the option of recovering funds spent on additional items or services covered under the states medicaid plan adjustment or recovery may only be made after the death of the individual and his or her surviving spouse if any and only at time when there is surviving child under age 21 or child who is blind or permanently and totally disabled33 for purposes of these recovery provisions estates are defined to include all real and personal property and other assets included within an individuals estate as defined under state laws governing the treatment of inheritance at the option of the state recoverable assets also include any other real and personal property and other assets in which the individual had any legal title or interest at the time of death including such assets conveyed to survivor heir or assign of the deceased individual through joint tenancy tenancy in common survivorship life estate living trust or other arrangement these provisions apply for persons who received such 33 in addition states can not recover against beneficiarys home on which the state has placed lien unless additional protections for siblings and adult children are satisfied crs35 medical assistance at 55 years of age or older34 medicaid law and regulations also require states to establish procedures for waiving the application of these rules in cases of undue hardship special provisions apply to persons who become eligible for medicaid under more liberal asset standard used in certain states for those who purchase longterm care insurance the statute prohibits states from recovering from the estates of individuals who received medical assistance under state plan amendment approved by may 14 1993 which provided for disregarding any assets or resources related to payments made under longterm care insurance policy or because an individual has received or is entitled to receive benefits under longterm care insurance policy states with such amendments are california connecticut indiana iowa few individuals have participated in the iowa program as of april 2002 and new york35 finally among the medicaid estate recovery provisions in obra 1993 is provision requiring the state agency to establish procedures for waiving the application of adjustment or recovery if it would cause an undue hardship as determined on the basis of criteria established by the secretary rules applying to institutionalized persons with spouses living at home medicaid law includes provisions to prevent spousal impoverishment situation that leaves the spouse who lives at home in the community with little or income or resources when the other spouse requires institutional or home and communitybased longterm care36 these provisions were added to medicaid law by the medicare catastrophic coverage act mcca of 1988 before mmca states could consider all of the assets of the community spouse as well as the institutionalized spouse available to pay for the cost of medical care for an institutionalized spouse under medicaid these rules created hardships for the spouse living in the community who was forced to spenddown virtually all of the couples assets to medicaid eligibility levels so that the institutionalized spouse could qualify for medicaid mcca established new rules for the treatment of income and 34 there is document that records or explains why the age floor was changed from 65 years old in preobra 93 statute to 55 years old by obra 93 35 other states that did not file state plan amendment prior to may 14 1993 such as illinois and washington also allow persons who purchased longterm care insurance policies to protect certain amount of assets the obra 93 provision allowed california connecticut indiana iowa and new york to waive recovery of persons resources related to payments under private longterm care insurance policy although illinois and washington are required to recover any assets or resources initially disregarded because of the payments made by qualified longterm care insurance policy they allow individuals to transfer these assets up until the time of their death even while they are receiving medicaid covered services 36 report of the special committee on aging united states developments in aging 1997 and 1998 volume 1 pursuant to sres 54 sec 19c february 13 1997 106th congress 2nd session senate report 106229 february 7 2000 crs36 resources of married couples to determine how much income or resources community spouse must contribute toward the cost of care for the spouse requiring the care and how much of the institutionalized spouses income and resources is actually protected for use by the community spouse for example today the income of many elderly couples comes largely from the social security and pension benefits that the husband receives because of his work history in the labor force the wife who may have had limited or attachment to the work force may receive only small social security benefit in her own name if the husband requires nursing home care and seeks medicaid coverage for his care under states medically needy program for instance most states prior to spousal impoverishment protections considered the husbands income his for purposes of determining eligibility they also considered resources held in the husbands name as well as jointly held resources to be fully available to him and would require that these resources be spent down to the states resource standard before considering him medicaid eligible in most states this could mean that the community spouse would have been left with only 2000 in assets held for example in savings account following eligibility medicaids posteligibility rules considered the husbands income to be available for the cost of his care and allowed deduction to be made for his wifes living expenses only to the extent that her own income did not exceed the standard specified by the state in most states this standard was the basic ssi benefit level or less this meant that wife with little or income of her own would have available for her living expenses an amount less than the federal poverty level protected resources spousal impoverishment resource eligibility rules provide for method of counting couples resources in initial eligibility determinations under the rules states must assess couples combined countable resources when requested by either spouse at the beginning of continuous period of institutionalization defined as at least 30 consecutive days of care the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms guidance on implementing spousal impoverishment law requires that nursing homes advise people entering nursing homes and their families that resource assessments are available upon request the couples home household goods and personal effects are excluded from countable resources in addition 209b states may not use more restrictive policies for defining these resources under spousal impoverishment law mcca allows states to protect resources equivalent to the amount of community spouse resources allowance csra37 federal restrictions limit the maximum amount states can allow community spouses to retain this is the greater of an amount equal to onehalf of the couples resources at the time the institutionalized spouse entered the nursing home up to maximum of 84120 as 37 these resource eligibility determinations are performed at the request of either spouse and can be associated with fee when not conducted in conjunction with an application for medicaid eligibility hcfa guidance on implementing spousal impoverishment law requires that nursing homes advise people entering nursing homes and their families that resources assessments are available upon request crs37 of 2000 89280 in 2002 or the state standard federal law stipulates that state standards may be lower than 16824 in 2000 17856 in 2002 maximum and minimum csra amounts are adjusted annually at the federal level by the same percentage as the consumer price index cpi38 when the community spouses half of the couples combined resources is less than the state standard the institutionalized spouse may transfer resources to the community spouse to bring that spouse up to the state standard if on the other hand the community spouses resources exceed the csra he or she may be required to apply the excess resources to the nursing home spouses cost of care section 209b states may not use more restrictive policies for defining these resources under spousal impoverishment law table 7 shows state spousal resources standards as of november 2000 protected income the spousal impoverishment protections do not permit income of community spouses to be used in determining the nursing home spouses eligibility unless the income is actually made available to the institutionalized spouse thus all of the community spouses income is protected for use by the community spouse and need not be applied to the cost of institutional care mcca also required states to establish an income level that the community spouse can retain without affecting the institutionalized spouses eligibility for medicaid the rules require that states recognize minimum maintenance needs allowance mmna for the living expenses of the community spouse this minimum according to federal law can be lower than 150 of the federal poverty level as of 2000 the minimum was 140625 per month states can set the maintenance needs allowance as high as 2103 per month in 2000 states can increase this amount depending on the amount of the community spouses actual shelter costs and whether the minor or dependent adult children or certain other persons are living with the community spouse both of these minimum and maximum amounts are adjusted at the federal level to reflect increases in the cpi to the extent that income of the community spouse falls below the states maintenance need standard and the institutionalized spouse wishes to make part of his or her income available to the community spouse the nursing home spouse may supplement the income of the community spouse to bring the spouse up to the state standard table 7 shows state spousal income standards for november 2000 38 ahmad omar n medicaid

other institution or is receiving hcbs waiver services while living in the community these rules apply to eligible beneficiaries who qualify under medically needy program or the 300 rule and determine how much of the beneficiarys income must be applied to the cost of care before medicaid makes its payment these rules are commonly referred to as the posteligibility rules or more accurately the posteligibility treatment of income rules personal needs allowance pna for persons in nursing homes and other institutions medicaid requires that states reserve personal needs allowance pna from beneficiarys income this is an amount that is considered reasonable to cover various personal care items not included in the institutions basic charge such as clothing individual preferences on personal care items toothpaste and shampoo social support telephone stationary etc and occasional outings if nursing resident enters hospital daily fee must be paid to the nursing facility to reserve bed for her return pna funds are often used for this payment medicaid law requires that states set aside 30 for an individual and 60 for couple for monthly spending on an individuals personal needs including clothing etc39 ssi recipients for whom more than half of their medical bills in an institution are paid for by medicaid are also subject to pna restrictions these individuals automatically have their monthly ssi benefit reduced to 30 beginning with the first full calendar month of residence40 states have the option of supplementing the federal minimum pna with state funds the pna amount therefore varies by state with 16 states having supplement personal needs allowances are not adjusted to reflect changes in the annual cost of living although two states connecticut and minnesota increase their pna levels annually table 8 shows pna levels by state 39 the federal pna benefit was increased from 25 to 30 month on july 1 1988 by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 obra

physician certifies that the recipients stay in such medical institution is not likely to exceed 3 months and they need to continue to maintain home to which they may return ssi benefits will not be reduced and recipients will continue to receive full ssi benefits for up to the first 3 months of institutionalization crs41 table 8 personal needs allowance november 2000 state personal needs
