proposals updated october 28 1999 coordinated by carl behrens and richard rowberg resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress abstract the department of energy doe is currently the subject of reorganization legislation because of concern about the security of its nuclear weapons program this report revision of an earlier crs review of doe programs consists of an introductory discussion of the agency and its mission as whole and description of its major programs as independent entities the report analyzes the effect of proposed legislation on the nuclear weapons program on the original mission of the department enhancing energy security and on does energy rd basic research and environmental restoration programs the report will be updated as events warrant department of energy programs and reorganization proposals summary created in response to the energy crisis of the 1970s the department of energy doe survived an attempt to dismantle it early in the reagan administration and another in the 104th congress now the agency is again the subject of reorganization legislation this time because of concern about the security of its nuclear weapons program an amendment to the intelligence authorization act for fy2000 hr 1555 was adopted by the senate to create the agency for nuclear stewardship within doe the head of that agency would report directly and only to the secretary of energy the agency would have responsibility for all defense related activities within doe and be responsible for all doe facilities in which defense related programs are the sole or primary activity similar initiative creating national nuclear security administration nnsa within doe was included by house senate conference committee on the fy2000 department of defense authorization bill s 1059 reported august 5 1999 that bill including the provision creating nnsa was signed into law october 5 pl 10665 but the administration indicated dissatisfaction with some of its provisions and asked the congress to modify them this report revision of an earlier crs review of doe programs consists of an introductory discussion of the agency and its mission as whole and description of its major programs as independent entities many of does original energyrelated missions have disappeared or changed radically in addition with the end of the cold war does nuclear weaponsrelated programs almost twothirds of the total budget are undergoing modification however regardless of the outcome of the debate on does future many of its present functions will continue in one location or another in presenting does present structure and detailed description of its individual programs the report analyzes the effect of the proposed legislation on the nuclear weapons program in addition it addresses two primary issues the effect of restructuring on the original mission of the department enhancing national energy security in the face of

history doe was the structural component of the carter administrations response to the 1973 energy crisis its 1977 organization act pl 9531 pulled together the policy and regulatory functions of the federal energy administration fea the energy supply and demand technology functions of the energy research and develop ment administration erda and numerous energy activities from other parts of the government also added from erda which was formed in 1974 out of the atomic energy commission aec under pl 93438 were its nuclear weapons programs along with range of basic research activities focusing

development and rl30206 appropriations for fy2000 interior and related agencies updated regularly crs2 component of the aec legacy was an infrastructure of large multipurpose research laboratories called national laboratories some of which dated back to world war ii energy policy the new departments primary civilian mission was defined by the prevailing view that oil was essential in the short term but that its supply was declining and would soon become too scarce and expensive to remain the nations most important fuel the supply of oil was controlled by the opec cartel which had taken advantage of the 1973 arab oil embargo to quadruple prices taken together this view held that the worlds oil supply was diminishing and that opec controlled prices could only portend succession of price runups since the early 1980s however earlier predictions of increasing prices and short supply of oil have not developed proved world oil reserves increased by about 50 from 1973 to 1990 prices while occasionally volatile have declined in constant dollars to about what they were before the 1973 embargo and have several times dropped considerably below that level regulation of oil prices and distribution an early mission of doe has been abandoned and development of alternative energy sources while continuing has been handicapped by the low price of the oil which the new energy sources were intended to replace at the same time the issue of the effect of fossil fuel burning on climate change has injected new dimension into energy policy and planning research and development since the creation of the department as energy programs have declined in importance there has been increased emphasis on basic research and on development of new technologies and processes to aid the nations economic growth the result of this shift has been steady growth in does basic research programs since the early 1980s this growth has also resulted in broadening of the scope of the rd supported by doe particularly at the doe national laboratories nuclear weapons programs in addition to changes in energy missions and programs does defense mission has changed the end of the cold war accelerated efforts to reduce or halt testing of nuclear weapons at the same time nuclear wastes associated with the weapons production programs some of them dating back to world war ii were recognized as severe environmental problem these devel opments changed the emphasis of the defense programs from creation of new weapons and expansion of the weapons stockpile to maintenance of the existing stockpile

includes the secretary deputy secretary and under secretary some organizational offices report directly to the secretarys office including the largely independent federal energy regulatory commission ferc3 external events and federal policy changes have triggered number of changes to the doe organizational structure virtually every secretary has initiated management reforms and reorganizations to respond to these changing circumstances and to suit his or her preferred management style in particular current secretary bill richardson has instituted several reforms including one focused on the management of does sprawling array of operations offices field offices and national laboratories4 the deputy secretary serves as the chief operations officer coo with responsibility for environmental management programs certain energy programs5 and variety of staff and support programs that include contract reform and the office of field integration6 four assistant secretaries report to the deputy secretary7 the under secretary has responsibility for the science and technology programs and two energy programs nuclear energy and energy efficiency and renewable energy eere8 the deputy secretary and under secretary share responsibility for the national security programs including programs under the assistant secretary for defense programs and the assistant secretary for nonproliferation and national security secretary richardsons management reforms in early 1999 secretary richardson instituted management study on which he based several reforms to the doe management structure that links headquarters to field operations9 key reform requires each of the 11 field offices to report directly to one of three lead program 3 ferc was set up as an independent agency within doe the fivemember commission is responsible for the licensing and regulation of hydroelectric power projects regulation of electric utilities transmission and sale of electric power transportation and sale of natural gas and the operation of natural gas and oil pipelines commissioners can be removed by the president only for cause 4 when it was established in 1977 doe inherited about 40 regional and field offices research centers university programs and laboratories from various predecessor agencies the bulk came from the atomic energy commission including eight operations offices and various production and weapons facilities 5 energy information administration eia fossil energy and the power marketing administrations 6 the office of field integration was previously named the office of field management 7 policy and international affairs environmental management environment safety and health and fossil energy 8 this includes one assistant secretary for eere 9 us doe office of the secretary changes to the departmental management structure memorandum april 21 1999 2 p and us doe office of the secretary department of energy management review april 1999 25 p crs6 secretarial offices lpsos thus the office of the assistant secretary for defense programs serves as lpso for the albuquerque and nevada operations offices the office of science serves as lpso for chicago oakland and oak ridge operations offices and the office of the assistant secretary for environmental management serves as lpso for the richland savannah river idaho rocky flats and ohio offices and the office of river protection under this reform each lpso is charged with overseeing performancebased management reviewing contract decisions resolving disputes and appraising field office managers also each lpso is responsible for longterm planning landlord activities and site integration and operations to fulfill these responsibilities each lpso is required to establish principal deputy for operations other program secretarial offices psos with programs in the field offices such as fissile materials disposition and nuclear energy are to serve as customers of the field offices where their work is performed nonprogram staff and support offices such as the office of the chief financial officer and the office of human resources management still set policy but now must go through lpsos to issue decisions directives and orders to the field related reform created field management council to be forum for departmental program integration policy review coordination decisionmaking and issue resolution the sevenmember council is chaired by the deputy secretary serving as chief operating officer coo and it includes the under secretary and the heads of the three lpsos the assistant secretaries for defense programs and environmental management and the director of the office of science one field manager and one representative from the other psos serve in rotational positions on the council all policy guidance from staff and support offices must be reviewed by the council before it is issued10 after the council reviews policy the lpsos are responsible and accountable for its proper implementation at their sites the office of field integration formerly the office of field management now serves as the secretariat to the council and reports directly to the coo operations and field office managers remain responsible for all site program and project execution contract management and facility operations oversight each one reports directly to the respective lpso operations offices will perform field level program integration functions and other tasks delegated by the lpso and psos they provide single voice to state and local governments regulators media and the public each area office serves as staff office to its respective operations office thus the new structure has four key points one is the office of the secretary and the deputy secretary coo second the psos are responsible for broad program strategy policy definition evaluation and oversight third the operations offices are responsible for program implementation sitewide integration and contract management fourth contractors are responsible for daytoday execution management and operation of assigned activities more than 80 of the doe work force are contractor employees 10 council members are responsible for ensuring consistency of policy and priorities while contributing field operational considerations to policy and program development crs7 project management reforms dozens of external and internal reviews showed that doe had systemic problems with project management including inadequacies in technical scope schedule planning and control and cost estimating the reviews also showed that doe had unclear roles and responsibilities based on these findings doe announced major project management reforms focused on installing new oversight and support capabilities in the office of the chief financial officer cfo11 projects will be evaluated prior to key decisions such as baseline approval and construction initiation special tracking and control mechanisms are being designed to follow all projects valued at 20 million or more further coo watch list has been set up to identify problem projects that require more stringent financial controls and reporting requirements projects on this list include the savannah river intank precipitation and hanford k basins spent nuclear fuels further reform directs the cfo to work with omb and congressional committees to require higher standards of project management in order for projects to be funded also the policy directs the cfo to work with other offices to devise plan to assess capabilities define qualifications create training program and build institutional capability for project planning control and reporting another reform directs each lpso to create an inhouse project management capability to improve accountability each lpso must assess its own project management system and prepare plan for correcting deficiencies and managing improvements further the lpso must coordinate with the cfo and submit this plan for review in addition one reform aims to improve contractor accountability for project management it directs the offices of contract reform and privatization procurement and the cfo to assess contractor project management issues further it requires plan to establish priorities and steps to strengthen contract reform doe security management reform investigations by doe and the federal bureau of investigation fbi led to presidential decision directive pdd 61 that called for new counterintelligence measures secretary richardson incorporated this directive into broad reform of does security programs that set out several new counterintelligence measures12 one is goal of ending the backlog of background investigations by the end of 1999 another is to create vulnerability assessment group the red team to evaluate espionage threat and vulnerability and to test security and counterintelligence measures also doe has signed memorandum of understanding with the fbi to improve coordination however the primary organizational action under this security reform was the creation of new office of security and emergency operations which reports directly to the secretary it is responsible for all safeguards and security policy computer security and emergency operations functions this new office consolidates functions and budgets from the office of security affairs and the office of the chief information 11 us doe office of the deputy secretary project management reform initiative memorandum june 25 1999 12 us doe richardson unveils security reform package press release may 11 1999 crs8 officer cio and it embraces the new office of foreign visits and assignments policy fvap and the new office of plutonium uranium and special material inventory pusmi all classified and unclassified computer security functions are now centralized under the revamped office of the cio additional funding is being sought for hardware to ensure continual monitoring of computer systems random audits of users and more stringent controls over storage media fvap ensures that all visitors have appropriate checks and approvals as mandated by pdd 61 pusmi enhances the accounting process for the most sensitive nuclear material new office of independent oversight and performance assurance consolidates expands and elevates the oversight functions for safeguards and security as well as for special nuclear materials accountability it also reports directly to the secretary gao critique the general accounting office gao has also made suggestions for reforming does management13 gao raises concerns about nuclear weapons information security and general management problems involving unclear lines of authority and contractor oversight weaknesses it observes that does reforms aiming for more direct field reporting to psos parallel those attempted under secretary watkins during the bush administration gao contends that the previous reform was abandoned when field and laboratory staff became frustrated by having to report to both program and staff offices for this and other reasons it concludes does recent piecemeal reforms will fail gao finds that does approach to contract management oversight does not meet modern standards and that its complex and everchanging organizational structure impairs improvements in accountability further it asserts that does record with big projects from 1980 to 1996 involved billions of dollars wasted in cost overruns and other inefficiencies based on survey of former administration and doe officials and on other observations gao concludes that the doe reforms are insufficient to overcome fundamental departmental problems instead it recommends that doe attempt more fundamental rethinking of departmental missions and restructuring of contract policy it offers framework of questions to help do this more specifically gao says doe should reexamine its missions to identify those that can be eliminated because they are longer valid government functions for missions that are properly governmental gao stresses the need for doe to reassess the best organizational placement for them14 an effective reorganization it says demands coordinated approach within and across agency lines supported by solid consensus of the congress and administration for change congressional actions legislation to reorganize the department of energy is being considered in both the senate and house in the senate an amendment to the intelligence authorization act for fy2000 hr 1555 was adopted that would create the agency for nuclear 13 us gao department of energy need to address longstanding management weaknesses july 13 1999 printed testimony gaotrced99255 14 further gao suggests that does strategic plan may embody weaknesses since it assumes that its existing missions and their organizational placements are valid crs9 stewardship within doe the head of that agency would report directly and only to the secretary of energy the agency would have responsibility for all defense related activities within doe and be responsible for all doe facilities in which defense related programs are the sole or primary activity there was companion bill in the house similar initiative creating national nuclear security administration within doe was included by housesenate conference committee on the fy2000 department of defense authorization bill s 1059 reported august 5 1999 the house agreed to the conference report on september 15 after rejecting by 139281 vote motion by representative dingell to recommit the president signed s 1059 on october 5 1999 pl 10665 but said the provisions setting up nnsa were flawed and announced that until further notice the secretary of energy would perform all duties and functions of the under secretary for nuclear security who is also the administrator of nuclear security of nnsa and guide and direct all personnel of nnsa by using his authority to assign any doe officer or employee to concurrent office within nnsa this action drew criticism from some members and the house committee on armed services established special oversight panel to work with the administration on the timely and effective implementation of the doe reorganization proposals mandated in title xxxii in joint hearing of the senate energy and governmental affairs committees october 19 secretary richardson called the reorganization plan as passed unworkable and said he would submit proposals for legislative modifications that would remedy the bills deficiencies for details on reorganization legislation see crs issue brief ib10036 restructuring doe and its laboratories issues in the 106th congress issues and options there are two primary issues to be considered when reviewing legislative proposals to reorganize or restructure the department of energy first what effect would restructuring have on the original motive for the department enhancing energy security energy remains an important national concern for environmental reasons and because declining domestic oil production seems certain to increase dependence on oil imports especially from the middle east the last 15 years have demonstrated clearly the effectiveness of the market in accommodating large energy price shocks without federal intervention except for modest sale of spr oil at the beginning of combat in the persian gulf war in 1991 while wide array of promising energy supply and demand technologies has emerged from the doe energy technology rd programs low energy prices have put commercial adoption of most of these technologies well into the future furthermore the apparent success of marketdriven energy efficiency gains has raised questions about the need for federal support of new technologies in this area nevertheless oil imports have steadily risen to constitute more than 50 of the nations oil supply and despite attempts to diversify sources of oil imports middle east dependence is growing if these supplies are threatened in the future it is very likely that federal actions will be taken the current focus of congressional restructuring proposals is the national security side of doe therefore does ability to take actions in the event of an energy emergency should not be adversely affected crs10 indeed if the restructuring brings about management improvements throughout doe it is possible that the agency could be more effective in responding to supply disruptions and developing new energy technologies if the restructuring were to result in shift of does resources from civilian to national security functions however its effectiveness in dealing with any significant energy concerns might be compromised the second issue concerns how restructuring would affect does energy rd basic research and environmental restoration programs those activities constitute about 57 of the doe budget for fy1999 the proposed restructuring concentrates on the national security programs which do not energy rd and basic research the primary reason for the restructuring proposals however is concern over security of nuclear weapons data and information in addition some of the facilities included in the proposed restructuring notably the three weapons labs are also the home of some of the doe energy rd and basic research activities therefore concerns have been raised that the restructuring may have negative consequences for activities not directly involving nuclear weapons the stockpile stewardship and maintenance programs for nonweapons programs within the new organization questions about relative emphasis and allocation of resources arise questions about how the management of any new organization will interact with management of does civilian rd programs also appear important report organization the remainder of this report examines the major doe programs describing their purpose when begun and their history since then the program sections are arranged in the order they appear in table 1 above because the weapons programs are the primary subject of the current reorganization initiatives we have rearranged the order of the programs in the table and the rest of the report to put those programs first environmental restoration and waste management which has separate budget listings for defense and nondefense activities because of split jurisdiction by authorizing committees is discussed as single item in this report this activity is not included in the reorganization legislation similarly because does national laboratories which are owned and funded by the federal government but staffed by nonfederal employees under contract with doe would be greatly affected by the reorganization legislation separate section discusses the issues surrounding them the remaining programs would not be directly changed by the reorganization legislation in pl 10665 however some of them especially some of the non weapons research programs could be indirectly affected the sections on those programs include discussion of possible issues raised by the reorganization crs11 weapons stockpile stewardship and management 15 description doe reorganized its stockpile stewardship ss program and its budget reporting for fy1996 in response to presidential and congressional direction of 1993 under its former name of weapons research development and testing wrdt this activity developed new nuclear weapons and held weapons tests however in 1992 the united states began moratorium on its nuclear tests and in september 1996 president clinton signed the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt which bans all nuclear tests the defense department has current requirement for new design warheads in this environment ss seeks to provide the scientific basis for maintaining nuclear weapons for decades without testing ss complements stockpile management sm16 in essence sm monitors maintains and dismantles nuclear weapons on daytoday basis ss provides the scientific resources to address problems sm cannot handle ss is working to increase understanding of nuclear weapons science through program of computation archived data from past tests and experiments using new or existing scientific facilities and then to apply this understanding to weapons maintenance problems and prediction of such problems for example warheads deteriorate with age formerly replacement of old warheads with new ones minimized this effect and tests could resolve aging problems and provide confidence in their solution now if sm finds that warhead component has deteriorated ss might determine whether that affects safety reliability or performance if it does not ss might try to determine how to retard further deterioration if it does ss might decide how to solve the problem alternatively ss might anticipate that problem will emerge and will seek solutions in advance17 key element of ss is its use in certifying the us nuclear stockpile each year that is confirming that the warhead types meet their required characteristics for safety yield etc ss is centered at the three doe nuclear weapons laboratories sandia national laboratories headquartered in nm alamos national laboratory nm and lawrence livermore national laboratory ca as part of the effort to generate new data and to attract and train young scientists ss is building new scientific facilities mainly at these laboratories to enable experiments simulating aspects of nuclear weapon performance also relevant to ss is the nevada test site nts the first nuclear test at nts was conducted in 1951 all us nuclear explosions since 1973 have been conducted there us policy requires the ability to resume nuclear testing if another nation tests or if supreme us interests require eg major weapon 15 prepared by jonathan medalia specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division 16 doe uses stockpile stewardship inconsistently sometimes to refer only to the science component and at other times to refer to both science and production 17 for detailed description see us department of energy office of defense programs stockpile stewardship plan second annual update fy1999 executive overview april 1998 40 p crs12 problem that cannot be resolved without testing doe is reducing activities at nts to level where it would take two or three years to conduct test after decision to resume doe is also using an underground chamber at nts to conduct subcritical experiments in which high explosives are used to examine the behavior of aged plutonium without causing nuclear chain reaction that would violate the ctbt history of stockpile stewardship nuclear weapons work began with the manhattan project in 1942 the first nuclear weapons test was held july 16 1945 work continued at low level for few years five tests were conducted in 19461950 since then the program has mirrored the tides of the cold war the 1950s saw the development of thermonuclear weapons and the deployment of many new types of weapons with 188 us nuclear tests between 1951 and 1958 the united states united kingdom and soviet union held testing moratorium from 1958 to 1961 in 1963 they agreed to the limited test ban treaty which bars atmospheric space and underwater but not under ground nuclear tests in the 1960s the united states conducted its highest level of testing with 433 tests the pace of us testing gradually slowed over the course of the 1970s and 1980s though many warhead types were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the end of the cold war and with nuclear testing halted the weapons program has shifted from developing new weapons with testing to maintaining existing ones without testing nuclear weapons work has been housed in several agencies over the last half century the manhattan project was under the jurisdiction of the army in 1946 the atomic energy commission aec was established providing civilian control of all nuclear weapon activities except military use in 1974 in response to the energy crisis the energy research and development administration erda was established to centralize national energy efforts erda incorporated the weapons functions of the aec which was abolished and several other energyrelated agencies in 1977 erda was combined with other agencies into the department of energy to give cabinetlevel attention to energy history of stockpile management through the 1980s the key mission of stockpile support the predecessor of sm was production of nuclear warheads several large facilities were built for the manhattan project including those at hanford wa for producing plutonium and at oak ridge tn for enriching uranium the 1950s saw more facilities built including savannah river site sc for producing plutonium and tritium rocky flats plant co for fabricating plutonium components and pantex plant tx for assembling nuclear weapons they were sized for high rate of warhead production other concerns were subordinated to production because of the urgency of the cold war and because in the early years the environmental safety and health risks posed by weapons production were much less fully understood than is the case now in addition to production stockpile support tasks included monitoring the condition of stockpiled warheads called surveillance nuclear warheads deteriorate over time high explosives degrade metals crs13 corrode components may crack and impurities build up in plutonium these changes may affect safety reliability and performance the surveillance program tries to detect these changes maintaining warheads this includes changing tritium reservoirs on warheads see below and replacing or repairing deteriorated components dismantlement of retired warheads throughout the cold war new warheads would replace older ones often before the latter deteriorated with age retired warheads would be disassembled at pantex and their high explosive burned uranium and plutonium components were shipped back to oak ridge and rocky flats respectively where they had been manufactured they would be reduced to metal and reused in new weapons in 1989 following an fbi raid rocky flats was closed because of environ mental and health violations as it was the only facility that made plutonium components on large scale weapons production ceased after components it had already made were used up the end of the cold war and the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 ended the requirement to produce new warheads many other production facilities have closed status of stockpile stewardship ss sm and third element program direction are grouped under the category of weapons activities program direction funds federal personnel for does office of defense programs which is in charge of the weapons program and funds some related activities that fall outside ss and sm such as environment and security for fy1999 the adjusted funding is 21159 million for ss 20526 million for sm 2500 million for program direction less 184 million for use of prior year balances for total of 44000 million for weapons activities the request for fy2000 is 22862 million for ss 19983 million

analyzes several potential impacts on the nuclear weapons complex of the main reorganization proposal currently before the 106th congress this proposal contained in title xxxii of the fy2000 defense authorization bill s 1059 pl 10665 signed into law october 5 would create national nuclear security administration nnsa within doe also in the conference bill title xxxi contains subtitle d matters relating to safeguards security and counterintelligence and subtitle matters relating to personnel aspects of these subtitles are discussed here as well the present analysis applies with special force to the three nuclear weapons laboratories as they have been at the center of concern over espionage but applies as well to the four plants and the nevada test site the house agreed to the conference report september 15 after rejecting by vote of 139281 motion by representative dingell to recommit to the conference committee with instructions to insist on striking all provisions that limit any existing authority of the secretary of energy to direct the nnsa crs15 regarding organization the legislation provides that nnsa shall have an administrator for nuclear security who is also under secretary for nuclear security this individual shall be subject to the authority direction and control of the secretary of energy sec 3202 within nnsa there shall be an office of counterintelligence and an office of intelligence sec 3204 there shall also be deputy administrator for defense programs responsible for nuclear weapons work sec 3214 deputy administrator for defense nuclear nonproliferation sec 3215 and deputy administrator for naval reactors sec 3216 security the legislation takes number of steps in an effort to improve security by creating semiautonomous agency that is among other things responsible for setting its own security policies the legislation seeks to make it quicker and easier to implement securityrelated directives within the nuclear weapons complex than would be the case if other organizations within doe had to sign off on such measures the legislation raises the profile of security and counterintelligence by having these functions headed by chief of defense nuclear counterintelligence and chief of defense nuclear security both within nnsa who shall report to the administrator for nuclear security and who have direct access to the secretary of energy because these two chiefs are within nnsa the legislation intends that they should be more attuned to security issues within the nuclear weapons complex than would be the case if they were outside it and weapons complex personnel should be more responsive to them in this context victor reis the outgoing assistant secretary of energy for defense programs testified before the house armed services committee on july 14 1999 that appreciation of the importance of security can be attained only by imbedding the security apparatus within the organization that has the responsibility for getting the job done security like safety then becomes part of the team that is focused on the mission not entrusted to an external group that is looking to play gotcha18 the defense authorization act takes other steps to raise the profile of security among other things it requires annual reports to congress on counterintelligence sec 2304 establishes commission on safeguards security and counterintelligence at department of energy facilities sec 3142 requires doe and contractor employees to be fully trained in matters relating to the protection of classified information and to potential espionage and counterintelligence threats sec 3145 requires other reports to congress on security sec 31503153 and mandates counterintelligence polygraph program sec 3154 more generally the legislations stress on security and the storm over security beginning in march 1999 have made an indelible impression on nuclear weapons complex management and staff alike about the importance of taking security with the utmost seriousness19 such actions seem sure to make security more integral part of the culture and modus operandi of the 18 testimony as reported in richardson avoids showdown with retiring defense chief reis nuclear weapons materials monitor july 19 1999 4 19 crs issue brief ib10036 restructuring doe and its laboratories issues for the 106th congress updated regularly crs16 weapons complex which is arguably more effective and less intrusive than if security is imposed by other parts of doe or external auditors science there is some question on whether the legislation by building wall around semiautonomous agency will impair the new agencys ability to do outstanding science the excellence of the nuclear weapons laboratories stems in part from their scientists ability to contact and work with outside scientists as the american physical society stated national security will ultimately be damaged if the underlying science suffers as result of government practices that indiscriminately discourage or limit the open exchange of ideas20 making the weapons program more selfcontained might impede contact with scientists in other parts of doe moreover the conference bill requires the secretary of energy to complete background review for each citizen from sensitive country before that person can visit nuclear weapons laboratory and imposes moratorium on most visitors from sensitive countries until key officials can certify that the foreign visitor program meets various counterintelligence and security standards sec 3146 the review requirement along with greatly increased concern about foreign nationals posing security risk might discourage weapons complex staff from inviting some foreign visitors on the other hand it might be argued that raising the threshold of effort needed to bring in such visitors would reduce the number of such visitors for whom there is the least justification and urgency higher threshold though does not necessarily reduce the number of wouldbe spies related science issue is whether measures to increase security will lead current staff to leave weapons work in midcareer or to retire earlier than they otherwise would and lead prospective applicants to reject job offers at the labs in weapons work to decide not to work at the labs or to decide not to apply such measures include the polygraphing of some 5000 employees the prospect of not continuing the university of california as the contractor operating livermore and alamos national laboratories and the institution of classificationlike controls on release or discussion of broad categories of unclassified information by lab staff discussions in july 1999 between crs and nuclear weapons complex staff reveal that these may be serious problems others outside the labs hold that the scientists should get with the program that they should be more accepting of security as part of the job and that after some initial grumbling they will get back to work moreover the legislation includes several provisions aimed at recruitment retention and skill development sec 3162 3163 accountability an enduring complaint over the years about doe is that the organizational structure is hopelessly confusing that it is incapable of reform and that it diffuses accountability so much that one is responsible for anything the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board called doe dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself21 this problem it is 20 american physical society aps statement on national security and open conduct of science may 21 1999 at httpwwwapsorgexecsecopenhtml 21 us presidents foreign intelligence advisory board special investigative panel science at its best security at its worst report on security problems at the us continued crs17 argued makes it all but impossible for doe to implement security measures effectively according to 1994 doe report these multiple safeguards and security offices at doe have resulted in duplication of guidance unnecessary requests for information and clarification and inefficient program execution unchecked this counter productive tendency threatens the success of the overall safeguards and security effort22 in the case of the recent alleged chinese espionage at alamos for example elements of doe did not communicate effectively with one another and critical information was lost as provided in the defense authorization act nnsa would try to change that situation by clarifying lines of authority with the administrator for nuclear security given direct responsibility and authority for the nuclear weapons complex and all other doe national security functions with all nnsa personnel responsible to the administrator or the secretary and not to people in any other part of doe and with the legislation making security more salient the new organization should be better able to coordinate security efforts and they should be subject to fewer crosspressures undermining them on the other hand some express concern that separate nnsa within doe would weaken accountability at july 13 1999 joint hearing by the house commerce committee and the house science committee representative dingell said proposals to set up fully or semiautonomous agency would only insulate these programs from outside scrutiny and accountability and maureen eldredge program director for the alliance for nuclear accountability private antinuclear group expressed concern that similar proposals are chilling return to the darker days of the past when weapons work was done unchecked by environmental consequences regulation or public scrutiny23 congressional oversight the defense authorization act includes multiple requirements for reporting to congress as noted under security above in particular there is to be detailed annual report on security and counterintelligence programs at each doe facility including the status and effectiveness of such programs the adequacy of procedures and policies for protecting classified information determination of whether each weapons laboratory is in full compliance with security measures significant violations of security and counterintelligence requirements and certain information on foreign visitors sec 2304 21 continued department of energy june 1999 p 4 22 us department of energy office of

19 1999 6 crs18 the legislation intends to convey to doe and the nuclear weapons complex how seriously the congress takes security matters requirements for reporting make clear that the security and counterintelligence are of critical importance and imply that noncompliance will be noticed and is not acceptable combined with the clearer lines of authority and responsibility in nnsa the reporting requirements aim to serve as an incentive to full compliance in addition aside from the legislative provisions the legislation expresses the congressional perspective on security 1999 report on maintaining nuclear weapons expertise recommended reinvigorating congressional oversight of the nuclear weapons program it also noted the administration and the congress through actions and words should make concerted and continuing effort to convey to the nuclear weapons community that their mission is vital to the security of the nation this message should be unequivocal clear and periodically reinforced24 the legislation arguably does this conveying to the nuclear weapons community the importance of its mission on the other hand the legislation does not address suggestions for parallel reorganization of congress to oversee the nuclear weapons program congress mirrors the multiple and conflicting jurisdictions and lines of authority within doe for this program with many committees involved observers have noted need to facilitate oversight streamline reporting by nnsa to congress and reduce the burden of testifying before and answering to multiple committees while it could be argued that having multiple committees involved in the nuclear weapons program ensures that contending interests and priorities are represented the same argument could be made on behalf of keeping the structure of the nuclear weapons program unchanged if the present structure of that program is deficient on the executive branch side congress may wish to consider if similar structure for congressional oversight may also warrant attention whither nnsa the fate of the proposed nnsa is unclear as of mid september nnsa is contentious on grounds of secretarial responsibility and authority and compliance with environment safety and health legislation secretary richardson said in august i would most likely recommend to the president that he veto the bill on grounds that the secretary of energy under the bill undermines the secretarys authority over nnsa and blurs the lines of responsibility in various areas25 senator carl levin said i remain concerned that the proposed reorganization so significantly reduces the authority of the secretary of energy over the nuclear weapons programs of the department that it makes him less accountable 24 us commission on maintaining united states

legislation would eliminate tangles in the lines of authority house republicans said and replace what representative mac thornberry of texas called dysfunctional bureaucracy with militarystyle chain of command from the secretary through the new agencys director to field directors of weapons laboratories 27 the states have different concern said one report last week 46 state attorneys general said in letter to congressional leaders that the reorganization would undercut 1992 law that explicitly gave the states regulatory control over the does hazardous waste management and cleanup activities28 kenneth salazar the colorado attorney general wrote to the chairs of the conference on the bill the reorganization should not subordinate environment safety and health concerns to weapons production and development i am concerned that this will be the unintended consequence of the proposed amendment29 in contrast representative thornberry indicated the legislation would leave existing state controls on environmental matters in place30 similarly senator domenici said what this legislation changes is not statutory requirements just the management structure responsible for complying with these requirements31 26 levin releases crs memorandum questioning doe reorganization proposal news release september 8 1999 httpwwwsenategovlevinreleases090899htm 27 eric schmitt congressional pact

develop its own expertise and allowed paying higher rates than generally available in federal service three of does national laboratories are still primarily nuclear weapons laboratories alamos livermore and sandia following the war the atomic energy act established the atomic energy commission aec to manage and regulate nuclear rd and to take over the weapons program and extend it to civilian atomic energy and related fields including the use of nuclear materials for medical and biological purposes nuclear rd including nuclear weapons rd has been under civilian control since then in 1974 the energy reorganization act transferred the rd functions including the laboratories of the aec to the newly created energy research and development administration erda also transferred to erda were energy related functions and some small singleprogram laboratories of the department of the interior national science foundation and environmental protection agency the federal nonnuclear energy research and development act of 1974 gave erda broad mandate to conduct energy rd and demonstration projects and to promote the commercialization of energy technologies doe was established in 1977 with erda and its laboratories as its core and with broad responsibility for national energy policy congress subsequently mandated number of specific new crs22 responsibilities for doe in the general areas of energy development and conservation technology transfer and environmental restoration and waste management since the 1980s however as concerns about the energy crisis of the 1970s lessened some of the departments energyrelated rd programs have been canceled or have received less support than previously current status the doe national laboratories are worldclass laboratories that contribute significantly to does major mission areas there has been concern in the last several years however as evidenced in the 1995 galvin task force report33 that the doe laboratories have lost their rd focus as does mission areas have become more diverse in the 106th congress following the release of the cox committee report34 and the rudman report35 legislation has been developed to

balance of the decade in the 1990s funding has increased somewhat in constant 1995 dollars funding grew from 13 million in fy1973 until it peaked in fy1979 at 14 billion spending plunged to 430 million by fy1982 and continued steady decline to 129 million in fy1990 since then it has increased steadily in current dollars funding was 346 million in fy1998 and 366 million in fy1999 the fy2000 request was 446 million history federal programs for solar heating and cooling research as well as geothermal research originated in the national science foundation nsf in the early 1970s in fy1973 nsf spent about 4 million for solar research and smaller unspecified amount for geothermal research both programs were transferred to the energy research and development administration erda when it was established in 1974 the wind energy program inherited by erda was originally part of the federal energy administration fea project independence solar energy plan and involved number of federal agencies including the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the department of agriculture at erda the renewable energy program was given equal status with other supply options through designation of its own assistant administrator in 1974 the congress enacted three laws pl 93409 pl 93473 pl 93 577 that together with the energy reorganization act expanded the range of renewable energy rd lines and authorized the creation of the solar energy research institute seri later renamed as the national renewable energy laboratory erdas 1975 national energy plan emphasized the importance of renewables as longterm post2000 technology development option erdas second plan in 1976 recognized prior commercial uses in the early 1950s and created an additional focus on shortterm applications and demonstrations of solar technologies erdas renewable energy functions were transferred along with others when doe was established in 1977 from the early longterm focus on

plants nuclear power systems for spacecraft and naval reactors the office also manages doe research reactors and surplus nuclear facilities produces radioactive isotopes for medical and other applications and manages the conversion of depleted uranium from enrichment operations into stable forms funding for civilian nuclear energy activities totaled 243 million in fy1998 and 284 million in fy1999 the administrations fy2000 request was 269 million history efforts to harness nuclear energy began in the late 1940s with joint program by the navy and the atomic energy commission aec one of does predecessor agencies to develop submarine nuclear propulsion system the program quickly achieved success with the light water reactor lwr which used ordinary water for cooling and to help sustain nuclear chain reaction to produce energy the design became the basis for the first commercialscale nuclear power plant shippingport which began operating near pittsburgh in 1957 during the 1960s the lwr was adopted as the standard commercial nuclear power technology in the united states and throughout most of the world the us nuclear rd program then turned most of its attention to what was expected to be the next generation of nuclear plants breeder reactors which could produce more fissile nuclear fuel than they consumed several prototype reactors were built and doe made plans to build the first commercialscale breeder reactor at clinch river tn but the program grew increasingly controversial because of the breeder reactors principal fuel plutonium nuclear weapons material and the deteriorating economic outlook for the technology congress canceled the clinch river project in 1983 during the late 1980s and early 1990s the nuclear rd program focused primarily on improved versions of todays commercial lwrs space power systems and advanced reactor technologies one advanced technology liquid metal reactors grew out of the breeder program and generated much of the same controversy which resulted in its termination by congress in 1994 the other major advanced reactor technology under development by doe the hightemperature gascooled reactor was ended in 1995 doe shared the nuclear industrys costs for completing detailed engineering for improved lwr nuclear power plants program whose funding ended in fy1997 37 prepared by mark holt specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division crs26 the new designs are intended to be safer and more economical to build and operate than existing reactors but the commercial outlook remains uncertain natural uranium must be enriched in the fissile isotope u235 to become useable fuel for light water reactors the operation of three huge uranium enrichment plants originally built to provide enriched uranium for nuclear weapons and naval power reactors was previously major activity of the doe nuclear energy office the oldest of those facilities at oak ridge tn was closed in 1985 and the operation of the remaining two at paducah ky and portsmouth oh was transferred to the governmentowned us enrichment corporation usec by the energy policy act of 1992 usec which was sold to the private sector in 1998 leases the two remaining enrichment plants from doe status two doe nuclear power research programs are now proposed or underway the nuclear energy research initiative neri designed to support innovative nuclear energy research projects received an initial appropriation of 19 million in fy1999 the nuclear energy plant optimization nepo program which has yet to be funded is intended to improve the economic competitiveness of existing nuclear power plants doe requested 25 million for neri and 5 million for nepo in fy2000 much of the nuclear rd programs current budget is devoted to shutting down facilities involved in the liquid metal reactor program process that is expected to take several years some of the technology developed for the liquid metal reactor program is being modified for treatment of various doe spent fuel and other radioactive waste breeder reactor opponents are fighting the waste treatment technology program on the grounds that it could form the basis for future revival of the liquid metal reactor program the naval reactors program joint activity with the defense department would be transferred to the new national nuclear security administration under the provisions in title xxxii of the fy2000 defense authorization act s 1059 development of nuclear reactors for space missions ended in fy1995 primarily because of lack of commitment by other agencies or industries that might deploy such system substantial work is continuing however on nonreactor nuclear power systems for space applications such systems which have been used on number of missions generate power from the heat produced by radioactive decay although uranium enrichment operations have been privatized does nuclear energy office remains responsible for management of thousands of containers of depleted uranium hexafluoride the material left over from the enrichment process under current plans special facilities are to be constructed at each site to convert the uranium hexafluoride to form that is safer to handle and store crs27 basic energy sciences bes38 description and budget the basic energy sciences bes program which is funded at 7995 million for fy1999 is the most diverse research program within doe its stated goals are to carry out scientific research related to energy technology development and to maintain and develop major research facilities for national use the research in bes consists of wide range of basic research activities in materials chemistry engineering earth sciences and energy biosciences in addition to energy technologies bes research has potential applications in wide variety of industrial areas the major user facilities synchrotron radiation and neutron sources operated by bes at the doe labs are used extensively by industry universities and government on costshared basis support of these user facilities constitutes nearly half of the doe bes budget doe is currently constructing new user facility the spallation neutron source sns this facility is designed to produce large flux of neutrons for use as tool to study genetic structure chemical reactions and structure of materials among other areas history the bes program finds its roots in research funded by the atomic energy commission aec from 1946 to its demise in 1974 when the energy research and development administration was established that year pl93438 it absorbed all the aec rd programs at the time the aec sponsored broadbased research program in many of the same general areas as the current bes program the aec program called physical research was almost entirely aimed at civilian nuclear science and technology befitting the agencys mission when the program was transferred to the energy research and development administration erda in 1974 its coverage broadened to include all the energy technologies under erdas jurisdiction the bes label first appeared in the erdas fy1976 energy rd plan when erda was absorbed by doe in 1977 the bes research program moved as well in addition to the original research programs inherited from aec which have expanded significantly doe has added research in earth sciences energy biosciences biomass based fuels and advanced energy projects current status doe requested 8881 million for basic energy sciences for fy2000 111 above fy1999 nearly all of the increase was for continued construction of the sns for which doe requested 214 million in fy2000 compared to 130 million in fy1999 in addition doe asked for an additional 8 million for climate change technology initiative research which would be spread among all of the bes subprograms doe requested 7 million in new funds for portion of the scientific 38 prepared by richard rowberg senior specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division crs28 simulation initiative which would be used for studying combustion processes offsetting reductions were requested in the engineering and geosciences materials chemical sciences and biosciences subprograms and by completion of the combustion research facilityii issues the future of the bes program is closely tied to that of the national laboratories at the nine multipurpose laboratories the two programs supply about 34 of the nondefense rd funding the diversity of activities conducted by these two programs contributes to the concerns about the lack of clear missions for these laboratories as the laboratories have expanded their interactions with the private sector it is many of the bes activities and facilities that are being offered for private participation restructuring doe to establish separate entity for defense programs could have some effect on the bes program about 573 million of the fy1999 bes appropriations 72 is being spent at the three weapons labs alamos national laboratory lanl lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl and sandia national laboratories snl most of the bes research undertaken at those labs is independent of the weapons work and does not use facilities also used by the stockpile stewardship program nevertheless there is likely some interaction between the researchers of the two programs and any management change instituted at the labs for security purposes is likely to affect the nondefense activities as well it would be rather difficult for laboratory management to operate under one set of procedures and structure for the weapons program and another for the civilian research activities of particular concern would be the possibility that exchange of scientific information between the two groups on related subjects such as materials science and chemistry would be hindered by barriers created by restructuring also if the bes research effort at the three labs is subject to the same management structure as the weapons program while the bes activities at the other labs are subject to different structure there could be inefficiencies created in joint lab activities the spallation neutron source sns project is potential casein point lanl has an important role in the project which will require the use of lanl accelerator research capabilities part of that capability is also being used by the doe weapons programs the sns project structure has already been criticized for being too complex and doe restructuring may add to that complexity crs29 computational and technology research ctr39 description and budget the computational and technology research ctr program supports basic research in mathematics and computer science and advanced energy projects the program funds research on advanced computer applications and provides access to high performance computers for researchers in the doe laboratories through the national energy research scientific computing center nersc this program also is responsible for the doe portion of the next generation internet ngi initiative40 finally doe civilian technology transfer activities are contained in this program history until fy1997 the ctr program was part of the doe basic energy sciences program dating back to the latter programs origins in the atomic energy commission for fy1997 doe removed the advanced energy projects and applied mathematics subprograms from the previous version of the bes program and formed the ctr program current status for fy2000 doe requested 1989 million for computational and technology research 263 above fy1999 the bulk of the increase was for the scientific simulation initiative to develop and deploy software for the doe supercomputing systems begin the development of terascale computing and networking facilities and start the selection of scientific projects for initial applications of those systems the fy2000 request for the ctr portion of this initiative was 52 million doe also requested slight increase for nersc and the energy sciences network to provide support for doe researchers funding for the ngi would remain the same for fy2000 as for fy1999 issues the proposed doe restructuring could pose significant concerns for this program while the supercomputer facilities at the nersc center are not part of the defense programs and are not located at one of the three weapons labs some in congress have expressed concern about the presence of two supercomputer programs within doe in particular the house appropriations committee during consideration of the doe appropriations for fy2000 questioned the need for the development of an additional supercomputer facility when substantial funding was already being provided for the accelerated strategic computer initiative asci within the doe defense programs the house committee noted that doe had stated 39 prepared by richard rowberg senior specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division 40 us library of congress congressional research service next generation internet by glenn mcloughlin crs report 97521 spr washington updated september 5 1997 crs30 that asci would not be limited to just defense applications and expressed its view that congress was unable to support two supercomputer programs within doe nevertheless the committee recognized the importance of applying supercomputers to complex problems and directed doe to work with the committee to identify mutually agreeable program41 with restructuring such program might be significantly more difficult to accomplish than is currently the case because the asci activity is the heart of the doe stockpile stewardship program and is likely to be the principal focus of additional security measures under the restructured arrangement access to asci supercomputers for nonweapons work might become very difficult furthermore the existence of separate management procedures and structures for asci and for doe users outside the weapons programs might complicate use of the asci facilities even if arrangements could be made that did not compromise security 41 us

responsibility for this research and expanded it into nuclear medicine as part of the aec mandate to explore peaceful uses of the atom the aec funding continued until the agency was terminated in 1974 by that time environmental research had also become part of the program as concern about the environmental effects of nuclear power plants grew when the energy research and development administration erda took over the aec research activities the biological environmental and health programs expanded to cover all forms of energy production this emphasis continued when the doe became responsible for erdas programs in 1977 since then the ber research program has expanded its mission to become major source of federal basic research support in the biomedical and environmental sciences status currently the ber program has two major activities along with broad set of activities in biomedical and environmental science the first is the human genome project coordinated by the national institutes of health whose goal is to map the entire human genome much of the doe portion of this project is being carried out at the national laboratories the second major activity is the carbon dioxide research project which is part of the us global change research program the carbon dioxide project focuses on the chemistry of carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion for fy2000 the ber program requested 4112 million for biological and environmental research 58 below fy1999 level issues for fy1999 about 137 of the ber funded research is being conducted at the three doe weapons labs most of that funding is for the doe portion of the human 42 prepared by richard rowberg senior specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division crs32 genome project which is centered at lanl and llnl there is little if any overlap between the ber work and the weapons work at the three labs other than sharing common management structure therefore concerns about restructuring would likely be limited to how change in management structure and procedures would affect the ber research effort at the three labs and whether it would affect interaction of those ber activities with those going on at other laboratories under the existing doe management structure another concern peculiar to the human genome project is whether heightened security measures brought on by the restructuring would create any barriers between doe researchers and those at the national institutes of health which is the lead agency on the project in particular there might be consequences for public access to the genome databases being established at lanl and llnl from the genetic sequencing work crs33 fusion energy sciences magnetic fusion energy43 description the fusion energy science fes program concentrates on basic research in plasma and fusion science and technology to expand the knowledge base needed to develop fusionbased power reactors and to enhance the application of plasma science in industry44 the program supports research on two major tokamak facilities and number of alternative concepts for the last several years doe has participated in the international thermonuclear experimental reactor iter project that participation ends in fy1999 however with the end of the engineering design activity phase the program is now developing roadmap for future fusion research that integrates both magnetic and inertial fusion concepts with the goal of demonstration power plant by 2035 the budget for the fes program for fy1999 is 2226 million history magnetic fusion research began in 1951 when scientists at various atomic energy commission aec national laboratories and at princeton university began to explore the possibility of containing the fusion reaction for peaceful purposes the aec began funding that research and in 1952 established fusion research activity within its research division the program called controlled thermonuclear research ctr continued to be funded by the aec until its research responsibilities were transferred to the energy research and development administration erda in 1974 by that time the program was renamed magnetic fusion research since another line of ctr was being pursued based on the principle of inertial confinement fusion icf the aec also supported icf research which because of its weapons applica tions remained in the defense research portion of the aec and erda when doe was formed the mfe program was absorbed by the agency over the years it shifted from being basic research program to an energy technology development effort recently however budget cuts and congressional mandates have resulted in the programs being redirected toward basic fusion science and technology and renamed fusion energy sciences fes the icf work remains in the doe defense programs although small activity on inertial fusion energy was started in the fes program few years ago status doe requested 2226 million for fusion science research in fy2000 the same as fy1999 the request however contained 10 million for the first year of three year 48 million effort to decontaminate the tokamak fusion test reactor which was shut down in fy1998 doe requested an increase of 47 million for research 43 prepared by richard rowberg senior specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division 44 us library of congress congressional research service magnetic fusion energy the doe fusion energy sciences program by richard rowberg crs issue brief 91039 washington regularly updated crs34 on novel magnetic confinement configurations funding for the first full year of operation of the national spherical torus experiment was also requested for fy2000 small increases were requested for the doublet iiid and alcator cmod experiments major reduction was requested for engineering research as result of the completion of iter participation and enabling rd issues about 88 of fes funding goes to the three doe weapons labs most of the research is generally independent of the weapons research going on at the labs and the immediate effect of restructuring would seem to be relatively small beyond the possible management questions discussed above for the bes and ber programs the connection between the fes and icf programs however might be significantly complicated by restructuring congress directed doe to undertake major study of its entire fusion research effort with the objective of integrating those activities more effectively while this does not mean putting all fusion research within one program it is likely to mean greater coordination of research planning and more collaborative research projects if the icf program is put in new agency within doe under restructuring such coordination may become more complicated particularly if the greater security focus of the new agency results in additional barriers between the civilian and defense research activities crs35 environmental management45 description and budget does nuclear weapons activities during the past 50 years as well as its non defense nuclear programs have generated large amounts of waste and environmental contamination proper management of that waste and the restoration of the environment at doe sites is the job of the assistant energy secretary for environmental management em the environmental management program is does largest activity with the responsibility for managing several of the departments largest facilities and an fy1999 appropriation of about 623 billion the administrations fy2000 request is 636 billion the environmental management program encompasses four primary activities waste management consisting of the storage treatment and disposal of wide variety of radioactive nonradioactive and mixed waste environmental restoration involving the mitigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater at doe sites safe shutdown and management of surplus doe facilities and the reduction of hazards posed by associated nuclear materials and the development of new technologies to allow doe to achieve its envi ronmental and waste management goals more effectively and at lower cost funding for the em program comes from three major appropriations categories defense doe cleanup activities authorized by the annual defense authorization bill nondefense and the uranium enrichment decontamination and decommissioning fund the enrichment dd fund includes contribution from commercial nuclear reactor owners although does uranium enrichment program was privatized in 1998 the department still owns the enrichment plants and is responsible for their final cleanup when they are permanently closed history throughout world war ii and most of the cold war doe and its predecessor agencies enforced their own requirements for waste management and environmental protection with little outside oversight at least partly because of the urgency of war and the threat posed by the soviet union the environmental effects of the nations nuclear weapons production program were considered relatively low priority radioactive waste often leaked from inadequate storage containers and was routinely discharged directly into soil and surface water 45 prepared by mark holt specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division crs36 the enactment of major federal environmental laws gradually changed does selfregulatory status and by the mid1980s the department was required to accept the jurisdiction of the environmental protection agency epa and state environmental agencies over its facilities doe began negotiating agreements with environmental regulators that established milestones for bringing doe facilities into compliance with federal and state environmental laws does growing environmental commitments led to the 1989 establishment of the environmental management program which was formed by consolidating environmental cleanup and waste management activities from the doe offices of defense programs nuclear energy and energy research the new program grew rapidly from an annual appropriation of 23 billion in fy1990 to 6 billion in fy1994 the explosive funding growth was fueled by environmental pressure and by the end of the cold war the halt in nuclear warhead production resulted in transfers of funding personnel and facilities to the environmental management program congressional concern about does management of the cleanup effort resulted in the transfer of part of the em program to the us army corps of engineers the formerly utilized sites remedial action program fusrap which cleans up old industrial sites that were involved in the nuclear weapons program was transferred to the corps by the fy1998 energy and water development appropriations act conferees on the bill noted that the corps conducts similar activities for the department of defense and the conferees believe there are significant cost and schedule efficiencies to be gained by having the corps manage fusrap as well46 status through 2070 the cost of doe cleanup waste management and related environmental activities could total nearly 150 billion according to does 1998 report on accelerating the cleanup program47 those costs will depend primarily on the extent to which contamination must be removed from doe sites and the efficiency of program management doe has long urged the establishment of flexible cleanup standards based on expected future land use since fy1994 funding for the environmental management program has flattened out and doe has been developing strategies to reduce the total cost of the cleanup effort one of does primary strategic directions is reflected in the 1998 report on accelerating cleanup which establishes goal of completing work at as many sites as possible by 2006 early completion of site cleanups is expected to save billions of dollars in longterm infrastructure and other landlord costs however some environmental groups have expressed concern that such early cleanups may be less complete than previously planned 46 us congress house of representatives conference report making appropriations for energy and water development for the fiscal year ending september 30 1998 and for other purposes report 105271 p 36 47 us department of energy accelerating cleanup paths to closure doeem0362 june 1998 crs37 another doe management strategy is the privatization of much of the departments waste management work under the privatization initiative various waste treatment and processing facilities would be developed by the private sector and doe would pay fee when waste was successfully treated privatization and other contracting initiatives are intended to increase incentives for cost reduction and efficiency in the environmental management program which has been criticized for excessive costs and low productivity issues although much of the activity of the em program is concerned with cleaning up weapons production sites proposed legislation setting up semiautonomous nuclear weapons agency does not include the em program in the new agency as discussed above see p 20 number of states attorneys general have expressed concern that their authority over environmental activities of the new agency would be weakened but it is not clear how or to what extent em programs which would not be transferred would be affected in this way crs38 high energy and nuclear physics48 description the high energy physics hep program supports experimental and theoretical studies of the fundamental structure of matter and energy it operates several large accelerators including the tevatron at fermilab and the linear accelerator at the stanford linear accelerator center slac it also supports theoretical and experimental research at number of universities in the nation major initiative of the hep program is participation in the large hadron collider lhc project at the center for european nuclear research cern in europe the lhc is an expansion of the particle accelerator at cern which would provide substantial increase in its capability making it the largest highenergy accelerator in the world an agreement between doe and cern was reached last year on us participation in the project the budget for the hep program for fy1999 is 6916 million the nuclear physics program np supports research into the structure of the nucleus of the atom and the forces holding the nucleus together it supports theoretical and experimental research at universities and the national laboratories large research facilities within this program include the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility tjnaf in newport news va now in operation and the relativistic heavy ion collider rhic at brookhaven national lab which will be completed this fiscal year the fy1999 budget for np is 3385 million history the general sciences program is the oldest research program funded by doe it is direct descendent of research funded during world war ii in conjunction with the manhattan project since the science underlying the atomic bomb was result of basic research in nuclear and particle physics up to the early 1940s federal authorities responsible for nuclear weapons development believed it essential to continue funding such research in 1946 before the atomic energy commission aec came into being nuclear physics research was funded by the office of naval research in 1947 the aec was established and began to support this research effort the aec quickly became the dominant supporter of nuclear physics research and remained so until its demise in 1974 during that period the research program took on the name high energy physics as recognition of the growing particleenergies that are characteristic of the research in 1974 the energy research and development administration took over funding until 1977 when the department of energy was formed in recent years the program has split into its current components of high energy and nuclear physics status for fy2000 doe requested 6971 million for high energy physics research 08 above fy1999 the highlight of the fy2000 hep program is to be completion 48 prepared by richard rowberg senior specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division crs39 and initial operation of several new facilities increases were requested for initial operation of the fermi main injector and two new detectors at fermilab additional funding was also requested for operation of the new bfactory and associated detector at slac funding requested for the doe contribution to the lhc program would reach 70 million in fy2000 5 million increase over fy1999 the doe nuclear physics research request for fy2000 was 3528 million 13 above fy1999 completion of the rhic resulted in decline of 166 million from fy1999 in construction funds doe requested an increase of 258 million in operating funds for rhic as it starts operation and for the alternating gradient synchrotron which the np program assumes from the hep program doe also requested an increase of 31 million for operation of the tjnaf which is scheduled to operate for 4500 hours in fy2000 in the first version of the budget request to congress doe asked that the bates laboratory at mit cease operations in fy2000 resulting in an 114 million reduction from fy1999 subsequent amendment to the request however restored those funds issues these two programs are likely to be the least affected of any of the doe science programs by restructuring during fy1999 only about 12 of hep and np funding goes to the three labs nearly all of that is nuclear physics research carried on at lanl by the alamos neutron science center using its 800mev proton accelerator that work could be affected by the restructuring the accelerator is also used by the defense programs but it is small fraction of the total doe effort possible concern may arise in connection with the use of doe supercomputer facilities by the two programs currently that work is carried out by the supercomputer facility at lawrence berkeley laboratory the national energy research scientific computing center if that computing activity must be shifted to any extent to the accelerated strategic computer initiative facilities within the defense programs however restructuring could pose problems for the hep and np programs to the degree new security procedures raise barriers to the asci program crs40 nonproliferation and national security office49 description and budget the office of nonproliferation and national security nns was established in 1991 to consolidate does arms control and nonproliferation programs the doe applies expertise derived from developing and managing us nuclear weapons to wide range of arms control and nonproliferation policies these include implementation and enforcement of international treaties such as the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt and legislation such as the atomic energy act of 1954 and the nuclear nonproliferation act of 1978 doe also implements portions of the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction programs in the former soviet union the end of the cold war and consequent nuclear arms control agreements confront doe with new challenges such as dismantling and storing retired nuclear warheads and deciding what to do with excess weapons materials especially plutonium the administrations fy2000 budget request for nns was 84325 million doe retains its longstanding responsibilities in the field of nuclear nonpro liferation the largest account for does nonproliferation activities is its non proliferation and verification rd program this program includes support for treaty verification nuclear export controls international safeguards intelligence and dismantlement assistance to the former soviet countries much of this work is conducted at the national laboratories history of does national security role the does technical capabilities stem from nearly 50 years of developing and managing the us nuclear weapons program soon after world war ii responsibility for the us nuclear stockpile was transferred from the militarys manhattan project to new civilian agency the atomic energy commission aec the aec built tested and maintained nuclear weapons largely through the national laboratories the department of defense retained responsibility for nuclear weapons on active duty congress exercised strong oversight over the aec through its joint committee on atomic energy when it was created in 1977 doe acquired these functions and inherited responsibility for managing the nuclear weapons complex the does expertise in nuclear weapons is not duplicated elsewhere in the government and is directly relevant to nonproliferation policy 49 prepared by zachary s davis specialist in international nuclear policy resources science and industry division crs41 issues in the legislative proposals to create semiautonomous agency within doe that would be responsible for all nuclear weaponsrelated issues in s 1059 nns would become part of the new agency as part of the new agency nns would be subject to new security measures that could affect its programs especially cooperative programs with russia key issues that await resolution include 1 implementation of environment health and safety regulations inside the new agency 2 role of doe field offices 3 effect of reorganization and new security measures on nns programs and lab operations crs42 power marketing administrations50 description and budget does four power marketing administrations pmas developed out of the construction of dams and multipurpose water projects during the 1930s that are operated by the bureau of reclamation and the army corps of engineers the original intention behind these projects was conservation and management of water resources including irrigation flood control recreation and other objectives however many of these facilities generated electricity for project needs the pmas were established to market the excess power they are the bonneville power administration bpa southeastern power administration sepa southwestern power administration swpa and western area power administration wapa the power is sold at wholesale to electric utilities and federal agencies at the lowest possible rates consistent with sound business practice and priority on pma power is extended to preference customers which include municipal utilities coops and other public bodies the pmas do not own the generating facilities but they generally do own transmission facilities except for southeastern the pmas are responsible for covering their expenses and repaying debt and the federal investment in the generating facilities the 104th congress debated sale of the pmas and did in 1995 authorize divestiture of one pma the alaska power administration sale of the remaining pmas has not since been an issue pending decisions yet to be made about the treatment of public power in the broader context of electric utility restructuring bpa receives annual appropriation the administrations request for the other three pmas for fy2000 was 200 million reduction of 158 from the fy1999 appropriation the savings would stem from the administrations proposal that beginning in fy2000 customers of sepa wapa and swpa would be responsible for making their own power purchases and transmission arrangements from any suppliers other than the pma to satisfy their needs under the purchase power and wheeling program ppw the pmas have purchased electricity and transmission capability which is repaid by pma customers to supplement federal generation the premise behind the proposed elimination of the ppw program was that deregulation should make it less expensive and less complicated for pma customers to make these arrangements another possible reason is that the money appropriated to the pmas under ppw is repaid to the treasury rather than to doe this means that the ppw appropriation is fully scored against the caps on discretionary domestic spending with which doe must comply bipartisan groups in both the house and senate have found this feature of the budget request to be controversial 50 prepared by robert l bamberger specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division crs43 federal energy regulatory commission51 description and budget the federal energy regulatory commission created as an independent agency within doe inherited the functions of the former federal power commission regulation of some parts of the natural gas hydropower and electric power industries and the regulation of oil pipeline rates from the interstate commerce commission ferc is essentially independent of doe its fy1999 appropriation was 1675 million all of it to be paid for by user fees following authority granted it in the 1986 omnibus budget reconciliation act for fy2000 the request was 179 million history and status fercs specific activities have evolved since its creation as major changes were legislated especially in the natural gas market and since the 1992 energy policy act in electric power generation in the current development of legislation restructuring the electric power industry proposals to increase fercs role in the partially deregulated market are subject of debate for more details on fercs role in electricity restructuring see the crs electronic briefing book on electric utility restructuring at httpwwwcongressgovbrbkhtmlebeletophtml 51 prepared by carl behrens specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division crs44 civilian nuclear waste management52 description and budget the office of civilian radioactive waste management ocrwm is responsible for the disposal of highly radioactive waste from commercial nuclear reactors and defense nuclear facilities under the nuclear waste policy act nwpa as amended ocrwm must investigate the suitability of yucca mountain in nevada for permanent underground nuclear waste repository and is authorized to develop waste transportation systems if the site is suitable doe can build and operate repository at yucca mountain upon receiving license from the nuclear regulatory commission nrc funding for the program is provided primarily by fee of onetenth of cent per kilowatthour of nuclear electricity generated in the united states revenues from the fee are held in the nuclear waste fund doe cannot spend money from the fund without annual appropriations by congress ocrwm also receives appropriations from general revenues to pay for disposal of highly radioactive defense waste fy1999 funding for the program totaled 357 million and the administration is seeking 370 million in fy2000 plus the release of an additional 39 million in previously appropriated funds according to doe the requested funding level would allow the department to remain on schedule for studying the proposed national disposal site at nevadas yucca mountain does schedule calls for an environmental impact statement for the disposal facility to be completed in 2000 and if the site is found suitable an application for construction permit to be submitted to the nuclear regulatory commission by 2002 waste disposal could begin by 2010 according to the department history highly radioactive longlived nuclear waste has been accumulating since the beginning of nuclear weapons production in the 1940s most of that military high level radioactive waste consists of liquids remaining from the chemical extraction of plutonium and uranium from material that had been irradiated in government nuclear reactors when fullscale commercial nuclear power plants began operating in the 1960s the developers of the new industry anticipated that commercial spent fuel would be similarly reprocessed to extract plutonium and uranium for new reactor fuel because of concerns about the weapons use of plutonium and diminishing economic prospects however commercial spent fuel reprocessing never took place on significant scale in the united states as result spent nuclear fuel is being stored at power plant sites pending disposal liquid highlevel waste from defense 52 prepared by mark holt specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division crs45 related reprocessing is stored in tanks and bins at four doe sites special treatment plants will have to be constructed at each site to solidify the waste for transportation and disposal methods for disposing of highly radioactive waste have been studied by doe and its predecessor agencies since the early 1950s including disposal in abandoned salt mines subseabed burial and launching into space in 1970 the atomic energy commission aec issued policy calling for the federal government to develop an underground highlevel waste repository and charge fee for disposal salt mine near lyons kansas was selected as the first repository site but the location quickly proved technically unsuitable numerous other sites were studied during the 1970s but little progress was made toward opening repository spent nuclear fuel began filling the storage pools at reactor sites and nuclear utilities called for federal action to solve the problem in response congress enacted the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 nwpa pl 97425 which required doe to intensively investigate three candidate sites for the nations first highlevel nuclear waste repository one of the sites was to be submitted to nrc for licensing with disposal operations scheduled to begin by 1998 utilities were required to sign disposal contracts with doe and pay fee into the newly established nuclear waste fund ocrwm was established to run the program after much controversy over does implementation of nwpa the act was substantially modified by the nuclear waste policy amendments act of 1987 title iv subtitle of pl 100203 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 under the amendments the only candidate site doe may consider for permanent highlevel waste repository is at yucca mountain nevada if that site proves unsuitable doe must return to congress for further instructions status despite the congressional mandate in 1987 progress on the proposed yucca mountain repository has fallen behind schedule doe delayed the scheduled opening of the repository to 2003 and then to 2010 date considered optimistic by many nuclear utilities which have paid more than 9 billion into the nuclear waste fund have strenuously complained about does failure to begin taking their spent fuel by nwpas 1998 deadline because of the repository delays many nuclear power plants are expected to require additional onsite storage capacity typically consisting of metal or concrete casks owners of permanently shutdown reactors contend that does failure to remove spent fuel from the closed plant sites is forcing them to bear indefinite longterm storage costs legislation has been considered in the past three congresses to establish an interim storage facility at yucca mountain that could begin receiving spent fuel more quickly than the planned permanent repository however the proposal has been blocked by presidential veto threats in response to utility lawsuits doe has offered to take ownership of waste at reactor sites and pay the costs of onsite storage but agreement has been reached crs46 fossil energy research and development53 description and budget does fossil energy research program is intended to develop new technologies for extracting and using coal oil natural gas and other fossil fuels the types of technologies under development include ultrahigh efficiency coal combustion systems new methods for producing liquid fuels from coal and improved oil and gas production techniques appropriations for fossil energy programs totaled 384 million in fy1999 and the administration requested 364 million for fy2000 history research on coal technologies was conducted by the department of the interior until congress transferred those activities to the newly established energy research and development administration erda in 1974 at the same time the scope of fossil energy research was greatly expanded by the federal nonnuclear research and development act of 1974 pl 93577 which also authorized major erda research efforts into renewable energy sources and other nonnuclear energy technologies those programs were transferred to doe upon its establishment in 1977 because of the disruption of oil supplies during the 1970s the federal fossil energy research program at that time focused largely on technologies to produce liquid fuels from coal and other solids such as oil shale number of large demonstration projects were planned under the authority of the nonnuclear act perceived need to speed the commercial availability of alternative liquid fuels led to the establishment of the synthetic fuels corporation sfc in 1980 by the energy security act pl 96294 sfc was authorized to provide loan guarantees price supports and other assistance to private synthetic fuels ventures under the reagan administration federal support for fossil fuels technology demonstration and commercialization was greatly reduced and several large doe projects were canceled falling oil prices reduced the commercial viability of projects supported by sfc prompting most private firms to abandon the pursuit of synthetic fuels in late 1985 congress abolished sfc but transferred 400 million of its authorized funding to the new clean coal technology reserve the initial funding source for the clean coal technology program status environmental issues particularly global climate change concerns have increasingly driven the budget priorities for does fossil fuels research program in recent years an emerging research area for the program is carbon sequestration 53 prepared by mark holt specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division crs47 including wide range of technologies for the physical chemical and biological removal of carbon from the atmosphere the shift in focus to natural gas is based on the current outlook for fossil fuel availability and current prices as well as environmental advantage versus coal or petroleum critics question the extent to which fossil fuel rd should be based on current trends and natural gas viewed as transition fuel to nonfossil fuels crs48 the naval petroleum reserves54 description and budget the national defense authorization act for fy1996 pl 104106 authorized sale of the naval petroleum reserve npr oil field at elk hills on february 5 1998 occidental petroleum corporation took title to elk hills and wired 365 billion to the us treasury in anticipation of operating elk hills for only part of 1998 the administration had requested 117 million for fy1998 and congress approved 107 million pl 104106 also transferred most of two naval oil shale reserves to the department of the interior doi doe expects to spend 212 million during fy2000 from prior year funds and sought new appropriation for the reserves operated by doi history the naval petroleum and oil shale reserves were established in the early 1900s to assure availability of oil fuels for the navy which was converting its vessels from coal to oil prior to world war i there was some production from the npr during the 1920s world war ii and the 1950s but the reserves had been essentially shut in for more than decade when the arab oil embargo was imposed in 1973 the embargo spurred some reassessment of npr policy and in 1976 congress enacted the naval petroleum reserves production act pl 94258 the act ordered production from the fields at maximum efficient rate mer and provided that npr oil would be sold into the us market the bush and reagan administrations proposed that the us divest itself of the npr both for budgetary reasons and on the grounds that it was inappropriate for the federal government to be in the oil business the clinton administration and congress agreed legislative authorization for the sale was enacted in february 1996 54 prepared by robert l bamberger specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division crs49 energy efficiency55 description does energy efficiency rd programs encompass broad array of technology development activities rd partnerships with industry and longterm research objectives that span all major sectors and enduses including buildings industry transportation and utilities program spending has been controversial the passage of the energy policy act of 1992 epact pl 102486 and priority commitment to energy efficiency by the clinton administration had raised the spending levels for fy1994 and fy1995 but congress trimmed the administrations fy1996 request from 890 million to 537 million the fy1999 appropriation was 692 million the fy2000 request was 836 million history in april 1973 president nixon created an office of energy conservation at the department of the interior doi to coordinate the energy conservation programs of the federal government in december 1973 the federal power commission reported that federal research related to energy conservation represented less than 1 of all energyrelated federal rd programs which stood at 731 million in fy1973 on may 7 1974 congress enacted the federal energy administration fea act pl 93275 which transferred the functions of dois office of energy conservation to the new feas office of energy conservation and environment this included various regulatory functions as well as promoting efficiencies in the use of energy resources in october 1974 president ford signed the energy reorganization act which created an office for energy conservation as part of the new energy research and development administration erda erda included conservation as an afterthought but the 1976 national energy plan elevated it to the highest national priority matching that for energy supply options erda conservation functions were transferred along with others when doe was established in 1977 the mandate for conservation was broadened to include maximum possible measures in federal agencies highest priority for comprehensive energy conservation strategy and optimal development of programs in 1995 dollars conservation rd funding grew steadily from 5 million in fy1974 until spending peaked in fy1979 at 682 million funding plunged to 137 million by fy1982 then climbed gradually to 240 million in fy1991 it then increased sharply reaching recent peak of 441 million for fy1995 from the early shortterm focus on voluntary and regulatory measures the program has broadened to include wide range of technology development and industry partnerships such as hydrogenpowered fuel cell vehicles and the partnership for new generation of vehicles pngv growing number of environmental laws such as the clean air act and international treaties such as the framework convention on climate 55 prepared by fred j sissine specialist in energy science technology and policy resources science and industry division crs50 change rely on energy efficiency measures as key part of pollution prevention strategies current status by far the largest conservation rd effort is focused on transportation particularly the development of electric and hybrid vehicles and the production of alternative fuels to combat oil import vulnerability and air pollution problems the bulk of industrial rd programs are aimed at reusing waste heat and minimizing energy and materials use to support energy productivity competitiveness and environmental goals the buildings rd programs emphasize technology development for building construction and enduse equipment to support energy productivity and environmental goals crs51 the strategic petroleum reserve56 description and budget the strategic petroleum reserve was authorized in late 1975 by the energy policy and conservation act pl 94163 to create stockpile of crude oil that could be sold into us markets in the event of disruption in imported supply oil being such vital commodity to the us economy there were parallel hopes that an spr of ample inventory would discourage the use of oil as political weapon and that its sale during an interruption would blunt rises in the price of oil purchases of oil for the spr were suspended beginning in fy1995 spending priorities shifted to replacing or upgrading equipment and infrastructure that is nearing the end of its useful life after funding the strategic petroleum reserve program from sales of spr oil in fy1997 and fy1998 the 105th congress approved conventional appropriation of 1601 million for the program in fy1999 this followed the cancellation of another authorized sale in all roughly 28 million barrels of spr oil were previously sold to finance maintenance and upgrade of spr facilities the administration requested 164 million for fy2000 slight increase over fy1999 to support operations maintenance and security history fill of the spr was initiated in 1978 but acquisition of oil for it has followed peripatetic course oil purchases were suspended to ease buying pressures on oil markets after the shah of iran was deposed congress insisted that fill be resumed at minimum of 100000 bd in the energy security act pl 96294 during the earliest years of the reagan administration the fill rate approached 300000 bd but had declined to roughly onetenth that rate by the early 1990s the priority of the spr declined during the 1990s as number of developments intersected 1 consensus to cut federal spending 2 declining likelihood of crippling oil supply interruptions 3 unregulated oil markets which appear to operate efficiently and effectively in allocating and pricing oil 4 developing consensus that at nearly 600 million barrels the spr is probably an adequate level of insurance and 5 that the costbenefits tradeoff were seen not to justify financing additional fill under present market and world conditions there were also plans at one time to expand the spr beyond its current capacity of 750 million barrels but there is interest in doing so at this time 56 prepared by robert l bamberger specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division crs52 energy information administration57 description and budget the energy information administration semiindependent agency of the department of energy collects and analyzes data on all forms of energy production and consumption in the united states and to lesser extent worldwide in fy1999 705 million was appropriated for eia the fy2000 request was 726 million history although some government energy data collection especially in electric power and natural gas has long history the 1973 oil crisis stimulated major effort to extend and consolidate information about energy and especially about petroleum the 1974 federal energy administration fea act gave the administrator of the new agency authority to gather information from energy producing and consuming firms and the 1976 energy conservation and production act created an office of energy information and analysis oeia within fea in 1977 the doe organization act established eia as the single government authority for energy information and gave it independence from doe regarding data collection and from the whole of government respecting the content of its reports it also transferred all the mandates from oeia as well as electric power and natural gas information from the federal power commission the consolidation of all these functions and the high policy profile of energy issues and legislation in the years following does formation caused major expansion in eias budget which reached 116 million in fy1981 also uncovered were some difficulties one problem was the contrast between data collected for statistical policy guidance and that collected for regulatory purposes in regulation of which there was major increase following passage of the many energy statutes of the 1970s the need is for information on individuals and firms most statistical series on the other hand depend on sampling and aggregating data and often seek to suppress individual data to protect privacy and encourage cooperation another problem lay in guaranteeing the reliability of the data statutory insistence on eias independence gained support from suspicions that earlier agencies had been influenced by administration policy makers however as long as energy issues remained active and emotional the agencys products were questioned when they did not support one position or another third difficulty arose from eias independence which tended to isolate its output from that of other agencies leading to some difficulty in compatibility and comparison 57 prepared by carl behrens specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division crs53 current status the decline in energy regulatory policies and statutes has reduced eias burden significantly and the lack of an energy crisis after the early 1980s lessened the concern with eias impartiality while allowing it to extend the time line of its historical data series many of which had been started only after the 1973 oil embargo when the 1990 gulf war stimulated legislative interest in energy again the resulting energy policy act of 1992 merely added number of new data series such as energy consumption alternative fuels and greenhouse gas emissions to eias mandate despite the lessened urgency of demand for energy data however eia continues with smaller budget to collect and analyze massive amount of energy related information using 75 different datacollection forms it produces two weekly seven monthly three quarterly and 38 annual data series publications in addition to many onetime studies and publications it also maintains and operates 51 computer models to help it project and analyze energy production and use for other versions of this document see
