resources science and industry division ship navigation in harbors safety issues summary on november 7 2007 container ship collided with tower of the san franciscooakland bay bridge spilling 58000 gallons of the ships bunker fuel into the bay the incident has raised questions about the role of maritime pilots and vessel traffic services vtss in preventing accidents in us harbors such as is there need for further independent oversight of pilot performance could vtss operate more like air traffic control centers should the pilot and ship captain be required to agree on passage plan before transiting harbor because of the additional challenges of navigating large ships through the constricted waters of harbor most us ports require shipping lines to hire maritime pilot maritime pilots through lengthy apprenticeship process and many years of experience have gained intimate knowledge of the navigational requirements of particular harbor despite the federal governments prominent role in regulating interstate commerce congress has largely left it to the various coastal states to regulate pilotage pilots are licensed by the state for ships engaged in foreign trade registered vessels carrying international cargo which accounts for the vast majority of port calls typically state pilot board oversees the hiring training and performance of pilots as well as setting pilotage rates charged to the shipping lines the us coast guard has jurisdiction only over pilots of ships engaged in domestic trade and the courts have ruled that the coast guard does not have the authority to suspend or revoke the license of pilots for violations while piloting foreigntrade ship to assist pilots the busiest us ports have established vts stations to monitor ship traffic and provide relevant information to pilots such as the location of other ships while often compared to an air traffic control tower vts is not directly involved in the movement of vessels and is more accurately described as an advisory service than traffic control center everlarger ships difficult or challenging slowspeed handling characteristics of some of these ships and rising port traffic that is predominantly foreignflagged have led to proposals concerning pilotage vtss and other safetyrelated navigation services in us ports given the federal interest in marine environmental protection and the coast guards mission to ensure the safety of shipping in us waters some experts have advocated stronger federal oversight of pilots they recommend that the coast guard or national commission establish national standards for pilot training and proficiency or that the coast guard be given disciplinary authority over statelicensed pilots state pilots resist greater federal oversight arguing that the unique geography and navigational requirements of each port justifies local oversight whether vtss should exert more direct control over vessel movement is also raised as safety measure but most acknowledge that an experienced onboard mariner is probably in the best position to direct vessels movement requiring that pilot and ship captain first agree on harbor passage plan investigating language

introduction on november 7 2007 at about 830 am the container ship cosco busan sideswiped one of the towers of the san franciscooakland bay bridge ripping 100foot by 12foot gash into the side of the hull and releasing over 50000 gallons of the ships bunker fuel into the bay throughout the morning and at the time of the accident there was heavy patchy fog and the pilot had delayed the ships departure from the oakland pier by 90 minutes because of the fog1 about three minutes before the accident but apparently too late to avoid the collision the san francisco vessel traffic service vts which monitors harbor traffic contacted the ships pilot the vts told him that he was running parallel to the bridge and inquired whether his intended course was still to pass beneath the delta and echo spans of the bridge as he had informed vts earlier although several investigations are pending the suspected cause of the accident is pilot error2 considering the number of ships transiting us harbors everyday accidents are rare this is largely the result of the skill and expertise of pilots and the navigation support services they receive from vtss when accidents occur the public impact of the oil or fuel spilled can be large as the cosco busan accident demonstrated as result of tanker safety improvements implemented in the wake of the 1989 exxon valdez spill the amount of oil spilled by oil tankers has been declining significantly and is now approaching the amount of oil spilled by nontank vessels3 according to the coast guard the cosco busan has fuel capacity of 52000 barrels4 larger than the fuel capacity of the majority of oceangoing nontank vessels calling at us ports which have fuel capacity between 10000 and 20000 barrels 1 this account of the accident is based on the statement of admiral craig bone 11th district commander us coast guard in hearing before the house committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on coast guard and maritime transportation november 19 2007 the us coast guard the national transportation safety board ntsb and the dhs inspector general are investigating the accident which will provide more details into the causes of the accident and will likely make recommendations for preventing this type of accident in the future 2 the san francisco bay pilot commission has suspended the pilots state license pending hearing and the coast guard has requested that the pilot voluntarily turn in his federal license which he has done 3 see figure 2 in crs report rl33705 oil spills in us coastal waters background governance and issues for congress by jonathan l ramseur 4 one barrel is equal to 42 gallons crs2 however 360 vessels calling us ports have fuel capacity over 50000 barrels and 100 vessels have fuel capacity over 70000 barrels5 while the fuel oil carried by nontank vessels is relatively small fraction of the oil carried as cargo in tankers it is still of sufficient quantity to cause an environmental catastrophe and significant economic loss if spilled much attention has focused on the timeliness of the coast guards response to the cosco busan spill but the accident has also raised questions about oversight of pilot proficiency and the role of vtss in harbor navigation congress has thus far held three hearings on the accident and has introduced legislation in reaction to the accident other preexisting legislation related to ship navigation is pending see the last section of this report important policy questions for congress include whether there is need for further independent oversight of pilot performance whether vtss should operate more like air traffic control centers and whether the pilot and ship captain should be required to agree on passage plan before transiting harbor everlarger ships difficult or challenging slowspeed handling characteristics of some of these ships and rising port traffic that is increasingly foreignflagged may be cause for review of pilotage vessel traffic services and other safetyrelated navigation services in us ports this report describes the role of pilots and vtss in the safe navigation of ships in us harbors and reviews the controversy over the governance of pilot associations the appropriate level of interaction between the vts and pilot and other proposals for improving the safety of harbor navigation the reports focus is on the prevention of ship collisions and groundings in harbors and thus does not discuss oil spill response and cleanup6 this report also does not discuss the legal liabilities of carriers and mariners in ship accidents background peculiarities of harbor navigation the skill and knowledge required to navigate ship in harbor versus at sea is significantly different most ship collisions allisions7 and groundings occur in harbors because that is where navigation becomes constricted by land shallow water other vessels and manmade structures like jetties bridges and piers tide and river currents are also an important factor in harbors but not at sea ships response to the water displacement of passing vessel channels bank and minimal underkeel clearance are hydrodynamics peculiar to harbors constricted waters fully loaded ship moving at typical harbor speed in channel with following tide may 5 statement of admiral thad allen commandant us coast guard

traffic and ships carrying especially dangerous cargo have put premium on the skill and knowledge of todays harbor pilots in 2005 oceangoing vessels over 10000 deadweight tonnage dwt made over 61000 us port calls or an average of 167 per day from 2001 to 2006 container ship calls at us ports increased by 14 while the average size of containerships increased by 258 the cosco busan with capacity of 5500 teus9 is member of the fifth generation of container ships built between 2000 and 2005 the ship is over 130 feet wide and just over three football fields long 901 feet from 2001 to 2006 port calls by smaller container ships those with less than 4000 teu capacity decreased by 15 while port calls by large container ships like the cosco busan or bigger those with more than 5000 teu capacity increased by 241 unlike the largest oil tankers which load and unload their cargo at offshore pipelines or transfer their cargo to lightering ships at the harbors entrance container and other types of ships must transit the harbor to load and unload ships carrying cargo that can be especially dangerous or damaging to the environment have also increased in number from 2001 to 2005 liquefied natural gas lng and liquefied petroleum gas lpg carrier calls increased by 31 and tanker calls increased by nearly 1010 because of boom in shipping in recent years especially in the dry bulk sector there is also concern that older ships that otherwise would have been sent to the scrap yard are still plying the seas and picking up dry bulk cargo at ports like those along the lower mississippi river which is load center for bulk cargoes11 according to one observer many ships transiting us harbors may simply be too big for their ditches12 in other words they exceed the size that the shipping channel was originally designed for while ships are designed and built for particular route over the life of ship lasting from 20 to 25 years markets change and ships end up calling other ports13 often shipping channels are deepened rather than widened which some argue is an indication that economics ship productivity motivates dredging more than safety concerns14 in other words it is argued that 8 maritime

houston ship channel full scale maneuvering trials marine technology vol 42 1 january 2005 p 1120 14 channel design and vessel maneuverability next steps marine technology vol 40 continued crs4 efforts are made to accommodate ship displacement but not maneuverability for example when two ships pass each other in opposite directions at certain segment in the houston ship channel they perform maneuver called texas chicken because the two ships pass so close to one another that they use the displacement from the other vessel for the extra water they need to avoid grounding on the edges of the channel certain concrete structure in the port of long beach is referred to as the can opener because of the risk it poses to ships transiting the harbor15 slowspeed handling characteristics in addition to their sheer size the biggest ships can have some handling characteristics that pilots need to compensate for when maneuvering them in constricted waters16 deepsea speed is given higher design priority than shallow and restricted water maneuverability in the design of cargo ships for example high powered engines designed to achieve faster deepsea cruising speeds can have minimum bare steerage speed of about eight knots which is relatively high speed in constricted waters in contrast deepsea speed is less important for cruise ships and they exhibit better slowspeed maneuverability as ships are getting bigger the relative size of their rudders is getting smaller not problem at sea but it does have an adverse impact on controllability at slower speeds in narrow channels and in shallow water ships with higher profile like car carriers container ships when fully stacked with containers on deck and cruise ships are much more susceptible than other ships to the influences of cross winds during slow speed maneuvering maritime pilotage maritime pilots are hired by ocean carriers to take command of the navigation of their ships through harbors they are navigational specialists for particular harbor they board ships at the entrance to harbor with use of pilot boat17 or in rare cases helicopter and take position at the bridge alongside the master of the vessel or the officer in charge of the watch and other bridge crew using hisher experience and intimate knowledge of the navigation through particular harbor the pilot will order instructions to the helmsmen to steer the ship through the harbor and may direct tugboats if they are assisting while the pilot is in command of the navigation of the ship through the harbor the captain of the ship remains in command of the ship and retains ultimate responsibility for its safe passage only under emergency situations is captain likely to countermand the pilots orders often the pilot will board the ship with computer laptop or other handheld device 14 continued 2 april 2003 15 giants of the sea massive new container ships carry huge loads but docking them is problematic for pilots wall street journal

moving and especially in conditions of heavy seas cold water or sea spray ice is extremely dangerous most pilots know of another pilot that lost their life while boarding crs5 that contains hisher own set of charts for that harbor as well as ship tracking technology the laptop may also be plugged into the ships navigation console to incorporate the ships navigation technology into the pilots navigation software when the pilot boards the ship the captain is required to inform the pilot about the navigation particulars of the ship such as the draft air draft highest point on the vessel and maneuvering characteristics pilot card is used for this purpose although english is the required language of international shipping language can be barrier to expansive communication between the pilot and captain pilotage requirements vary among us ports most us ports require that ship hire pilot that is it is compulsory in some ports hiring pilot may be voluntary in these cases if ship captain regularly calls at port and is confident that heshe can navigate the ship through the harbor the captain may elect not to hire pilot but the shipping line will still be charged either the full pilotage fee or some portion thereof for liability reasons many shipping lines will take on pilot even if not compulsory on the west and gulf coasts the pilot usually navigates the ship from the harbor entrance to the dock and vice versa but on the east coast some ports require docking pilot to takeover from the pilot when docking the ship docking pilots are usually former tugboat captains and are not members of the local pilot association in louisiana in addition to hiring harbor pilot shipping lines may also be required to hire one or two river pilots depending on how far up the mississippi river the ship is transiting to call at the port of baton rouge or south louisiana especially large ships may be required to hire two pilots or full pilot and an assist pilot pilot training pilot may be graduate of maritime academy with sea experience if pilot has little sea experience heshe may begin with an apprenticeship under the supervision of senior pilot lasting several years eventually an apprentice pilot will have to pass written exam that includes among other things drawing the chart for the harbor in every detail by memory new pilot will begin solo piloting on smaller vessels and will typically have to have piloted minimum number of ships in each size range before advancing as explained below there are pilots who hold state licenses and those that hold federal licenses or endorsements the requirements for obtaining state license vary from port to port but states generally require that an applicant hold federal pilots license as minimum requirement obtaining state pilot license generally requires more handson experience than obtaining federal pilot license state pilot associations maritime pilot typically works as an independent contractor in pilots association at given port the association takes care of administrative functions for the pilots such as dispatching pilots to vessels maintaining pilot boats and billing and collecting pilotage fees pilots are assigned to ships on rotating basis and the shipping line has choice in the selection of the pilot pilot associations are regulated by state board of commissioners or in some cases by city government18 typically pilot board is comprised of three to ten 18 at the port of angeles pilots are city employees overseen by the port at the port continued crs6 members who serve parttime representation on the board must consist of specific ratio of pilots members of the broader maritime industry in the port area and members of the public not connected with the maritime industry the pilot board is responsible for ensuring the qualifications of the pilots setting pilotage fees charged to the vessel operators and reviewing the performance of pilots pilotage fees are based on the draft andor tonnage of the vessel and in some cases the distance piloted pilots do not work in competitive environment and pilot associations are effectively local or regional monopolies the pilot association only selects enough member pilots to service the traffic at hand state and local pilot associations only have jurisdiction over the pilotage of ships in the foreign trade that is ships carrying international cargo19 federal pilots the federal government has jurisdiction over the pilotage of ships in the domestic trade for example tank vessel carrying oil from alaska to california20 typically sea captain engaged in the domestic trade will carry coast guard pilots endorsement on hisher captains license and therefore will not need to hire pilot upon entrance to harbor but rather has the authority to pilot the vessel in that harbor this type of federal pilot authorization is the most common there are also few independent federal pilots that are not employed by coastwise shipping line but offer their piloting service at the particular port for which they are licensed like the state pilot license the federal pilot license pertains to specific port therefore the ship captain must obtain pilot license for each port that heshe expects to call on routine basis generally all state and local pilots licensed to pilot foreign trade vessels also hold federal license to pilot ships in the domestic trade as mentioned above most state and local pilot associations require federal pilots license as minimum requirement for being allowed to work towards state pilots license the federal government will grant federal pilots license to anyone that qualifies unlike the states that limit the granting of licenses based on their perceived need for pilot services dual oversight significantly the coast guard cannot suspend or revoke the license of pilot for misconduct while he or she is piloting foreign trade vessel the courts have ruled that the pilot in this instance is acting solely under the authority of state license21 conversely state cannot do the same to pilot while piloting vessel in the domestic trade because the courts have ruled that in this instance the 18 continued of long beach one private company provides pilotage services in an exclusive contract with the port 19 statutorily ships engaged in the foreign trade are referred to as registered vessels 20 ships engaged in the domestic trade aka coastwise trade are statutorily referred to as enrolled vessels 21 alex l parks and edward v cattell jr the law of tug tow and pilotage 3rd ed cornell maritime press centreville maryland p 997 see soriano v united states 494 f2d 681 1974 amc 283 9th cir 1974 and dietz v siler 414 f supp 1105 ed 1976 crs7 pilot is acting solely under the authority of hisher federal license22 however the coast guard does have the authority 46 usc 2302 to levy civil penalty of up to 25000 against person who operates vessel in negligent manner and charge person operating vessel in grossly negligent manner with class misdemeanor the dual regulatory structure of piloting dates back to the mid1800s as ports in colonial america began to develop the colonies instituted their own pilotage requirements as pilotage was longestablished tradition in europe in 1789 the first congress allowed the states to continue to govern pilotage practices until further legislative provision shall be made by congress23 it was not until the mid 1800s after the introduction of steam vessels that congress began to play role in pilotage in 1871 congress enacted law that required steam powered ships in the coastal trade to have federally licensed pilots and preventing the states from requiring state pilots for these ships24 1912 us supreme court decision affirmed that federal jurisdiction over pilotage pertains only to ships engaged in the domestic trade while the pilotage of ships engaged in the foreign trade fell to state jurisdiction until congress decided otherwise25 this bifurcated regulatory structure continues today the bifurcated nature of pilot oversight is product of legislative history and questions have been raised why oversight is not purely based on safety considerations whether ship is carrying domestic or international cargo is not factor in safe harbor navigation the ntsb questions how the coast guard can adequately perform its safety mission without direct oversight over the pilotage of the vast majority of vessel transits in us harbors moreover with the current trend of substituting oil from alaska which accounts for most us coastal shipping with imported oil further diminution of us coastal shipping seems probable26 on the other hand one could argue that captains of coastwise trade vessels are deployed on voyages of much shorter duration than international voyages are likely to call at limited number of us ports more frequently and therefore can gain the expertise and knowledge of navigation necessary for safe transit in those ports in contrast sea captains on international voyages it is argued do not gain the same level of harbor expertise and knowledge because of much longer voyages and potential assignment to voyages with different port callings it is also argued by state pilot associations that because the geography and the nature of maritime traffic varies tremendously among ports it is best left to each individual port to decide the level of pilot expertise and performance required to ensure safe harbor navigation 22 see baggett v department of professional regulation board of pilot commissioners 1984 amc 1259 717 f2d 521 11th cir 1983 23 section 4 of the lighthouse act of august 7 1789 1 stat 54 crowley p 173 24 act of february 28 1871 16 stat 440 25 anderson v pacific coast steamship company 225 us 187 1912 26 in the last halfdecade us foreign waterborne trade increased by nearly 17 while coastwise and great lakes shipping declined by 4 crs8 state pilot associations are regulated monopolies with handful of exceptions most ports have just one pilot association servicing that port however there is generally nothing in state laws prohibiting competing pilot association from forming it was only during the sailing era that competition among pilots in harbor was the norm pilot associations defend their monopoly status as being necessary to prevent commercial interests from trumping safety they contend that in competitive environment economic pressures from the shipping lines would inevitably undermine their safety prerogative also pilot associations argue that if they granted licenses to all those who applied and met the requirements pilots would not obtain an adequate number of transits to maintain their expertise in given harbor how an apprenticeship training program would function if senior pilots knew that their trainees would soon be competing against them is also concern state licensed pilots further contend that it is important that the pilot be an independent contractor not member of the crew employed by the ship operator as is typically the case with federal pilots it is argued that an independent contractor status insulates the pilot from cost pressures that could otherwise cloud the pilots judgement the state pilot system has been criticized for being relatively closed profession and claims of nepotism have been directed at some pilot associations27 study by the marine board of the national academies noted that28 pilots generally have been reluctant to address colleague performance because of social and business relationships potential loss of earning for affected individuals and especially concern that any form of oversight might expose them to liability for colleagues performance the integrity and credibility of pilot oversight was highlighted by 1986 ship and barge collision on the mississippi river in louisiana the ntsb found that the pilot of the ship may have caused or contributed to five of six accidents in the previous five years but the pilot commission and the pilot performance review panel both of whose membership was comprised entirely of pilots had not taken any disciplinary action against the pilot29 since that accident louisiana has amended its piloting regulations to include nonpilots on pilot boards other states have generally done the same and some states do not allow any pilots to be on the board however criticism of the monopoly structure of the pilot system in louisiana continues30 and the cosco busan accident has raised this criticism 27 see for instance river pilot reform

regarding the monopoly structure of pilotage ship operators are concerned with the level of pilotage fees they pay likewise port authorities and other maritime service providers in port are concerned that the level of pilotage fees may drive business away from their port32 thus in addition to navigation safety port economics continues to drive debate over pilot governance vessel traffic services to assist the pilot and crew with safe navigation the coast guard has established vessel traffic services vts in many ports from the vts coast guard watchstanders can monitor and provide guidance to harbor traffic with the use of electronic communication radio radar differential global positioning system dgps33 surveillance cameras and binoculars vts operates 24 hours day seven days week vtss vary depending on the geography and the nature and volume of vessel traffic in port area but vtss generally are staffed with both uniformed and civilian coast guard watchstanders currently there are vtss in eleven us ports staffed by 155 civilian and 130 activeduty personnel the coast guard estimates that about 43 activeduty watchstanders will transfer in and out of vtss annually34 vtss may also be staffed by members of maritime exchange from which they have evolved us ports without coast guardled vts have maritime exchange that provides vtslike services and are more accurately called vessel traffic information services vtis maritime exchange may be jointly operated or run by pilot association and be staffed by pilots vtss and vtiss are funded from some combination of user fees charged to

captains to avoid collisions and groundings participation was initially voluntary and unregulated and there were protocols however after ship collision in san francisco bay in 1971 congress passed the ports and waterways safety act of 1972 pl 92340 which directed the coast guard to establish vts systems at ports where the coast guard deemed necessary36 in the 1970s vtss were established in san francisco puget sound new york new orleans and houstongalveston vtss were added in morgan city port arthur louisville valdez angeles and sault st marie thereafter the oil pollution act of 1990 passed in response to the exxon valdez oil spill made participation in the vts mandatory where they existed safety and security as result of the september 11 2001 terrorist attack and the heightened concern for port security harbor traffic monitoring and ship tracking has received boost in federal attention and funding the maritime transportation security act of 2002 pl 107295 requires ships over 300 gross registered tons grt to be equipped with automatic identification system ais transponders which electronically transmit ship information location speed and direction ais data can be transmitted shiptoship or between ships and shoreside vtss or maritime exchanges for security reasons the coast guard is planning to extend shoreside ais receivers and transmitters nationwide but currently this technology is fully operational at just several major us ports ais was introduced into the shipping industry as safety measure prior to 911 to some extent it allows for the replacement of voice radio communications with electronic communication which is regarded as more efficient less distracting to the mariner and less errorinducing medium for data transmission some vessel collisions have been caused in part because pilot was communicating by radio with more than one other vessel and mistook communication from one vessel for another it is highly desirable that vts communications to the pilot or master be as nonintrusive on the mariner as possible for instance in the cosco busan accident when the coast guard was asked why the vts watchstander had not alerted the pilot earlier or repeatedly the coast guard replied that vts personnel are trained not to distract the pilot with interruptions during any critical maneuver37 with the introduction of ais there was some speculation and debate that ship could determine its location without the need for navigation buoys and determine the location of other ships without the need for shoreside vts however now that ship tracking and monitoring has become security objective shoreside communication and tracking facilities are viewed as necessary component 35 vessel traffic service angeleslong beach harbor report to the vts

and coordinate response when the need arises the coast guard is planning to colocate jhocs and vtss jhocs are currently operational at norfolk san diego charleston and seattle and the coast guard plans to create jhoc at each major port area issues for congress given the trend towards larger ships an expected increase in port traffic and probable lag in the expansion of shipping channels and terminal facilities due to fiscal and environmental constraints congress may consider several issues related to the safety of harbor navigation oversight of pilot performance in response to the exxon valdez oil spill congress required that all pilots commanding ships in prince william sound be operating under the authority of their alaska pilot license in addition to their federal license38 this created system of dual accountability to the state of alaska and to the us coast guard the national transportation safety board ntsb has recommended that all state pilots be required to operate under coast guard authority to address lack of adequate consistent accountability of state pilots39 under this requirement statelicensed pilot would not be allowed to pilot either foreign trade vessel or domestic trade vessel if hisher federal license was revoked the ntsb contends that the consequences of major marine accident particularly in terms of environmental damage cannot be considered merely local in effect and therefore federal oversight of pilot performance is appropriate the ntsb has also stated that the near total immunity from federal control enjoyed by state pilots prevents the coast guard from carrying out its congressional mandate to ensure safety on all federal waterways40 however past congresses have not favored granting the coast guard additional legislative authority over statelicensed pilots the coast guards response to 1988 ntsb recommendation regarding this matter states as follows41 the coast guard 38 section 4116a2 of the oil pollution act of 1990 pl 101380 39 ntsb safety recommendation addressed to admiral j william kime commandant us coast guard october 21 1991 p 6 40 ntsb marine accident report collision between the hong kong flag bulk carrier petersfield and the us towboat bayou boeuf and tow new orleans louisiana october 28 1986 ntsbmar8801 p 51 41 coast guard reply dated july 13 1988 excerpt quoted in ntsb safety recommendation continued crs12 concurs with the intent of this recommendation and recognizes the need for establishing better disciplinary control over some statelicensed pilots however past coast guard efforts to obtain the recommended authority have not been successful in congress the coast guard requested this authority as provision in s 682 which was enacted as the port and tanker safety act of 1978 pl 95474 but the provision was not included in final passage of the bill at that time the american pilots association argued against the provision on the grounds that the coast guard was not as knowledgeable and experienced as local pilots with the local conditions in each harbor due in part to the continual rotation of coast guard staff every two to three years therefore the association argued the local pilots were in the best position to properly judge the performance of their peers42 shipping lines however argued in favor of the provision stating that43 when there is misconduct or there is slippage in the quality the evaluation of that should be at the federal level so that we have uniform excellency all over the country and it does not depend on the particular political climate of the state to determine whether you are going to have good pilots or bad pilots the desire for an independent assessment of pilot performance was also voiced by the marine board of the national academies noting that measures to confirm maintenance of pilot knowledge and skills are informal systematic measures are not used to detect and correct degraded capabilities before such weaknesses become factors in marine accidents and that the effectiveness of corrective action at the state level by pilot associations and pilot boards has been uneven44 the marine board did not call for the coast guard to have disciplinary authority over state pilots but called for the creation of national commission on pilotage chartered by congress that would set national baseline standards for pilot training and qualifications and would accredit each ports piloting system45 should vtss operate more like atcs the coast guard notes emphatically that vts is an advisory service not traffic control center the

more safely or efficiently 3 advising or recommending course of action to vessel usually infrequently and 4 in rare circumstances directing vessel to move to certain location or hold at anchor or at the dock until safe to proceed but without giving direct maneuvering orders46 while vtss are often compared to an air traffic control tower the major difference is that vtss do not give specific conning orders to the pilots such as heading and speed47 however the level of vts involvement in harbor navigation varies depending on the circumstances of the harbor for instance in busy harbors or in harbors with drawbridge the vts may enforce harbor traffic management plan that dictates oneway traffic or order of procession through waterway48 in these cases the vts could be described as traffic management as opposed to positive traffic control whether vtss could operate more like an atc which navigation experts refer to as shorebased pilotage or remote pilotage is topic of speculation and debate pilots and other navigation experts assert that there is way of replacing the eyes of an experienced onboard mariner49 pilots describe turning ship like to turning car on ice it slides through the turn and pilotage is described as process of continually watching how the ship responds to maneuver which will dictate the pilots next command how ship responds is affected by the characteristics of the ship weather and water conditions50 pilot needs to be aware of multiple cues wind tide and river currents in the case of estuaries the salt water versus fresh water mix that affects buoyancy these are all factors that only an onboard mariner is in position to discern pilots stress that visual cues and references are still of paramount importance in their trade and doubt whether any kind of advanced vts system could replace the process of continual evaluation by an onboard pilot if conning ship is beyond the present capability of vts congress might still move to assess whether the vts should exert more control over harbor traffic in bad weather conditions the coast guard already has authority to restrict vessel movements during hazardous weather conditions but does not regularly do so one reason may be that the coast guard lacks standards to judge the maneuvering capabilities of vessels in constricted waters see below 46 us coast guard vessel traffic

lawmakers might consider whether more scientific information and analysis about ship maneuverability in harbor waters is needed51 while the imo in 2002 developed maneuverability standards for ships in deep unrestricted water at sea speed analogous performance standards for ships in shallow constricted water at slow speed have been established because there is standard the coast guard cannot establish harbor restrictions for certain ships that may be less controllable during hazardous weather conditions these standards would arguably also help pilots better predict the maneuvering capabilities of vessels and aid in the development of pilot training simulators and manned physical models to more accurately reflect reallife conditions52 poorhandling vessels given the particular handling characteristics of some vessels policymakers might elect to consider whether there should be more systematic method for pilots to share their experiences with vessels requiring special attention both within their harbor and among pilots from other harbors where the ship regularly calls this was recommendation of the us coast guard following an investigation into 1997 ship collision in the chesapeake bay53 vts expansion although the cost effectiveness of vtss can be disputed on port by port basis congress may act to assess the need for vtss in other us ports particularly those that have experienced large traffic growth for instance at the port of savannah vessel calls have increased by 34 in the last halfdecade54 and in the last decade the port jumped from 11th to 4th largest in the country in terms of teu throughput55 the port has also recently become major gateway for lng imports56 for security reasons the coast guard is actively pursuing its ability to track ships further from shore using ais technology congress may examine whether there are any safety benefits to this expansion such as avoiding ship collisions at the approaches to harbors 51 channel

water transportation statistical snapshot may 2007 pp 4 and 6 crs15 requiring passage plan the ntsb has consistently recommended that the pilot and master of the vessel first establish detailed passage plan of how the transit of the vessel is going to proceed through the harbor the pilot would inform the master of his intended course noting the essential features and relevant checkpoints of maneuvers to be undertaken such as where he specifically intends to pass under bridge maneuver around shallow area pass by channel buoy and contingency plans for unexpected incidents57 because the master and the bridge crew essentially provide another set of eyes the ntsb contends that passage plan would allow the ships crew to be more effective check on the ships position and movement though some accident investigations reveal reluctance on the part of the bridge crew to speak up or challenge the pilot and some masters may consider the pilots arrival as chance to get some rest passage plan could also foster teamwork or more specifically bridge team management btm aka bridge resource management brm concept adopted from the airline industry that among other things emphasizes good communication among those manning the bridge common thread that runs through many marine accident reports is lack of communication between the pilot and bridge crew btm has become part of the required training curriculum for pilots and bridge crews the coast guard has not supported the ntsbs recommendation arguing that it would impinge on the traditional masterpilot relationship58 and that the pilot cannot be expected to establish game plan with the master when so many aspects of passage cannot be predetermined the coast guard believes there are sufficient federal regulations59 and customary practices which apply in masterpilot relationships60 canadian survey of mariners found that while 80 of the pilots responding claimed that they always or often inform the master of passage plan less than half of the masters said that they do61 on the other hand while 96 of officers of the watch and 95 of masters responded that the officers of the watch always or often monitor the ships movement only about 50 of pilots responded that officers of the watch always or often monitor the ships movement62 the report 57 ntsb marine accident brief grounding of new delhi express in kill van

safety board of canada safety study of the operational relationship continued crs16 noted that foreign masters who are not familiar with local navigation conditions rely largely on the pilots and thus the verification of pilots passage plan becomes only formality but at the same time canadian masters who are well aware of the local conditions may also pay little attention to the pilots passage plan in 2003 the international maritime organization imo united nations body that establishes safety standards for international shipping recommended that the information exchanged between the pilot and master include among other things general agreement on plans and procedures including contingency plans for the anticipated passage63 thus while passage plan maybe considered good practice an unresolved issue is whether it has any consistent value and whether it should become regulatory requirement language barriers given the global nature of the shipping business language is always an issue in international shipping operations english is the standard language of shipping and the imo has developed navigational code of basic commands in english64 however the pilot captain crew and vts can communicate in whatever language everyone is most familiar with if different from english on foreignflagged ships the captain may be the only crew member that understands english or at least the basic imo phraseology and therefore may need to translate the pilots commands to the helmsman the largest single source of ship crews both officers and unlicensed seamen is the philippines in large part because of their english language skills65 more recently china india the ukraine and russia have also become major suppliers of seamen in light of the increasing diversity of seamen congress may wish to examine whether language barriers are an increasing problem in ship navigation and whether there is need for additional enforcement of english language proficiency among ship crews calling us ports congress may opt to examine how the aviation sector has addressed this problem other issues nearmiss data congress might consider whether to establish database of near misses like that in the aviation sector the coast guard and the maritime administration looked into establishing data base of near misses in the marine environment in 1997 but the project was disbanded in

concern expressed by some members of congress and some in the maritime industry is lack of technical expertise by coast guard safety personnel due to its practice of continually rotating staff by subject area and location67 this issue has been raised regarding limitations in the capabilities of vtss to exert more control over vessel movement and the agencys capability to judge pilot performance some have called for removing some safety functions from the coast guard to civilian agency at which professional continuity could be better fostered the coast guard has responded to this criticism with plan among other things to increase civilian positions in the marine safety program strengthen marine safety career paths and increase hiring from maritime academies68 the coast guard further argues that there are synergies between its maritime safety and security missions therefore the coast guard maintains that these missions should be carried out by the same agency legislative
