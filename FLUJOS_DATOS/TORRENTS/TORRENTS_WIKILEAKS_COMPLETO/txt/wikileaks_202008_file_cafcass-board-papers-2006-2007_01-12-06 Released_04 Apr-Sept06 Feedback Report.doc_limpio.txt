complaints received has increased to 296 from 250 for the same period last year this is reflected in the rise in complaints recorded as received but not registered and is at least partly accounted for by the improved recording by managers of complaints that do not then progress further the corresponding rise in the numbers of comments received indicates that many of these are then being dealt with as comments rather than registered complaints see table 10 number of complaints registered against case referrals region total number total percentage of case complaints referrals registered east 1251
