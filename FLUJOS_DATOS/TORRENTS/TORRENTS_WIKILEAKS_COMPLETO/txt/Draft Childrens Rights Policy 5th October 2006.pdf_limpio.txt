agenda item 14 bd080906 children and family court advisory and support service paper for the board meeting on 05 october 2006 childrens rights policy for endorsement aim and purpose 11 the draft childrens rights policy was consulted on between november 2005 and february 2006 and also reflects recent policy and practice developments in cafcass the policy is now submitted to the board for approval 12 endorsement by the board is an important step towards mainstreaming childrens rights at all levels of the organisation particularly in frontline practice 2 action for the board 21 to play their part in the mainstreaming push 22 to endorse the shared values framework as being consistent with the good governance of cafcass 23 to note the commitment to specific convention articles set out in the policy 3 recommendation 31 the board is asked to fully endorse the childrens rights policy appendix 1 as set out 4 diversity 41 the current policy is fully diversity compliant 5 training 51 all training modules have been re evaluated to ensure this policy can be fully implemented and to ensure its impact is more visible and tangible to children and young people and supports improvements in direct work with them legal domestic legislation and guidance remain the primary basis for promoting children and young peoples welfare in england working within the spirit of the united nations convention on the rights of the child uncrc appendix 2 will be further assurance for children that their contribution to issues that affect their lives will always be respected the uncrc is nonenforceable and cannot be effectively challenged directly under any of its articles it is not incorporated into uk law and external court is empowered to pass judgement on it it is merely cited by different courts domestically and internationally as an indication of the aspirations of most countries in the world towards children the uk had reservations when ratifying the uncrc the reservations related to the care of young offenders immigration and employment regulations regarding over 16 year olds and childrens hearings in scotland the latter two reservations have since been removed it is an existing policy position that cafcass practitioners will promote the principles of the uncrc service principles and standards 2003 and that the organisation will seek to promote the rights of children set out in the uncrc corporate plan 20036 this remains an organisational signal that we put children first the approach of other organisations the commission of social care lnspection csci is guided by the treaty to strengthen domestic legislation and national lnspection standards they take the view that the convention articles are principles for decisions and as yardstick for auditing child focus 72 csci recognises that the uk expressed reservations when ratifying the uncrc cscls current position is that they adopt the convention with specific position on the same reservations expressed by the uk government if reservation arose it would be considered on casebycase basis 73 the childrens commissioners office has due regard for the uncrc and it underpins their work key strategic issues for the board to consider endorsement of the policy will mean that cafcass will continue to actively consult all children and young people whose lives are directly affected by our service and provide the opportunity to be heard should they so wish 82 compliance with the policy will be achieved through the existing performance management framework 83 degree of culture change will be crucial to the full and successful implementation of the policy the timescale is the same as that for the entire practice development programme this has march 2009 as the final date for all necessary practice developments and improvements to have taken place in every local service area 9 financial implications 91 these changes will be managed within existing resources there are specific costs incurred for writing and disseminating the policy as the costs are existing staff time knowledge learning and development costs are already funded within existing allocations risks 101 full implementation of the policy across the organisation needs to be phased to ensure that practitioners can be fully trained to work within this framework this will be addressed over realistic timescales 102 it is existing cafcass policy to promote the principles of the uncrc some of those principles are not to be found in domestic law however there is nothing wrong legally in cafcass giving commitment to promote such principles and the risks of policy or legal challenge are minimal as long as any specific recommendation about child is made in good faith with an evidencebase and having taken their needs wishes and feelings into account 103 public awareness of our more explicit focus on childrens rights may lead to greater expectation of their views being heard in family court proceedings if this is not demonstrated there will be greater risk of criticism similarly pressure groups representing other interests in the family justice arena may suggest their own rights are being undermined by the stronger focus on childrens rights however group is likely to disagree with the principles set out in this policy merely its application in individual cases in this sense the most important aspect of the policy is how it will be reflected in everyday practice christine smart childrens rights director september 2006 appendix 1 putting children and young people first fcass childrens rights policy seen heard 8th september 2006 final version for ecdg and board 30108106 introduction cafcass is committed to developing its services to children young people and their families

young person referred to us cafcass core responsibility is to represent the interests of children and young people and their interests in range of family court proceedings central to this ethos of the service is article 12 of the uncrc that has been identified as one of the guiding principles of the convention article 12 focuses on consultation and participation it gives children who are capable of forming their own views the right to express their views freely in all matters affecting them for this purpose the child shall be provided with the opportunity to be heard in any judicial or administrative process affecting them historically the voices of children have often been too weak to be heard often with disastrous consequences articles 14 and 17 give children and young people the right to hold their own opinions and to access information article 3 states that parties should ensure that the child is afforded such protection and care as is necessary for his or her wellbeing taking into account the rights and duties of parents and those with parental responsibility cafcass is committed to promoting the principles of the uncrc and providing the highest standard of
