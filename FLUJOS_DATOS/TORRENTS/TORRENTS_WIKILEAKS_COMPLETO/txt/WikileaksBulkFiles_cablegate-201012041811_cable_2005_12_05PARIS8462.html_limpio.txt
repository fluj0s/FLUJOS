political minister counselor josiah rosenblatt for reaso ns 14 b and d 1 c summary council of europe secretary general davis warned the ambassador december 12 citing nato unresponsiveness to repeated written queries that he intended soon to go public with respect to the alleged use of kforrun detention centers in kosovo for secret cia secret prisons this despite the fact that french nato officers present at the scene have categorically rejected the allegations on renditions davis took more discreet approach saying that this was an issue the coes parliamentary assembly pace not its syg was addressing he added that in fact this was matter between the coe and individual member states rather than between the coe and the us pace president rene van der linden and investigator dick marty have taken confrontational approach in advance of january 2327 plenary session publicly stirring the pot in member states by provocatively accusing the us of withholding information end summary kosovoaccess to alleged secret detention center 2 c during december 12 meeting with the ambassador council of europe coe secretary general terry davis complained of what he described as continued nato unresponsiveness to coe requests for access to kforrun detention centers in kosovo he claimed he had sent seven separate letters to nato syg hoop sheffer none of which had elicited satisfactory response davis described kosovo as black hole for the coe committee on the prevention of torture notwithstanding the fact that the coe charter gives the organization the right to visit any detention place in member states given natos obsructionism davis told the ambassador as courtesy he said that he would have nono choice but to go public over the issue in early 2006 3 c davis concluded that others but not he had begun to connect the dots and were speculating that kosovo might be site for secret cia prisons free from international scrutiny we note that on november 26 monde carried an article in which the coes human rights commissioner alvaro gilrobles is reported as claiming that september 2002 visit to camp bondsteel had given him the impression that it may have served as detainee camp this story was rebutted the following day in figaro and monde by the french general who was in charge of kfor at the time who stated that all interrogations of suspects at bondsteel had been conducted in the presence of nato that is to say french officers renditions 4 c on the renditions issue more broadly davis noted that pace president van der linden and investigator marty rather than he were addressing the matter for the coe he assured the ambassador that he personally viewed the question as one between the coe and its member states not between the coe and the us davis noted that the coe had asked european member state governments in light of allegations of secret prisons whether they were in any way involved 5 c van der linden and dick marty for their part continue to seek to keep the issue alive marty declared to the press december 13 that he found the allegations of us renditions credible even if he allowed that it was still too early to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of coe member states in illegal actions he publicly chastised the us for failing to provide any information or explanations putting aside any mention of the secretarys december 5 statement on the controversy ref c which was provided to marty under cover letter from ambassador stapleton on december 7 comment 6 c for any number of reasons including some that may have more to do with institutional rivalries rather than the issue at hand van der linden and marty appear to have decided to take much more confrontational public approach than davis on the renditions issue the result is that whatever their motivations the renditions issue appears likely to stay on the front burner the pace committee on legal affairs and human rights announced december 13 that it will ask the pace to schedule debate on the issue at the january 2327 plenary session end comment please visit paris classified website at httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurparisindexc fm stapleton
