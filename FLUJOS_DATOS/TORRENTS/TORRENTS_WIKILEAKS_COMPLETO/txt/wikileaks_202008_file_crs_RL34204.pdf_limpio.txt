various bills have been introduced in the 110th congress that address foreign temporary agricultural workers10 some of these bills including hr 371s 237s 340 all identical and known as agjobs and hr 1792 propose complete overhaul of the h2a program both agjobs and hr 1792 would streamline the process of importing h2a workers and would make changes to existing h2a requirements regarding minimum benefits wages and working conditions the streamlining and other changes proposed by the measures are different however for example both agjobs and hr 1792 would make changes to existing h2a wage requirements agjobs would freeze the aewr at the january 2003 level for three years after the date of enactment while under hr 1792 h2a employers would longer be subject to the aewr s 1639 which was considered in the senate and hr 1645 strive act which was the subject of hearing by the house judiciary committees subcommittee on immigration citizenship refugees border security and international

in 1990 when congress replaced the former h1b visa category for aliens of distinguished merit and ability with the current h1b professional specialty worker visa category discussed above it also established the and p visa categories15 generally the visa is reserved for the highest level of accomplishment and covers fairly broad set of occupations and endeavors including artists athletes entertainers and scientists those holding an visa may stay up to three years with oneyear renewal option the p visa has somewhat lower standard of achievement than the visa and is restricted to narrower band of occupations and endeavors the p visa is used by an alien who performs as an artist athlete or entertainer individually or as part of group or team and who seeks to enter the united states temporarily and solely for the purpose of performing in that capacity p1 visas are for athletes and members of entertainment groups at an internationally recognized level of performance individual athletes on p visas may stay in intervals of up to 5 years at time up to 10 years in total other p visa holders may stay up to one year hr 5060 which has been reported by the house judiciary committee would amend the law to enable p visas for individual athletes to be renewed in fiveyear increments apparently without limit in addition the house has passed hr 1312 which would provide for expedited adjudication of or p visa petitions that are not processed within 30 days of filing if the petitioner is nonprofit arts organization or is filing on behalf of such an

recent years fueling pressure to revise admissions levels in the law upward17 replacing or supplementing the current employmentbased preference system with meritbased point system is also garnering considerable interest for the first time in over decade18 another recurring option is to longer count the derivative family members ie spouses and minor children of employmentbased lprs as part of the numerical ceiling the effort to increase levels of employmentbased immigration is complicated by the backlogs in familybased immigration due to the sheer volume of aliens eligible to immigrate to the united states citizens and lprs often wait years for their relatives petitions to be processed and visa numbers to become available raising questions about the advisability of increasing employment based immigration before resolving the familybased backlogs meanwhile others question whether the united states can accommodate higher levels of immigration and frequently cite the costs borne by local communities faced with increases in educational expenses medical care human services and infrastructure expansion which are sparked by population growth title v of s 1639 the immigration bill considered in the senate in june 2007 would substantially revise legal permanent admissions in terms of employmentbased immigration the first three preference categories as described above would be eliminated and replaced with point system this proposed point system would be multitiered with tier for meritbased immigrants the merit point tier would be based on total of 100 points divided between four factors employment education english and civics and family relationships 19 among the other pending bills on employmentbased lprs is hr 1645 it would increase the annual number of employmentbased lprs from 140000 to 290000 and would longer count the derivative family members of employmentbased lprs as part of the numerical ceiling at the same time it would cap the total number of employmentbased lprs and their derivatives at 800000 annually 20 s 1038hr 1930 the skil act of 2007 would expand employmentbased immigration by exempting aliens with advanced degrees and specialized occupations from the worldwide numerical limits moreover s 1038hr 1930 would longer count the derivative family members of employmentbased lprs as part of the numerical ceiling s 1397 would likewise

tamperresistant and difficult to counterfeit in order to impede document fraud and unauthorized employm ent since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the policy priorities have centered on preventing identity fraud with sharp focus on intercepting terrorist travel and other security threats there is consensus that immigration documents should include biometric identifiers eg digitized photos or finger scans but determining what type of biometric identifier to use poses variety of technical issues congress imposed statutory requirement in 1996 for doss bureau of consular affairs to issue biometric border crossing card known today as laser visa in 2001 and 2002 congress added requirements that all visas be biometric since october 2004 the bureau of consular affairs has been issuing machinereadable visas that use biometric identifiers in addition to the photograph that has been collected for some time 25 immigration documents issued by uscis in dhs likewise include

viewed as essential components of strategy to reduce unauthorized immigration there appears to be considerable congressional support to expand verification requirements and bolster worksite enforcement efforts in some cases this support seems to be linked to support for other proposals to establish new temporary worker programs and to legalize the status of unauthorized aliens in the united states under ina 274a it is unlawful for an employer to knowingly hire recruit or refer for fee or continue to employ an alien who is not author ized to be so employed employers also are required to participate in paperbased empl oyment eligibility verification system commonly referred to as the i9 system in which they examine documents presented by new hires to verify identity and work eligibility and complete and retain i9 verification forms employers violating prohibitions on unlawful employment may be subject to civil andor criminal penalties enforcement of these provisions

the current largely voluntary electron ic system under s 1639 it would be unlawful for an employer or other entity to hire or recruit or refer for fee an individual for employment in the united states without verifying identity and employment eligibility as specified over time participation in the new electronic eevs would become mandatory as of the date of enactment the secretary of dhs would be authoriz ed to require any employer or industry that is federal contractor part of the critical infrastructure or directly related to us national or homeland security to participate in the new eevs this requirement could be applied to both newly hired and current employees later than 18 months after the date of enactment all employers would be required to participate in the new eevs with respect to newly hired employees and certain current employees later than three years after enactment all employers would be required to participate with respect to new employees and all employees not previously verified through the eevs under s 1639 individuals who receive final notices that the system cannot confirm their employment eligibility known under the bill as under everify as final nonconfirmation notices could seek administrative and judicial review as specified the current i9 system would remain in place with some modifications changes would also be made to existing monetary penalties for employer violations 38 among its other employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement related provisions s 1639 would provide for the disclosure of certain taxpayer identity information by ssa to dhs 304 require ssa to issue more secure social security cards 305 and establish voluntary program through which participating employers could submit employees fingerprints to verify identity and employment eligibility 307 title iii of hr 1645 would likewise amend ina 274a to establish new electronic employment verification system under this bill it would be unlawful for an employer or other entity to hire an individual for employment in the united states without verifying identity and employment eligibility as specified unlike under s 1639 these

everify system permanent and phase in requirement that all employers conduct employment authorization verification through it initially this requirement would apply only to new hires not later than

circumstances s 3093 like hr 4088s 2366s 2368 would make everify permanent unlike these bills however it would not make participation mandatory for all employers instead it would require federal contractors to participate in addition under s 3093 employers participating in everify could elect to verify the employment eligibility of their existing employees the secretary of homeland security also could require any employer or class of employers to use everify to verify the employment eligibility of its current workforce if the secretary has reasonable cause to believe that the employer has committed material violations of the ina prohibitions on unlawful employment hr 98 and hr 2954 would require social security cards to include an encrypted machine readable electronic

dhsadministered everify system with two new verification systems to be established by ssa the electronic employment verification system eevs and the secure employment ligibility verification system seevs under hr 5515 employers and other entities would be required to verify identity and employment eligibility in cases of hiring and in certain cases of referral or recruitment for fee not later

system in key ways for example the eevs would use information from government database the national directory of new hires that is not currently part of everify 40 like hr 1645 hr 5515 would enable individuals who are rminated from employment as result of disapproval notice akin to final nonconfirmation under everify to seek administrative and judicial review the seevs which hr 5515 woul d direct ssa to establish by regulation would provide for identity authentication and employm ent eligibility verification it would use the services of private sector entities to enroll new employees by means of identity authentication to protect authenticated information through biometric technology and to verify employment eligibility employees would be afforded the same rights and protections in connection with responses to inquiries under the seevs as under the eevs hr 5515 also would increase monetary penalties for employer violations of ina 274a prohibitions on unlawful employment 104 and
