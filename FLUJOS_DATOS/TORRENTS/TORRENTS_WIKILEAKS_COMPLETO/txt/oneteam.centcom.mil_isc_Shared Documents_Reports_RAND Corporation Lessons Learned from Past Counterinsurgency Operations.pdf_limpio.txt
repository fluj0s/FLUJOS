product of one of several rand corporation research projects examining us political and military capabilities for ﬁghting spectrum of current and future insurgency threats it should be of interest to academics policymakers military science specialists intelligence analysts and laypersons within the united states and elsewhere who may be interested in learning the applicability of lessons from past counterinsurgency coin operations to the insurgencies the united states faces today and may face in the future the six cases proﬁled in this paper include the philippines 18991902 algeria 19541962 vietnam 19591972 salvador 19801992 jammu and kashmir 1947present and colombia 1963present they were selected to explore coin operations in regions with varied characteristics relating to geography historical era outcome type of insurgency and the level of us or foreign involvement among others the issues addressed in this paper pertain to the success or failure of several counterinsurgency operations the counterinsurgents ability to innovate and adapt and the need for way to recognize the threat and determine what is needed to confront it the authors hope that this paper will add to the evergrowing body of literature on coin and will abet the development of tactics techniques and procedures ttps for coin in addition to those cited in the newly released us army and us marine corps counterinsurgency field manual fm 324 mcwp 3335 this paper is not intended to be comprehensive analysis of insurgency instead it exam ines handful of insurgencies to determine which ttps the insurgents and counterinsurgents employed and then develops some general conclusions on counterinsurgency operations that could be applied to the 21st century to this end the authors have included theories and lessons learned from the past as well as contemporary debates on the topic which may not necessarily pertain to the lessons learned from these particular case studies although this paper had several authors lesley anne warner as the lead author was responsible for collating the various chapters ensuring cohesiveness and continuity in the case study analyses and enumerating overall

4ixsummary the global war on terror gwot is being waged in multiple theaters possessing wide spectrum of social dynamics regional relationships histories political cultures strengths and weaknesses and salient grievances as insurgent threats evolve and assume new forms the united states must also evolve in its ability to counter potentially prolonged threats in several parts of the world because of the potential for global reach in contemporary insurgencies the ability to draw on lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations using different historical cases can be valuable helping current and future leaders prevent repetition of mistakes and elucidating foundation on which to build contemporary responses despite the need to look to the past for clues on how to proceed at present or in the future it is also important not to generalize making lessons learned not loose analogy but perfectly matching antidote rather than disregarding successes and failures as phenomena of the past or attempting to shove round lessons into square counterinsurgencies strategists must consider range of possible responses this paper analyzes six coin case studies from the 19th and 20th centuries in which insurgent and counterinsurgent strengths and weaknesses are examined for their contributions to the outcomes of the conﬂicts if they have been resolved as of this writing the cases proﬁled in this paper are the philippines 18991902 algeria 19541962 vietnam 19591972 salvador 19801992 jammu and kashmir 1947present and colombia 1963present these cases were selected because of the potentially valuable lessons that can be drawn from them for future coin operations and because they demonstrate the application of some of the methods detailed in the us army and us marine corps counterinsurgency field manual fm 324 mcwp 3335 released in december 2006 as the reader will ﬁnd in addition to the various tactics techniques and procedures ttps used to combat these insurgencies these cases exhibit variations and commonalities in such characteristics as outcome historical era geographic spread type and organization of the insurgency and the level of foreign intervention among others the philippines 18991902 the insurgency in the philippines did not have strong base of support among the population because some filipinos wanted provincial autonomy whereas the insurgents goal was centralx money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations ized government the insurgency was highly factionalized with competing goals and it often alienated potential supporters in the population by levying taxes on them and using violence against those discovered to be cooperating with the americans the insurgents were also weakened by the fact that they were illtrained transitioned to guerrilla tactics too late in the war to have signiﬁcant eﬀect and were unable to obtain sanctuary in nearby countries or to arrange for any possible inﬂux of supplies and manpower as result of the countrys island geography although the insurgents outnumbered the americans and were often able to disappear into the population the welltrained us soldiers were able to defeat the insurgency despite their own misconceptions about the conﬂict their unfamiliarity with the terrain and the brutal tactics they employed to put down the insurrection many us soldiers had learned how to ﬁght war of this type from their experiences in puerto rico and cuba as well as during the wars against the american indians between the 1860s and the 1890s from these conﬂicts they learned to separate the population from the insurgents and to ration food to decrease the populations incentive to share food with the insurgents the counterinsurgents also participated in contingency operations during which they would help create and maintain infrastructure the americans also made it inescapably clear that collaboration with the insurgents would be severely punished to help restore law and order to the archipelago the united states created armed local indigenous forces who were instrumental in capturing the insurgent leader gathering intelligence and protecting the population from insurgent retribution algeria 19541962 in algeria the insurgent goal was to establish an independent state within the framework of the principles of islam although most of the population remained ambivalent until the front libération nationale fln initiated campaign of discrete urban terrorism the beginning of this campaign instigated french overreaction targeting the algerian population as whole with such brutality that the flns cause immediately gained popularity the flns targeting of civiliancentric venues in algiers european sector resulted in the french employing extrajudicial means to detain interrogate and torture suspected insurgents the draconian measures the french took to quell the insurgency eventually drove even unaﬃliated moderates into the outstretched arms of the fln once news of the institutionalized regime of torture was made known abroad french public support for the war plummeted eventually the french realized that they needed to gain the support of the population through humanitarian assistance and secure algerias borders to eliminate the inﬂux of external support to the insurgents ultimately they sought to persuade the population that they fared better under french rule than as an independent nation although the second half of frances coin strategy was successful it was compromised by the degree to which france had attempted to pacify the country through brute force with the loss of public support for the war at home france was forced to grant algeria independence after winning the military war but losing the political onesummary xi vietnam 19591972 the part of the insurgency in vietnam covered in this paper was continuation of the viet namese war for independence from the french 19451954 from which communist north vietnam and usbacked south vietnam emerged north and south vietnamese communists began their inﬁltration and indoctrination of cadres in the south and accelerated these eﬀorts in the aftermath of the coup against ngo dinh diem throughout the war the insurgents emphasized the wars political nature using established networks to gain the support of the population and creating mass associations as vehicle for political indoctrination acting as shadow government they were able to provide social services enact land reform and make those in the population feel that they had stake in supporting them knowing that the south vietnamese government was too weak to protect its population insurgents also used discriminant terrorism to maintain control of their own cadres and the population at large by the time us combat troops arrived the situation in south vietnam had deteriorated to the point that us involvement could not be restricted to counterinsurgency alone by the mid1960s paciﬁcation programs carried out under diem were placed on the back burner as us and south vietnamese security forces struggled to regain control of the military situation the inability of indigenous security forces to shoulder an adequate amount of combat responsibility ineﬃciencies in gathering intelligence from the population to target the insurgent infrastructure and the unwillingness of the south vietnamese government to build political base perpetuated the spiral of chaos leading up to the tet oﬀensive in 1968 because of the severity of enemy losses during tet the counterinsurgents were able to intensify their paciﬁcation eﬀorts and achieve moderate success it was during this period that the united states was able to achieve unity of command with civil operations and revolutionary development support cords and that the south vietnamese government in an eﬀort to build political base outside saigon enacted program of land reform despite these innovations and reforms the south was overrun by conventional invasion from north vietnam in 1975 thus the true periods of coin and paciﬁcation in vietnam occurred between 19591963 and 19681972 salvador 19801992 the insurgency in salvador emerged from politicalcriminal activities such as kidnappings and assassinations and eventually evolved into guerrilla warfare although there was mass support for such an insurgency the insurgents were able to ﬁeld large number of ﬁghters relative to the salvadoran security forces with members spanning the political spectrum although uniﬁed into one insurgent group there was substantial disagreement as to the doctrine and identity of the movement which severely compromised its strength because of the countrys rugged terrain and unregulated border with honduras the insurgents were able to enjoy sanctuary as well as steady ﬂow of support from cuba and nicaragua until the fall of the soviet unionxii money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations as result of series of free elections the salvadoran government has been awarded broad popular support and thus political legitimacy to build on its legitimacy the government implemented civic action programs to rebuild social and economic infrastructures and free the army to pursue insurgents additionally train and equip program run by the united states helped retrain the salvadoran army to ﬁght the insurgency although direct us involvement was kept to minimum the governments lack of control over death squad activity eroded domestic and international support and uncertainty over continued us support resulted in lesseﬀective warﬁghting the insurgency ended with negotiated compromise in which the insurgents were given stake in the political future of the country jammu and kashmir 1947present the insurgency in jammu and kashmir jk has been ongoing for over half century and has been sustained by support from pakistan and by an inﬂux of foreign ﬁghters who may have links to qaeda the various competing factions draw members from the ranks of other insurgent organizations and their cause is to establish fundamentalist theocracy the insurgents are mainly rural because there are few security forces in those areas and they do not provide social services or any form of informal government to local civilians they frequently employ terrorism indiscriminately to force loyalty and instill fear in the population the indian government learning from british lessons during the malayan emergency as well as from its own experience with the liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte has been rather successful at militarily managing the insurgency the government has created specially trained units to execute coin separated the civilians from the insurgents protected the population and restricted the use of airpower and ﬁrepower to reduce civilian casualties it has also engaged in civic action to ensure amicable relations with the population and to encourage cooperation in gathering intelligence the insurgency is ongoing largely because the insurgents enjoy sanctuary in pakistan and political solution has not yet been developed and applied colombia 1963present the colombian insurgent groups emerged from an atmosphere of revolutionary change in which they sought to take political power by force over time their income has come from kidnapping extortion and the local drug trade through which they have interacted with latin american organized crime networks to ensure steady supply of arms through the movements involvement in the drug trade the insurgency has lost ideological cohesion as many leaders have become more interested in personal enrichment than in the organizations political and military agenda furthermore many potential domestic and international supporters have been repelled by the insurgents involvement in the drug trade and their use of indiscriminate terrorism and they are consequently extremely unpopular the insurgents have also failed to challenge major population centers or sabotage vital economic assets and they summary xiii have not used their vast source of income to acquire sophisticated weapons to neutralize the governments air superiority the colombian government has had the advantage of political legitimacy with long record of freely and fairly elected civilian leadership the government receives substantial aid from the united states and the european union with which they have increased the strength of their security forces armed and trained local selfdefense units and implemented seizeandhold strategy to ﬂush the insurgents from certain territories however the government does not have the numbers to secure the borders and maintain the seizeandhold strategy the insurgents enjoy sanctuary in venezuela panama and ecuador and there is also evidence that they receive some level of support tacit or overt from venezuelan president hugo chavez some of the characteristics of the insurgencies covered in this paper can be found in table s1 conclusions when presented with variety of possible insurgencies counterinsurgents may be more adept at managing the problem if they have money in the bankin other words if they can beneﬁt from lessons learned during past coin operations for the sake of continuity and adaptability in the multifront global war on terror counterinsurgents should approach lessons learned across past coin operations as loose analogies at the same time those charged with executing coin should avoid making generalizations that tend to form model for coin overall seeing how counterinsurgents confronted the complexities of the insurgencies they faced in the past may enable current counterinsurgents to be more proﬁcient at ﬁghting wide variety of modern insurgencies that have global reach in the past cases of the philippines and vietnam and in the ongoing cases of jammu and kashmir and colombia the counterinsurgents were open to using knowledge gained from past counterinsurgency operations which they then used to formulate ttps for their ongoing operations doing so often required that they be objective critics in the face of failure and adjust their strategy accordingly it is important that counterinsurgents understand local dynamics so that all theaters of the conﬂict can be understood in context this knowledge can help exploit cleavages and encourage competition among insurgent factions which was done in the philippines and with less success in vietnam in vietnam salvador and colombia counterinsurgents used indigenous intermediaries with established social networks to earn the trust of the population and psychologically unhinge the insurgents in some of these cases the indigenous intermediaries took the form of armed civilian selfdefense militias who protected their own villages from insurgent attacks in the case of the philippines the creation of welltrained and uncorrupt police force was integral to the capture of the key insurgent leader and in demonstrating that locals were being trusted to provide for and control their own security police are also integral to counterinsurgency operations because they are responsible for detaining and interrogating suspected insurgents from whom they can acquire intelligence to attack the insurgent infrastructurexiv money

situation handsoﬀ approach is sometimes necessary to allow the host nation to learn which methods are most eﬀective in dealing with an insurgency considering its own strengths and limitations with this in mind foreign counterinsurgents should determine how best to assist the host nation in its eﬀorts to reform if this is necessary to better ﬁght the insurgency diversifying sources of data on the host nation and gathering information on its intelligence collection and dissemination abilities may support this eﬀort as in the cases of salvador and colombia strong competent democratically elected leadership at all levels of government is especially helpful in situations in which both the insurgents and counterinsurgents are attempting to persuade the population not only that their form of government is legitimate but also that they will have the opportunity to improve their quality of life and the political means to express their desire for this eﬃcient host nation provision of social services and employment opportunities can also demonstrate legitimacy and competence in the eyes of the population foreign or even host nation counterinsurgents who are not from the local area of operations should assume that they will have limited opportunities to convey their good intentions consequently they may be viewed more favorably from the outset if they are perceived as contributing to progress and not to chaos in the three cases with large foreign counterinsurgent contingents the philippines algeria and vietnam as well as in jammu and kashmir the counterinsurgents engaged in humanitarian actions designed to improve the lives of the population although in some cases these actions were taken either too late or on such small scale that they had minimal eﬀect counterinsurgents should strive for unity of command akin to the bureaucratic struc ture of the cords program in vietnam so that there is fusion and continuity among counterinsurgency programs to facilitate this structure bureaucracies should encourage culture of cooperation both in the host nation and among the foreign counterinsurgents and have either foreign adviser in the background or domestic political leader to bridge this gap in the area of operations local autonomy for counterinsurgents may enable innovation and adaptability in the case of algeria the french were extremely adept at securing the countrys bor ders to deny insurgents sanctuary to minimize the inﬂux and inﬂuence of unwanted external actors and to sap the strength of the insurgent infrastructure however counterinsurgents failed in this eﬀort in vietnam and salvador as well as in the ongoing cases of jammu and kashmir and colombia this failure has allowed insurgents to maintain the strategic initiative and recuperate mentally and physically in their sanctuaries when they feel threatened by the counterinsurgents finally counterinsurgents should analyze solutions in terms of longterm eﬀectiveness not shortterm necessity as demonstrated by the time spans of all the counterinsurgency operations discussed in this paper insurgency can be prolonged aﬀair in the face of longterm necessity shortterm eﬀectiveness is often poor substitute especially when actions taken in the short term to solve immediate problems counteract the longterm goals of the counterinsurgency operationxviiacknowledgments the authors wish to express their sincere thanks to the many people who sponsored supported and critiqued this research this project was made possible through the support

and weaknesses and salient grievances in the post911 world many policymakers refer to gwot as the long war in which proﬁciency in counterinsurgency coin operations could be the diﬀerence between defeat and victory on timetable that is more in harmony with us capabilities to counter prolonged threats in several parts of the world as global threats are in state of constant ﬂux us capabilities must strive to stay ahead of the curve because of the potential for global reach in contemporary insurgencies the ability to draw on lessons learned can be valuable resource not only in comprehending how certain methods have been applied in various settings but also in discovering possible strands of continuity during what prussian military theorist carl von clausewitz 1968 described as the fog of war seeing general trends and outcomes across cases from the past should help prevent repetition of mistakes and elucidate foundation on which to build contemporary responses despite the need to look to the past for suggestions on how to proceed perhaps the greatest lesson that can be learned from looking at past coin campaigns for insights on current and future campaigns is not to generalize insurgencies and counterinsurgencies are not clones the solutions and problems may or may not be transferable between cases seeing lessons learned not as loose analogy but as perfectly matching antidote can be rather costly oversight in the search for lessons learned and unlearned counterinsurgent strategists should regard the approach to these lessons as more consistent with the qualities of ﬂypaper than teﬂon although neither extreme is ideal rather than disregarding successes and failures as phenomenon of the past or attempting to shove round lessons into square counterinsurgencies strategists must be open to multiple possibilities this paper is one of several rand corporation research products of large project tasked with determining future political and military capabilities for ﬁghting spectrum of insurgencies while taking broad look at the phenomenon of insurgency the authors decided to zoom in and take more intimate look at which tactics brought insurgencies and counterinsurgencies success and failure in undertaking this study the authors hoped to derive important insights from collage of insurgenciesbig and small ongoing and completed insurgent and counterinsurgent victory and with or without us involvement for the purpose of this paper the authors used the central intelligence agency cia deﬁnition of insurgency which states that2 money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations insurgency is protracted politicalmilitary activity directed toward completely or par tially controlling the resources of country through the use of irregular military forces and illegal political organizations insurgent activityincluding guerrilla warfare terrorism and political mobilization for example propaganda recruitment front and covert party organization and international activityis designed to weaken government control and legitimacy while increasing insurgent control and legitimacy the common denominator of most insurgent groups is their desire to control particular area this objective diﬀerentiates insurgent groups from purely terrorist organizations whose objectives do not include the creation of an alternative government capable of controlling given area or country 1 for the purpose of this paper the authors also used the deﬁnition of counterinsurgency from the department of defense dictionary of military and associated terms which states that counterinsurgency consists of those military paramilitary political economic psycho logical and civic actions taken by government to defeat insurgency2 the cases analyzed in this paper are the philippines 18991902 by ivan khilko algeria 19541962 by peter chalkvietnam 19591972 by lesley anne warnerel salvador 19801992 by angel rabasajammu and kashmir 1947present by paraag shuklacolombia 1963present by angel rabasa these cases were selected for multiple factors among them geographical distribution outcome us and foreign involvement and historical era the philippines case was selected because it was one of the few clearcut us coin successes although it can be perceived as less relevant to 21stcentury insurgencies because of the changes in technology over the past century however like the usled invasion of iraq in 2003 the philippines case is an example of an invasion by foreigners who then faced an unexpected uprising and were forced to adapt to it their methods of population control and system of rewards and punishment carrot and stick are examples of paciﬁcation that can be used as an alternative to the other wellknown approaches of winning hearts and minds or transformation 3 the authors selected algeria as case study because it was prime example of coin operation in which the counterinsurgents were able to prevail militarily but subsequently lost the political war especially on the home front as result of the brutality used to put down 1central intelligence agency nd 2joint chiefs of staﬀdepartment of defense 2007 3winning hearts and minds refers to counterinsurgents engaging in civic action to gain the cooperation of the popula tion through their good deeds and to discourage cooperation with the insurgents carrot and stick is strategy of incentives and punishments intended to reward or punish the population for its cooperation or lack thereof transformation is longterm strategy to reform the social and governmental norms of country so that grievances can be addressed legally as opposed to the population having to resort to insurgency gompert and gordon unpublished research introduction 3 the insurgency algeria is also classic example of how insurgent tactics prompted counterin surgents to react with such overwhelming force that they alienated the previously unaﬃliated members of the population and drove them into the arms of the insurgency the insurgency in vietnam was chosen not only because it was watershed in us his tory but also because it was deﬁnitive moment in the evolution of military culture with regard to ﬁghting politicalmilitary wars this case is also prime example of the eﬀectiveness of joint political and military approach to coin through the civil operations and revolutionary development support cords program although it might have proven more eﬀective had there been an early and accurate assessment of the situation on the ground although the counterinsurgents lost in this case vietnam is good example of how paciﬁcation was ultimately so successful that north vietnam was forced to launch conventional invasion of south vietnam in order to win the war the salvador case was selected because it was an example of rather successful coin operation and postvietnam experiment in which the united states was able to limit its role to train and equip because of the favorable outcome of this conﬂict this case is also used as an example of how the united states playing relatively indirect role was able to train the salvadoran army to ﬁght the insurgency more eﬃciently which was instrumental in breaking its momentum the host nations willingness to participate in series of elections added to its legitimacy and showed that it was committed to democratic governance which may have contributed to the governments eventual victory the authors chose jammu and kashmir to include in this paper because of its islamist element the long duration of its insurgency and the role of external support in sustaining the insurgency in addition jammu and kashmir is an example of an insurgency in which the insurgents have been more concerned with securing their own interests and less concerned with creating social network for political activism unlike many of the other insurgencies discussed in this paper within the scope of the insurgencies analyzed here colombia represents another exam ple of an insurgency that has not been centered on gaining the support of the population but rather began with ideological roots that were soon fragmented by the very activities that sustained it the authors chose this case because of its long duration the insurgencys transformation over this span of time and the governments relative success in enacting measures to keep the insurgency at bay some of the characteristics of these insurgencies can be found in table 11in each case study insurgent and counterinsurgent tactics and strategies have been ana lyzed as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each side and how they contributed to the outcome of the conﬂict in conclusion the authors sought to acknowledge the lessons learned from each conﬂict and the similarities and diﬀerences among methods that were successful in combating spectrum of insurgencies in addition the authors sought to articulate general conclusions on coin operations whether addressed in these particular case studies or notalthough most of the insurgencies discussed in this paper are part of the classical genre of insurgency it is still important to understand the complexities of these cases especially as the united states prepares to wage gwot for the long haul the ability to draw on these4 money in the bank lessons learned from

has its roots in the waning days of spanish occupation as revolution ary organization called the katipunan1 started in 1892 the katipunan accomplished little during their time under the spanish largely because there was great deal of inﬁghting within the organization this is best exempliﬁed by the assassination of the organizations leader andres bonifacio in 1897 by emilio aguinaldo member of the politically active principale class of landed gentry by removing his rival aguinaldo assumed power of the largest rebel factions in the country and would go on to lead the insurgency against the united states for the most part aguinaldo was able to centralize the insurgency on luzon the largest island in the archipelago ordering his followers to go into the mountains in november 1897 he issued decree that they would adopt guerrilla tactics against the spanish in response to this the spanish concluded the pact of biaknabato with him month later which ostensibly called for reparations for injured filipinos and reforms beneﬁcial to the indigenous population see figure 21 for map of the philippines after being given 400000 pesos by the colonial government aguinaldo was sent oﬀ to hong kong with group of his followers allowing the spanish to only nominally implement the reforms discussed the departure also did not end the filipino revolutionary eﬀorts and only bolstered aguinaldos myth throughout the archipelago 2 admiral george dewey of the us navy brought aguinaldo back from hong kong in may 1898 thinking that he would be good ally against the spanish for the impending us takeover of the philippines at this point the relationship between aguinaldo and the united states begins to blur because president william mckinley gave unclear instructions to dewey as to the future purpose of the us presence on the archipelago number of disagreements at key junctures such as deciding who had responsibil ity for capturing manila from the spanish turned aguinaldo

in manila suburb aguinaldo realized that he had to signiﬁcantly reorganize the revolutionary army and opted to do so by mixing conventional and guerrilla forces another important player on the filipino side lieutenant general antonio luna attempted to play up the conventional warfare side of aguinaldos strategy but because of his erratic nature on and oﬀ the battleﬁeld he was assassinated by aguinaldos bodyguards in june 1899 in december 1899 aguinaldo decided to abandon conventional tactics and turn wholly to guerrilla warfare realizing that the revolutionary army was match for the muchbetter trained us forces led by major general elwell otis in luzon aguinaldo divided insurgent forces into partisans and militia with the partisans focusing on disrupting us progress on the island and attacking towns that capitulated to us forces and the militia ﬁghting as parttime guerrillas responsible primarily for helping out the partisans members of the two often switched between groups arbitrarily and the organization also contained strata that included town government representatives and tax collectors because aguinaldo had the principales on 3linn 1989 the philippines 18991902 9 his side they were able to help him win over signiﬁcant number of townsfolk to the guerril side often encouraging them to join the militia the year 1900 proved to be turning point in the war with general arthur macarthur replacing general otis in may of that year as us commander for the philippines with broader understanding of the rebellion macarthur approved tactics that ensured that the united states could secure the cooperation of the filipinos through visible threat of force against rebel collaborators reaching out to the bases of power of the wealthy ilustrado busi nessmen and the principales macarthur was ultimately able to win the support of both of these groups and that of the people they controlled by the time major general adna chaﬀee was appointed us commander of the philippines in july 1901 aguinaldo had been captured and the rebel movement had lost most of its drive and organization after putting down rebellions in south luzon and on the island of samar the war was oﬃcially declared ﬁnished in june 1902 strengths of the insurgents able to navigate terrain well the rebels used their knowledge of the diﬃcult geography of the philippines to their advantage often retreating to hideouts in the mountains of north luzon or leading the us army into the jungle where ﬁghting was extremely tough in so doing they were able to for the most part ﬁght battles in places where conventional army would be stuck making it hard to defeat small force of guerrillas with superior knowledge and capabilities in compromising terrain blended in with civilian population as in any guerrilla conﬂict the greatest strength of the rebels was that there was apparent dividing line between combatants and civilians when ﬁghting was over combatants could very easily slip back into villages where they would be indistinguishable from the noncombatant population this was extremely frustrating for us army commanders who were well aware that large number of the people they were helping in the villages and who seemed to be siding with them were in fact likely to be spies for the rebel leadership or enemy combatants 4 vastly outnumbered us forces most modern histories put the number of filipino insur gents around 100000 although the total number of us troops was nominally higher 126468 the number of combat troops was at any given time closer to 40000 5 thus the filipinos had signiﬁcant advantage in the number of ﬁghters they could commit to any given conﬂict 4captain delphey t casteel writing to his wife in october of 1900 one day we may be ﬁghting with thousands of

insurgents lack of strong leadership most filipino commanders had generally received formal military training whatsoever under the spanish and those who had like aguinaldo generally had experience ﬁghting oﬀ only small groups of bandits which was not particularly useful in largescale conﬂict this proved to be signiﬁcant problem in terms of strategizing particularly in the early stages of the conﬂict when the insurgents were still pursuing conventional tactics the decision for the wholesale shift to guerrilla tactics was likely taken too late after the rebels had lost signiﬁcant number of men and the control of key areas of luzon the lack of coordination at the command level is also highlighted by the fact that quite often the filipino commanders seemed to be driving at diverging aims as evidenced by the assassination of general luna in 1899 aguinaldo could hardly hope to centralize the insurgents as he was in hiding until september 1900 by which time the insurgency had mutated into number of independent battalions with little communication among themweak support base many of the tactics oﬃcially sanctioned by the rebel leadership such as intimidation and monetary extortion from the impoverished peasantry served to decrease potential assistance from the populace aguinaldos choice of the principales and the tagalogs he was member of both groups as his natural support base gave him signiﬁcant lead against the us army but this was too narrow to build lasting following in the countryside 6 through concentrating mainly on large landowners and promising lucrative political incentives after victory to only small class of rich filipinos aguinaldo alienated the lower classes of filipino society 7 us forces were able to win their support through contingency operations by showing that they were actually there to help those who supported them ultimately aguinaldos oversight proved crucial to the us campaign as the army was able to use the ilustrados to inﬂuence signiﬁcant portion of the peasant population and prevent them from siding with the rebels the fact that aguinaldo banked on change of us presidency also led to his undoing as this was hardly something he could realistically hope to inﬂuence from his position in the philippines even considering the strong antiimperialist sentiment in the united states at the time also the aims of the insurgency

of support that the revolutionary army disregarded were the ladrones roving gangs of thieves derived from the peasant class that terrorized the countryside given the principale centric nature of the

middle of the conﬂict as they saw that many in the population were cooperating with the americans these tactics grew more and more violent rural collaborationists were slaughtered in evergrowing numbers creating culture of intimidation that served to turn much of the rural population against aguinaldos troops in addition to this the fact that the terrorists imposed taxes on oftenimpoverished local populations and sometimes resorted to force or outright theft to replenish dwindling supplies led to animosity toward them in the countrysideisland geography as limiting factor the revolutionary army as is often the case with island insurgent groups had hard time ﬁghting the us army precisely because of the restrictive archipelagic geography of its homeland each island although large enough for several military theaters did not oﬀer much in the way of hiding places forcing militants to constantly hide among the population after an attack and making it very hard to regroup and recuperate without being discovered the isolation of the islands coupled with the us navy blockade of the archipelago made it diﬃcult for the insurgents to coordinate actions 9 among themselves also even if the revolutionary army had had major outside supporter which it did not it would have been diﬃcult to get support onto the islands further limiting its chances for victory against the united statespoorly trained and armed corps of soldiers th lack f mili tary training in th l w r ranks of the revolutionary army was also signiﬁcant problem as the insurgents were match for the formally trained us troops 10 this is indicated by the signiﬁcantly higher number of casualties suﬀered by the filipinos in nearly any conﬂict with us forces additionally number of incidents were recorded throughout the war in which rebels made serious tactical mistakes such as forfeiting large quantities of weapons in battle as far as armaments go the filipino troops riﬂes did little against the americans superior krags

commanders number of skills and strategies with which to ﬁght insurgents which were huge factor to winning in the philippines the most eﬀective of these was the internment of civilians in concentration camps originating from the successful tactic of restricting indians to reservations which was implemented toward the end of the conﬂict under generals macarthur and chaﬀee 12 the ostensible purpose of this was to separate civilians from insurgents and thus cut oﬀ their base of support within the population particularly through the taxes insurgents levied as well as possible future recruitment and theft of property civilians were restricted from leaving the camps and buﬀer zone between the camps and the outside was created in which everything was burned so as to leave nothing for the insurgents another counterinsurgency tactic derived from the indian wars was the rationing of food among the local population thereby severely restricting supply and removing any incentives for villagers to share their food with insurgentswelltrained corps of soldiers three separate types of the us army forces served in the philippine war the regulars about 65000 soldiers at the start of the war and the state volunteers and us volunteers about 35000 soldiers combined many of the troops had previously served in cuba and puerto rico as well as in the indian wars and had had some exposure to the types of climate and terrain they would encounter in the philippines they were also acquainted with the irregular warfare and contingency operations that would prove to be the bulk of operations in the philippine campaign finally us troops were simply better trained and disciplined 13 than their filipino counterparts who for the most part had formal training in warﬁghting techniquesdevelopment operations simultaneous to combat operations one of the most important steps taken by the army to ensure popular support for its campaign was to pursue what became known as development or contingency operations at the same time as ﬁghting the insurgents from the outset the army was tasked with building and sometimes staﬃng schools setting up governments within rural areas and providing such amenities as modernized sanitation and communications systems schools hospitals and roads this helped sway great number of civilians to the us cause especially after over three centuries under the spanish who had very little interest in providing for the populace other than wealthy landowners the original impetus for these contingency operations was president mckinleys order to defeat the insurgents in humane manner and many commanders took it upon themselves to give their soldiers 11the armys success may be ascribed in some degree to the invaluable experience its top commanders had gained in ﬁghting indians the ﬁnest irregular warriors in the world out of 30 us generals who served in the philippines from 1898 to 1902 26 had fought in the indian wars boot 2002

life many filipinos chose to side with the us army thus providing the local support crucial to antiguerrilla operations adaptation of tactics as result of the geographical and cultural diversity of the phil ippines us army commanders quickly learned to structure tactics in each theater according to individual conditions in dealing with the filipino population commanders took note of the fact that some were inherently more receptive to the us cause and had to be treated diﬀerently they therefore created appropriate incentives to induce diﬀerent populations to cooperate such as imposing stricter punishments to make it unpopular to side with the rebels general order 100 go 100 established in 1863 was the code of warfare in the us civil war and in the philippines it stipulated rewards for those who cooperated with us forces and harsh punishments for guerrillas after general macarthurs appointment the order was stressed to commanders to enforce strong and very visible standard of justice in the philippines besides informing the commanders larger eﬀect of go 100 was that this standard of justice became known to the filipinos collaboration with the guerrillas even indirect would be punished severelydevelopment of filipino auxili ary armed forces and police along with the contingency operations the united states conducted the army also trained two distinct indigenous armed forces in the philippines the constabulary and the scouts and number of rural police forces the constabulary was semiautonomous paramilitary forces set up to ﬁght insurgents shining example of which was the contingent on the island of negros led by brigadier general james f smith 15 the scouts were force originally organized by lieutenant matthew batson in pampanga province which because of its high rate of success at countering guerrilla activity eventually grew into military auxiliary corps of over 15000 16 in fact the scouts under the direction of major frederick funston were responsible for the capture of aguinaldo in north luzon in february 1901 major turning point in the war in raising these forces the army handed over some of the responsibility for the security of the islands into the hands of the filipinos the eﬀect of this was twofold filipinos were often more respected by the population and thus more eﬀective at countering rebel inﬂuence neutralizing insurgents and gathering

operations image that the americans were ruthless colonizers along with other steps toward self government the creation of indigenous forces allowed the filipinos to largely police themselves weaknesses of the counterinsurgents very narrow topdown view of insurgency in the early stages as commander of us forces in the philippines for the ﬁrst stage of the conﬂict general otis assumed wholly unrealistic view of rebel demographics and ideology after talking to number of wealthy filipinos from his outpost in manila otis decided that aguinaldo and the revolutionary forces represented either tagalog despotism or lowerclass anarchy and that ﬁrm policy toward them would secure support from men of property 17 this notion is quickly refuted by the simple facts that aguinaldo was himself principale and that large segment of this group supported him throughout most of the conﬂict nonetheless it persisted in some commanders thinking even after the broaderminded general macarthur succeeded otis by which time the conﬂict had progressed into allout guerrilla warfare occasional brutality the ﬂip side of soldiers experience in asymmetric warfare during the indian wars is that they were also informed by the racist rhetoric behind the conﬂict 18 thus when they landed in the philippines many brought these attitudes along with them making the war unpopular both at home and among indigenous filipinos previously mentioned tactics such as internment of civilians in concentration camps and food deprivation and destruction of property while eﬀective reduced conﬁdence in us troops and took high toll on the population in the form of malnourishment aguinaldo attempted to exploit this to his own ends in thinking that the unpopularity of the war would swing the vote in the united states toward the democrats in 1900 and end the us occupation the ﬁnal phase of the war in 19011902 saw number of violent counterinsurgency operations unacceptable by modern standards the retaliation on the island of samar to the murder of 48 us soldiers in balangiga was particularly brutal summary executions were common usually in retribution for guerrilla violence and torture methods such as the water cure became commonplace as method for obtaining informationharsh climate and terrain and lack of supplies the army found highly unwelcoming conditions once they landed on luzon and these would

not help either as soldiers often had to march over mountains only to ﬁnd themselves in the middle of dense jungle once they had ﬁnished their descent consequently hundreds became sick and died many more suﬀered extreme exhaustion and depression leaving large part of the army generally demoralized 19 another problem caused by diﬃcult terrain was lack of communication among the various fronts during the war often leading to decisions by commanders that contradicted those of others and were ultimately counterproductive conclusions as the us sole unequivocal counterinsurgency success the war in the philippines holds number of lessons for future operations the most important factor in winning the war was likely the attention devoted to gaining the support of the populace through programs such as the creation of strong municipal governments schools and infrastructure within the country the united states was able to ultimately convince the majority of the population many of whom were potential enemy combatants not to side with the insurgents the commander most wholeheartedly committed to this was general macarthur who took the most signiﬁcant steps to gaining the support of both the ilustrado educated class and the principale landowners under macarthur the auxiliary armed forces scouts and constabulary programs really took oﬀ providing the united states with heretofore impossibletoattain intelligence and more eﬀective way to control and protect the indigenous population such programs as concentration camps and food deprivation while controversial helped to cut oﬀ insurgents from bases of support in the civilian population and harsh punishments for collaboration were made visible to the filipinos in go 100 the last and most brutal phase of the war under general chaﬀee contributes the most to the view of the conﬂict as an unjustiﬁably violent one from the side of the americans and rightly so exasperated with the insurgents guerrilla tactics and attempting to extricate us troops from war that had dragged on too long commanders too often overstepped the bounds of president mckinleys mandate to win the conﬁdence respect and admiration 20 of the filipinos although not all us tactics could be justiﬁed it remains fact that in less than four years the us army was able to permanently crush large insurgency in country where it had previously had experience

thrust of the flns strategy during the initial stages of the war focused on creat ing resistance groups and cells whose main task was to recruit new members and impress proindependence mindset on the algerian muslim community subsequently however more explicit tactical use of urbanbased terrorism became evident which was essentially aimed at two main objectives ﬁrst to provoke an overreaction on the part of the security forces that could then be exploited to internationally highlight the algerian struggle for independence second to drive wedge between the local population and the colonial administration the flns shift to urbanbased modalities became readily apparent between the end of 1957 and the beginning of 1958 when during the course of four months the organization conducted range of operations in the heart of algiers european sector notable incidents included two waves of synchronized bombings that speciﬁcally targeted civiliancentric soft venues collectively killing 18 and injuring over 140 3 the assassination of the citys mayor 2wikipedia 2006 3the bombings were conducted in two major wavesone in september 1956 and one in january 1957 targets included the milk bar

establishment at this time5 called out the elite 10th parachute division granting it full authority to do whatever was necessary to restore order in the capital in what subsequently became known as the battle of algiers the decision proved to be one of great import rationalizing that extreme circumstances warranted extreme countermeasures the units commanderinchief general jacques massau authorized wholesale roundups of entire neighborhoods enacted under system of quadrillage in which the city was divided into controlled squareseach one conforming to regional command in addition to extrajudicial preemptive detentions of fln suspects 6 although massaus actions were instrumental in crushing the flns terrorbased opera tions they elicited widespread international debate and consternation just as signiﬁcantly they fostered increased popular sympathy for the insurgentswho despite carrying out bloody atrocities of their own were increasingly viewed as defenders of the peoples rightsas well as polarized and undercut domestic public opinion and support in metropolitan france itself 7 growing domestic and overseas pressure for deﬁnitive end to the conﬂict eventually forced french president charles gaulle who had come to power in 1958 on distinct profrench algerian policy to reverse his stance and concede to negotiating stance that explicitly recognized the possibility of colonial selfdetermination and majority rule 8 the presidents uturn sparked major insurrection among the colons in algeria who in conjunction with hardline elements in the army who were adamant that frances earlier ignominious retreat from indochina should not be repeated in north africa established the organ isation larmée secrète oas an overtly terrorist entity this organization committed itself to an openended agenda of political violence that was intended to provoke leadership crisis in paris through the assassination of gaulle unleash civil war against the metropolitan government police and army and ignite an ethnic war against muslims 9 despite carrying out wave of highly bloody attacks that at its height averaged 120 bombings day the oas rebellion was contained

attempted to destroy the accord through lastditch campaign of urban terrorism vote on the future status of the colony was taken on july 1 1962 11 this subsequently returned nearly unanimous12 result in favor of independence which was duly conferred to algeria two days later13 the wars overall toll was immense during the course of eight years an estimated 15 million algerians either disappeared or were killed in addition over two million residents were dislocated from their homes and third of the countrys economic infrastructure destroyed french military losses amounted to 18000 dead 6000 from noncombatrelated causes and 65000 wounded with europeandescended civilian casualties exceeding 10000 including 3000 fatalities in 42000 recorded terrorist incidents 14 strengths of the insurgents the flns main strength revolved around its expeditious use of terror to alter the political text of the algerian conﬂict as noted in the preceding section the adoption of this operational tactic was primarily designed to provoke overreaction on the part of the french security forces as well as to garner national and international support for the groups independence agenda 15 in both endeavors the fln was remarkably successful and this remains perhaps the most enduring legacy of its insurgency the chief architect of the insurgents terror strategy was ramdane abane the flns top theoretician entirely selftaught he was as wholly unsentimental as he was ruthless retaining complete and unalterable faith in the utility of civiliancentric violence many of abanes views reﬂected the thinking of carlos marighela whose minimanual of the urban guerrilla is perhaps the bestknown revolutionary treatise laying out the reasoning behind the use of terrorist tactics 10for detailed account of the evian agreements see horne 1977 chapter eleven 11the oas eventually signed peace treaty with the fln on june 17 1962 12some six million out of total population of 65 million voted in the referendum 13wikipedia 2006 14wikipedia 2006 15the flns adoption of civiliancentric urbanbased modus operandi was also instrumental in conceptualizing the ﬁrst philosophical eﬀorts to justify the tactical resort to terrorism the ideas of frantz fanon and jeanpaul sartre both of whom advocated the systematic use of violence as cleansing force that could free an individual from feelings of inferiority despair and inaction were directly inﬂuenced by the algerian war and represent perhaps the clearest attempts to exonerate terror as an allembracing end in itself rather than merely functional means to particular objective see wardlaw 1982 p 41algeria 19541962 21 from the moment large proportion of the population begin to take his activities seriously his success is assured the government can only intensify its repression thus making the life of its citizens harder than ever homes will be broken into police searches organized innocent people arrested and communications police terror will become the order of the day and there will be more and more political murdersin short massive political persecution the political situation of the country will become military situation 16 abane applied this logic to the algerian context with dispassionate eﬃciency between 1957 and 1958 pointedly declaring that for every fln ﬁghter executed hundred frenchmen would meet similar fate the taunt which was subsequently mirrored in the unleashing of an intensive campaign of urban bombings in the heart of algiers was unambiguous and explicitly aimed at goading the authorities into the type of overreaction that could be readily leveraged to alienate the local population from the colonial administration just as important abane appreciated the role of terror in bringing an otherwise silent cause to the attention of the world community this became clearly evident in the now infamous directive nine in which he rhetorically asks is it preferable for our cause to kill ten enemies in an oued dry river bed of telergma when one will talk of it or single man in algiers which will be noted the next day by the american press 17 the flns adoption of terror proved decisive paris was indeed provoked into initiat ing draconian highly brutal response discussed below that completely alienated the native population destroyed the middle ground of muslim political compromi and drove formerly passive algerians if not directly into the ranks of the fln at least away from the colonial administration the security forces actions also served to disgust domestic public opinion in france which in turn signiﬁcantly undercut popular support for continuing with the war 18 just as important from the end of 1957 the conﬂict in algeria became notable fea ture on the international diplomatic and political landscape not only was the conﬂict hotly debated in the united nations security council and general assembly but several leading arab states also declared unambiguous support for the fln cause in what was eﬀectively the ﬁrst concerted show of middle eastern unity on global issue in addition there was growing awareness of the war in both britain and the united states with washington in particular expressing concern that military equipment supplied to france for north atlantic treaty organizations nato purposes notably helicopters was being misdirected and used to quell the algerian insurgency 19 as horne sums up disheartening to france as it was encouraging to the fln in their campaign for interna tionalization was the growing awareness of the war in both the united states and britain inevitably this brought hostility to frances role in it as in france the battle of algiers 16marighela 1982 p 37 17abane quoted in gaucher 1965 p 262 18hoﬀman 1998 pp 6364 martin 2005 p 53 horne 1977 chapter eleven 19wikipedia 200622 money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations had done much to publicize the war which was now being echoed in anglosaxon opinion20 weaknesses of the insurgents one of the main weaknesses of the insurgents particularly in the early stages of the conﬂict was miscalculation that their rebellion would be actively supported by the civilian population there were at least four reasons why the fln believed that local muslims would readily endorse its call to arms first the indigenous population was deprived of all political rights second virtually the entire algerian economy was in the hands of the french or metropolitan settlers third many veterans who had fought with great bravery against nazi germany during world war ii and subsequently alongside france in indochina were dismayed at the lack of recognition they garnered from paris particularly the colonial governments refusal to grant them equal status much less citizenship this assessment however quickly proved erroneous although national sentiment was not opposed to the attainment of sovereign independence per it was not especially radical and certainly far less so than in morocco and tunisia both of which gained their independence at roughly the same time part of the reason for this derived from the support paris garnered from notorious muslim tribal chiefs and elitist judges clerics and bureaucrats whose interests were served by the french presence in addition although colonial rule did not fundamentally improve the political rights of the indigenous population it did help to improve their socioeconomic condition through the provision of schooling and housing and the eradication of disease just as important there was concerted attempt by the colonial power to eradicate local culture and traditions which allowed algerians to assimilate french norms and customs without forsaking their own finally there existed strong middle ground of political compromise that was conﬁdent that degree of genuine autonomy could be achieved through peaceful democratic devolution of power 21 the flns misreading of grassroots support for independence was particularly signiﬁ cant as it initially caused the group to substantially overestimate its chances for success on the battleﬁeld indeed the movements leaders had concluded early on that france was military paper tigera perception that was largely derived from series of defeats inﬂicted on the colonial power in indochina tunisia and morocco all of which preceded the algerian insurgencyand would certainly be match for an insurgency with strong popular base as hoﬀman notes however two years after the commencement of hostilities the fln had precious few tangible eﬀorts to show for its eﬀorts and there was certainly sign of an imminent french withdrawal from the territory 22 20horne 1977 p 243 21hoﬀman 1998 p 61 martin 2005 pp 5253 22hoﬀman 1998 p 61algeria 19541962 23 strengths of the counterinsurgents th ugh th f ren ch w ere ul timatel fo r ced t wi th dra w fro m algeria so m aspects f i ts campaign against the fln are worthy of consideration in terms of eﬀective coin noteworthy was the institution of twopronged doctrine of paciﬁcation that was pursued following the draconian restoration of order in algiers and that was aimed at 1 obtaining the support of the population and 2 starving the fln of vital external support and internal territorial control to accomplish the ﬁrst task paris moved to provide humanitarian assistance to local muslim communities pledged full protection for those who sided with the army and through the notion of association guaranteed that the colony would be recognized as constituent part though not integral component of the french republic 23 with concomitant rights guar anteed for all its citizens24 simultaneously the french army moved to stop the external ﬂow of materiel and person nel support to the fln by reestablishing control over algerias land borders to this end an electriﬁed barbedwire fence complete with mineﬁelds radars and patrol zones for armed elements was constructed along the colonys borders with morocco and tunisia the barrier was intended to act as ﬁshnet for the frontier regions that security force interdiction units could then use to both round up rebels who had covertly crossed into algeria as well as identify the routes they had taken 25 the ultimate goal of paciﬁcation was to politically and operationally asphyxiate the fln in order to reestablish secure environment for reuniﬁcation without exposing the people to excessive risk french army colonel gilles martin explains how the concept was put into practice to achieve these goals the army replaced civilian administration unable to act in secure areas it took over the management of schools clinics road maintenance the water supply and so on to help administer these functions the army divided algeria into grid of regions sectors and subsectors at the lowest level an infantry company controlled few villages and couple thousand inhabitants the same soldiers who used shovels ﬁrstaid kits and schoolbooks reinforced security administered the population and fought the rebels 26 paciﬁcation worked well in several respects the strategy which necessitated extensive and sustained contact between army units and their assigned villages helped to build measure of trust within elements of the local population although this by means neutralized the lingering eﬀects and trauma caused by massaus brutal campaign in algiers in number of instances communitarian bonds were established and leveraged to create selfdefense units known as harkas these forces operated in tandem with the military and were eﬀectively used 23it should be noted that this provision arguably undercut pariss hearts and minds strategy as it eﬀectively forced algeri ans to accept permanent inferiority as department of france 24martin 2005 pp 5556 see also galula 2006 25martin 2005 p 56 26martin 2005 pp 555624 money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations to seek out and destroy rebel strongholds equally the use of border barriers was so eﬃcient that it made external inﬁltration more or less impossible prompting fln cadres across the maghreb to deliberately abandon their homebased comrades reﬂecting these successes by 1960 the insurgents had more than 5000 members ﬁrm area from which to conduct and plan oﬀensive attacks and real objective beyond survival 27 weaknesses of the counterinsurgents by far the greatest weakness and mistake exhibited by the counterinsurgents was how they reacted to the flns adoption of an urbanbased campaign of terrorism as suggested above the response by the security forces was as absolute as it was brutal indeed the various methods employed by general massau to restore order and control in algiers eﬀectively amounted to an institutionalized regime of torture interrogation techniques were extremely harsh embracing electrocution simulated drowning and directed abuse speciﬁcally aimed at degrading human dignity detainees who refused to talk were eliminated and together with those who simply died during questioning disposed of in cleanup operations that became so prevalent they earned the slang expression work in the woods 28 overall it is thought that almost 40 per cent of the casbah arab quarter were arrested or detained during the course the four months some 3000 of whom were never heard from again29 that these tactics were eﬀective in crushing the flns operational capacity there is doubt however france was unable to capitalize on the groups battleﬁeld weakness largely because the governments use of ruthless and repressive tactics during the battle of algiers had fatally exposed the bankruptcy of the central governments rule not only had indigenous muslims been irreconcilably estranged the metropolitan population had become totally disillusioned with the idea of an algerie française and international opinion was squarely behind decolonization thus although massau claimed that the parachute divisions actions were justiﬁed in smashing the flns urban campaign of terror it is evident that they came at enormous political cost 30 as paul teitgen the secretarygeneral of the algerian governorgen eral at the prefecture remarked all right massau won the battle for algiers but that meant losing the war 31 the reality of the situation was quickly recognized by gaulle who within two years of assuming the presidency had come to accept that retaining control over the north african territory was longer tenableeven in the face of vigorous opposition to french withdrawal by both colonial settlers as well as hardline elements within the french army 32 accepting the 27martin 2005 pp 5556 wikipedia 2006 28horne 1977 pp 198206 wikipedia 2006 hoﬀman 1998 pp 6263 martin 2005 p 53 29wikipedia 2006 rosie 1986

military battle in algeria but lost the politi cal war goaded into holds barred policy of eradication by the flns adoption of terrorism the case study is sad but necessary illustration of what can occur when western democracy relinquishes its authority and responsibility and allows the military to conduct coin campaign unfettered by the rule of law as hoﬀman observes the battle of algiers remains perhaps the most signiﬁcant episode in the flns insurgency in that it succeeded in removing any semblance of moral legitimacy from paris while simultaneously exposing the rebels to favorable world attentionjust as abane had calculated 34 full and complete victory for the french was essentially impossible under such circum stances irrespective of its military standing by the end of the 1950s the political initiative lay ﬁrmly with the fln the flns government in exilethe gouvernement provisoire république algérienne gpra which was established in tunis in late 1958had been recog nized by morocco tunisia and the soviet union as well as several other arab asian african and east european states labor unions in britain and the united states were openly calling for algerian muslim selfdetermination and in france growing antiwar movement had begun to take root the political dimension of the algerian conﬂict was lesson that was to inform the think ing and tactics of numerous national liberation movements across the world yassir arafat for example explicitly singled out the seminal inﬂuence that the fln experience had on the plos own struggle against israelone that was to be reﬂected in the intensive diplomatic agenda pursued by the late palestinian leader throughout the 1990s and 2000s 35 nelson man dela similarly identiﬁed the civil war as one that was to have major bearing on the ancs decadeslong eﬀort to end white minority rule in south africa observing that the north african colonial conﬂict was the closest model to the situation confronting his own movement he readily appreciated the crucial signiﬁcance of the nonmilitary sphere on successful proindependence struggles taking away the chief lesson that international and domestic opinion is sometimes worth

at paciﬁcation in south vietnam which met with mixed success for the purpose of this paper north vietnam is discussed in conjunction with the insurgent forces because that country supported and directed the insurgency in the south and recognized the inseparability of the political and military aspects of the war the part of the war discussed in this paper had three phases the beginning of

vietnam and was to be reuniﬁed with an election in 1956 as prescribed by the geneva accords by this time the perception had changed in us policymaking circles regarding the importance of southeast asia north vietnam was perceived as fallen domino in the cold war and south vietnam was seen as domino at risk 1karnow 1997 p 192 28 money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin

autonomy instituted land reforms that increased the power of the landowning elite and exacerbated social tensions by promoting to government posts family members and catholics who were often tainted by association with french colonialism when diem refused to hold elections for reuniﬁcation and began to have moderate success arresting his political opponents many of them communists north vietnam decided to begin its reuniﬁcation campaign to avoid violating the geneva accords it founded the national liberation front nlf in 1960 as façade for its covert activities in south vietnam 2 in 1961 us advisers were sent to south vietnam to help combat the developing insurgency 2in addition to members of the nlf thousands of viet minh from the war against the french had remained in the south to aid

1963 summer protests and monk selfimmolations hastened the demise of his regime and he was overthrown and assassinated in november 1963 for the better part of the remainder of us involvement in south vietnam the leadership of the country became revolving door further obstructing the goal of defeating the insurgency north vietnam seeing the resulting chaos following the coup increased its inﬁltration of the south in august 1964 on the assumption that two us destroyers had been attacked in inter national waters in the gulf of tonkin president lyndon johnson requested that congress pass the gulf of tonkin resolutionin eﬀect blank check that facilitated us escalation of the conﬂict in 1965 the airﬁeld at pleiku was attacked giving johnson pretext to send combat troops to vietnam when the troops arrived the situation was such that the paciﬁcation that had taken place under diem was put on the back burner as the americans and south vietnamese struggled to stave oﬀ military defeat by main force viet cong and north vietnamese military units phase iii the paciﬁcation era 19681972 the north vietnamese and the viet cong launched the tet oﬀensive in january 1968 the same year in which the us troop level in south vietnam peaked to just over 500000 tet was watershed for both sides as in the aftermath of tet the bulk of ﬁghting shifted from the severely weakened viet cong to the north vietnamese army on the us side public opinion in opposition to the war forced the government to seek disengagement from the conﬂict by increasing south vietnams ability to ﬁght the war and thereby reducing the need for us combat presence process that was commonly referred to as vietnamization because of the insurgents weakness following tet the united states and south vietnam were able to uncover much of the insurgent infrastructure and intensify paciﬁcation eﬀorts with moderate success despite their fear of alienating powerful landowners the south vietnamese government enacted land reform law designed to eliminate some of the populations grievances and coopt one of the insurgent causes unfortunately many of the reforms undertaken during this phase were enacted too late to be eﬀective strengths of the insurgents throughout the conﬂict the insurgents learned from other insurgencies and were adaptable in their techniques 3 because of their experience resisting the chinese japanese and french occupations they had already learned which methods worked against more powerful enemy therefore when us combat troops entered the conﬂict in the early 1960s the insurgents were able to start from tested base of knowledge built over the past 15 years many south vietnamese cadres were brought north for training and education in 1954 and subsequently 3ho chi minh lived in moscow for two years studying how to organize revolution and the north vietnamese and viet cong learned from other insurgencies and followed maos example30 money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations reinﬁltrated which added to that base of knowledge the insurgents were also sensitive to the facts that the war and its tactics were constantly changing and that to avoid defeat they needed to change at an accelerated pace 4 between 1954 and 1963 north vietnam addressed the weaknesses in its own regime and consolidated power while carefully monitoring events in the south fearing that if it were to act prematurely it would destroy all it had gained during the period of internal stabilization following the french withdrawal 5 the north vietnamese respected diems nationalist cre dentials to the extent that he would prevent large us military presence which is why they did not use force when diem refused to hold elections in 1956 6 they also maintained hope that his regime would collapse on its own as result of its unpopularity and that they could quickly overrun the south before the americans could react 7 despite these measures north vietnamese sources say that the insurgents took too long to transition from political struggle to armed struggle 8 to build political and military base for guerrilla war and exploit the unrest resulting from diems inept governance the north vietnamese created the nlf in 1960 which was an umbrella organization consisting of the viet cong the cao dai and hoa hao religious sects and minority groups who felt alienated from the south vietnamese government such as the montagnards and khmers 9 the nlf was directed from north vietnam and led by dang lao dong vietnam workers party members as well as south vietnamese who had been trained in the north and reinﬁltrated back to the south the peoples revolutionary party prp created in 1962 served as the southern counterpart to the north vietnamese dang lao dong and its infrastructure operated at six levels central oﬃce for south vietnam cosvn region province district village and hamlet 10 the nlf structure was extremely decentralized which contributed to the movements success as the village party committee had great deal of autonomy in determining local policy 11 politically the insurgents couched their appeals in terms of liberation from foreign oppression and rule by corrupt puppet leaders and made sure that their leadership included noncommunist ﬁgures to broaden the appeal of their cause overall their appeal was one of 4we must pay attention to the development of forms of war so that we can respond to the requirements of each period when it is necessary we must change in time outdated forms of warfare taking up new ones which

opportunity to have better life in terms of cadres assigned to each task political activity exceeded military activity12 threeman cells kept ﬁghters disciplined maintained the ﬂow of information and ensured that ﬁghters were indoctrinated with the purpose of the struggle cadres were left in their home areas to work among their own people which helped draw recruits from established social networks exploited their familiarity with the villagers and the target area and made use of preexisting trust acting as shadow government the nlf sought to alleviate hardships by providing food implementing land reform lowering taxes and tightening security in the countryside it created mass associations at the village level which were integral to the political struggle and to the involvement of the population in the movement and helped move their primary association away from their traditional family structures and closer to communal organization as in north vietnam the insurgents built free schools and health clinics and used facetoface encounters with citizens and psychological operations psyops through the press and radio to counteract us leaﬂet campaigns the insurgents also used discriminate terrorism to keep both committed and uncommitted villagers and cadres in line knowing that the south vietnamese government was too weak to protect them the insurgents attacked symbols of us and south vietnamese authority to highlight counterinsurgent inability to provide security for the population using propaganda assassination ambush and other forms of terrorism and coercion they intimidated enemies and encouraged fear and respect among those already committed to the cause they also collected taxes at will and destroyed many main roads making it diﬃcult for the south vietnamese government to control rural areas the insurgents sought sanctuary in foreign territories and used it for the transportation of weapons because the us fear of escalation prevented the bombing of laos and cambodia until the ﬁnal years of the war this strategy allowed the insurgents to control their losses dictate the pace and intensity of the war and hold the strategic initiative they knew that us public opinion would not support highcost protracted conﬂict as was the case in france in the 1950s in north vietnam chinese manpower was used so that their own men could be available to ﬁght in the south which deterred the united states from bombarding close to the border with china 13 weaknesses of the insurgents although the insurgents were successful in surprising the counterinsurgents and in securing psychological and political victory during tet the military operation was failure because it devastated the viet cong manpower supply in such way that for the remainder of the war the north vietnamese troops bore the brunt of the ﬁghting although tet was considered 12pike 1986 p 234 13schulzinger 1997 p 210 32 money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations political victory for the insurgents they lost many supporters as result of their brutality in the villages they conquered after tet the insurgents continued to suﬀer from public relations errors because they had to resort to forced enlistment to replenish their supply of ﬁghters because new recruits were not volunteers they were not as committed to the cause as fully indoctrinated voluntary recruits had been additionally because of population displacement as result of tet the insurgents found it harder to depend on the population for supplies and taxes thus some areas were taxed harder than others leading to additional alienation from the insurgent cause overall the upheaval caused by tet enabled the counterinsurgents to intensify paciﬁcation and made the contested population more inclined to support these eﬀorts 14 in addition to these posttet diﬃculties the insurgents had several ongoing weaknesses the indoctrination and organizational style of the insurgents was such that they used lot of paper in analyzing their progress and planning for the future which created lot of intelligence for the counterinsurgents once cadres and insurgent bases were captured 15 additionally insurgent military and organizational techniques were slower to adopt more ideal pace of progress making the insurgents feel that they were not keeping up with the progress and adaptation of the counterinsurgents 16 north vietnamese sources acknowledge that the insurgents underestimated the eﬀects of paciﬁcation and counterinsurgent capabilities and were thus slow in executing countermeasures 17 finally the insurgent bases in liberated zones were small and isolated which exacerbated their eﬀorts to replenish manpower and equipment weaknesses of the counterinsurgents as of 1962 the us army was doctrinally unprepared to act in its capacity as an adviser in counterinsurgency which partially explains the diﬃculties the americans and south vietnamese had with paciﬁcation in the early 1960s although the army field manual 1005 discussed how to wage war against an enemy that used irregular tactics it neglected to discuss good practices for training the forces of host nation in this capacity 18 that said even if the united states had been equipped to advise army of the republic of vietnam arvn there is good chance they still would have encountered diﬃculties as arvn was generally incompetent at both conventional and unconventional operations as result of the us predilection for ﬁghting conventional wars the americans trained the south vietnamese to counter conventional invasion from the north while shortchanging the struggle against the insurgents in the south 19additionally the army chief of staﬀ when 14cassidy 2004

any good sol dier could handle guerrillas20 thus instead of soldiers being trained thoroughly in the art of counterinsurgency they were minimally trained for coin as an added duty consequently there was signiﬁcant time lapse of several years before the problem was correctly identiﬁed and the solutions correctly applied 21 the insurgents did not have an end date on their tour of duty and were committed to the war for the duration of the conﬂict unlike us soldiers who served 12month tours of duty the short duration of their tours of duty and the shortterm mindset meant that by the time they understood what techniques were required to combat the insurgency they were longer on duty 22 with the mindset that vietnam was just another small stepping stone in the cold war oﬃcers were rotated every six months to broaden their combat experience which prevented them from gaining an intimate knowledge of their areas of operation technology dictated the type of war that was fought by the counterinsurgents and had the unintended eﬀect of working against the goals of paciﬁcation the united states relied heavily on airpower and ﬁrepower because it was averse to heavy casualties and possessed an overwhelming technological advantage this strategy often harmed civilians especially harassment and interdiction ﬁre where the army ﬁred at an unseen enemy with particular target in mind largescale operations were preceded by heavy bombing alerting insurgents that counterinsurgent forces would soon be entering an area in addition to radicalizing the population the counterinsurgent predisposition to use technology foiled one of the key elements of paciﬁcationthe provision of security for the population in exchange for intelligence sir robert thompson british counterinsurgency expert renowned for his involvement in paciﬁcation in malaya believed that the united states relied too heavily on helicopters and were never mobile on their feet which hindered their ability to gather intelligence from the population conversely the viet cong were able to control contested populations because they lived among the population and discredited south vietnamese government oﬃcials in saigon who were rarely physically or psychologically proximate to the population viet cong proximity to the population also made it more complicated for the counterinsurgents to discern who the enemy was coupled with the fact that in many cases the viet cong were the population as of march 1964 it was estimated that the viet cong controlled 15 percent of the people and 30 percent of the territory in south vietnam 23 because of the rapidly deteriorating political and military situation in south vietnam the counterinsurgents were forced to focus on the military dimension of the insurgency with little regard for the inseparability of the political and military in insurgent strategy 24 in eﬀect the counterinsurgents were ﬁghting two utterly 20hunt 1995 p 19 21the john f

command the breakdown of communication between diplomats and military advisers contributed to the persistent lack of coordination once the united states became aware that the war could not be won unless it addressed both military and political issues realization embodied by the cords program the situation had deteriorated to the point that the reforms could not have suﬃcient impact the police often the root of intelligence collection provision of local security and unearthing insurgent infrastructure were understaﬀed underfunded and poorly trained the national police force had signiﬁcant trouble recruiting suitable candidates because preference went to arvn for males between the ages of 18 and 28 and the recruits they did manage to attract were not paid very well 25 consequently the police were often involved in corrupt activities that compromised the success of paciﬁcation although the phoenix program which will later be described in detail was successful at gathering intelligence from prisoner interviews in an eﬃcient manner it was plagued by several weaknesses as well as accusations of being an assassination program quotas encouraged the south vietnamese to make arrests in retribution or simply to achieve the suggested number of insurgents captured and neutralized and quotas were later eliminated because of this problem additionally the legal system was not advanced enough to process the detainees making the prisons breeding grounds and indoctrination centers for villagers who had previously been indiﬀerent 26 the counterinsurgents were eventually able to establish system for processing prisoners to mitigate the programs weaknesses much of the problem with paciﬁcation was the unreliability of the saigon government although there was signiﬁcant debate among us oﬃcials as early as 1955 as to whether diem was the right man for the job the united states sought alternative to his leadership until 1963 even though his government lacked authority and popularity with majority of the population like the leaders who followed him diems greatest concern was staying in power and he was consequently unable to deal with the insurgency despite the leaders inability and sometimes outright refusal to implement political reforms that would have abetted paciﬁcation the united states did not have the option of completely cutting aid to south vietnam for fear of further weakening the countrys government 27 since foreign embassy personnel were discouraged from traveling outside saigon the americans developed an unhealthy reliance on governmental sources which were not always trustworthy but reduced the perceived need to gather intelligence from the population in the countryside further allowing counterinsurgents to maintain their distance made the correct decision to pursue primarily conventional war of attrition when us combat troops arrived in 1965 the author believes that it might have been the wrong decision to shortchange the political and unconventional aspects of the war at this time as the methods of ﬁghting the war should not have been seen as zerosum and should have been addressed in terms of longterm eﬀectiveness

the goal of improving paciﬁcation eﬀorts in 1966 revolutionary development cadre program was established to mimic the organization of the nlf in this program highly trained and motivated men were sent to work in villages to ameliorate conditions for villagers and establish rapport between the governors and the governed some units even used the same hitandrun tactics of the insurgents against conventional enemy forces us presence was often crucial to the success of these programs because the populations in question especially ethnic minorities tended to be suspicious of the intentions of the south vietnamese government 28 these particular programs designed to mobilize the population had mixed outcomes on one hand it showed that the united states knew enough about the cohesiveness of certain populations to build civil defense units around them on the other the arvn units that were supposed to come to the aid of village defense units were often slow in responding if they responded at all which diminished the villagers view that the government of south vietnam gvn could provide for their security the marine corps combined action program cap was created in 1965 with the hope that marines with prior combat experience in vietnam and the proclivity to work side by side with the vietnamese would reside in villages protect them from the viet cong and train locals to protect their own villages at the outset of each marines tour he was trained in the political structure and culture of vietnam but not in the language which prevented the program from achieving maximum success the fact that the cap units were scattered also prevented the program from having maximum eﬀect because they were not nearly networked enough to come to the aid of cap units in other villages overall the program had mixed success and was eﬀective at attacking the viet cong infrastructure vci using indigenous forces by the time the program was discontinued the cap which represented only 15 percent of the marines in vietnam accounted for 76 percent of enemy killed 29 the most successful and innovative approach to paciﬁcation was the cords program which began in 1967 under the direction of robert w komer the special assistant to the president and deputy for paciﬁcation in vietnam the programs purpose was to unify all paciﬁcation eﬀorts under one agency so as to eliminate the impasse between civilian and military bureaucracies which it more or less accomplished the success of the cords program relative to prior paciﬁcation eﬀorts can be attributed to bureaucratic politics and the realization that twopronged approach was needed for paciﬁcation both civilian and military personnel brought strengths to cords that ensured its successthe military with its vast resources and manpower and the civilians with their understanding of the political nature of the war komers assertive personality and his good rapport with the new macv commander general 28blaufarb 1977 p 106

and adaptive the timing for such innovation although late in the conﬂict was well timed for the tet oﬀensive tet was political victory for the insurgents but their military losses were considerable and they required time to recuperate consequently compromising their ability to hinder paciﬁcation recognizing this advantage general abrams implemented clearandhold strategy in which counterinsurgents would clear contiguous areas of insurgents and pacify the residents of that area 30 by 1970 at least 90 percent of the population of south vietnam was paciﬁed releasing arvn to ﬁght the insurgents and increasing civilians incentives to cooperate with the counterinsurgents 31 the phoenix program was created in 1968 and was designed to sever the link between the ranking viet cong and the population by neutralizing or killing the vci which was engaged in recruiting and training of cadres 32 since the vci was required to remain in contact with the population to maintain the traction of the cause it was extremely visible and therefore vulnerable unlike insurgents who could remain hidden whenever they felt the need to do so the program was decentralized with south vietnamese chief who was superior to his us adviser whose role was restricted to advising and calling in us military support local indigenous forces were used to attack the vci because they were familiar with the terrain and the inhabitants of the villages which allowed the military to focus on the provision of security throughout the programs existence almost 82000 vci members were neutralized blow that north vietnamese general later described as extremely destructive although much of this can be attributed to the losses suﬀered by the insurgents during tet 33 had the counterinsurgents understood the importance of the vci in the early years of the insurgency when it was most vulnerable they may have encountered greater success in their political and military operations during this paciﬁcation period in an attempt to coopt one of the insurgent causes president nguyen van thieu undertook such reforms as the election of local governments and the land to the tiller act 1970 to ensure that the south vietnamese had political and economic stake in the future of the country the land to the tiller act was one of the most successful reforms carried out by the south vietnamese government because it sought to eliminate one of the underlying causes of the insurgency and contributed to the amelioration of the economic situations of those it aﬀected in the ﬁrst three years of the program alone the percentage of south vietnamese living or working on land they did not own dropped from 60 percent to 10 percent 34 30andrade and willbanks 2006 pp 923 31boot 2002

1975 marked the end of the 30year vietnam war for indepen dence and the ﬁrst defeat for the united states at the end of the conﬂict 24 million south vietnamese civilians were dead as well as 58000 americans 230000 arvn and 550000 north and south vietnamese insurgents the end of the war was watershed for the united states not only because it created an aversion to ﬁghting small wars and prevented the lessons of vietnam from being institutionalized but also because the united states was perceived as paper tiger and world power in retreat after the fall of saigon laos and cambodia were quick to fall to communism and the soviet union became emboldened in other parts of the world that the insurgents must have been successful in their techniques because they won the war is conclusion that should be avoided because many of their strategies and techniques met with mixed success what is most important however is that they learned from their successes and failures and were extremely adaptable in their techniques the insurgents were adept at combining the military and political aspects of their war in classic insurgent fashion and were able to successfully mobilize the people of south vietnam as weapons against the government their decentralized organization provided social services where the government could or would not which increased their legitimacy with those they sought to convert to their cause knowing that the united states had an advantage in conventional warfare they lured the counterinsurgents away from population centers because they understood that the war was not over territory but over the loyalty and control of the population and ﬁnally they used terrorism to coerce those who were undecided to join the cause to intimidate those who were already committed and to ensure that all cadres were thoroughly and continually indoctrinated with the cause that said the war was not won by the insurgents but by conventional invasion from north vietnam as the last three years of the war were mostly fought by north vietnamese conventional forces likewise one should not assume that the counterinsurgents lost because they were unsuc cessful in their techniques as paciﬁcation had mixed outcomes the counterinsurgents eventually understood that they needed uniﬁed politicalmilitary solution for the war but the time lost between the beginning of the insurgency and the implementation of these reforms allowed the insurgent infrastructure to mature and grow stronger once the importance of the insurgent infrastructure was established the counterinsurgents were able to counter it by implementing programs to attack and gather intelligence from it and legally process detainees in manner that minimized population alienation by not fully understanding the political cause behind the insurgency the counterinsur gents were thus unable to successfully coopt the insurgent cause until much later in the conﬂict the counterinsurgents underestimated the eﬀect that land reform if carried out correctly in the insurgencys early stages would have had on the insurgent cause and the eﬀect that us combat presence had on the erosion of the gvns legitimacy and authority the inability and sometimes unwillingness of the gvn to combat the insurgency and provide security and social services for the population and us government support for these successive regimes further eroded what little authority they had 38 money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations partly because of the dire state of the war when us combat forces entered it in 1965 technology and ﬁrepower dictated the way the war was fought and inhibited the counterinsurgents from understanding that they needed to become more primitive in their techniques to combat the insurgency heavy reliance on technology contributed to the alienation of the population and hampered the counterinsurgents ability to gather intelligence about the viet cong and vci however not using the maximum amount of the most sophisticated technology would have been antithetical to the us military culture and would have increased casualties and decreased public support because of this preference for conventional warfare on the heels of us involvement in two large conventional wars in the 1940s and 1950s many potentially successful counterinsurgency programs were dismantled and their resources redirected to purely oﬀensive military operations additionally the us view that the war in vietnam was sideshow for the larger cold war battles had leaders rotating troops frequently to give them battleﬁeld experience rather than leaving them in place long enough to learn about their environments on the other hand the counterinsurgents were eventually willing and able to use such insurgent tactics as smallunit patrols and the formation of mass associations which demonstrated their eventual openmindedness to new ideas and their ability to take advantage of enemy setbacks as in the posttet era ultimately the unity of command for cords and the advantage of its timing during period of severe enemy weakness allowed the counterinsurgents to make inroads in paciﬁcation while the use of indigenous forces and locals freed the military up for security operations and added legitimacy to south vietnamese counterinsurgent operations had the counterinsurgents been able to enact the same reforms in the early 1960s that they did later that decade they may have encountered greater success and their lessons may have been preserved for future generations engaged in counterinsurgency operations unfortunately because of the outcome of the war this was not the case one may conclude that some of the lessons that can be drawn from counterinsurgent operations in vietnam include the recognition of the marriage between the political and military in an insurgency the desirability of longterm perspective open to many possibilities harsh objectivity in the face of failure and penchant for adaptability as well as the fact that successful paciﬁcation campaign run by foreigners is not viable alternative to paciﬁcation and maintenance of political base by the host nation39chapter five salvador 19801992 angel rabasa1 origins and characteristics of the insurgency salvador has long history of social violence the country is the most densely

sandinistaled insurgency in nicaragua the nicaraguan insurgency was broadbased movement that incorporated elements on the political spectrum from conservatives to marxists but the sandinistas controlled the armed component unlike the situation in nicaragua in 1979 however there was broadbased support for armed insurgency in salvador despite substantial weapons deliveries from cuba and nicaragua and the lack of readiness of the salvadoran military which was then under us arms embargo fmln ﬁnal oﬀensives in january 1981 and again in early 1982 and in 1989 failed to overwhelm the salvadoran government as the salvadoran armed forces grew more capable with the inﬂux of us military assistance after 1981 the fmln reverted to classical guerrilla tactics and the war developed into stalemate 11 strengths of the guerrillas the fmln carried out robust insurgency for period of eight years despite signiﬁcant us military support for the salvadoran government the insurgency was ended by peace agreement that gave the fmln role in the political life of the country some of the factors that account for the insurgencys resilience are the following ability to generate signiﬁcant forces by 1983 the fmln was able to ﬁeld force of 9000 to 12000 combatants giving the salvadoran army less than 41 overall advantage and could mount battalionlevel operations involving as many as 500 to 900 ﬁghters despite improvements in the salvadoran armed forces as the result of the us train andequip program the guerrillas maintained the ability to mass forces overwhelm isolated garrisons and ambush relief columns to coordinate operations the fmln established sophisticated internal communications system linking its fronts throughout the country 12 adaptability after us assistance to the salvadoran military began to turn the military balance against the guerrillas the fmln adapted to the growing strength and capabilities of the salvadoran armed forces by breaking down large columns into smaller squads and adopted new tactics including increased use of land mines and homemade weapons attacks on us military personnel and salvadoran military training centers and urban operations

external support the arms pipeline from cuba and nicaragua was critical in sustain ing the salvadoran insurgency before the general oﬀensive of january 1981 tons of modern weapons primarily usmade arms from captured stockpiles in vietnam were delivered covertly to guerrilla forces in salvador 14 arms shipments continued throughout the period of the armed conﬂict usually transported by small

political front the fdr never enjoyed major ity support among the population lack of mass support was manifested in the failure of several ﬁnal oﬀensives 1981 1982 and 1989 to provoke mass uprising as anticipated by the fmln the guerrillas strategy of systematic attacks on the countrys infrastructure also cost them loss of popular support the massive turnout at the 1982 and 1984 elections despite the threat of violence could be considered repudiation of the guerrillas methods as well as their aimslack of political legitimacy the guerrillas were weakened politically by sustained dem ocratic

to prevent us assistance to the salvadoran government from the beginning the guerrillas and their supporters were aware that us support over time could tilt the military balance in favor of the salvadoran government as eventually happened therefore the guerrilla strategy in early 1981 was to overwhelm the government before us assistance to salvador could resume us military assistance to salvador was resumed by the carter administration on january 16 1981 16 until the signing of the peace agreement in 1992 fmln supporters and sympathizers mounted campaign in the united states and

support declined as result of changes in the international environment after 1989 the retrenchment and subsequent collapse of the soviet union and the end of soviet assistance to cuba and nicaragua raised the risks and costs to those countries of continuing to support the salvadoran insurgency the sandinista government of nicaragua also came under additional pressure because of us support of the nicaraguan resistance which some us oﬃcials presented as reciprocal treatment for the sandinistas for their support of the salvadoran insurgency strengths of the government the strengths and weaknesses of the government side were in some respects the obverse of the guerrillas strengths and weaknesses the main strengths of the salvadoran government during the civil conﬂict which in the end enabled it to prevail were the following political legitimacy before the 1979 coup salvadorlike most central american countries except costa ricahad tradition of genuine democratic governance the

federal republic of germany also provided economic and military assistance to salvador restructuring of salvadoran military and security forces at the onset of the insurgency the salvadoran armed forces were barracksbound defensively minded organization with severe deﬁciencies in command and control tactical intelligence tactical mobility and logistics the us security assistance program was designed to address these deﬁciencies and transform the salvadoran armed forces strategy doctrine training and equipment with minimum of direct us involvement the ceiling on the number of us military trainers in salvador was ﬁxed at 55 personnel throughout the armed conﬂict for most of the us military assistance program to salvador the training mission was special forces mission it represented the us governments awareness that the united states was not ready to send conventional forces so soon after the end of the vietnam war the brigade operational planning and assistance training team opatt mission lasted 12 years and was one of the longestrunning us special forces missions the special forces involvement had much to do with the success of the us security assistance program to salvador 18 in the context of this military assistance program the united states trained the sal vadoran armys rapid reaction battalions that played key role in moving the salvadoran armed forces out of the strategic defensive 19 in formerly guerrillaheld areas the government implemented civic action program that consisted of rebuilding the social and economic infrastructure and training civil defense units to protect key targets and free the military to engage in oﬀensive operations 20 finally after the counterinsurgency eﬀort gained momentum in the mid1980s the morale of the government forces was usually high and not on the verge of collapse as alleged by some critics of the war 21 18comments by robert everson review of manuscript january 2007 see also bailey 2004 19us library of congress

governments forces were able to hold their own in decadelong armed conﬂict they evidenced signiﬁcant weaknesses that made the outcome at times uncertain strategic vulnerabilities these vulnerabilities derived from salvadors geographic and demographic conﬁguration unlike for instance colombia where farc formations generally operate in peripheral areas at considerable distances from major population centers in salvador the guerrilla strongholds were within striking distance of the countrys main cities and critical infrastructure the eastern region of salvador the fmlns main area of operations suﬀered the brunt of the attacks but part of the country was immune in its 1989 general oﬀensive for instance the fmln attacked military installations in major cities throughout the country including the capital san salvadorlack of border control these strategic vulnerabilities included lack of control of sal vadors border with honduras and the maritime border with nicaragua in the gulf of fonseca salvadoran refugee camps on the honduran side of the border were used as sanctuaries by fmln guerrillas 22 overreliance on air mobility because of the largescale guerrilla attacks on bridges and roads especially in the initial stages of the conﬂict the salvadoran military depended heavily on air transport this was both strength and weakness the heavy use of uh1h helicopters for mobility resulted in high down ratioparticularly since many of the helicopters delivered by the united states to salvador were aging and frequently of poor quality similarly most of the a37s required excessive unscheduled maintenance time 23 fortunately for the government side the salvadoran rebels never introduced surfacetoair missiles which would have compromised the use of aircraft in transport and close air support roles by government forcesimperfect government control over security fo rces and continued human rights violations death squad activity some of it allegedly linked to elements of the security forces continued throughout the period of the insurgency although the number of political murders declined signiﬁcantly after duarte became president in 1984 allegations of human rights violations constituted signiﬁcant obstacle to the eﬀorts of the reagan and ﬁrst bush administrations eﬀorts to maintain congressional and public support for the government of salvador uncertainty of continued us assistance opposition among sectors of the us congress to continued assistance to salvador created uncertainty about the future of us assistance the salvadoran armed forces responded to the uncertainty of continued funding by hoarding essential materials to the detriment of warﬁghting 24 22some of these camps were in the bolsones pocketssmall demilitarized strips of land along the border

percent of the labor force between 1978 and 1985 and real wages declined by about onethird between 1983 and 1987 25 economic distress led to the christian democrats loss of their parliamentary majority in 1988 to the victory of the rightwing arena party in the 1989 presidential election conclusions salvador was the theater of the most successful ussupported counterinsurgency eﬀort since the 1960s 26 the insurgency was defeated despite signiﬁcant weaknesses on the govern ment sidewhich included poorly trained and equipped government forces at the beginning of the insurgency an almost total lack of civil defense key element in the successful guatemalan counterinsurgency campaign and signiﬁcant external support for the insurgents this external support as noted above enabled the fmln to generate large guerrilla force by salvadoran standards that as late as 1983 operated at will throughout the countryside and inﬂicted heavy casualties on government forces 27 what turned the tide was politicalmilitary strategy implemented by the us and salvadoran governments on the political side the salvadoran government was able to assemble broadbased coalition from conservatives to christian democrats that was led for much of the war by josé napoleón duarte ﬁrst as member of the junta that replaced the romero government and then as president of salvador 19841989 duartes credibility as democratic reformer was indispensable in maintaining us and international support for salvador during the war 28 on the military side the united states implemented trainandequip program that transformed the salvadoran armed forces from static defensively minded organization into force capable of oﬀensive operations against the guerrillas the transformation of the salvadoran armed

any permanent solution to the salvadoran armys strategic problem short of striking at the nicaraguan root of the guerrilla movements military strengtha task beyond the capabilities of the salvadorans

tables on the sandinista government which was forced to ﬁght for its own survival while supporting the salvadoran insurgency finally the geopolitical change brought by the collapse of the soviet union

shifted east to jk with great deal of support from the pakistani government furthermore with the continual encouragement and support of the pakistani directorate for interservices intelligence isi the mujahideen began to view jk through religious lens as jihad in the 1990s tensions in the region increased as did the level of violence coordinated attacks 1although the 1971 war was initiated by

atal bihari vajpayee accepted the invitation of his counterpart in pakistan nawaz sharif and traveled to lahore to continue peace talks optimistic hopes for peace were shattered few months later when

redeployed the vast majority of its forces to its border with pakistan and both nations braced for the possibility of another war amid the already heightened tensions another terrorist attack this time targeted at the wives and children of indian soldiers occurred in kashmir on may 14 2002 pakistan insinuated the possible use of nuclear weapons after india issued stern warnings for islamabad to discontinue support of the terrorist elements involved although the situation was gradually deescalated the future of the region remains unclear strengths of the insurgents historically islamic militant groups and paramilitary forces have directly helped the pakistani government obtain strategic and military objectives 3 in turn islamabad has granted such organizations very wide latitude to operate throughout the country pakistans regional proximity to afghanistan and the middle east has come under the spotlight since the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 president musharraf although usdeclared ally in the global war on terror has continued to maintain an ambiguous stance on terrorist activities and crossborder inﬁltration into jk in 1999 when many indian battalions were rapidly redeployed to the kargil area to battle the crossborder intrusion there was an increased ﬂood of militants into the kashmir valley as result the successful outcome of the kargil conﬂict was underscored by disappointing setbacks in coin operations across jk there were many attempts by the isi to disrupt the 2002 elections by ﬁnalizing the for mation of the kashmir liberation army an organization that would establish uniﬁed command structure and communication network for terrorist groups across jk the existence of such an organized and wellestablished terrorist network in the region would undoubtedly reduce the visible link to the isis direct involvement in crossborder terrorism and therefore mask any semblance of guilt 4 following the decline of the jammu and kashmir

apparent that jk was gripped by higher level of insurgency than had been experienced before it was quickly determined that the regular army already engaged in curtailing crossborder inﬁltration along the loc could hardly cope with the full range of coin operations furthermore the heavyhanded tactics of purely military approach to the insurgency was resulting in inadvertent civilian deaths and collateral damage this coupled with the consistent diﬃculty of determining the location of militants among the population was causing increasing alienation and discontent interservice quarrels in 1993 following the creation of uniﬁed headquarters uh in jk caused additional setbacks created to coordinate coin operations among the army paramilitary and police forces the uh was ineﬀective and counterproductive as indias oldest paramilitary force the border security force bsf wanted to place the rashtriya riﬂes under its command the rr units staﬀed by regular army personnel looked down on the bsfs abilities and dismissed such notions furthermore early rr battalions lacked cohesion as they were assembled by amalgamating soldiers from diﬀerent battalions 12 northern com mand also began the challenging task of reorienting soldiers to coin operations by adapting political approach that concentrated on the population rather than on the militants language diﬀerences unit traditions and high degree of equipment variance at the battalion or even the company level were all barriers to successful early deployments in the valley it was not until after the kargil war that northern command was able to act on lessons learned from early mistakes strengths of the counterinsurgents northern command has since been heavily involved with additional civic and developmental operations following the success of its initial largescale operation the indian government approved funding for additional projects in the early years following the end of the world war ii the indian army composed

uncertainty lowintensity conﬂict is all about highspeed change chaos and disorder it demolishes in one stroke all traditional military concepts applicable to general war the contradictions are simply too many 13 to successfully and consistently combat insurgent forces coin forces must create and maintain secure environment that can be regulated with relative ease this requires the deployment of security forces across the region according to indian doctrine there are ﬁve important steps must be taken to successfully conduct coin operations separation of civilians from insurgents the use of linear grid systemphysical domination of an area of responsibility aorrestraint in use of airborne and landbased ﬁrepowercivic action winning the hearts and minds the ﬁrst requirement to successfully carry out coin operations is to isolate the insurgents from the local population by temporarily shifting the civilians to villages already secured by indian forces this better allows security forces to eﬀectively screen the locals for insurgents as the threatened regions of jk are vast and require large numbers of security person nel the indian army has regulated its coin operations through the use of grid system an army battalions aor is essentially demarcated by the level of insurgent activity and the ease with which operations can be carried out because of such factors as terrain and size of local population the large grid can then be further divided into smaller sections that can then be moni tored easily by company or platoonsized unit of soldiers if necessary ﬁre support can also be called in to deal with larger insurgent groups as coin operations are often conducted on the platoon level or sometimes even squad level the implementation of such system helps to reduce gaps and allows unit not only to observe its aor more consistently but also to dominate it with strong physical presence in an area and vigorous patrols conducted during both day and night security personnel are able to observe and regulate given village and the access it has to its surroundings soldiers cultivate human intelligence humint through cache of local assets and agents direct familiarity with the villagers can help soldiers detect the presence of any unusual or suspicious persons 13ray 199756 money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations additionally the indian army made conscious decision to severely curb the use of air borne and artillerybased ﬁrepower while conducting coin operations to minimize collateral damage and corresponding casualties the excessive escalation of ﬁrepower during ﬁreﬁghts has severely disrupted the local population and caused much higher unintended casualty rate two unsuccessful coin campaignsthe us military in vietnam and the soviet army in afghanistanyield examples of the negative consequences that result from the continued overuse of heavy ﬁrepower in civilian areas forces carrying out coin missions must have formidable resource of men and equip ment as this sort of restraint can be costly in closequarters combat casualties to the coin forces will be unavoidably higher than if using distanced artillery strikes or air support in addition to traditionally military operations it is of vital importance to actively engage and promote interaction between the security personnel and the civilian population lieutenant general s c sardeshpande reaﬃrms that counter insurgency operations must of necessity be an intimate mix of military operations civic actions psychological operations and politicalsocial action 14 good media relations can also eﬀectively showcase coin operations providing increased comfort to the local population and even intimidating insurgent groups active and continuous interaction with both local and international media groups can serve as force multiplier keeping the population informed can only help to alleviate any alienation within it recently 15 corps of the indian army launched an expensive and ambitious project operation sadbhavana the brainchild of lieutenant general arjun ray it was largescale venture aimed at improving life for the civilians of ladakh in jk with an initial cost of close to 1 million the plan called for constructing schools hospitals and community development centers and providing water and electricity the project also included tours for locals to diﬀerent parts of the country and the improvement of roads and bridges across the state the project was widely acclaimed and declared success 15 it is important to note that these civic actions were conducted on signiﬁcant scale and in transparent genuine manner the government determined that worthwhile facilities for the population had to be properly planned and initiated with proper followthrough to start winning hearts and minds clear and visible diﬀerence in the lives of the locals was also needed if they were to begin trusting security personnel otherwise the feelings of alienation would foster further antiindian sentiment anit mukherjee who served in the rashtriya riﬂes in kashmir and nagaland writes after the ﬁrst year of conducting operations with questionable

indian security forces are simply unable to guard the entire stretch of the loc from inﬁltration military success regardless of how extensive can never defeat an insurgency indian soldiers as part of

violencia and the subsequent military dictatorship of general gustavo rojas pinilla were brought to close by the national front in 1957 in which the countrys two dominant parties the liberal and conservative parties agreed to end their confrontation and alternate in power for the following 16 years see figure 71 for map of colombia this context is necessary to understand the development of the modern colombian insur gent movementsprimarily the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc and the national liberation army eln 1 the cuban revolution and the beginning of soviet support for national liberation movements in latin america encouraged the advocates of revolutionary change in colombia to challenge the national front governments through armed struggle in 1961 the colombian communist party declared the revolutionary path in colombia could require combination of all forms of struggle the armed struggle was launched on foundation of experienced ﬁghters the farc leader pedro antonio marin better known by his nom guerre manuel marulanda vélez or tiroﬁjo sureshot for instance began his guerrilla career in 1949 when he joined liberal guerrilla band in the department of tolima one of the epicenters of the violence in 1964 marulanda helped to establish communistoriented independent republic in marquetalia remote area in southern tolima this was one of several republics established by communistoriented guerrillas in southern colombia marulanda escaped when the colombian army attacked and destroyed the marquetalia guerrilla group in june 1964 in 1numerous minor guerrilla groups developed in the early stag of the colombian insurgency for instance the chinese backed popular liberation army elp the erp the guevarista revolutionary army erg the m19

bogotapanamaaragua colombiavenezuela guyana brazil peruecuadorcaribbean sea north pacific ocean 1966 the communist guerrillas denominated selfdefense forces were reorganized as farc with marulanda as military commander2 the farc expanded slowly between the mid1960s and the 1980s in its early stages farc guerrillas engaged in ambushes of military units and raids on farms the main objectives were capturing military equipment securing food and supplies capturing hostages and settling scores with informers in this early stage the farc was more concerned with survival than with expansion 3 in 1974 the organization established general staﬀ and secretariat to provide political direction nevertheless during this period the farc operated only in remote marginal areas of the country and did not pose serious threat to stability this situation changed in the 1980s when the farc began to implement the expan sion strategy set at its 1982 seventh conference funded by resources captured from the illicit drug trade until that time the farc like other revolutionary organizations was reluctant to become involved in the drug trade which it considered counterrevolutionary 4 with the 2the farc

ﬁrst to consolidate control of cocagrowing regions second to extend the theater of operations to the entire country so as to force the government to disperse its forces and reduce its ability to regain the military initiative third to isolate the capital bogotá and other major cities and fourth to transition to largescale military operations culminating in general uprising 5 the eﬀectiveness of the farcs strategy and operations can be assessed in terms of its successor lack thereofin attaining these objectives the second group considered here is the eln unlike the farcs ruralorigin leadership the eln leadership was composed of university students who followed the havana line the eln also attracted radicalized catholic adherents of liberation theology the eln suﬀered severe attrition in the late 1960s as the result of government pressure and internal purges but it reemerged in the 1980s under the leadership of guerrilla priest named manuel pérez who died in havana in 1998 the eln has been more reluctant than the farc to exploit the illegal drug trade kidnappings and extortion including protection payments extracted from the oil industry account for most of the elns income but some more pragmatic sectors of the group have become involved in the drug trade strengths of the guerrillas the farc and the eln are some of the longestlasting insurgencies in the world over period of 40 years they have survived eﬀorts by the colombian military to eradicate them and have expanded their presence throughout the country 6 some of the factors that account for the guerrillas survival are the following strategic ﬂexibility the farc and eln have successfully adapted over the years to changed circumstances while maintaining especially the farc consistent strategy of expanding their presence throughout the country the farc has expanded from 350 ﬁghters at its formal establishment in 1966 7 to 32 fronts with 3600 ﬁghters in 1986 60 fronts with 7 000 ﬁghters in 1995 and over 70 fronts with 1500020000 ﬁghters in 2000 8 when the government has gone on the strategic oﬀensivefor instance during the mid1960s plan lazo oﬀensives and after the launching of the uribe governments military strategy known as plan patriotathe farc has gone on the defensive and lowered its military proﬁle to resume attacks at more favorable time later the eln 5fuerzas armadas revolucionarias colombia 1994 6the most serious of these eﬀorts was plan lazo developed by the colombian armed forces in consultations with us counterinsurgency planners in the early to mid1960s plan lazo failed to eradicate the guerrillas but succeeded in eliminating number of guerrilla groups and in extending government control to many contested areas see maullin 1973 pp 6980 7the farc dates its

experienced signiﬁcant growth in the 1980s and 1990s but not as much as the farc it attempted to expand to other regions of the country but by and large the groups ﬁghting force has also remained concentrated in its traditional area of inﬂuence in northeastern colombia unity of command and organization almost since the farcs inception marulanda has dominated the organization ﬁrst as chief of staﬀ and subsequently as head of the secretariat there have been serious challenges to the leadership throughout the history of the organization the farc is hierarchically organized with sevenmember secretariat which provides political direction to the movement and supervises 25 member general staﬀ and the chain of command for the peoples army there is some question however as to the extent to which the secretariat controls the 70odd largely selfﬁnancing fronts dispersed throughout the country particularly after the loss of the demilitarized zone that the farc controlled between 1999 and 2002 in contrast to the farc the eln has experienced signiﬁcant dissension particularly in its early years when the group nearly disintegrated because of inﬁghting and colombian military pressure the most recent purge in 2002 resulted in executions and desertions 9 expanded sources of income estimates of the farcs income range from 200 million to 400 million10 to over 1 billion11 annually half of it from the drug trade according to latin america security analyst samuel logan the old system of limited arms purchases with cash has been replaced by armsforcocaine swaps using the same routes used to smuggle cocaine out to smuggle the guns in the arms suppliers include mexican and brazilian organized crime networks 12 the changed dynamic produced by the drug income is illustrated by the minutes of the farc secretariats annual meeting published by the colombian weekly semana in august 2000 the acquisition of arms currently has permitted us qualitative jump in our process of becoming the ejército pueblo peoples army or farcep 13 as noted above the eln has entered the drug trade partially and more reluctantly than the farc reportedly cocarelated income currently amounts to onethird of the elns revenues 14 the group relies for much of its income on kidnappings and extortionparticularly payments extracted from the oil and mining industries in areas where the eln is active 15

constitute strategic rear guard that enables farc and eln forces to resupply and slip across the border when under pressure by government forces the venezuelan border is particularly problematic because venezuelan president hugo chávez has ignored farc and eln crossborder activity and tolerates their presence and activities in venezuela 16 weaknesses of the guerrillas the weaknesses and shortcomings of the farc and eln if anything are greater than their strengths and make it highly unlikely that either group could overthrow the colombian government in the foreseeable future these weaknesses include the downside of involvement in the drug trade although the drug trade produces high proﬁts it is also an important source of weakness for the farc the eﬀects have been loss of ideological cohesion particularly at the lower levels as some of the commanders have become more interested in proﬁts from the drug trade than in advancing the organizations politicalmilitary agenda b loss of domestic and international support as many potential supporters were repelled by the farcs involvement in obviously criminal activity and c facilitation of the building of coalition in support of the colombian governmentfailure to gain popular support although it has some level of support willing or coerced in its base areas the farc and eln remain deeply unpopular with the colombian public the farc and eln have never registered higher than 2 or 3 percent in popularity polls the guerrillas resort to kidnappings and involvement in other criminal activity attacks on economic targets and indiscriminate attacks on civiliansfor instance the may 2002 attack on church in bojayá which killed 119 personsall contributed to their loss of popular support failure to sustain the move from smallunit attacks to largeunit operations battalion size or larger in the late 1990s the farc attempted to make qualitative jump to higher stage of military operations by engaging and defeating battalionsized units of th c l m b i an ar m d l i c i as i n 1 9 9 6 an d l b i l l ar i n 1 9 9 8 17 however the sequence of successful largescale attacks on isolated army units was broken at the battle of mitu november 1988 where for the ﬁrst time the colombian military used oncall air power to defeat farc attempt to overwhelm the local garrison since then the colombians have used airland synergies to prevent guerrilla concentrations the eln has never attained the ability to mount largescale operations over the last several years in fact the organization has come under pressure by the

and it is now largely concerned with survival18 failure to mount sustained attacks on strategic centers although in the 1980s and 1990s the farc carried the armed struggle beyond the traditional guerrilla areas in periphery and even mounted attacks near bogotá in 2000 it failed to challenge the governments control of the countrys populated heartland there is mixed record with regard to economic warfare the farc and eln have attacked the transportation communications and energy infrastructureinterdicting highways destroying electricity towers and attacking oil pipelines however this activity has not disabled vital economic assets in 2004 the colombian economy was one of the best performing in latin america with an annual growth rate in gross domestic product of 35 percent failure to deploy sophisticated weapons the farc and eln have been very ingenious in using locally available materials to develop improvised weapons such as homemade propane cylinders ﬁlled with explosives launched from improvised mortars fashioned from 55gallon drums or larger canisters nevertheless despite large revenues and links to international illegal arms networks the farc has not been known to deploy sophisticated infantry weapons especially surfacetoair missiles which could neutralize the colombian governments air superiority critical component in the governments military edge over the farcloss of the demilitarized zone as condition for its participation in peace negotiations beginning in january 1999 the government withdrew its forces from the zona despeje an area of some 42000 square kilometers in southcentral colombia the farc established its headquarters in this zone and used it as sanctuary to launch operations rest and reﬁt its forces and hold prisoners and hostages the zone was the hub of series of logistical and mobility corridors that the f ar c used to move ﬁghters arms and drugs throughout the country after three years of fruitless talks however the pastrana government forces reoccupied the zona despeje in january 2002 the proximate cause was the spike in farc attacks in the preceding months highlighted by the hijacking of an airliner and the kidnapping of colombian senator the underlying reason was the failure of the peace process to produce any resultslargely because of farc intransigenceand the farc overplaying its hand by taking ever more provocative actions political weakness the loss of its sanctuaries in the zona despeje represented deeper political failure on the part of the farc the farcs strategy of simultaneously ﬁghting and talking created tactical advantages for the group but shifted the political dynamics in colombia in favor of advocates of hard line toward the guerrillasas shown by president alvaro uribes election

19531957 since the end in 1974 of the alternation in the presidency of the liberal and conservative parties under the national front arrangement elections have been free and competitive the preservation of constitutional government even under conditions of insurgency and high levels of violence has been key factor contributing to maintaining the governments legitimacy and domestic and international supportpopular and competent leadership as the case of salvador also shows see the discus sion of the role of president josé napoleón duarte competent and credible leadership is critical in rallying government under attack to defeat an insurgency president uribe is regarded as strong and competent leader and his hard line toward the guerrillas generated unprecedented approval rates of up to 70 percent 19 uribes popularity and high regard for his leadership led to the amendment of the colombian constitution that permitted him to run for reelection he was reelected in 2006 with 622 percent of the vote margin of 40 percent over his nearest rival international support improvements in colombias human rights performance and the damage to the farcs image as result of its involvement in the drug trade have helped to maintain strong international support for the colombian government colombia is the third largest recipient of us assistance not counting iraq and afghanistan the european union eu also supports the uribe governments ﬁght against terrorism and drug traﬃcking 20 and provided some 300 million in assistance to the colombian government local governments and nongovernmental organizations ngos for the years 20012006successful adjustment to insurgent strategy and tactics since the mid1990s when the farc was able to engage and defeat battalionsize colombian army formations new operational and tactical approaches on the part of the colombian military including coordinated airground operations have produced improved military performance under uribe the colombian government inaugurated seizea ndhold strategy which substantially increased the territory under government control and expanded overall government forces strength by over 80000 to 207000 active military personnel and 129000 police and other security forces facing an estimated 12000 to 15000 farc 19colombia president rides popularity wave uribe widely seen as toughminded 2005 20the

government also inaugurated program of training and arming local selfdefense forces under military supervision weaknesses of the government despite notable advances over the last several years there are weaknesses in the colombian institutional and military structures that could be exploited by the farc if the colombian governments current eﬀorts faltered these include uribes indispensability the downside of uribes handson style of leadership is that he has become indispensable although his leadership has been instrumental in energizing the colombian governments response to the farc threat and rolling back many of the gains made by the guerrilla organizations in the preceding decades there is obvious successor with uribes charisma and popularity much of the momentum currently on the governments side could dissipate if he were to be removed violently there have been several assassination attempts or when his second term runs out in 2010preservation of farc capabilities and infrastructure despite the progress made by the government forces in clearing strategic areas such as the region around the capital the farc retains presence in almost all of colombias departments including cocagrowing areas in eastern and southern colombia the farcs military capabilities also remain substantially intact some colombian analysts suspect that the farc might have implemented tactical retreat to build up its strength and regain the initiative at later timepersistence of criminal networks criminal networks pervade the colombian landscape these networks traﬃc drugs weapons and other illegal goods and engage in moneylaundering kidnapping and extortion sometimes in league with the farc eln and auc the activities of these groups greatly complicate the governments task of ﬁghting the guerrillas and consolidating state control inability to control borders the colombian government has had great diﬃculty in cre ating secure environment on the borders with panama venezuela and ecuador the farc and to lesser extent the eln maintain signiﬁcant presence and inﬂuence in the border regions as well as sanctuaries on the venezuelan and panamanian sides of the border the governments dilemma is that it does not have enough forces to clear and hold territory in the countrys heartland and simultaneously secure the bordersvulnerability to external interference there is strong evidence that people in vene zuelan president hugo chavezs inner circle have provided support to the farcammunition safe houses documentation and even weapons moreover venezuelas acquisition of sophisticated military equipment from russia and other sources will give venezuela an overwhelming military superiority over colombia even though colombian analysts do not believe that chavez is preparing for war with colombia at min 21international institute for strategic studies 20061 23 4 5colombia 1963present 67 imum the new venezuelan armaments cannot but distract the colombian military from their primary counterinsurgency mission and relieve pressure on the farc conclusions historically colombian governments for the most part considered the existence of the guer rillas as fact of life that could be ignored as long as the guerrillas did not constitute strategic threat to the stability of the state this was viable approach until the convergence of the insurgency and the drug traﬃc gave the farc the means to grow and expand into economically and politically strategic regions of colombia the colombian governments response was to attempt to negotiate with the guerrillas truce with the farc and parts of the eln was in eﬀect from 1984 to 1987 and peace negotiations took place under the administrations of césar gaviria 19901994 ernesto samper 19941998 and misael pastrana 19982002 all of these eﬀorts to reach negotiated settlement failed because the guerrillas were not seriously committed to reaching peace agreement but rather saw the talks as way to gain tactical advantages in longterm campaign to seize power the united states for its own part recognized the nexus between the guerrillas and drug traﬃcking but has failed to identify the political control that the guerrillas exercise over an everlarger part of colombias territory as the center of gravity of the guerrilladrug traﬃcking complex as result us eﬀorts were focused on strengthening colombian antinarcotics capabilities while insisting that us military assistance not be used for counterinsurgency this was unrealistic given the colombian governments inability to eradicate the drug trade where it did not have physical control and the magnitude of the political and military threat that it faced from the growing strength of the guerrillas in short throughout the 1990s neither the colombian government nor its us ally understood the nature of the security problem in colombia this strategic myopia began to be corrected with the breakdown of the peace process in the last year of the pastrana administration and the election of president uribe in 2002 and for the united states with the events of september 11 and the onset of the usled global war on terror the uribe governments counterinsurgency approach embodied in the defense and democratic and security policy and its military component plan patriota centered on consolidating control of territory and protecting the populationclassical counterinsurgency doctrine in addition to increasing defense spending by 30 percent and troop strength by over 80000 personnel between 2001 and 2004 the uribe government has begun to build civil defense units in rural areas under military supervision for its own the united states changed its policy that previously limited the use of usprovided equipment to antidrug operations freeing it up to be used for counterinsurgency operations the counterinsurgency eﬀort in colombia is now therefore based on more adequate strategy and is being carried out more forcefully than at any time since the 1960s although it is too early to make conclusive assessment of the current colombian approach there are indications that the government is meeting its objectives the government has established presence in every one of colombias nearly 1100 municipios in 2000 there 68 money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations was police presence in onefourth of the countrys municipios22 and garnered signiﬁcant successes against the farc attacks by irregular groups as the guerrillas and paramilitaries are denominated on government forces in 2005 diminished by 9 percent from 2004 and by 29 percent from 2003 23 of course one expects that the government will be able to eradicate the guerrillas any time soon rather the expectation is that the new colombian strategy and tactics will gradually reduce the scope of the guerrillas activities and create the conditions for realistic negotiations 22colombian armed forces brieﬁng 2000 municipios are the second level of local administration after the departments currently 32 they are the equivalent of us counties or parishes 23fundación seguridad democracia 2006 on the other hand colombian security analyst alfredo rangel notes that the farcs military capabilities remain intact in many areas and that the process of demobilization of the paramilitaries promoted by the government could paradoxically increase the farcs freedom of action suárez 2005 69chapter eight conclusions lessons learned for future counterinsurgencies lesley anne warner in an age when insurgencies have worldwide reach counterinsurgents can ill aﬀord not to examine the complexities of past cases and the continuities among them especially since the complexities of the insurgency that the counterinsurgents are facing may not be elucidated until much later there is more to gain than to lose by examining past insurgencies as insurgents learn from other insurgencies counterinsurgents should continue to learn from the successes and mistakes of other counterinsurgencies to avoid the repetition of mistakes this may especially be true as the united states continues to confront variety of mutating threats in several parts of the world however in thinking of future insurgency threats the most valuable lesson is that coin successes and failures are loose analogies the insurgencies of the past diﬀer somewhat from the insurgencies the united states faces today in its global war on terror although some characteristics such as the importance of eliminating sanctuary and the importance of providing security for the population have not changed in the following paragraphs the lessons learned from the coin operations in this paper and other cases can be classiﬁed by what the recently released us army and us marine corps counterinsurgency field manual fm 324 mcwp 3335 describes as defensive and oﬀensive stability operations civil security civil control essential services governance and economic infrastructure and development 1 because of counterinsurgencys com p l ex an d m ul tifa ce t d n tur th u th r ﬁn ds i t ins uﬃ c i n t t co m p artm n talize w h t in some cases is lesson that spans two or more of these categories unless speciﬁed these lessons are applicable to host nation counterinsurgents as well as to foreign counterinsurgents as the situation permits according to the counterinsurgency field manual fm 324 mcwp 3335 an eﬀec tive counterinsurgent force is learning organization 2successful coin requires unfettered adaptability and the ability to be an objective critic in the face of failure3 the emphasis here is on the ability to learn from failure as success in coin must not be seen as unequivocal as cohen et argue if program is successful in one province or city it will most likely be 1department of the army and us marine corps 2006 section 119 2department of the army and us marine corps 2006 section 126 3metz and millen 2004 p 2670 money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations unsuccessful in another4 similarly if solution is successful in one counterinsurgency it may be unsuccessful in another possibly because of intervening variables the reason for this paradox is that conditions diﬀer in several places and thus solutions must be custommade for each situation although the insurgency is still ongoing indian counterinsurgents in jammu and kashmir have learned which tactics techniques and procedures ttps bring success and which bring failure and have adjusted their strategy accordingly adaptability to insurgent tactics and the ability to learn from the eﬀectiveness or lack thereof of other coin campaigns proved an advantage in the philippines vietnam jammu and kashmir and colombia in these campaigns counterinsurgents exhibited varying degrees of willingness to learn from the us indian wars the british experience in malaya the indian campaigns against the ltte in sri lanka and colombias own long experience against insurgents granting counterinsurgents local autonomy would hasten the process of innovation and adaptability which should be encouraged and accepted at all levels of bureaucracy 5 rather than having bureaucrat thousands of miles away making general decisions for all theaters of the insurgency local authorities who have their ﬁngers on the pulse of the population can assess the situation on the ground and then determine how best to combat local problems 6 in the case of jk the counterinsurgents have divided their aor into grids which has allowed military units to become intimate with the particulars of their environment as well as reduce gaps in the provision of security military and civilian agencies must work together to create innovative and adaptive coin programs and tactics within the unity of eﬀort the military must secure inﬂamed areas so that political and civic actions can follow building on the success of the security forces the level of interaction between the civilians and the military should be such that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing and how cooperation can facilitate the success of operations if there is not enough communication between civilians and the military bureaucratic competition and deadlock will set in thereby undermining the coin objectives of both sides such bureaucratic cooperation should take place not only in the conﬂict zone but in the seats of government of both the host nation and the foreign counterinsurgents so as to prevent cleavages for the insurgents to exploit 7in this eﬀort it is essential that bureaucratic selfinterest not have detrimental eﬀect on the execution of coin in this paper the case of vietnam is an excellent example of how bureaucratic impasse impeded successful coin in the early years of the insurgency the population may be more likely to accept the presence of foreigners if it sees that they are contributing to progress rather than chaos 8 in the

future counterinsurgencies 71 infrastructure and the protection of basic human rights to improve the lives of the population whose acquiescence they sought by providing the funding and the guidance for such activities as building schools and digging ditches for waste management counterinsurgents can make employment available so that laborers can do honest and productive work toward stabilizing the political and economic situation while providing for their families and stimulating the local economy giving the population way to support itself and showing that counterinsurgents are instruments of change for the better in the process of stabilization gives potential insurgents stake in the process of political and economic development 9 civic and humanitarian actions along with credible pledges of protection in return for cooperation can help the counterinsurgents gather humint although in the cases of algeria and vietnam these eﬀorts came too late to be eﬀective or were undertaken on such small scale that the positive eﬀect was minimal in the case of the philippines humanitarian eﬀorts were more along the lines of carrot and stick in which the population was presented rational choice to either support the counterinsurgents and gain rewards or support the insurgents and face punishment 10 information operations io should be employed to publicize actions that exemplify host nation legitimacy and competence manage the gap between the populations expectations and the counterinsurgents ability to respond to their needs and discredit insurgent propaganda 11 if information is made available to the population explaining how counterinsurgent actions have increased personal security and improved conditions in the conﬂict ecosystem the population may be more inclined to support the counterinsurgents 12 to ensure maximum availability of disseminated information counterinsurgents should use culturally appropriate symbols in multiple forms of communication taking into account which means are most accessible to the population in question much like other aspects of coin the best io will be localized since circumstances diﬀer from city to city and province to province the counterinsurgency field manual fm 324 mcwp 3335 posits that for the coin eﬀort to attain lasting success the host nation needs to achieve legitimacy 13 politically the presence of strong competent democratically elected leaders in salvador and colombia allowed the regimes to maintain legitimacy and gave the population viable outlet for possible grievances to establish or maintain political legitimacy counterinsurgents must be willing to listen to various groups and integrate them in the political process so that they have stake in the future of their country counterinsurgents must sometimes even be willing to listen to the grievances of some of the lessagreeable elements of society as permanent end to the conﬂict 9sepp 2005 p 9 10in instances where the insurgency is of military nature as in jammu and kashmir having counterinsurgents carry out actions to gain the trust of the population or gain intelligence from it can help more than it can hurt as the key to ending an insurgency is often persuading those in the population that they have the opportunity to have better life by siding with the counterinsurgents 11us department of the army and us marine corps 2006

and us marine corps 2006 section 12272 money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations cannot be established unless the various warring factions can see their places in the future of the country in salvador negotiated settlement gave insurgents incentives to lay down their arms and address their grievances through the political process in pursuit of legitimacy and endurance it is important that such agreements be timed so as to minimize the issue of foreign occupation despite providing foreign aid for coin in salvador the united states placed ceiling of only 55 military personnel in the country throughout the insurgency unlike the gradual trans i n fr m d vis rs t co m b t tr p s thr ugh u t u s in v l v m n t in v i tn am co n versely the presence of foreign combat troops as in the philippines algeria and vietnam fanned the ﬂames of nationalism on the insurgent front in two of these cases the insurgency emerged as way to resist foreign occupation which is similar to the insurgencies the united states is facing today since every army of liberation has halflife according to general david petraeus foreign counterinsurgents or even host nation counterinsurgents who are not from that particular area of operations should not expect much latitude making it critical for an expedient return of sovereignty and authority to the host nation in all aspects of coin 14 deciding to help host nation that is facing an insurgency brings up the issue of lever age as dan byman argues foreign counterinsurgents need to carefully determine how best to eﬀectively bridge the gap between their interests and those of the host nation as it is the more critical situation is to us national security interests and the more the united states pledges its support for the host nation the less leverage it has over how its aid money is spent and how the war is fought 15 to mitigate this common diﬃculty byman suggests that foreign counter insurgents diversify their sources of intelligence possibly using ngo status reports and opensource media to augment the volume and quality of information they are being provided as well as consider gathering information on the allys intelligence collection and dissemination activities 16 in contemporary counterinsurgencies we are learning that motivating the population to choose sides is more critical than in the past because of the speed at which information is made available to target populations from either the insurgent or counterinsurgent side using indigenous human capital counterinsurgents should aim to build trust with the population and understand the conﬂict ecosystem through established social networks 17as they should already be endowed with the knowledge of how best to earn the trust of the population the use of indigenous forces especially forces from the particular area in question increases the legitimacy of the counterinsurgents and can also help to divide and weaken the insurgency by psychologically unhinging the insurgents in the philippines algeria vietnam salvador and colombia the counterinsurgents recognized the advantage of arming and training trustworthy civilians to defend their villages which allowed the military more time to pursue the insurgents 14petraeus 2006 p 4 15byman 2006 p 81 16byman 2006 p 112 17david kilcullen quoted in packer 2006 p 64conclusions lessons learned for future counterinsurgencies 73 the use of indigenous intermediaries would help bridge the gap between foreign counter insurgents and the population especially if there are moderates who may be more willing to listen to what each side has to say moderates may be targets of the insurgency because of their perceived proclivity to compromise with the host nation as in the case of algeria counterinsurgents should take advantage of the existence of such population and seek to expand its ranks while oﬀering strong and credible protection as these activists are more likely to become targets of the insurgency enhanced language abilities and cultural training would allow trust to be built at faster paceon both the political and military fronts of the insurgency once those in the population see that the counterinsurgents have made genuine eﬀort to learn their language and understand their culture they may become more amenable to paciﬁcation understanding local dynamics will help put both civic and military actions in perspec tive as the population can hopefully impart wisdom on local conditions existing prior to and during the insurgency allowing the counterinsurgents to better comprehend the general trend of the insurgency 18 counterinsurgents will also need to be aware of the operations taking place in their area of responsibility as well as elsewhere in the region to understand the signiﬁcance and objective of their present operations although making the eﬀort to learn language and culture is valid activity in itself it should also be seen as pathway to unlocking the social nuances of the local population and may reveal potential cleavages to exploit within the insurgency the insurgents are after all part of the population and who better to advise on these cleavages than the sea in which the insurgent swims once the counterinsurgents become reasonably acquainted with any cleavages within the insurgency they should encourage competition among potential factions and may be able to convince individual insurgents to defect by granting marginal demands in certain cases such as the philippines and vietnam counterinsurgent knowledge and exploitation of cleavages within the insurgency and the population as whole abetted the paciﬁcation eﬀort in the philippines vietnam and colombia the counterinsurgents were slow to under stand the complexities of the insurgencies they faced to the detriment of their coin strategies because coin is system of programs designed to react and adapt to insurgency it is important to understand the nature of the conﬂict as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the insurgents counterinsurgents at all levels of operation should seek to understand the insurgent cause so as to undermine it or at least avoid giving it credibility through counterinsurgent actions in this eﬀort the counterinsurgents should try not to cloud their perceptions with their prior belief systems or overreliance on analogies as this may lead to faulty perception of the nature and origins of the conﬂict as well as insurgent grievances additionally foreign counterinsurgents should support the wishes of the population above those of the host nation so as to maintain the legitimacy of the counterinsurgent cause if the wishes of the 18although the insurgency in iraq is not analyzed in this paper pp 2329 of ahmed hashims insurgency and counterin surgency in iraq discuss historical and sociological factors that caused fallujah to become such hotbed of instability in the insurgency 74 money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations population and the host nation are radically diﬀerent it will hurt the counterinsurgent cause to turn blind eye to host nation corruption nepotism and ineﬃciency forcing troops to live close to the population wherever possible can mitigate the percep tion of counterinsurgents as outsiders interested in their own security19because of their physi cal and sometimes psychological proximity to the population the counterinsurgents in the philippines vietnam marine corps cap units and jk were able to gather intelligence to target the insurgent infrastructure and were also able to limit the manpower and supply ﬂows to the enemy such proximity to the population can help counterinsurgents better protect the civilian population and better understand what grievances need to be addressed to drain support from the insurgency counterinsurgency training should be seen as system and should be approached as such by the appropriate authorities there should be an objective individual charged with powers of oversight to make sure not only that there is fusion and continuity among coin programs but that there are gaps or redundancies as well kalev sepp asserts that this person can either be homegrown charismatic leader or foreign adviser in the background who would ideally understand that coin operations and conventional warfare require diﬀerent skill sets and training 20 counterinsurgents should seek to create competent indigenous police force free from corruption accompanied by reforms in the justice and penal systems in recruiting indigenous security forces the counterinsurgents should seek to create force that reﬂects the ethnic religious and socioeconomic makeup of the local population and should make special eﬀort to recruit reasonable number of potentially oppressed ethnic minorities to increase their stake in ﬁghting the insurgency 21 indigenous police should be trained by other police forces who have been steeped in the appropriate institutional culture and capabilities rather than by the military by means should the military do police work because the military is trained to capture and kill whereas the police are trained to detain and interrogate police also protect the population from being coerced into joining the insurgency as well as gather and disseminate intelligence gathered from interrogations in the philippines the police force was instrumental in the capture of the insurgent leader as well as in increasing the appearance of gradual return of sovereignty to the filipinos foreign counterinsurgents should adopt handsoﬀ approach to operationsencourag ing the host nation to develop its own capabilities and learn from its own successes and failures this may sometimes require that counterinsurgents limit themselves to defensive operations keeping in mind that if they oﬀer too much assistance the host nation will have few incentives to learn to develop its own procedures or change ineﬀective ones as cohen et and earlier t lawrence 22 argue it is better for the host nation to do mediocre job than 19tomes 2004 p 24 20sepp 2005 p 11 21this applies to both the police and the military 22do not try to do too much with your own hands better the arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly it is their war and you are to help them not to win it for them actually also under the very odd conditions of arabia your practical work will not be as good as perhaps you think it is lawrence 1917conclusions lessons learned for future counterinsurgencies 75 for foreign counterinsurgents to do perfect job in terms of the legitimacy that would be lost in the process23host nation visibility in the political humanitarian economic and security spheres will help demonstrate its legitimacy and competence with the foreign counterinsurgents playing only supporting role fledgling insurgencies are easiest to crush as they are still formulating cause garnering support and learning eﬀective guerrilla techniques and are thus more susceptible to failure 24 therefore realizing the presence of threat and deﬁning what exactly that threat poses to the host nation and foreign counterinsurgents are critical procedures to undertake before the insurgency gains strength and momentum in fact crushing the insurgency while it is small can save time money and valuable lives but to acknowledge threat is to acknowledge the existence of weakness within the current system that must be corrected the counterinsurgent loses if it does not win which is why it is critical to develop pro grams to target the insurgent infrastructure early while it is still weak and vulnerable 25 for this reason counterinsurgents must have an uncorrupted view of the status of the insurgency and how to combat it at diﬀerent stages in its development when there is lull in the insurgency the insurgents may be lying low and have not necessarily been defeated therefore counterinsurgents must be prepared to pursue insurgents until their ranks have been purged and so severely weakened that they can longer pose credible threat to the state apparatus in the ongoing cases of jk and colombia the counterinsurgents have been unable to completely eliminate the insurgent infrastructure and presence in the country in colombia this has led analysts to assess that the farc may not be in its dying days but may be resting and rebuilding for another round of ﬁghting in contemporary insurgencies the task of eliminating insurgent infrastructure is perhaps more diﬃcult because insurgent use of the internet and other electronic modes of communication provide them with esanctuary which allows them to spread information and gain recruits in highly protected medium to ﬁght insurgencies the counterinsurgents need to remember to become more primitivenot necessarily more sophisticatedin their techniques and to think outside the box advanced technology designed to minimize counterinsurgent casualties often prevents them from having to interact with the population and its abuse results in their alienation and radicalization in the case of vietnam heavy use of indiscriminate ﬁrepower hurt the counterinsurgent eﬀort rather than facilitating it and the host nation in salvador relied too heavily on handmedown helicopters from the united states that often malfunctioned and required constant maintenancea distraction when planning for and ﬁghting the insurgency in contrast the counterinsurgents in jammu and kashmir have realized that they need to minimize the use of ﬁrepower and airpower to reduce civilian casualties in any case counterinsurgents should use technology as way to gather additional information from the population 23cohen 2006 p 52 24byman unpublished research 25cohen et 2006 p 5176 money in the bank lessons learned from past counterinsurgency coin operations during routine interactions as well as to ensure the protection of the population from insur gent retribution counterinsurgent adoption of preemptive detention and torture as extreme counter measures to the insurgency in algeria not only alienated moderates and drove them into the ranks of the insurgency but also caused loss of support from the domestic population in france any political advances were undermined once people became aware of the atrocities committed by the counterinsurgents in pursuit of stability and this ultimately forced france to grant algeria independence similar human rights abuses in the form of death squads eroded government legitimacy in salvador and us soldiers in the philippines undertook violent means such as internment food deprivation and torture to pacify the population preemptive and preventive detention can also radicalize previously unaﬃliated civilians once they come in contact with insurgents who are being detained in the same prison to minimize insurgent use of sanctuary and the inﬂux of manpower and supplies from other countries counterinsurgents must make securing the border high priority depriving the insurgents of the strategic initiative and place to recuperate and regroup counterinsurgent inability to deny the insurgents sanctuary proved to be persistent problem in the cases of vietnam salvador jk and colombia in vietnam the counterinsurgents resisted pursuing the enemy into bordering countries fearing that such action would escalate the conﬂict in jk the ambiguous areas of control and the decadesold tension between the nuclear nations of india and pakistan make pursuing insurgents into their sanctuary in pakistan suicidal in the case of the insurgencies in colombia the insurgents not only receive sanctuary in neighboring venezuela but are also receiving some level of support from venezuelan president hugo chavez on the other hand the counterinsurgents were extremely successful in closing algerias borders to supplies and manpower damaging the eﬀectiveness of the remaining insurgents in algeria the lessons learned from the cases in this paper exhibit several coin ttps that met with varying levels of success and failure factors of perception and mindset have not been discussed here but practitioners and theorists alike must keep in mind that ﬁghting insurgency can be prolonged aﬀair with few obvious successes or easy answers to most eﬀectively manage the complexity of coin counterinsurgents need to think of solutions in terms of longterm eﬀectiveness not shortterm necessityand this especially refers to the successes and failures from past coin operations algeria is prime example of case in which the counterinsurgent perception of shortterm solutions to immediately crush the insurgency counteracted its longterm goals of ﬁnding political solution to the conﬂict above all although multidisciplinary discussion drawing lessons from the past and present is certainly helpful in crafting response to the threat of insurgency creating model for ﬁghting insurgency can be destructive as it may lead counterinsurgents to pigeonhole their responses based on historical analogies that follow the model this is not to say that we cannot learn from history on the contrary when put in perspective having base of knowledge of the outcomes of mix of variables can be valuable resource on which counterinsurgents can drawallowing
