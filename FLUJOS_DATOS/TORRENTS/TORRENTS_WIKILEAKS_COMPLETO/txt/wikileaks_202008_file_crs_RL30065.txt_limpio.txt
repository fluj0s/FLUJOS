independence on june 1 1960 in merger of the former british and italian somalilands despite relatively homogenous population that is over 90somali and the sunni islam faith shared by most citizens postindependence somalia has been characterized by successive conflicts internal conflict has resulted largely from warfare among and within the five major clan groups in somalia the dir the isaq the hawiye the darod and the rahanweyn external conflicts were partly attributable to nationalist desire for greater pansomalia encouraged by former dictator mohammed siad barre somalis make up not only the bulk of the population in somalia itself but are also key group in djibouti and are found in the neighboring countries of kenya and ethiopia the dominant figure in postindependence somali politics was president mohammed siad barre who held power for twentytwo years barre led somalia on socialist path and allied somalia with the soviet union the relationship disintegrated in 1977 when somalia went to war with ethiopia and the soviet union supported the marxist regime in addis ababa after winning the early battles somalia lost the war when its army was overpowered by ethiopian forces supported by yemeni and cuban troops after somalia split with the soviet union the us began providing military and economic assistance in exchange for american access to naval and air facilities us support continued throughout the 1980s until congressional pressure forced the suspension and eventual complete withdrawal of aid because of massive human rights violations by the barre regime in 1988 civil war intensified in the northwest region in the late 1980s although the barre regime won most of the fighting it also carried out reprisals against civilians massacring some 50000 people largely of the main northwestern isaq clan and forcing another 500000 into exile international condemnation followed the attacks including us congressional pressure to suspend economic and military aid to the barre regime full civil war erupted shortly after as opposition to the government spread southward and barre was ousted in january 1991 by the forces of the united somali congress usc which later split into factions led by general mohamed farah aideed and ali mahdi mohammed four months after the ouster of barre the dominant group in the five northwest provinces the somali national movement snm announced the independence of the separate republic of somaliland barre died in exile in nigeria crs2 following the collapse of the central government somalia descended into fighting among at least sixteen rival warlords and their factions for control of mogadishu and other areas of the country famine and lawlessness ensued and an estimated 300000 somalis died of starvation during the year of civil war that followed barres ouster1 after lengthy delays due to security concerns the security council launched operation provide relief the united nations operation in somalia unosom i in midaugust 1992 to provide humanitarian relief the deteriorating security situation eventually left the mission unable to deliver food and supplies to those in need and led to appeal for military support for the humanitarian operation president george bush subsequently ordered 25000 us troops into somalia on december 9 1992 as the us united task force unitaf or operation restore hope2 when president bill clinton took office in january 1993 he was eager to reduce american involvement and turn the mission over to forces unorganized conference resulted in march 1993 resolution among the major faction leaders to end the violence and the then expanded unosom into unosom ii scheduled to take over unitaf and have greater enforcement power for mandate of disarmament and nationbuilding3 the us officially handed over command of the operation to the on may 4 1993 and by june only 1200 us combat soldiers and 3000 support troops remained as part of forces comprised of contingents from 28 nations following the take over of operational responsibility from unitaf to unosom ii the security situation once again rapidly deteriorated particularly in mogadishu where seventeenhour battle on october 3 1993 culminated in the deaths of 18 us soldiers4 almost immediately after the attack president clinton ordered the withdrawal of us troops who left on march 25 19945 the remaining forces

given up on the country although various diplomatic efforts are currently underway to end the violence and establish central governing authority outside entities have attempted to mediate including the governments of ethiopia and egypt the arab league the organization of islamic conference the united nations the organization of african unity oau and the intergovernmental authority on development igad some fourteen cease fires and resolutions for national reconciliation in somalia have been signed and broken since the fall of the central government in 1991 but certain regions has successfully established regional authority structures and the last two agreements brokered respectively by the egyptian government and ethiopia under the igad have given rise to guarded optimism for the future in somalia after the last forces left somalia in march 1995 with support from small contingent of us marines violence continued centered in mogadishu militiamen loyal to rival warlords fought regularly for control of territory and resources yet most battles did little to shift the regional balances of power aideed leader of united somali congress usc faction comprised of members of the habr gadr subclan of the hawiye family maintained control of south mogadishu and declared himself president of somalia while ali mahdi mohammed leader of another usc faction with members from the abgal subclan of the hawiye family held power in north mogadishu ali mahdi was allied with another mogadishu faction leader osman hassan ali atto in fighting to prevent aideed from gaining control of more of mogadishu where green line differentiated areas of the city held by different warlords meanwhile the rest of the country also suffered from violence among warring factions with rival warlords struggling for control in the northwest republic of somaliland the southcentral with significant fighting in baidoa the southwest where violence centered around the port city of kismayo and the northeast where fighting revolved around the chairmanship of the somali salvation democratic front ssdf6 on august 1 1996 general mohammed farah aideed died of injuries sustained in gun battle week earlier with forces loyal to rival warlord ali atto ali mahdi and ali atto immediately called for ceasefire and some observers expressed new optimism for peace in light of the death of aideed who had repeatedly refused to engage in peace negotiations less than week after aideeds death however the leadership of his hawiye clan alliance announced that his hussein mohammed aideed would be responsible for carrying on the battle as the new leader of the faction and he pledged to carry on his fathers policies7 hussein aideed in his mid thirties is naturalized american citizen who landed with the us

leadership council of the united somali congresssomali national alliance uscsna after the election of hussein aideed heavy fighting resumed in mogadishu and the security council issued resolution on august 13 1996 calling for conference between the factions aideed rejected the proposition as outside interference while other leaders welcomed the recommendation violence subsided somewhat in the ensuing months and president daniel arap moi of kenya mediated peace talks in october resulting in resolution to end hostilities remove roadblocks and allow the free movement of people none of these conditions was met the government of ethiopia attempted its own mediation convening most factions to attend talks at sodere resort town outside the ethiopian capital of addis ababa both efforts stalled and severe violence broke out once again in december as aideeds forces battled those of ali mahdi ali atto and musa sudi yalahow relative of ali mahdi who controlled the southern mogadishu suburb of medina fighting persisted throughout 1997 particularly in mogadishu the region outside baidoa in southcentral somalia and the area around kismayo in southeastern somalia the violence still had minimal effect on the balance of power between the various factions prominent somalis launched several serious efforts to advance the reconciliation process such as the formation of the national salvation council in january as part of the sodere peace initiative by the leaders of over two dozen groups including ali mahdi although aideed was excluded from this attempt to establish national government various thirdparty intermediaries such as the arab league the igad the oau and the sought to assist in mediation efforts but met with little success egyptian and ethiopian peace initiatives many organizations and governments have attempted to mediate among the warlords but with little longterm success two initiatives however have recently seemed more promising one led by the government of ethiopia convened in the resort town of sodere in november 1996 the other initiated by the egyptian government sponsored meetings in cairo in december 1997 although the sodere initiative in particular appeared initially to have good chance of success negotiations in that process have since stalled the ethiopian government accused egypt of undermining its efforts at reconciliation by convening the cairo talks in december 1997 and ethiopian ministers have repeatedly maintained that the cairo declaration was detrimental to peace in somalia8 the sodere initiative sponsored by ethiopia with the support of both the igad and the oau convened on november 29 1996 and aimed at forming new central government after three months of talks twentysix factions and their leaders

conference for all somali factions in bosasso early in 1998 the elected president of the republic of somaliland mohammed egal refused to attend the meeting but did leave open the possibility of participating in loose federation with the government formed by the national salvation council aideed and his faction boycotted the talks calling themselves the only legitimate government and refusing to negotiate until the other warlords acknowledged aideed as president aideed has accused the ethiopian government of supporting ali mahdi in the clan struggles for mogadishu under the ethiopiansponsored talks the national reconciliation conference in bosasso stable port city in the northeast held by the darod clan was designed to balance power among the five clans and emphasize the inclusion and input of all factions not only the hawiye subclans fighting for control of mogadishu in spite of continued statements of support and commitment by the warlords and the igad governments the national reconciliation conference was postponed several times during 1998 ali mahdi stated at one point that the delay was to allow aideed to join the process he had begun making conciliatory overtures toward the ethiopian government and the other mogadishu warlords at the end of the igad summit in march 1998 the member governments issued statement noting that the proliferation of parallel initiatives can only undermine the central objective of accelerating the peace process in somalia and urging all concerned parties to bolster the igad peace process on somalia and ensure that all assistance provided to somalia be geared to enhance the peace process and that it be channeled through the igad mechanism the parallel initiatives mentioned in the igad statement referred specifically to meetings in cairo sponsored jointly by the government of egypt and the arab league in december 1997 the igad governments particularly ethiopia accused egypt of deliberately undermining the sodere initiative in order to strengthen egyptian power in the region and weaken the ethiopian position9 tensions between the ethiopian and egyptian governments have been ongoing for decades largely because of power struggle over control of the headwaters of the nile river the nile is the lifeline of egypt and since the main source of the nile is ethiopia egypt has for many years maintained strong presence in the region egypt assumes that successful mediation effort by ethiopia will place the horn of africa country in stronger position in country egypt long considered its sphere of influence therefore mediation in somalia has come to symbolize increased influence in regional matters egypt denied the charges asserting that its talks were more inclusive because of the participation of hussein aideed after more than month of talks and just five days after faction leaders agreed on how many delegates each group would send to 465member reconciliation conference scheduled for february 1998 in baidoa all but two of the major factions signed the somali declaration of principles providing for 13person presidential council prime minister and national assembly the declaration stated that the warring factions agreed unanimously on ceasefire and the disengagement of opposing forces for lasting peace stability and an end to the conflict and civil war 9 ibid crs6 in somalia and the leaders vowed to take immediate steps to rebuild confidence in somalia including reopening the seaport and airport in mogadishu10 under the egyptiansponsored agreement aideed and ali mahdi would each get 80 seats at the meeting with the remainder divided among the other four clans the conference was also slated to occur in baidoa traditionally hawiye stronghold inland from mogadishu the agreement clearly favored the hawiye clan of aideed and ali mahdi both in the number of seats and the location making mogadishu disproportionately important to successful peace talks mohammed haji ibrahim egal the president of the republic of somaliland boycotted the talks asserting the independence of the northwestern region and his refusal to allow its reintegration colonel abdallah youssef and general aden abdallah nur faction leaders in the northeast also refused to sign in opposition to the accord critics of the agreement asserted that aideed participated only because he was allowed to dictate many of the terms such as an extremely high number of seats for his relatively small clan and the location of baidoa since he refused to set foot in bosasso the conference originally scheduled for february 1998 was postponed several times over the course of the past year because of fighting between aideeds militias and other factions and is now scheduled to take place in early 1999 meanwhile 20member delegation established by an international conference held in october 1998 in addis ababa traveled to different regions of somalia at the beginning of december in new effort at reconciliation the group with representatives from ethiopia egypt eritrea italy norway uganda and yemen first visited somaliland to evaluate the involvement of local communities such as religious and womens groups and village elders in the peace process after arriving in mogadishu the group was expelled on december 5 by hussein aideed and ali mahdi who accused the delegates of trying to divide the somali people one representative reported that more and more ordinary somalis were saying they wanted peacethere was feeling that the rival warlords are losing influence and that in number of areas locallybased authorities had exerted control and kept some stability11 the emergence of local administration the inability and unwillingness of somali faction leaders to end their power struggle and cooperate for lasting peace remain the greatest obstacles to the establishment of working government in somalia observers note that key step in restoring stability is to convince rival factions that they are in mutually hurting stalemate situation in which each faction can successfully stand up to the other and defend its own territory but one can extend control or make gains certainly arrangement can be successful without the transparent and goodfaith cooperation of each warlord in each region as former us ambassador to somalia robert 10 somali factions sign powersharing pact move may end 7 years of war miami herald december 23 1997 11 diplomats expelled from somalia bbc news december 5 1998 crs7 oakley stated early last year it is up to the somalis themselves to decide whether they want unitary state or whether they want to continue with individual clans controlling chunks of territory12 although the intractability of the faction leaders themselves constitutes the most obvious barrier to negotiated settlement many observers now argue that perhaps the peace process itself is flawed in that it seeks the wrong outcome they maintain that the peace process must recognize that centralized government is currently unrealistic and efforts should instead capitalize on the strengths of somali culture such as spirit of local autonomy historic arrangements for powersharing and decentralization and strong desire for peace somali analysts suggest that negotiated agreement in somalia has the greatest hope of success if built from the ground up diplomatic efforts should first focus on establishing local arrangements for administration and security then move to regional structures and finally central government which could perhaps be simple loose federation of polities this emergence of local administration should be fostered and encouraged with the longterm goal of central government in mind somalia may well represent failed nationstate in the traditional sense of the term but these observers assert that government structures are indeed functioning in some areas13 the northwest region of somalia is considered by many such analysts to be model for successful regional authority and administration the republic of somaliland seceded from the rest of somalia in 1991 and now has its own flag and national anthem army and police and currency its government collects revenues from taxes levied at ports and roadblocks and vehicle licenses the region has established constitution and parliament and conducted democratic elections despite its government structures and apparatus the republic of somaliland remains unrecognized by the international community the president mohammed haji ibrahim egal and his government administer only three of the five provinces that comprise the selfproclaimed state the eastern area of sanaag is home to different powerful clan which while not hostile refuses central administrative authority the port city of bosasso in northeastern somalia has also been termed success story for clan and local rule14 this red sea port grew from fewer than 10000 residents to more than 80000 over the past seven years largely because of stable government and growing economy in bosasso the local military and political leaders have established regional government controlled by clan elders and held by general mohammed abshir musa

serious threat to its successful implementation mohammed siad hersi morgan chief of the somali national front darod faction of the marehan subclan in southwest somalia declared in september that he planned to set up jubaland state with the southern port of kismayo as its capital as part of new somali approach to find bottom up solution to the situation in somalia members of the international community have also come to recognize the presence and benefits of local decentralized authority the head of the nairobi based political office for somalia announced in june that it would begin supporting regional leaders to form administrative structures and build institutions of civil society and would look to new bottomup approach to peace in somalia in order to form the building blocks for successful federation kenyan president moi also pushed for local administration in talks with aideed ali mahdi and ali atto in april 1998 the three major clan leaders in mogadishu agreed to establish joint administration structure for the capital city they attempted to take first step in that direction with the reopening of the mogadishu seaport in september but the ceremony was marred by militiamen for two other faction leaders who opened fire on the gathering libya has donated 800000 to help pay for the administration of mogadishu including its police force which graduated from

mediation efforts he hosted meeting in tripoli of delegation from the mogadishu administration in december 199816 his apparent interest in seeing reconciliation in somalia coincides with his new interest in african affairs religious leaders have also become stabilizing force in somalia observers report many signs that islamic religious leaders have succeeded in stepping into the power vacuum created by lack of central government17 these include the proliferation of muslim charities the growing influence of islamic religious leaders and particularly the prevalence and power in northern

reconstruction and new economic growth although some observers assert that the fiercely independent nature of the somalis as well as their strong allegiance to clan elders and leaders preclude the evolution of somalia into fundamentalist islamic state others point to the growing number of fundamentalist groups as danger sign particularly noteworthy are accounts that alitahad an islamic fundamentalist group with support from sudan and operating within somalia is engaged in crossborder raids on ethiopia in an attempt to destabilize the region18 over the past year ethiopian forces have reportedly crossed the border with somalia on several occasions in pursuit of itahad forces economic and humanitarian conditions relative peace in much of the country in 1997 and 1998 led to rise in commercial activity and contributed to some economic recovery livestock and fruit exports continued to revive although exports are still hurt by the closure of the mogadishu seaport other positive indications include regular airline flights carrying freight and passengers generally available consumer goods and food financial transfers and banking activity and operating telephone and communications systems as well as computers although the provision of such services remains highly uneven19 somalia remains chronic food deficit country however and some of the most fertile agricultural regions have recently suffered from drought serious flooding or both in november 1997 over 2000 people were killed and as many as 250000 left homeless in the south after torrential rains caused major flooding and devastated crops 20 the world food program estimated on december 9 1998 that 700000 somalis face imminent food shortages and also announced that somalis have the lowest average daily intake of food less than half that of people in developed countries the country ranks 175th out of 175 nations in human development and life expectancy is only 43 years with one in four children expected to die before reaching age 5 united nations agencies had previously announced at the end of november that third consecutive crop failure in southern and central somalia has left

constitute another major impediment to agriculture and livestock particularly in the northwest and along the border with ethiopia22 recent reports indicate that conditions in somalia closely parallel those which precipitated operation restore hope in 1992 one worker recently explained that the problem in 92 was you had drought bad harvests and pay for the militias which raided the crops the militia was eating one else was youve got the same problem now on smaller scale23 combined with the recent crop failures in oncefertile southern somalia is the increased violence throughout the country major clashes have been reported in mogadishu where the new municipal authority recently established night curfew in the southcentral port of merca in baidoa where over dozen people were killed in rocket attack on january 3 1999 in kismayo where over 30 people were reported killed in early january 1999 and in southwestern somalia the red cross longer operates in somalia because of security concerns following the kidnapping of eight employees and two pilots in april 1998 other agencies are having increasing difficulty distributing the much needed food and supplies provided by the united nations and cannot ship food in large convoys because of the threat of ambush24 although the republic of somaliland has enjoyed relative stability for the past several years and has been able to establish some functioning government institutions humanitarian conditions there remain dire receiving assistance is complicated by the fact that the government is not recognized by the international community and refusal to treat the region separately in terms of disbursement refugees international also warned recently that the northwestern transition to democracy could disintegrate without greater aid to offset the impact of large number of refugees equivalent to some ten percent of the population set to be repatriated soon from ethiopia by the to somaliland25 at the end of 1997 more than 465000 somalis were refugees with an estimated 240000 in ethiopia 150000 in kenya 53000 in yemen 20000 in djibouti and 3000 in eritrea further 200000 somalis were internally displaced26 in

issues such as health and food security most us assistance is channeled through usaid and nongovernmental organizations ngos in programs to help minimize future food crises and to help keep the country stable the program in somalia complements the greater horn of africa initiative ghai whose food security and conflict prevention strategies support sustainable economic growth and prevent or mitigate conflict29 issues for the united states after somalia ended its relationship with the soviet union in 1977 and turned to the united states for support somalia became an important and strategic american ally in the cold war even after congressional pressure led to the suspension of aid to the barre regime in 1988 the united states government was eager to restore stability in somalia and resume close ties mainly because of an interest in regional security according to one observer mention of somalia in us diplomatic circles now provokes embarrassment and avoidance behavior30 the policy failures of operation restore hope and unosom ii contributed to increased reluctance to get militarily engaged in africa the mission creep and lack of clarity in the mandate for unosom ii contributed to the deadliest firefight involving us troops since vietnam analysts argue that this made the clinton administration and congress reluctant to involve us forces in other peacebuilding missions particularly in rwanda where genocide broke out just six months after the mogadishu firefight with respect to somalia itself longterm political strategy for reconstruction has been formulated or publicly articulated however the us continues to finance humanitarian assistance through usaid programs and its greater horn of africa initiative ghai to prevent famine and promote

role of peacemaker or peacekeeper too many states have been playing this role31 however some somalis argue that american encouragement of the peace and reconciliation processes now underway could make an important contribution particularly in light of perceived us credibility in somalia hussein aideed claims that we blame the for what went wrong not the us and many somali citizens lament the current lack of us interest and involvement32 by reengaging in somalia through longerterm commitments to reconciliation and reconstruction efforts some analysts note that the united states can protect its regional interests in the horn of africa and also address broader concerns regarding the rise of islamic fundamentalism congress and somalia at the height of the somali humanitarian crisis and civil war in the early 1990s the us congress was actively engaged in efforts to get the international community to intervene to halt deteriorating social and economic conditions and end the civil war since the withdrawal of us and forces however congress has shown diminished interest in events or prospects for peace in somalia the one notable exception is house concurrent resolution 339 first introduced on october 8 1998 by congressmen tom campbell rca and donald payne dnj the resolution which has been reintroduced in the 106th congress in early february 1999 notes the significant level of economic and social stability achieved in the republic of somaliland and urges both president clinton and the international community not to delay diminish or cancel the amounts and kinds of assistance to somalia it further states that aid to northwestern somalia does not constitute recognition of any particular claim to sovereignty by any facto government of the region and calls on the president to increase involvement in the reconciliation and reconstruction processes underway in somalia the resolution was referred to the house committee on international relations and further action was taken 31 ibid 32 reiss bob i am product of the us washington post magazine august 31 1997 crs13 figure 1 map of somalia source adapted by crs cartographic section united nations department
