as interested parties have debated whether and exactly how to change the law congress has inst ead focused legislative attention on narrow bills to extend or modify selected cwa programs but not any comprehensive proposals in the 109th congress two such bills were enacted bill extending authorizations for the long island sound program hr 3963 pl 109137 and another concerning the lake pontchartr

the most prominent legislative water quality issue has concerned financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects at issue is how the federal government will assist states and cities in meeting needs to rebuild repair and upgrade wastewater treatment plants especially in light of capital costs that are projected to be as much as 390 billion over the next two d ecades in the 109th congress the senate environment and public works committee approved s 1400 bill authorizing 20 billion in federa l grants to capitalize state clean water infrastructure loan programs house committee approved bills to reauthorize other clean water act programs h r 624 would have provided 15 b illion in grants over six years for sewer overflow project s and hr 1359 would have extended pilot program for alternative water source projects none of these bills was passed other clean water act issues have received attention from numerous stakeholders but were not considered by the 109th congress in pa rticular programs that regulate activities in wetlands especially cwa sec tion 404 have been criticized by landowners for intruding on private landuse decisions and imposing excessive economic burdens environm entalists view these programs as essential for maintaining the health of wetland ecosystem s these groups are concerned about 2001 supreme court decision the swancc case that narrowed

in achieving the ambitious goals that congress established 30plus years ago to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the na tions waters problems persist the types of remaining water quality problems are diverse ranging from pollution runoff from farms and ranches city str eets and other diffuse or nonpoint sources to metals as well as organic and inorganic toxic substa nces discharged from factories and sewage treatment plants the principal law that deals with polluting activity in the nations streams lakes estuaries and coastal waters is the fe deral water pollution control act pl 92500 enacted in 1972 commonly known as the clean water act or cwa amended by pl 95217 in 1977 pl 97117 in 1981 and pl 1004 in 1987 it consists of two major parts regulatory provisions that impose progressively more stringent requirements on industr ies and cities to abate pollution and meet the statutory goal of zero discharge of pollutants and pr ovisions that authoriz federal financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction both parts are supported by research activities plus pe rmit and enforcement provisions programs at the federal level are administered by the environmental protection agency epa state and local governments have majo r responsibilities to implement cwa programs through standardsetting permitting and enforcement1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33465crs2 2 for further information see crs report rl33466 water quality implementing the clean water act by claudia copelandthe objective declared in the 1972 act of restoring and maintaining the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nations waters was accompanied by statutory goals to eliminate the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters by 1985 and to attain wherever possible wa ters deemed fishable and swimmable by 1983 while those goals have not been fu lly achieved consider able progress has been made especially in controlling conventional pollutant s suspended solids bacteria and oxygenconsuming materials discharged by industries and municipal sewage treatment plants progress has been mixed in controlling discharges of toxic pollutants heavy metals inorganic and organic chemicals which are more numerous and can harm human health and the environment even when present in minute amounts at the partsperbillion level moreover efforts to control pollution from diffuse sources termed nonpoint source pollution rain fall runoff from urban suburban and agricultural areas for example are more recent given the earlier emphasis on point source pollution discharges from industria l and municipal wa stewater treatment plants overall data reported by epa and states indicate that 39 of river and stream miles assessed by states and 45 of assessed lake acres do not meet applicable water quality standards and are impaired for one or more desired uses approximately 95000 lakes nd 544000 river miles in the united states are under fishconsumption advisories including 100 of the great lakes and their connecting waters due to chemical contaminants in lakes rivers and co astal waters and one third of shellfishing beds are closed or restricted due to toxic pollutant contamination for mercur contaminant of growing concern as of 2003 45 states had issued partial or statewide fi sh or shellfish consumption advisories the most recent major amendments were enacted in 1987 pl 1004 this was the first comprehensive revision to the law in decade authorizations for some programs such as general grant assistan ce to states research and general epa support authorized in that law expire d in fy1990 and fy1991 authorizations for wastewater treatment funding expired in fy1994 none of these programs has lapsed however as congress has continued to appropriate funds to implement the act2 the clean water act has been viewed as one of the most successful environmental laws in terms of achieving its statutory goals which have been widely supported by the public but tely some have questione d whether additional actions to achieve further benefits are worth th costs criticism has come from industry which has been the longstanding focus of the acts regulatory programs and often opposes imposition of new stringent and cos tly requirements criticism also has come from developers and property righ ts groups who contend that federal regulations particularly the acts wetlands permit program are costly intrusion on private landuse decisions states and cities have traditiona lly supported water quality programs and federal funding to assist them in carrying out the law but recently many have opposed cwa measures that they fear might impose new unfunded mandates ma ny environmental groups believe that further finetuning tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33465crs3 strengthen the act is needed to maintain progress achieved to date and to address remaining water quality problems legislative activity since pl 1004 following enactment of amendments in 1987 major cwa legislative activity occurred until the 104th congress 1995 the house approved comprehensive reauthorization bill hr 961 that was opposed by environmentalists and the clinton administration critics said that the bill would undermine the existing framework for protecting us wate rs the senate did not take up hr 961 or other cwa legislation in the 105th and 106th congresses comprehensive reauthorization legislation was introduced but action occurred in the 106th congress on bills dealing with specific water quality issues congress passed bill to strengthen protection of coastal recreation waters through upgraded water quality standards and coastal waters monitoring programs pl 106284 cong ress also passed bill pl 106457 that reauthorized several existing cwa prog rams ie chesapeake bay cleanup clean lakes and the national estu ary program and bill to authorize cwa grant funding for wet weather sewerage projects i ncluded as provision of the fy2001 consolidated appropriations bill pl 106554 during its tenure the clinton administration did not offer legislation to reauthorize the cwa but rather initiated number of agencywide and program specific reforms focusing on flexibility and what were termed common sense approaches to regulation the 107th congress focused legislative atten tion on one of the key programs of the act provisions concerning financia l assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects house subcommittee and senate committee approved bills to extend the acts state revolving fund srf pr ogram through fy2007 hr 3930 s 1961 neither bill received further ac tion in large part due to controversies over application of the davi sbacon act which requires that contractors engaging in certain federal contract construction pay workers on such projects not less than the locally prevailing wage for comparable work and over the formula for allocating srf grants among the states the single water quality measure enacted by the 107th congress was the great lakes legacy act pl 107303 it amende d existing great lakes provisions of the cwa section 118 to au thorize 50 million annually for fy2004fy2008 for epa to carry out projects to remediate sediment contamination in the great lakes the bill also reauthorized cwa provisions concerning the lake champlain basin program section 120 cellaneous provisions revive d number of cwa reports to congress that had been discontinued unde r previously passed sunset law pl 10466 and allowed states to use cwa section 319 grant funds for stormwater management projects in fy2003 in the 108th congress attention again focuse d on water infrastructure financing issues although bill was enacted see authorization of wastewater

included loss of electric power after the storm to pump process and treat raw water supply and wa stewater epa and the us army corps of engineers staff have assisted state and local government personnel to evaluate damages efforts continue throughout th region to assess f acilities to determine their operating status including needs to re pair or rebuild but epa reported that six weeks after hurricane katrina more than 95 of wastewater treatment facilities in the affected region were operational lthough many may requi re major repairs or rebuilding even more than year after the storms facilities in some cities serving parts of new orleans for exam ple were not fully operational3 the 109th congress considered wide rang of legislative proposals to aid generally in response and recovery in particular s 1709 passe d by the senate on september 27 2005 would have modified the revolving loan provisions of the clean water act to provide favorable treatment s uch as forgiveness of loan principal and extended repayment for sewage treatment repair or rebuilding projects in alabama mississippi and louisiana it also would have permitted those states for two years to provide cwa assistance even for proj ects not included on states intended use plan since many of the systems affected by hurricane katrina are believed to not be included in the plans the house did not act on this legislation more generally some suggested that environmental review and permitting requirements of the clean water act and other federal nvironmental laws should be modified to enable swift recovery from the storms several bills with provisions intended to do so were introduced s 1711 s 1765s 1766 but r eceived further congressional consideration4 wastewater security since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states congressional attention has focused on security preparedness and emergency response issues among the topics of interest are protection of the nations water infrastructure facilities both drinking water and wastewater from possible physical damage biologicalche mical attacks and cyber disruption5 policymakers have examined number of legislative options in this area including enhanced physical security co mmunication and coordination and research in october 2002 the house passed legislati on to authorize 200 million in grants for security activities at wastewat er treatment plants hr 5169 it also authorized 15 million in technical assistance for small treatment plant facilities and 5 million to epa for improved vulnerability assessment

public works committee approved simila r bill s 1039 srept 108149 in may 2003 further action occurred due in part to concerns expressed by some that the legislation would not mandate vulnerability assessments and would not require that they be submitted to epa as is the case with drinking water assessments required by pl 107188 wastewater security issues again received attention in the 109th congress in may 2006 the senate environment and public works committee approved s 2781 srept 109345 it was similar to s 1039 in the 108th congress in that it would encourage wastewater u tilities to co nduct vulnera bility assessments and would authorize 220 million to assist utilities with assessments and pr eparation of site security plans it also included pr ovisions responding to march 2006 gao report that found that utilities have made little effort to addre ss vulnerabilities of collection systems which may be used by terrorist s to introduce hazardous substances or as access points for underground travel to potential target6 s 2781 would have authorized epa to conduct research on this topic during committee consideration of the bill an amendment was rejected that would have required rather than encouraged treatment work s to conduct vulnerability ssessments and also would have required highrisk fac ilities to switch from using ch lorine and similar hazardous substances to other chemicals that are often referred to as inherently safer technologies further action on this bill occurred legislative issues in the 109th congress the year 2002 marked the 30th anniversary of passage of the clean water act and 15 years since the last major amendments to the law while as noted there has been measurable clean water progress as result of the act observers and analysts agree that significant water pollution problems remain however there is less agreement about what soluti ons are needed and whether new legislation is required several key water quality issues exist evaluating actions to implement existing provisions of the law assessing whether additional steps are necessary to achieve overall goals of the act that have not yet been attained and fining the appropriate federal role in guiding and paying for clean water infrastructure and other activities for some time efforts to comprehensively amend the act have stalled as interests have debated whether and exac tly how to change the law many issues that might be addressed involve making di fficult tradeoffs between imp acts on different sectors ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33465crs7 7 for information

technical or scientific uncertainty and allocating governmental responsib ilities for implementing the law these factors partly explain why congress has recently favored focusing legislative attention on narrow bills to extend or modify selected cwa programs rather than taking up comprehensive propos als other factors also are at work these include general reluctance by most members of congress to address controversial environmental issues in vi ew of the slim major ities held by political parties in the house and the senate lack of presidential initiatives on clean water issues neither the clinton nor the bush administration proposed cwa legislation and since the terrorist attacks of sept ember 11 2001 more prominent congressional focus on security terrorism and iraq war i ssues than on many other topics including environmental protection authorization of water infrastructure funding the acts program of financial aid for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction is central feature of the law at issue today is how the federal government will assist states and cities especi ally in view of the high projected funding needs that exist it received attention in the 109th congress as it has for several years although cont roversies have stymied enac tment of new legislation since 1972 congress has provided total of 765 billion to assist cities in constructing projects to achieve the acts requirements for s econdary treatment of municipal sewage equivalent to 85 reduction of wastes or more stringent treatment where required by local wa ter quality conditions the cwa does not authorize funds for operation or maintenance of complete d projects state and local governments have spent more than 25 b illion of their own funds for construction as well in addition to cwa programs other sources of federal funding are administered by the us department of ag riculture and the depa rtment of housing and urban development7 nevertheless funding n eeds remain very high an additional 181 billion nationwide for all types of projects elig ible for funding under the act according to the most recent needs survey estimate by epa and the states issued in august 20038 in september 2002 epa released study called the gap analysis that assessed the difference between current spe nding for wastewater infrastructure and total funding needs both capital and operation nd maintenance9 in that report epa estimated that over the next two d ecades the united states needs to spend nearly 390 billion to replace existing wastew ater infrastructure systems and to build new ones including for some projects not currently eligible for cwa funds such as system replacement which are not reflected in the epastate needs surveyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33465crs8 10 for

illion the agency estimates according to the gap analysis if there is increase in investment there will be about 6 billion gap between current annual capital expend itures for wastewater treatment 13 billion annually and projected spending n eeds the study also estimated that if wastewater spending increases by 3 nnually the gap would shrink by nearly 90 to about 1 billion annually outside gr oups including coalition called the water infrastructure network have offered proposals that have attracted some congressional interest for multibillion dollar investment program in wastewater and drinking water infrastructure10 the 1987 amendments initiated program of grants to capitalize state water pollution control revolving funds srf or loan programs this program in title vi of the act replaced the previous categorical grants program under which the federal share was 55 of project costs and localities were not obligated to repay federal funds that they received under th revolving fund concept monies used for construction will be repaid by borrowing communities to the states to be recycled for future construction in other communities thus providing an ongoing source of financing states must provide 20 matc h of the federal amount the intent of the 1987 amendments was that fede ral contributions to srfs would assist in making transition to full state and local financin g by fy1995 the essential tradeoff was that states would have greater flexibility to set priorities and administer funding in exchange for ending federal aid after fy199411 all states have established the mechanisms to administer the new loan programs and have been receiving srf capitalizati on funds under title vi for several years many have complained that the srf prog ram is unduly complicated by federal rules even though congress had intended that st ates were to have greater flexibility congressional oversight has examined the progress toward reducing the backlog of wastewater treatment facilities needed to achieve the acts water quality objectives while newer estimates of future funding needs have drawn increased attention to the role of the srf program in meeting such needs small communities and states with large rural populations have experienced the largest share of problems with the sr f program many small towns did not participate in the previous construction grants program and consequently are likely to require major projects to achieve compliance with the law yet these communities often lack an industrial tax base and thus face the prospect of very high per capita user fees if their citizens are required to repay the full capital cost of sewage treatment projects while the initial intent was to phase out federal support for this program congress has continued to appropriate srf capitalization grants to the states providing an average of 135 billion annually in recent years the srf provisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33465crs9 12 water infrastructure funding issues relate d to annual appropriations also are an issue of interest to congress for information see crs report rl33466 water quality implementing the clean water act by claudia copelandhave been less controversial than others in the act such as wetlands reform because of apparent general agreement on the need to provide funding ssistance as reflected in continued appropriations the cwa s srf provisions also were model for similar provisions added to the safe drinking water act sdwa in 1996 pl 104 182 however because remaining clean wate r funding needs are still so large at issue is whether and how to extend srf assistance to address those needs how to allocate srf funds among th states and how to prioritize projects and funding bush administration officials have said th at infrastructure funding needs go beyond what the federal government can do on its ow n of particular c oncern is assisting small and economically disadva ntaged communities that have had the most difficulty in adjusting from the acts previous categorical grants program to srf loans additionally there is concern about th adequacy of srf or other funding specifically for projects dealing with problems of overflows from municipal combined and separate sewers which can release partially treated or untreated wastewaters that harm public health and the environment epa estimates that the cost of projects to control sewer overflow s from combined and separate sanitary sewer systems is nearly 140 billion nati onwide and more recently wastewater utilities have sought assistance to assess operational vulnerabilities and upgrade physical protection of their facilities against possible terrorist attacks that could threaten water infrastructure systems12 legislative responses congress has actively considered water infrastructure funding issues since the 107th congress when house and senate committees approved bills to extend the acts srf program through fy2007 and increase federal assistance hr 3930 s 1961 srept 107228 report on hr 3930 was not filed neither bill receive d further action in large part due to controversies over application of prevailing wage requirements of the davisbacon act and over the formula for allocating srf grants among the states in the 108th congress four bills to reauthorize the clean water act srf program were introduced s 170 s 2550 h r 20 hr

bill included new formula for statebystate allocation of clean water srf grants renewal of the clean water acts sewer overflow grant program and provisions such as extended loan repayments and subsidies for disadvantaged communities prior to the senate committees action in july 2003 the house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on water resources and environment approvedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33465crs10 13 for information see crs report rl32503 water infrastructure financing legislation comparison of s 2550 and hr 1560 by claudia copeland and mary tiemannhr 1560 legislation similar to hr 3930 the bill approved by that committee in the 107th congress hr 1560 would have aut horized 20 billion for the clean water srf program for fy2004fy 2008 it included several provisions intended to benefit economically disadvantaged and small communities such as allowing extended loan repayments 30 years rather than 20 and additional subsid ies eg principal forgiveness and negative interest loans for communities that meet states affordability criteria it included provisions to require communities to plan for capital replacement needs and to develop and implement an asset management plan for the repair and maintenance of infrastructure that is being financed13 further action occurred the issue of the applicability of the prevailing local wage requirements of the davisbacon act to srff unded projects has affected consideration of water infrastructure legislation for some time b ecause that act has both strong supporters and critics in congress critics of davisbacon say that it unnecessarily increases public construction costs and hampers competition while s upporters say that it helps stabilize the local construction industry by preventing competition that would undercut local wages and working conditi ons the bill approved by the house subcommittee in july 2003 hr 1560 did not include language specifying that the davisbacon act shall apply to srffunded projects while s 2550 did include such requirement other factors that cloude d the bills were administration opposition to authorization levels in both bills and disputes over funding allocation formulas in the 109th congress the senate environment and public works committee approved s 1400 the water infrastructure fi nancing act in july 2005 srept 109 186 the bill was similar to s 2550 in the 108th congress it would have authorized 20 billion for grants to capitalize the cl ean water act srf pr ogram and 15 billion for safe drinking water act srfs th rough fy2010 as approved by the committee s 1400 would have revise d and updated the cwa formula for statebystate allocation of srf monies and also specified that the prevailing wage requirements of the davisbacon act shall apply to all projects financed from an srf as similarly provided in the committees bill in the 108th congress further action on this bill occurred for some time interest has been growing in identifying and developing new mechanisms to help localities pay for wate r infrastructure projects beyond federal grants or srfs which appear insufficient to fully meet funding needs in june 2005 the house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on water resources and environment held hearings on alternative means to fund water infrastructure projects in the future at the first hearing w itnesses focused on one way to increase funding for water infrastructure that has recently been advocated by some groups creating national clean water trust fund that would c onceptually be similar to trust funds that exist for highway and aviation projects witnesses and subcommittee members discussed difficulties in identifying potential revenue sources that would be deemed fair and equitable the

issues several other cwa issues have drawn some degree of congressional attention regulatory protection of wetlands how best to protect the nations remaining wetlands and regu late activities taking place in wetlands has become one of the most contentious environmental policy issues especially in the context of the cwa which contains key wetlands regulatory tool the permit program in section 404 it requires landowners or developers to obtain permits for disposal of dredged or fill material that is generated by construction or similar activity into navigable waters of the united states including wetlands section 404 has evolved through judicial interpretation and regulatory change to become one of the principal federal tools used to protect wetlands although th at term appears only once in section 404 itself and is not defined there at the same time its implementation has come to be seen as intrusive and burdensome to those whose activities it regulates at issue today is how to address criticism of the section 404 regulatory program while achieving desired goals of wetlands protection14 unlike the rest of the act the permit as pects of section 404 are administered by the us army corps of engineers rather than epa although the corps uses epa environmental guidance other federal agencies including the us fish and wildlife service fws and natural resource c onservation service nrcs have more limited roles in the corps permitting decisions tension has existed for many years between the regulation of activities in we tlands under section 404 and related laws on the one hand and the desire of landowners to devel op property that may include wetlands on the other hand the conflicts over wetlands regulation have for the most part occurred in administrative pr oceedings as congress has not amended section 404 since 1977 when it provided exemptions for categories of routine activities such as normal farming and forestry controversy has grown over the extent of federal jurisdic tion and impacts on private prope rty burdens and delay of permit procedures and roles of federal agencies and states in issuing permits judicial proceedings involving section 404 one issue involving long standing controversy and litigation is whether isolated waters are properly within the jurisdiction of section 404 isolated waters that are wetlands which are not physically

of whether the cwa provides the corps and epa with authority over isolat ed waters the courts 54 ruling in solid waste agency of northern cook county swancc v us army corps of engineers 531 us 159 2001 held that the corps denial of 404 permit for disposal site on isolated wetlands solely on the basis that migratory birds use the site exceeds the authority provided in the act the full extent of impacts on the regulatory program resulting from this decision remains unclear even five years after the ruling in part because of different interpretations of swancc reflected in subsequent fe deral court cases while it continues to be difficult to fully assess how regulatory protection of wetlands will be affected as result of the swancc decision and other possible changes the remaining responsibility to protect affect ed wetlands falls on states and localities16 environmentalists believe that the court misinterpreted congressional intent on the matter while industry and landowner gr oups welcomed the ruling policy implications of how much the decision restricts federal regulation depend on how broadly or narrowly the opinion is applied some federal courts have interpreted swancc narrowly thus limiting its effect on current permit rules while few read the decision more broadly the governments current view on this key question was expressed in epa corps guidance issued in january 2003 it provides legal inte rpretation essentially based on narrow reading of the courts d ecision thus allowing federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue but it calls for more headquarters review in disputed cases administration press releas say that the guidance demonstrates the governments commitment to nonetloss wetlands policy however it is apparent that the issues remain under discussion b ecause at the same time the administration issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anprm seeking comment on how to define waters that are under ju risdiction of the regulatory program17 the anprm did not actually propose rule change s but it indicated possible ways that clean water act rules might be modified to further limit federal jurisdiction building on swancc and some subsequent legal decisions the government received more than 133000 comments on the anprm most of them negative according to epa and the corps environmentalists and many states opposed changing any rules saying th at the law and previous court rulings call for the broadest possible interpretation of the clean water act and thus narrow interpretation of swancc but developers sought

concerning federal regulatory jurisdiction over isolated wetlands the epa administrator said that the administration wanted to avoid contenti ous and lengthy rule making debate over the issue environmentalists and state representatives expressed relief at the announcement interest groups on all side s have been critical of confusion in implementing the 2003 guidance which constitu tes the main tool for interpreting the reach of the swancc decision environmentalis ts remain concerned about diminished protection resulting from the guidan ce while developers said that without new regulations confusing and contradict ory interpretations of wetland rules will continue federal courts continue to have key role in inte rpreting and clarifying the swancc decision on february 21 2006 the supreme court heard arguments in two cases brought by landowners rapanos v united states carabell v us army corps of engineers seeking to narrow the scope of the cwa permit program as it applies to development of wetlands the issue in both cases had to do with the reach of the cwa to cover waters that were not navigable waters in the traditional sense but were connected somehow to navigable waters or adjacent to those waters the act requires federal permit to discharge dredged or fill materials into navigable waters many legal and other observers hoped that the courts ruling in these cases would bring greater clarity about the scope of federal regulatory jurisdiction17 the courts ruling was issued on june 19 rapanos v united states 126 sct 2208 2006 in 54 decision plurality of the court led by justice scalia held that the lower court had applied an incorrect standard to determine whether the wetlands at issue are covered by the cwa justice kennedy joined this plurality to vacate the lower court decisions and rema nd the cases for further consideration but he took different positions on most of the s ubstantive issues raised by the cases as did four other dissenting justices early judgments by legal observers suggest that the implications of the ruling both shortterm and longterm are far from clear because the several opinions written by th justices did not draw clear line regarding what wetlands and other waters are subject to federal jurisdiction one likely result is more casebycase determin ations and continui ng litigation there also could be renewed pressu re on the corps and epa to clarify the issues through an administrative rulemaking congr essional actions in september 2002 the house government reform subcommittee on energy policy natural resources and regulatory affairs held hearing on the governments response to the swancc decision and to press the government to clarify its interpretation of the court case committee members and

goes beyond what the supreme court required in swancc has allowed many streams and wetlands to be unprotected from developmen t and has been more confusing than helpful opponents of the amendment pred icted that it would make epas and the corps regulatory job more difficult than it already is congress adjourned sine die in december without taking final action on hr 5386 thus delaying final action

acidic and other types of dr ainage from abandoned sites where gold silver copper lead and iron ore were mined the core concept underlying the bills is that in order to address the problem of pollution from iam sites it is appropria to encourage cleanup by so called good sama ritan entities to do so the bills hr 1266 s 1848 and an administration proposal hr 5404 and s 2780 proposed to establish proce ss for issuing permits to good samaritans and to provide incentives in the form of reduced liability from environmental laws and less stringent environmental cleanup st andards

legislation the issues of liability ex posure under environmental law and strict regulatory standards coul d stymie voluntary cleanups opponents especially many environmental and conserva tion advocates acknowledge th at cleanup would benefit the environment but they expressed concern that exemptions and relief such as these bills proposed might be the first step in dismantling key envir
