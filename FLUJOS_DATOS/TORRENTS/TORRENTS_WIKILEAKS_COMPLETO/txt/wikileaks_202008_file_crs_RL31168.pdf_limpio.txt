appropriation and the departments of commerce justice state the judiciary and related agencies appropriation initial allocations totaling 88 billion to date from the emergency supplemental

table 1 provides summary for each bill and total for all 13 tables 2 through 13 present separate pages for each appropriation measure listing in most cases spending at the account level there are significant limitations in identifying precise amounts included in appropriation bill accounts for terrorismrelated activities some result from the way in which omb organizes its data around categories that do not necessarily correspond to appropriation accounts in many cases terrorismrelated resources are comingled in host account with other funds with precise designation of amounts to combat terrorism omb data for defense and military construction appropriations are not disaggregated and are provided in only very broad categories nevertheless data presented in this report indicate where funds are concentrated and highlight new spending initiatives that have emerged since september 11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31168contents funding overview 1 methodology and limitations 2 list of

httpwwwwhitehousegovomblegislativeas noted below there are significant limitations in identifying precise amounts included in appropriation bill accounts for terrorismrelated activities nevertheless data presented in this report indicate where funds are concentrated and identify new spending initiatives that have emerged since september 11 methodology and limitations funding for programs to combat terrorism have been loosely coordinated and documented in an annual report to congress by the office of management and budget omb2 omb presents the data in two ways according to spending by each federal agency and according to five mission categories omb defines the five categories as follows physical security of government programs protecting federally owned leased or occupied facilities and federal employees from terrorist acts physical security of the national populace activities protecting national infrastructure including air traffic railroad highway maritime and electronic distribution systems energy production distribution and storage vital services such as banking water and emergency services and telecommunication systems law enforcement and investigative activities programs aimed at reducing the ability of groups or individuals to commit terrorist acts and investigating and prosecuting terrorist acts when they occur preparing for and responding to terrorist acts activities focused on planning training and equipping personnel responsible for incident response research and development programs designed to develop technologies to deter prevent or mitigate terrorist acts included in these figures is rd to defend against weapons of mass destruction although the five mission categories and agency distribution data are useful in analyzing resource priorities for combating terrorism congress does not consider funding initiatives using these organizational structures rather congress addresses terrorismrelated spendi ng like other funding proposals through appropriation bills in order to organize funding amounts in the way in which congress considers and approves resources tables in this report crosswalk the omb figures from the mission and agencybased organization structure to an appropriation account listinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31168crs3 3 some exceptions include the justice departments counterterro rism fund the state departments antiterrorism assistance and terrorist interdiction programs the treasury departments counterterrorism fundthere are significant limitations however in drawing on the omb data and reconfiguring it to parallel the appropriation bill structure the first is that very few federal programs are exclusively focused on combating terrorism making it difficult to precisely identify funding for terrorism activities3 rather resources to combat terrorism are incorporated into larger host programs in agency budgets for example variety of counterterrorism programs totaling about 222 million in fy2001 are funded within the 417 million justice departments office of justice programs account the 222 million figure represents department of justiceomb estimate and does not reflect specific appropriation line item or directiveearmark made by congress in the fy2001 appropriation like executive agencies congress does not appropriate funds to combat terrorism in discreet accounts except in few cases rather amounts for terrorism activities are merged into larger host accounts and in most cases there are estimates of how much of the host account will or should be committed to combat terrorism committee reports on the appropriation measures occasionally discuss amounts dedicated to terrorism activities but rarely in comprehensive way that would allow for clear identification of how much is included within specific account and how the level might compare to the presidents request due to this limitation most accounts listed in the house and senate columns in the accompanying tables show not specified or ns designation and are not totaled in order to mitigate this limitation to some extent the tables also include amounts for the host accounts from which terrorism spending is drawn although not definitive indicator of funding levels to combat terrorism host account totals when compared with administration requests can provide some evidence of whether appropriation bills provide sufficient amounts that would allow the executive agencies to proceed with plans to fund terrorismrelated activities only in few cases where an account exclusively funds terrorismrelated activities or is congressional initiative such as the creation of new deputy attorney general for domestic terrorism in the senate passed commerce justice state spending bill are amounts included in these house and senate columns linking the omb data that is organized according to the five mission categories with appropriation accounts also presents challenges the mission categories in many cases appear to aggregate funds across several appropriation accounts and in the case of the department of interior appropriation bill across multiple agencies wherever possible the tables provide more specific information regarding the purpose of funds for combating terrorism than what can be gleaned from ombs generic mission categories nevertheless the categories used by omb are the most frequently cited in the tables because omb allocates funds from the 40 billion emergency supplemental by appropriation account this problem does not apply to those resources further limitation is the lack of any breakdown for defense spending where the largest amount of terrorismrelated funding is concentrated the omb report lumpshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31168crs4 4 us general accounting office bioterrorism federal research and preparedness activities september 2001 p 35all us defense intelligence and military construction into single national security community group making it impossible to differentiate between funds appropriated in the defense and military construction spending bills moreover the omb document provides further information regarding how the 64 billion national security community spending requested for fy2002 is allocated among appropriation accounts portions of the defense budget are classified adding another obstacle to identifying accounts in which funds to combat terrorism are included due to these constraints table 4 includes combined entry for defense and military construction appropriations that does not offer any data at the account level resources allocated from the 40 billion emergency supplemental appropriation however are broken out into more specific categories provided by the defense department and omb further possible deficiency in the omb report is the extent to which amounts for combating terrorism are overstated during research efforts to compile these data crs identified anecdotal evidence that selected figures in the omb report far exceeded those attributed by other sources for example omb states that the us department of agricultures agriculture research service ars spent 325 million on research related to bioterrorism in fy2001 recent general accounting office report however quantifies the ars total at 05 million last year4 crs is not able however to estimate the extent to which amounts provided in the omb report are overstated or conversely understatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31168crs5 table 1 combating terrorism appropriations summary s millions appropriation billenacted
