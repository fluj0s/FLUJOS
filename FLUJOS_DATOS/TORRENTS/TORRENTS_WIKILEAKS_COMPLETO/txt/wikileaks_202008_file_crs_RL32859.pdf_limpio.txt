programs the administration has argued that giving state and local authorities more flexibility to coordinate workforce and family support programs can help to promote lfsufficiency among lowincome families waiver initiatives like the superwaiver are one type of approach to service integration broad and more enduring policy issue that has been raised in response to criticism that social serv ice programs are fragmented costly to administer and complicated for lowincome families to maneuver over the past 30 years there have been numerous fede rallevel service integration initiatives in addition to waivers approaches to service integration have included grant management reform adminis trative simplificati on demonstration or pilot projects and block grants past fede ral efforts reveal that issues related to potential costs and savings programs to be covered administering authority evaluations and accountability are important components that can influence the success of service integration initiatives ironically the biggest lesson has been that reform itself can be fragmented and requi res great deal of effort and strong leadership to coordinate nd implement in its own right lessons from past initiatives have shown that service integration requires resources to execute in the shortrun and it is not clear whether integration is cost effective in the longrun taking these cost s into account federa l programs included in integration efforts generally are those that provide services to meet basic needs of lowincome individuals and families but the debate over which programs and types of requirements to include can be highly political and lead to wide variation in the types of projects undertaken desi gnation of an organizational body with authority to implement an initiative can facilitate federal pa rticipation expedite approval of projects provide technical assistance and act as an oversight entity pilot and demonstration project s require

federal rules of various welfarerelated programs in order to integrate activities across wide spectrum of social services1 this proposal often referred to as the superwaiver would provide broa d waiver authority to executive branch agencies that administer covered programs2 the administration has argued that giving state and local authorities more flexibility to coordinate workforce and family support programs can help to promote lf sufficiency among lowincome families this initiative has rekindled longstanding discussions about service integration an issue that has confounded nd perplexed policymakers nd program administrators for more than three decades this report reviews the history trends and outcomes of past federal initiatives to integrate social services that might be

ccdf and the social services block grant ssbg co st an estimated 5222 billion in that year3 congress has created these programs at different points in time to meet distinct needs of various segments of the lowincome population however when viewed as whole the programs prompt concerns that the federal social assistance system has become costly to administer and complicated for lowincome families

1991creation of an assortment of social serv ice programs yet for as long as these programs have existed congre ss has had an interest in coordinating and making them work better together during 1991 hearin g representative bill emerson expressed common sentiment that arises in discussions of service integration i think we all agree that all of the programs we are talking about have been well intentioned the problem is over peri od of time there are so many programs and there is so much conflicting juri sdiction that there has been lot of confusion the solution may be combining some of these programs and addressing the needs of the individual or whole person rather then piecemeal solution i think everybody wants to solve these problems and i dont think the differences are as much philosophical as they are practical in terms of what works and gets results6 the structure of congressional committees also creates disjuncture of authority over many closely related social service programs which can stall momentum for reform committees with rela ted or overlapping jurisdic tions may resist proposals to integrate or consolidate programs in order to preserve their powers of oversight and authorization and to ba lance conflicting interests additionally many advocacy and lobbying groups have an established in terest in the continuation of existing programs and they may object to pr oposals that would merge them into comprehensive general service packages thus the heavy power of the status quo can dampen efforts that invol ve largescale change th systemic realities are not necessarily insurmountable but they do establish the predispositions of political players and the preference for particular outcomes institutional power struggles whether between states and the federal government or the executive and legislative branches can also generate challenges to service integration state and local grantees that administer federally funded programs have long sought flexibility and sometimes advocate waivers as way to better integrate services at the same time congress seeks to ensure accountability and the fiscal and programmatic integrity of programs established to meet national goals this necessarily involves at l east some federally imposed requirements guidelines and procedures additionally some approaches to service integration like waivers give more authority to ex ecutive branch agencies to administer and approve projects several arguments are used to prom ote integration of public assistance programs one is to make more sense of the programs from the perspective of the individual seeking help there is the rati onale that the causes of poverty are multiple and interrelated therefore providing preventative and comprehensive

statistic on program fra gmentation to support its case for service integration studies indicate that between 85 and 95 of all hew clients have multiple problems and that single services prov ided independently of one another do not result in changes in clients dependency status or life chances frequently the failure to receive referred services prevents clients from benefitting from service already provided7 integrated services can also make programs more compatible so that caseworkers may face fewer obstacles and be better able to perform their jobs from the efficiency perspective integrated programs could help to reduce administrative costs by taking advantage of economies of scale reducing overlap and utilizing costsharing across programs critics of the current superwaiver proposal argue that existing waiver authority within social service programs as well as flexibility in block grants such as tanf and ssbg have so far been ccessful at increasing program coordination and that broad sweeping waiver authority is not needed these groups contend that giving the executive branch new powers would compromise congressional authority and is not necessary to achieve better inte gration of services the center on budget and policy priorities cbpp argues there are to be sure areas in which st ates could use further flexibility to define certain program parameters or better align programs that serve similar populations or provide similar services these matters can be addressed however without the radical shift in gove rnance and risks to lowincome families that the superwaiver poses8 others contend that states may have other reasons for promoting flexibility in certain areas for example in many discussions of service integration states bring up rules related to cost allocation as barrier to integrating programs there is concern among some federal administrators that these issues have more to do with states ability to maximize revenue by shifting fe deral funds between programs than with the intent of providing integrated services lastly questions have been raised about the range of possibilities for serv ice integration under current law9 while legal

to service integration 10 block grants are generally understood to be fixedsum federal grants to states that give them broad flexibility to design and implem ent designated programs in contrast categorical grants often include prescriptive fe deral requirements and must be used for more narrowly defined purposes 11 two past initiatives funded by the federal go vernment have contributed to this literature base in 1974 the department of health ducation and welfare initiated project share national clearinghouse to improve the manage ment of human services also called the human service monograph series the project produced collection of papers on service integration and related topics that were compiled for public access in 1991 grants from the department of health and human services partially funded the establishment of the national center for service integration the centers mission was to actively support service integration efforts by serving as an information clearinghouse for documents programs and organizations 12 the most often cited definition of services integration originated with hew secretary elliot richardson in june 1971 departmental memorandum service integration refers to ways of organizing the delivery of services to people at the local level services integration is not new program to be superimposed over existing programs rather it is process aimed at developing an integrated framework within which ongoing programs can be rationalized and enriched to do better job of making services available within existing commitments and resources its objectives must include such things as the coordinated delivery of services for the greatest benef it to people b holistic approach to the individual and family unit c the provision of comprehensive range of services locally continuedregulatory requirements pose some barriers at the federal level service integration also requires significant amount of res ource investment and technical expertise to execute at the state and local level federal barriers may only be one of many obstacles to implementing strategy for service integration over the past 30 years public assistan ce programs have volved through various federal and intergovernmental reform efforts in the last decade there has been greater tendency to block grant programs in order to devolve more flexibility and decisionmaking authority to state and local governments10 the context has also changed in response to the transformation of federal priorities re lated to the welfare system there is strong emphasis on em ployment and support services to provide the framework for sustained independence from federal assistance lawmakers have recognized that lowincome families moving from welfare to work require services that address multiple needs these may include employment and education services assistance with child care access to medical care and help finding affordable housing this rationale has provided renewed vigor for concerns that family experiences these needs concurrently nd as interrelated but federal programs continue to address them as isolated problems also growing literature on service integration has provided an academic and political forum for discussions of past efforts and current policy11 service integration defined service integration is an unwieldy topic in many

1986 the general accounting office gao issued report that provided an inventory of service in tegration demonstrati on projects completed between 1970 and 1985 we found that there is not universa lly agreedupon definition of service integration to some service integration means colocation of service providers combined case management common application forms and shared client data to others it means system accountability and accessibility combined with efficient and effective services prov ided at the most reasonable cost13 organizations that seek to integrate services may differ in administrative structure budget size target population geographic boundaries and staffing all of which can affect the scope and impact of reforms rvice integration has also been described as existing on continuum ranging fro m loosely coordinated services to collaboration and fina lly to integration14 in general the literature tends to distinguish between two approaches to service integration serviceoriented and systemoriented reform serviceoriented integration is client and case management focused with the goal of linking clients to broad range of services that address multiple family needs examples of these efforts are colocation of services joint applications and eligibility determination and crosstraining of staff systemori ented reforms would change administrative and service delivery structures to facilitate integrated management and coordination of programs across state c ounty andor local agencies15 examples of system oriented reforms are eliminating conflicting eligibility and benefit rules among service programs changing how agencies plan and finance services reorganization of public agencies around common populati on or offering fiscal and performance incentives to increase coordination between agencies for the most part service integration must take place at the state and local levels because that is where rvices are accessed by recipients yet

require an intergovernmental effort conflicting regulations and fragmentation of these programs at the federal level can impede state and local efforts that would ot herwise bring programs together as

initiatives to reform the management of federal grants devolve decisionmaking power and flexibility to states incorporate state options into statutes authorizing programs and efforts to simplify administrative and reporting rules across programs giving st ates the opportunity to apply for waivers of certain federal requireme nts as the superwaiver proposal would do is also systemoriented reform intended to increase flexibility to integrate services within the existing federal framework drawing from the experience of past fforts much more is now understood about the barriers to integration instab ility both fiscal and political can hinder the capacity of any level of g overnment to follow through with and maintain programs over the long run service integration requires strong leadership and successful advocate to bring all the parties into the planning process studies have found that as individual champions of projects retir or move on support for and cooperation with initiatives has dissipated16 there are often differing geographical boundaries for program service areas turf issues such as loss of autonomy distrust of other agencies and differences in philosophy for serving clients can be substantial barriers state and local agencies runni ng separate programs have an established culture that often conflicts program administrators can be reluctant to merge their program and change methods of operation integra tion may require colocation changes to personnel organization and j ob responsibilities and trai ning that requires high degree of cooperation and commitment from em ployees issues such as protecting client confidentiality can be barrier to sharing data and technical integration of case management systems finally service in

inclusive of multiple programs that bridge agency boundaries like the superwaiver proposal distinct from thes initiatives there have been many other federal attempts to coordinate and integrate

pilot and demonstration projects that allowed waivers of certain federal program requirements since the late 1990s waivers and block gran ts have become the chief elements of proposals to promote state flexibility and innovation the following section of this report provides an overview of legislative and executive branch service integration initiatives that have occurred over the last three decades while this is not an exhaustive review it does highlight the major kinds of approaches employed by the federal govern ment to move toward integration namely reform of grant management administrative simplificati on pilot or demonstration projects block grants and waivers service integration initiatives two initiatives acted as important precursors for subsequent service integration efforts that occurred throughout the 1970s these were broad fullscale efforts to streamline and integrate grant administration management processes and intergovernmental activities the inte rgovernmental cooperation act in 1968 and president nixons federal assistance re view far in 1969 set the context for several significant servi ce integration proposals di scussed in this report

about decade federal assistance review far 1969 the federal assistance review far was governmentwide effort spanning from march 1969 to june 1973 omb and 14 other federal agencies were broug ht together to review mechanisms for placing greater reliance on state and local governments and to simplify the process for obtaining funds from multiple federal s ources the review resulted in 10point program that included guidelines for achieving these goals31 these included establishment of 10 standardized regions for 75 major federal agencies and bureaus with field offices sharing common jurisdictions and headquarters through co location was way to more easily coordinate programs across traditional agency boundaries concurrently federal re gional councils frc consisting of

operational authority to regional offices greater reliance on state and local governments for administration of programs and streamlining of paperwork and procedures in programs two initiatives discussed in this report the joint funding simplifi cation act of 1974 and the integrated grants administration in 1972 were both ideas proposed by the far with these two preceding efforts in mind the

notifica tion application processing and execution of grants was setup to manage the iga program proj ects could be funded by one grant award notice rather than several grant awards each with its own funding period this also allowed for single financ ial reporting system fundi ng normally lasted for 12 months and an annual audit of each project was required within six months after the project was

following difficulties were identified lack of coordination and commitment among federal agencies while frcs acted as moderators between federal agencies and grantees they lacked the authority to create the collaboration and commitment that was needed from federal agencies only one of the six iga projects reviewed actually received singlegrant award with synchronized fundi ng periods the other

improved client access to needed services and that agencies were more responsive to the n eeds of families being served yet fiscal problems resulting from pooling funds of different categorical programs and administrative restrictions limited overall success of these efforts34 as with the iga program cost allocation and accounting of expenditures across multiple programs was complex and prohibitive for project administrators interagency planning was difficult because program officials often felt the projects were threats to their programs budget and agency identity ggestions were

combinations of services and targeted varying elements of the lowincome popula tion including pregnant teens and senior citizens primary focus in most of the programs was integrated case management which allowed client s with multiple problems to r eceive comprehensive network of support and assistance outcomes implementation of the sipp projects was initially uncertain because congress did not

families under multip federal assistance programs the purpose was to create economic opportunity at the community or neighborhood level and to increase the selfsufficiency of lowincome individuals and familieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32859crs26 69 also introduced as hr 2086 70 us congress senate committee on governmental affairs local empowerment and flexibility act of 1996 hearings s 88 july 1996features the legislation expected progra ms to be operated from the local or neighborhood level and would have authorized the development of community opportunity systems to restructure the deliv ery of social services the bill did not authorize any appropriation beyond the disc retionary funds already authorized for existing grant programs the president woul d have been given authority to designate panel of federal officials with responsib ility to approve the inclusion of specific programs and waive any federa l statutory or regulatory re quirements in that program the bill also included technical assistance to help develop and implement an integrated system applications were require d to define particular service area the population to be served and how the prog ram would measure performance related to increasing opportunity and selfsufficien cy the individuals and families to be served were to be included as participants in the design and implementation of the comprehensive system an evaluation component would have required approved agencies to conduct assessments of the sy stems impact on the target population and community extension of waiver appr oval would be allowed if the agency demonstrated superior alternative system for assisting individuals and families legislative history the community opportunity act originated as proposal from the reagan ad ministrations economic empowerment task force and became part of the bush administrations welfare reform agenda while the bill itself was not reintroduced and saw fu rther action the concept of authorizing waivers for demonstration projects and the inclusion of evaluation requirements manifested itself throughout later proposals local empowerment and flexibility act of 1996 s 88 category waivers purpose the local empowerment and flexibility act of 1996 was introduced and reported by committees in both the house and senate but was not enacted69 the bill would have established process by which federal interagency board could approve flexib ility plans proposed by one or more local governments key goal was to enable state local nd tribal governments and private nonprofit organizations to adapt federal financ ial assistance programs to particular communities proponents argued each of th various grant programs tends to treat the needs it aims to address as if most communities had the precisely identical problem calling for single common solution70 additionally there was concern about the budget deficit and the bill was seen as way to ma ximize efficiency in discretionary grant programs and optimize expenditure of federal resources features the legislation would have au thorized local governments that received aid under multiple federal assistance programs to propose flexibility plans for the administration of two or more such programs the legislation was cost neutral existing grants from these programs were to be combined with similar state and local program funds key ement was that local governments could request waiver for maximum of five years of wide range of federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32859crs27 71 hr 2086 requirements that could not be waived included title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 title ix of the education amendments of 1972 the age discrimination act of 1975l the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the fair housing act or the individuals with disabilities act 72 testimony of charles griff ith director of the interg overnmental liaison advisory commission on intergovernmental relations on senate bill 88 local empowerment and flexibility act dec 5 1995requirements if it was necessary for implementation of the plan71 the bill made use of existing community empowerment boards established by presidential directive through empowerment zone and enterprise community programs the board was intended to foster federal interagenc communication review waiver requests provide technical assistance and monitor performance of the flexibility plans waivers would ultimately be approved by the appropriate federal agency the bill gave priority to applicants that were designated as an enterprise community or empowerment zone amendments to the original bill required that plans be developed with significant public input and submitted to affected local and state agencies for comment period plans would have been required to include measurable performance criteria legislative history there was opposition to this bill in both the house and senate some critics objected to the bills sweeping scope and the indeterminate impact of the legislation among the issues raised were the lack of constraints on the ability of local governments to shift the use of funds the potential for waiving provisions that could compromise progra ms original purpose and the absence of congressional oversight and public accountability for community empowerment boards additionally the mechanism for developing flexibility plans was viewed as too cumbersome to be effective this bill was dvocated by the us advisory commission on intergovernmental relations which testified before the senate government affairs committee72 during this testimony both the integrated grants administration iga and the joint funding simplification act of 1974 were cited as examples of past reforms to address gr ant assistance issues and as demonstration of the persistence of service integrati on problems at the state and local levels welfare reform reaut horization 2004 hr 240

version has many of the same elements but limits the programs that could be included in demonstration projects includes stronger evaluation requirements and limits the number of states that could participate to 10 lessons learned past federallevel service integration initiatives covered in this report provide some lessons that can help to inform the current superwaiver debate as well as future federal efforts ironically the bigge st lesson has been that reform itself can be fragmented and requires subs tantial amount of effort to coordinate and execute in its own right costs and savings most of the service integration initiatives covered in this report have been designed to be co stneutral meaning they did not include separate appropria tion or authorization for funding and would not have resulted in new spending or benefits proposals we re often created under the perception that consolidation of existing grant programs would lead to more effective delivery of services and save money by lowering administrative costs and reducing overlaphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32859crs29 74 us department of health education nd welfare social and rehabilitative service integration of human

increased efficiency were used as arguments for many legislative initiatives which helped to build political support but also meant little or funding for the project itself service integration projects undertaken by executive branch agencies were more likely to be funded yet grants were subject to the impetus of the sponsoring agencies to use discretionary funds and funding was often uncertain under these circumstances an independent evaluation of the si to projects found that they did not demonstrate longterm savings fieldwork indicated that it may not be possible to justify services integration strictly in rms of total dollar savings although there are some cost savings resulting from econo mies of scale and re duction of duplication they do not appear to equal the input cost s of administrative and core service staff required to support integrative efforts74 the sito evaluation did not review all projects funded and other initiatives such as the sipp projects did not include cost benefit analysis making it diffi cult to generalize this finding the true costs of integrating services are not entirely clear yet it does seem to be the case that there are shortrun co sts involved in initiating projects service integration requires both financial and political resources to implement whether from the federal state or local level integr ating services may include costs of planning and building network of support in the community training staff colocating agencies and investments in technology sustaining or institutionalizing service integration may require some level of continued resour ces in the longrun it is anticipated that the economies of scale achieved through integration will outweigh the costs of implementing the necessary changes it is also argued that comprehensive services can better serve c lients and lead to in creased independence from assistance there is little evidence about the costeffec tiveness of service integration strategies and the variability and scope of projects undertaken make it difficult to estimate the am ount of additional resources that may be required for given project in partic ular type of community programs covered many of the federal initiatives covered in this report allowed states and localities great deal of discretion in deciding which programs they would include in service integra tion project for example in the proposed community opportunity act of 1991 congress did not specify the programs eligible for inclusion in demonstra tion project instead panel of federal officials would have conferred with the head s of federal agencies opera ting programs included in demonstration project application nd make recommendation to each agency regarding inclusion of the program or waiver of statutory or

heading of public assistance this broad definition has made it difficult to establish generalities and structure across different projects political wrangling often causes the selec tion of programs included in service integration efforts to be haphazard depending on political resistance from certain groups with established interest in cu rrent programs yet creating common framework for federallevel initiatives that is inclusive of minimum of basic needs programs can lead to better opportun ities for evaluati on more consistency in projects at the local level target needed cooperation at the federallevel and ensure continued provision of pr imary support services administering authority most federallevel service integration efforts have included designation of an administrative entity to facilitate implementation of an initiative the purpose of this body has been to act as focal point for carrying out logistical elements and communicating with different federal agencies an administering authority can provide dir ect oversight of projects and report to congress regarding projects and program activities some federal administrative bodies have also been tasked with provi ding technical assist ance to grantees or projects conducted under the initiative the integrated grants administration iga and the joint funding simplification act of 1974 were administe red through federal regional councils which were responsible for managing the programs regionally processing applications and acting as moderators between grantees and various federal agencies based on previous initiatives that were enacted federal administering authorities streamlined interaction between grantees and federal agencies but they often lacked the authority to compel federal agencies to fully participate nd cooperate with the intent of the legislation this was pr oblem also found in implementation of the community action and model cities programs in which

1977joint funding by regional staffs and fede ral agencies is major stumbling block77 pilot and demonstration proj ects administered through si ngle federal agency had problems obtaining waivers in many cases due to the lack of coordination with other agencies the sipp pilot projects were administered by single division within hhs yet grantees found it difficult to obt ain waivers from other federal agencies and an interagency workgroup did not ve the commitment and participation from representatives to overcome this problem the limited ability of the administering body to induce the cooperation of federal ag encies in these pr ojects was critical element that hindered the success of these reforms service integration requires momentum and leadership to carry out the activities included in an initiative and to pr omote coordination nd collaboration among participants at the federal level facilitating service integration is at least partly reliant on the designation of some kind of organizationa l body that has appropriate authority sufficient expertise across program areas and the ability to provide ongoing technical assistance to overcom barriers and make recommendations for future proposals establishing an ad ministering authority without the proper backing and resources can undermine its capacity to achieve given objectives evaluations evaluations of service integr ation projects can be an important tool for making assessments relative to the costeffectiveness of changes measuring impact on organizations and clients and providing insight about pragmatic and workable approaches to service integra tion despite the implication of the name pilot or demonstrat ion many of the previous federallyfunded projects were developed without any clear ar ticulation of how be st practices or models of service integration could be demonstrated to inform future efforts in other areas this was overshadowed by the diversity in objectives needs political and organizational structures across projects pilot programs simply ended when the demonstration funds ran out beginning in the mid1970s the public money for taking to scale what had been learned from succe ssful demonstrations dried up78 an independent evaluati on was conducted for both si to and sipp projects but the evaluations were limited by measurement difficulties and the fact that they were not initiated until after projects had been implemented one reviewer found that evidence from sito projects was fragmentary and difficult to assess largely because of inconsistent definitions and limited qualitative measures of impact79 from the start projects were not managed as dem onstrations by hew research funding was granted to projects that represented many different approaches to service integration which made it difficult to assess them as social experimenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32859crs32 80 douglas henton the feasibility of services integration an evaluation prepared for the hew interagency services integration rd task force mar 1975critics contend that pilot projects are so small in scope that they cannot be expected to have any measurable impact some have also argued that expectations that pilot projects could help lead to service integration models is unrealistic due to the severity of differences not only in the problems of particular communities rural versus urban but also in particular social and political environments human services organizational networks must be adapted to local environments and one structure can be implemented in every environment80 evaluations are most effective when they are undertaken from projects conception to establish baselines and an appropriate evaluati on methodology one type of evaluation might pr imarily assess whether integr ation has been achieved by examining changes to agency structure operations provision of services and cost effectiveness another ev aluation may look at whether integrated services impacted client outcomes federa l provisions that clarify expectations for pilot or demonstration projects can pr ovide framework to guide evaluations so that any common strategies or similarities across diverse projects might be identified evaluating service integration initiatives raises questions bout how to deal with small sample sizes and chan ges that may take an exte nded period of time to produce significant impacts finally evaluations can be costly to administer and may require that additional resources be devoted to project accountability federallevel service integration initiatives usually devolve some authority for decisionmaking to the states in order to allow flexibility across programs this invariably raises the question of how to ensure accountab ility developing appropria and effective outcome measures to assess the performance and enhance accountability of federallyfunded public ssistance programs is challenge that is not unique to service integr ation in retrospect most of the service integration projects covered in this re port focused primarily on planning and development of programs rather than on measuring and tracking performance this may be part of the reason why support for projects waned since there were quantitative measures from which to judg programs success requiring strong performance measures has many potentia l benefits to enhance accountability including providing information on the eff ects of integrated services and allowing better opportunity for oversight issues facing the superwaiver proposal the starting point today is vastly diffe rent from what it was in the 1960s and 1970s for many years state and local g overnments sometimes with federal support have experimented with ne w forms of service delivery strategies and organization now that many programs have aged some consolidation has occurred and flexibility within programs has been created states ve been better able to take

been more national attenti on and intergovernmental mome ntum to make better sense of social service programs as syste m of support for lowincome individuals the superwaiver proposal is service integration initiative that would allow demonstration projects and waivers key issues in the superwaiver debate are similar to those that have been raised in previous federal efforts legislation that would authorize the superwaiver or program coordination demonstra tion projects requires projects to be cost neutral states would have access only to the existing funds available in each of the programs covered by their superwaiver this means that any additional costs that project may incur must be paid for by nonfederal resour ces depending on support from projects sponsoring community or state projects may face resource constraints that limit the extent of integration that can be achieved the legislation does not designate an administering authority to approve waivers instead pproval within 90 days would be required of each federal agency re sponsible for program covered by the demonstrationwaiver reque st the bush administrations original superwaiver proposal incl uded establishment of federal interagency waiver board to facilitate the process of processing waivers81 but this was not incorporated into legislation applying for and gaining approval of waivers has the potential to be timely and cumbersome even with the inclusion of 90day deadline for federal agency approval especially if agencies could easily obtain extensions by requesting more information from the applicant in considering the superwaiver there has been sharp disagreement over what programs should be included and what requirements could be waived as part of dem onstration projects as they have moved through congress superw aiver proposals have included different visions of what programs would be eligible for approval under demonstration project ther has been strong resistance to the inclusion of the food stamp and homeless assistance programs within this framework projects coul d be expected to vary widely in type and scope of ac tivities undertaken to integrate services as passed in the 108th congress and reintroduced in the 109th congress the house bill would require assurance that an applicant conduct ongoing and final evaluati ons of the project the senate finance

and action to develop similar definitions and collection of base line data across projects in order to adequately compare the effectiveness of interagency linkages and different approaches undertaken finally the superwaiver include s requirements that project applications provide descripti on of the performance objectives for the project and that each administe ring secretary report annually to congress regarding how well each project is meeting these objectives strong performance measures can help to increase accountability of projects if they are successful at capturing true impacts and outcomes of integration projects the superwaiver proposal is the latest manifestation of an ongoing federal interest in promoting service integra tion and crossprogra m coordination the longevity of this movement is telling and suggests that pressure to integrate services will not subside but continue to build as the emphasis on setting budgetary priorities and making services more effective increases as technology becomes more sophisticated and as individual federal programs are modified to allow more flexibility and collaboration with other services most agree that the existing fragmentation of social service programs is real problem that must be addressed in order to better serve families and increase the efficiency of publiclyfunded assistance programs the intergovernmental nature of social service programs which often combine federal state and local resources also implies that the federal government must play some role in helping to address these
