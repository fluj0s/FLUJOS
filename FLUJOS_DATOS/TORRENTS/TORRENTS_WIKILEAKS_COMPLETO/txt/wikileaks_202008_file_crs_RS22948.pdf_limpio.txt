political importance far outweighs its share of the russian economy 72 of russian gdp in 2001 agriculture s been severely affected by the transition to market economy as much as or more than any other economic sector according to one estimate agricultural production d eclined around 40 in volume since 1991 with much of the decline occurring in livestock production2 russia is not competitive on the global ma rket in red meats and poultry and its domestic production has not kept pace with consumption as incomes rise in recent years imports have accounted for half or more of russian poultry consumption even though government policies have ttempted to encourage domes tic production imports have accounted for roughly 30 of pork consump tion and roughly 40 of beef production3 some analysts conclude that this domes tic situation underlies russian actions that periodically have constraine d the countrys imports of pou ltry and meat products the russian federal government has been under pressure from regional and local governments and from factions within the russian parliament to protect agriculture from further erosion and to provide time and resources to permit it to become competitive one major trade constraint was russia s imposition in early 2003 of new import quotas on poultry and of tariffrate quotas t rqs on beef and pork affecting not only the united states but ot

expressed stiff opposition claiming that the restrictions would retard the process of russias accession they specifically argu ed that russia was violating the standstill principle under which countries applying for wto membership are to refrain from imposing new trade restrictions during the acce ssion process russia countered that it was imposing the restrictions to protect its domestic meat producers from import surges right that is enjoyed by wto members5 following several months of negotiations the united states secured the agreement in principle that would effectively continue us exports of meat and poultry to russia under the new quota systems while allowing for future growth formal bilateral agreement was signed by the two parties on june 15 2005 which set the us share of

has kept us chicken out of the eu since 1997 in july 2008 u s and russian poultry industry leaders reportedly forged position whereby russia would not enforce the antimicrobial rule and would extend the expiring poultry quota allo cations beyond 2009 but at reduced levels however russia entered georgia in early augu st before either of their governments had formally endorsed this reported agreement10 recent developments the diplomatic tensions over russias military incursion into georgia have threatened to reverse longterm progress on many longstanding usrussia issues including in agricultural trade first the russians in late august announced ban on poultry shipments from 16 us establishm ents effective september 1 2008 three other establishments had been delisted on au gust 6 bringing the total to 19 the number widely reported in the press the bans followed round of joint usrussian plant inspections in late july and early august 2008 that uncovered what the russians claimed were number of safety problems many plants had not corrected problems found in earlier visits they stated adding that another 29 plants could also lose their eligibility the russian veterinary and phytosanitary service vpss claimed that tested products from the 29 plants were showing high er levels of antibio tics and arsenic than russia allows11 one of the primary reasons vpss cited for suspending the first 19 plants was an inability to visit us poultry farms even though the usrussia poultry agreement provides for such visits according to the usa poultry and egg export council the council acknowledged that u s commercial producers administer small amounts of antibiotics and trace amounts of arseniccontaining compounds for animal health reasons but stated that they are within

the 19 plants as precursor to additional actions that could further constr ain us meat and poultry exports to russia russian health and safety official has threatened to enforce the ban on chlorine treatments calling it outdated technology at the same time russian agricultural officials predicted that they might re duce all poultry imports by 200000 mt in 200914 currently the worldwide quota for 2009 is 1252000 mt the united states has 931500 mt or about threefourths of it under the tr q russian prime minister putin has gone further indicating that the country might spend several trade agreements reached during its wto accession negotiations including thos covering pork trqs as well as poultry quotas putin reportedly said that under the agreements russia has not received anything in return of benefit to the economy incl uding agriculture however any suspensions could be reversed once russi joins the wto he added15 there are some indications that the russians were considering quota reductions andor renegotiation of some import agreements even befo re tensions arose over the georgia situation nonetheless if any reductions are direct ed disproportionately against the united states andor various sps actions are applied more broadly here us competitors may gain larger share of the russian market currently brazil and number of eu countries are di stant competitors of the united states there in poultry meats brazil already supplies more than three times as much pork as the united states the united states was starting to overtake denmark and remains ahead of canada as the other leading sources for russias pork imports brazil is the main supplier of russian beef imports followed by argen tina uruguay and paraguay these developments began to unfold while congress was in its august 2008 recess agricultural leaders in congress could decide to wait to determine whether the russians follow through with additional actions aff ecting the us meat and poultry industries before determining what if any options to consider decisions about usrussian agricultural trade relations could hinge largely on the broader geopolitical situation16
