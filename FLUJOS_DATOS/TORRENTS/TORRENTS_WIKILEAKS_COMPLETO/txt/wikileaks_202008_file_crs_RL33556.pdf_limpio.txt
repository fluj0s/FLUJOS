divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33556soil and water conservation an overview summary soil and water conservation topics are prominent in discussions of policy options for the next farm bill which the 110th congress is considering major conservation topics include where to set overall funding levels and levels for each program what should be th priorities for the conser vation effort and deciding whether any existing programs or activitie s should be modified or eliminated and whether new programs or activ ities should be added to the effort addressing these topics often pits supporters of commodity programs and the tr aditional farm program benefits against those who would like to see an expanded conservation effort the house passed its version of the farm bill on july 27 2007 hr 2419 by vote of 231 to 191 numerous options fo r conservation provisions were offered as the legislation moved through the house but the conservation title was passed largely as reported by the agriculture committee and modified by chairmans mark this legislation would increase f unding for many conservation programs and add number of small new programs to the conservation portf olio while delaying further implementation of the conserva tion security program until fy2012 the senate passed its version of this legislation on d ecember 14 hr 2419 amended by vote of 79 to 14 after adopting wi deranging managers amendment this legislation would create new conservati on stewardship program that combines features of the conservation security and environmental quality incentives programs it would provide level funding for most ex isting conservation programs and create several new programs within existing programs the house and senatepassed versions differ in numerous ways that will have to be resolved by the conference committee the most significant of these differences is that the house version allows ne w signups in the conservation security program csp until fy2012 while the senate version repl aces the csp with new conservation stewardship program and requires that more than 13 million acres be enrolled annually while the house bill would increase conservation funding by more than 45 billion and the senate b ill would increase it by almost 48 billion the differences in which programs would be increased and by how much must also be resolved congressional appropriators influence the scope and scale of conservation programs annually the president signed the consolidated appropriations act 2008 on december 26 2007 it provides funding for the rest of fy2008 it makes several adjustments to funding for conservation programs for example limiting funding for the environmental quality incentives prog ram to 10 billion extends funding for three farm bill programs that

recent developments1 the house and senate comp leted action on their respec tive versions of new farm bill in 2007 hr 2419 however conference action was initially delayed in part because of differences between co mmittee leadership and the administration over the inclusion of tax provisions in the bill and the administrations demand for additional reform of commodity progra ms consequently congress temporarily extended portions of the expiring 2002 farm bill until march 15 2008 as part of the consolidated appropriations act fo r fy2008 p l 110161 since march congress has approved onem onth extension followed by three consecutive short term extensions lasting through may 162 both the house and senate have named conferees conferees began fficial meetings in april 2008 and have been working to resolve approaches to finance new sp ending above baselin using tax provisions not usually associated with farm bills the house and senate versions of the pending omnibus farm bill differ in numerous ways that will have to be resolved by the conference committee in conservation the most significant difference is that the house version allows new signups in the conservation security program csp until fy 2012 while the senate version replaces the csp with new conservation stewardship program that combines features of the existing c sp and environmental quality incentives program requiring that more than 13 milli on acres be enrolled annually the senate bill provides level funding for most existin g conservation programs while increasing overall conservation fundi ng by almost 48 billion between fy2008 and fy2012 and creates several new programs mostly within existing programs the house bill increases overall funding for cons ervation by more than 45 b illion between fy2008 and fy2012 and adds several small new programs to th conservation portfolio while eliminating very little of the current effort beyond delaying further enrollment in the csp until fy2012 congress completed action on fy2008 fundi ng for agriculture when it passed the consolidated appropriations act 2008 hr 2764 the president signed this bill on december 26 2007 it ma kes several adjustments to funding for conservation programs for example limiting funding for the environmental quality incentives program to 10 billion and providing 30 million for watershed operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33556crs2 extends funding for three farm b ill programs that expired at the end of fy 2007 through march 15 2008 and includes 07 acrosstheboard rescission evolution of federal resource conservation issues conservation of soil and wa ter resources has been public policy issue for more than 60 years an issue repeatedly recast as new problems have emerged or old problems have resurfaced two themes re ducing high levels of soil erosion and providing water to agriculture in quantitie s and quality that nhance farm production dominated public policy deba tes about conservation until 1985 congress responded repeatedly to thes themes before 1985 by creating or revising programs designed to redu ce resource problems on the farm they combined voluntary participation with techni cal educational and financial assistance incentives by the early 1980s however concern was growing especially among environmentalists that these programs were not adequately dealing with environmental problems resulting from agricultural activities especially off the farm publicized instances of significant problems especially high soil erosion rates said to rival the dust bowl era increased awareness and intensified the policy debate congress responded in watershed ev ent by enacting four major new conservation programs in the conservation title of th food security act of 1985 pl 99198 one of these programs the conservation reserve program crp greatly increased the federal financial commitment to conservation and targeted federal funds at some of the most severe problems by retiring land under multiyear contracts the other thr ee sodbuster conservation compliance and swampbuster created new approach to conservation by halting producer acce ss to many federal farm program benefits if they did not meet conservation program requirements for highly erodible lands and wetlands thre of these four programs all except swampbuster addressed soil erosion provisions enacted in the next farm b ill the food agriculture conservation and trade act of 1990 pl 101624 reflected rapid evolution of the conservation agenda including the growing influen ce of environmentalists and other non agricultural interests in the formulation of conservation policy and recognition that agriculture was not treated like other busin ess sectors in many environmental laws congress expanded this agenda to addr ess groundwater pollution water quality and sustainable agriculture and allowed for the use of easements as well as amending existing programs amendments to the crp reflect these changes its earlier focus on highly erodible land and on stabilizing land prices has been adjusted especially in the 1990 farm bill to give greater emphasis to environmental concerns after congressional party control switched in 1994 conservation policy discussions turned to identifying ways to make the conservation compliance and swampbuster programs less intrusive on farmer activities this switch also appeared to reduce the influence of environmental in terests in developing conservation policy however the federal agricultural impr ovement and reform act of 1996 pl 104 127 included wideranging conservation title the enact ed bill gave considerablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33556crs3 3 for an overview of conservation provisions in the 1996 farm bill

compare with prior law see crs report rl31486 resource conservation title of the 2002 farm bill comparison of new law with bills passed by the house and senate and prior law by jeffrey zinn 5 us department of agriculture reform and assessment of conservation programs report to congress submitted july 10 2006attention to wildlife and enacted new pr ograms dealing with farmland protection grasslands and other topics it also funded many of these new programs as mandatory for the first time using the co mmodity credit corporation as the funding mechanism3 the nature of the conservation effort c ontinued to evolve after 1996 as reflected in the provisions of the most recent farm b ill the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 pl 107171 conservation themes in this farm bill included 1 increasing overall funding 2 creating new pr ograms and addressing new issues and 3 providing more conservation on lands in production called working lands primarily through the new conservation secur ity program one factor that influenced the decision to provide more funding wa s the large backlog of interested and qualified applicants who coul d not participate because of insufficient funds new factor in this farm bill was considering how funding for farm programs generally and conservation specifically could be used to meet world trade obligations4 themes for conservation and the broader context within which the farm bill is being debated have continued to change and are desc ribed below in the section on the 2007 farm bill current major conservation activities usdas conservation efforts have centered in recent years on implementing the conservation reserve pr ogram crp wetland pr otection programs the environmental quality incentives program eqip and the conservation security program csp and on providing technical assistance funding for the overall conservation effort will have grown much larger by the end of fy2007 when many of the farm bill programs authorized in the 2002 law expired general trends in policy for the suite of conservation pr ograms between 2002 and 2007 included less emphasis on land retirement nd on land producing row crops and more attention to conservation on land in other agricultu ral uses and to livestock producers recognizing this expanding effort c ongress in the 2002 farm bill required the secretary to submit report to both agriculture committees bout how to better coordinate and consolidate conserva tion programs including implementing recommendations that report was delivered in july 20065 lead conservation agencies are the natural resources conservation service nrcs which provides techni cal assistance and administers most programs and the farm service agency fsa which administers the most expensive current programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33556crs4 6 for background information on the suite of current conservation programs administered by nrcs and fsa see crs report rl32940 agriculture conservation programs scorecard by jeffrey zinn and tadlock cowan 7 one of many recent examples of such pa rtnerships is the november 8 2006 announcement of partnership with the defense departme nt to promote land conservation near military bases 8 mandatory spending means that funding levels or for this program acreage enrollment levels are authorized for each year in the 2002 farm bill and provided through the borrowing authority of the commodity cred it corporation with annual appropriation required 9 information on the crp including announcements and enrollment statistics can be found at httpwwwfsausdagovdaftcepdcrphtmthe crp these agencies are supported by others in usda that supply research and educational assistance including the agricultural research service the forest service and the economic research service6 in addition the conservation effort involves very large array of partners including other federal agencies state and local governments and private organiza tions among others who provide funds expertise and other forms of assi stance to the conservation effort7 conservation reserve program crp under the crp producers can bid to enro ll highly erodible or environmentally sensitive lands into the reserve during si gnup periods retiring it from production for 10 years in almost all instances successf ul bidders receive annual rental payments and costsharing and tec hnical assistance enrollment can total up to 392 million acres however enrollment in combination with land enrolled in the wetland reserve program discussed below is limited to 25 of the crop land in county funding is mandatory spending8 fsas summary of par ticipation through february 2007 shows almost 368 million acres were enrolled with more than 4 million acres in texas and almost 35 million acres in montana9 only land that was cropped in four of six years preceding enactment is eligible thus making it more difficult to bring land into production prima rily to gain access to the program subprogram can enroll up to 1 million acres of small isolated farmable wetlands since 2002 some economic uses of enrolled lands have been permitted in return for reduction in annual rental payments in august 2005 secretary of agricultu re johanns announced that usda would offer opportunities to reenroll or extend contracts involving more than 28 million acres of land where current contracts ex pire between 2007 and 2010 priority for reenrollment was based on the relative ranking of the land using the environmental benefits index with additional credit being given for land located in any of five national priority areas or areas of signif icant adverse water quality or habitat impacts contracts were offered in five groups land in the highest ranked group was reenrolled for 10 years with 15 years for restored wetlands using updated market rental rates to reflect changes in local market conditions land in the other four groups received contract extens ions at existing rental rate s with the second highest group receiving fiveyear extensions nd the lowest group receiving twoyearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33556crs5 extensions on march 8 2007 fsa nnounced that 232 million acres would reenroll or extend their contracts out of the 278 million set to expire between 2007 and 2010 the other 46 million acres will exit the program when contracts expire some of these acres will be planted to m eet the growing demand for corn to produce ethanol and fsa also stated that pproximately 14 million of the 46 million acres are located in major corn producing areas more recently usda announced with its fy2008 budget request that it does not antic ipate holding general signup in 2007 or 2008 more recently interest has grow n in providing producers with the option to leave the program without penalty because of high market pr ices for corn wheat and soybeans and the depar tment has repeatedly responde d that it does not see any justification for such an option at this time usda has estimated that the average erosion rate on enrolled acres has been reduced from 21 to less than 2 tons per acre per year retiring these lands also expanded wildlife habitat enhanced water quality and restored soil quality the annual value of these benef its has been estimated from less than 1 billion to more than 15 billion in some regions where par ticipation is most concentrated estimated benefits exceed annual program costs wh ich have averaged about 50 per acre per year however the government acc ountability office gao and others have criticized the potentially ephe meral nature of these bene fits because the landowner is under obligation to retain them after contracts expire although they must follow conservation plan on any previously enrolled highly erodible land to retain eligibility for many types of farm program payments in addition to general signups fsa has enrolled more than 37 million acres under several more targeted options th acres which count against the overall enrollment cap of 392 million acres can be enrolled continuously because they are presumed to provide large environmental benefits the three largest and oldest options all authorized in legislation are continuously enrolling portions of fields with especially high environmental values throug h february 2007 more than 26 million acres had been enrolled with more than 465000 acres in iowa the most common conservation practice at these sites is buffer strips along water bodies stateinitiated enhancement program conservation reserveenhancement program or crep under which states contribute funds so that higher rents can be offered to potentia l participants in specified areas where benefits will be concentrated for example maryland the first state to implement crep is enrolling stream buffers restored wetlands and high ly erodible lands along streams in portion of the chesapeake bay watershed currently 29 states have one or more pproved enhancement programs 3 states have more than one program and re quests are pending from several additional states fsa data show that almost 920000 acres had been enrolled through february 2007 program to enroll up to 1 million acres of small isolated farmablewetlands usda offers signup bonus to attract participation more than 162000 acres had been enrolled through february 2007 with more than 71000 of those acres in iowa httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33556crs6 10 for more information on crp see crs report rs21613 conservation reserve program status and current issues by tadlock cowanother newer options all tablished through administrative actions by usda include enrolling up to 500000 acres of floodplai ns to be planted to hardwood trees with allotments specified for states rolling up to 250000 acres of field boarders for northern bobwhite quail habitat creating up to 250000 acres of wetlands in non floodplain areas and restoring up to 250000 acres of long leaf pine 100000 acres of duck nesting habitat nd 500000 acres to meet priority needs in all states with allocations to each state finally ne w emergency forestry conservation program was enacted in supplemental appropriations in the wake of hurricane katrina in 2005 under which fsa estimates that 700000 acres will be restored nrcs provides technical assistance in support of crp but the 1996 farm bill placed cap on funding from the ccc that can be used to reimburse agencies for services provided to deliver ccc programs these funds have been insufficient to pay all related technical assistance cost s at times in recent years and in fy1999 nrcs briefly suspended crprelated activities nrcs now has line item in its budget for this purpose and received 764 million for fy2006 congressional efforts to provide adequate technical assistance funding are discussed in the subsection titled technical assistance below10 wetlands and agriculture swampbuster and the wetlands reserve program wrp have been the main agricultural wetland protection programs 1 million acre program for small isolated farmable wetlands added to the crp in the 2002 farm bill is discussed above under swampbuster farmers w ho convert wetlands to produce crops lose many federal farm progra m benefits until the wetland is restored swampbuster includes several exemptions from loss of benefits such as any wetland conversion that was initiated prior to december 23 1985 the date of enac tment or wetland that is created as result of adjacent development it allows partial penalty meaning that fewer benefits are lost once decade swampbuster has been cont roversial since it was first enacted in 1985 some from the farm community view wetland protection efforts on agricultural lands as too extensive or overzealous they observe th at it protects some sites that appear to provide few of the values attributed to wetlands portion of this group also view these efforts as an unacceptable intrusion of government into the rights of private property owners or takings environm ental and other groups counter that the swampbuster program has been enforced weakly and inconsis tently with few violators losing farm program benefits c ontroversies also aris over inconsistencies such as when adjoining states use different interpretations of rules that lead to different determinations wetland issue for agriculture was rais ed in

should not pply to certain isolated waters one result is that an estimated 8 million acres of agricultural wetlands that had been subject to the section 404 prog ram is now subject only to swampbuster up to 1 million of these acres may be rolled in the farmable wetland component of the crp11 the supreme court issued subs equent decisions on two cases that continue to alter the reach of the section 404 program12 the second wetlands program the wrp was established in the 1990 farm bill it uses permanent and temporary easements and longterm agreements to protect farmed wetlands enrollment reached almost 19 million acres by september 30 2006 permanent easements account for more than 80 of the total and have been perfected on almost 15 million acres the s ecretary has the option of delegating the administration of easements to other federal or state agencies with the necessary expertise it currently has an enrollment cap of 2275000 acres and annual enrollment is limited to 250000 acres funding is mandatory through the ccc the office of inspector general released an audit report in 2006 which found that unwarranted payments had been made becau of lax controls and poor appraisals on june 29 2004 usda announced part nership initiative in nebraska modeled after the crep com ponent of the crp to enroll almost 19000 acres this may be prototype for future initia tives another recent initiative taken administratively will be used to creat 250000 acres of wetlands in nonfloodplain areas see the crp discussion above13 during fy2006 nrcs used reverse auction to enroll more than 3500

years before 2002 payments are based on which of three levels of conservation is pla nned for and practiced the west level allows contracts of five years and annual pa yments up to 20000 the middle level allows contracts of 5 to 10 years and annual payments up to 35000 th top level allows contracts of 5 to 10 years and annual payments up to 45000 the lowest level requires plan that addresses at least one resource cern on part of farm the middle level requires plan that addresses at least one resource concern on the entire operation and the top level requires plan to ddress all resource concerns on the entire operation implementation has proven c ontroversial as the authorizing legislation created this program as true entitlement but appropriators prohib ited funding in fy2003 then limited available funding each year s ubsequently as result csp has been growing but much more slowly than pr oponents would like nrcs has responded to these funding constraints in the way that it has implemented the program limiting signups to producers in designated waters heds after three year s of implementation the program has more that 19000 participants in 280 watersheds in these watersheds about 157 million acres has been enrolled in the program requested funding for fy2008 was 316 million an increase of 57 million from fy2007 however this increase only will be nough to support contracts on land that is currently enrolled this program has another component new to the conservation effort it requires interested producers to complete an extensive selfassessment to determine their eligibility the fi rst time it has re quired this am ount of work from producers interested in enrolling in conservation programs as prerequisite to determining whether they will be accepted17 the most recent congressional action to cap csp funding wa s in reconciliation legislation enacted february 8 2006 pl 109171 where it was capped at total of 1954 billion from fy2006 through fy2010 and at 565 billion from fy2006 through fy2015 the budget resolution that set fy2007 spending provides only enough funding to support existing contracts these actions generated complaints from program supporters who view the curr ent funding situation as being at odds with the entitlement that wa s envisioned in 2002 and are l ooking for alternatives to gain additional funding18 earlier actions related to csp funding include the following in fy2002 cbo scored csp at 2 billion over 10 years in 2003 cbo revised this estimate to 68 billion in fy2003 appropriations cong ress limited csp funding

assistance nrcs provides technical assistance ta at the request of the landowner to conserve and improve natura l resources ta includes professional advice on how to design install and maintain land manage ment vegetative and structural practices that provide conservation be nefits nrcs combines that advice with knowledge of local conditions ta is component of most conservation programs and nrcs estimates that the cost of providing it in fy2005 amounted to about 145 billion19 almost 10 billion of this total came fro m discretionary accounts two issues associated with technical assistance have been whether nrcs has the capacity to meet the growing demand as funding fo r programs increases and how technical assistance costs should be f unded for mandatory programs nrcs is permitted to augment the technical assistance capacity of the agency by allowing producers to use approved third pa rties to provide this assistance in the june 7 2006 oversight hearing nrcs chief bruce knight testified that more than 2500 applications to perform these servi ces had been approved these people had provided the equivalent of 520 staff years of support between 2003 and 2006 at cost of 1635 million to the agency subsection of section 2701 of the 2002 farm bill provided that technical assistance in support of each mandatory pr ogram come from the funding provided by the ccc for that program however the office of management and budget supported by the department of justice issued an opini on in late 2002 that technical assistance funding for mandatory programs remains limited under cap that has been placed in section 11 of the ccc charter unde r prior law many in congress had thought that the language in the 2002 farm b ill had resolved this issue and they were supported in this conclusion by gao opinion the administration proposed in its fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005 budget requests to address th is limit by creating new farm bill technical assistance account to be funded through annual appropriations congress rej ected these proposals in fy2003 and fy2004 congress prohibited using any of the discretionary funds from conservation operations for technical assistance to implement any mandatory programs this prohibition combined with retention of the cap on ccc funds that can be spent on administrative expenses meant that some of the mandatory programs donated funding for technical assistance to other programs thereby leaving lesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33556crs11 20 for example in fy2003 the eqip was authorized at 695 million of that total 145 million was to be spent on ta leaving 550 million for costsharing assistance to producers but eqip was donor program b ecause an additional 107 million was diverted from the program to pay for ta in other mandatory conservation programs leaving 442 million for costsharing assistance for producers other donor programs in fy 2003 included the farmland protection program the grasslands reserve program and the

from the current effort prior to acting on farm bill legisla tion both agriculture committees had held hearings on conservation earlier in 2007 the senate agriculture committee held an oversight hearing on the conservation security program and environmental quality incentives program on january 17 and general conservation hearing on may 1 while the house agriculture committee s subcommittee on conservation credit energy and research held hearing on the status and performance of conservation programs on april 19 at these hearings interest groups expressed support for or opposition to many of the proposals that d emerged and addressed questions such as how funding constraints might be addressed in conser vation policies and programs several reports from usda agencies and others such as the strategic plan for usdas natural resources conservation service nrcs which administers most of the conservation programs to gu ide its activities until 2010 helped to inform the farm bill debate31 the mostwidely discussed c onservation topics include in particular order the following how to better integrate conservation efforts with commodity policies through green payments or by other means whether overall conservation funding should continue to grow and how any additional funds shoul d be allocated among the many conservation programs as well as whether certain locations states regions or watersheds producer s or resource concerns should receive higher priority and what levels of funding would eliminate backlogs of interest in program participation whether funding for working lands in production generally referred to as green payments and perhaps modeled after the csp should be expanded both because of the likely need for more funding if international trade talks are successfully concluded and because such an effort would complement the many land retirement conservation programs32 how to make energy policies that encourage expanded crop cultivation for biofuels compatible with land retirement and other conservation goals how to address issues new to the farm bill or of growing importance such as endangered species and invasive specieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33556crs20 33 more information on this initiative can be found at httpcooperativeconservationgovwhether the federal conservation agencies have the capacity to deliver
