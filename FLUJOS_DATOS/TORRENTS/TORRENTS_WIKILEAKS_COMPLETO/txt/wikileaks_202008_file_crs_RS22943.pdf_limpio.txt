details the home retention and economic stabilization act of 2008 hr 6076 which would delay foreclosure for up to 270 days and set minimum payments for borrowers during the deferment period foreclosure deferment may be of increased interest to policymakers because it might allow more people to consider the new hope for homeowners program passed by congress on july 26 20081 hope for homeowners is voluntary program to enable troubled mortgage borrowers and lenders to refinance their loans through the federal housing administration fha having created the voluntary program it remains to be seen if people will be willing and able to participate under current financial market conditions meanwhile the pace of foreclosures continues to rise even as another category of loans alta approaches the peak of its payment resets some have argued for moratorium on foreclosures to give distressed borrowers and lenders time to seek financial relief others might argue that delaying foreclosures may also delay the recapitalization of the banking system and ultimately delay restoration of stability in financial markets proponents might respond that providing additional time to keep current borrowers in their homes will ultimately reduce the magnitude of bank losses and lessen the need for recapitalization hr 6076 provides one method of granting borrowers and lenders additional time to avoid foreclosure 2

expressed purpose of the bill is to permit deferrals on certain home mortgage foreclosures for limited period to allow homeowners to take remedial action to require home mortgage servicers to provide advance notice of any upcoming reset of the mortgage interest rate and for other purposes hr 6076 seeks to achieve these goals by establishing 270 day deferment period for eligible mortgages during which foreclosure proceedings are halted requiring borrowers to continue making loan payments during the deferment period and requiring lenders to provide borrowers notice of any upcoming payment

defines an eligible deferredforeclosure mortgage as subprime mortgage or negative amortization mortgage originated prior to january 1 2008 that has reached its deferment trigger in the following discussion the section numbers refer to subsections of section 128a that would be added to the truth in lending act as described in the bill 4 1 subprime mortgage eligibility section 2a8 in general subprime mortgages have higher interest rates than prime mortgages because of greater risk of default therefore subprime is defined within the bill in terms of interest rates for firstlien loans on residential mortgages loan is subprime if its interest rate equals or exceeds the yield on treasuries of comparable maturity by more than 3 percentage points or has an annual percentage rate that equals or exceeds the most recent conventional mortgage rate by more than 175 basis points 5 for mortgages that are second liens on residential property subprime is defined as more than 5 percentage points above treasuries of comparable maturity or 375 basis points above the most recent conventional mortgages 2 negative amortization mortgage eligibility section 2a6 in general fully amortizing loan pays off the full principal gradually over the term of the mortgage while negatively amortizing mortgage allows periods in which the outstanding balance grows hr 6076 defines negative amortization mortgage as consumer credit transaction secured by the consumers principal residence with the potential for negative amortization of the outstanding principal balance and under which the minimum monthly payment of principal and interest required increases after the date of origination 3 borrower eligibility section 2a5 the bill establishes four criteria for borrower eligibility the borrower must 1 have an eligible mortgage either subprime or negative amortization 2 reside at the mortgaged property and intend to continue to reside there for the duration of the deferment period 3 have an annua l income not more than twice the state median income adjusted for family size and 4 respond to any reasonable inquiries from the loans servicers or creditors 4 the deferment trigger section 2a3 the date on which the borrower becomes eligible for deferment depends on whether the eligibility of the mortgage is based on subprime or negative 4 15 usc 1631 et seq 5 basis point is 1100 of percentage point defining subprime with the 3 percentage point threshold matches the threshold used by the federal reserve to designate higher risk mortgages in its home mortgage disclosure act hmda database these mortgages are commonly referred to as ratespread mortgages and several industry sources now provide data on ratespread mortgages in lieu of presenting information on mortgages from the department of housing and urban developments hud list of lenders w ho specialize in the subprime market for example the 2007 mortgage market statistical annualvolume i pp 226227 uses the ratespread definition for 2004 and later when hmda began reporting ratespread mortgages but uses huds lender list for 2003 and earlier when ratespread information was not available inside mortgage publications bethesda maryland 2007 ratespread mortgages for hmda should not be confused with mortgages subject to the home owners equity protection act hoepa which has higher interest rate threshold

borrower who fails to make the required monthly payment risks terminating the deferment period 1 deferment payment amounts section 2e2 for subprime loans the required monthly payment during the deferment period is the lesser of the minimum monthly payment of principal and interest on the date the loan was originated or monthly payment to be calculated based on recent market conditions the formula for this second monthly payment calculation recent conditions is the monthly payment required for 30year fixedrate loan applied to the outstanding balance using an interest rate equal to the most recent conventional mortgage rate plus 100 basis points section 2g defines the most recent conventional mortgage rate as the fixed rate mortgage rate listed in the federal reserves h15 release in the week prior to the determination of the deferment period payment 6 for example if the most recent conventional rate reported by the federal reserve is 630 then the rate used to calculate the monthly payment under the current conditions approach would be 730 many subprime loans had twoyear introductory period followed by 28year period at an adjustable interest rate to fully pay off the loan socalled 228s7 in many cases the introductory periods interest rate was lower than the contemporaneous market rate called teaser so that the effective interest rate would be likely to rise for given borrower even if market rates were not rising in some cases the twoyear introductory period may also have been interestonly in which case the monthly payment would rise when the loan became fully amortizing even if market interest rates fell the bill sets the required payment during the deferment period for subprime loans as the lesser of the original minimum payment and what current 30year fixedrate mortgage might require for the remaining balance for negative amortization loans the required payment during the deferment period is the minimum monthly mortgage payment required at the time the mortgage was originated formula for any mortgages that are both subprime and negative amortization is not separately specified 2 amortization of deferment balances section 2e3 in some months perhaps most months the minimum required payment during the deferment period as specified in section 2e2 will be less than the amount due in that month under the original terms of the mortgage
