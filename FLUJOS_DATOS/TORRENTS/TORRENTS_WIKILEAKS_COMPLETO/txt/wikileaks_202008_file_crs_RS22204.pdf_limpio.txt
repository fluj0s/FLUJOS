of 2008 at one time reaching more than 140 per barrel of crude oil since july however petroleum prices and import volumes have fallen at historically rapid pace in january 2009 prices of crude oil fell below 40 per barrel at the same time the average monthly volume of imports of energyrelated petroleum products fell slightly the sharp rise in the cost of energy imports added an estimated 50 billion to the nations trade deficit in 2006 and another 28 billion in 2007 the fall in the cost of energy imports combined with the drop in import volumes as result of th slowdown in economic activity has reversed the trend of rising energy imports costs and will sharply reduce the overall costs of us energy imports for the rest of 2008 this report provides an estimate of the initial impact of the rising oil prices on the nations merchandise trade deficit this report will be updated as warranted by events

g343g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 according to data published by the census bureau of the department of commerce1 the prices of petroleum products over the first half of 2008 rose sharply generally rising considerably faster than the change in demand for those products before falling at historic rate as result the price increases of imported energyrelated petroleum products worsened the us trade deficit in 2006 and 2007 and will again in 2008 energyrelated petroleum products is term used by the census bureau that includes crude oil petroleum preparations and liquefied propane and butane gas crude oil comprises the largest share by far within this broad category of energyrelated imports the slowdown in the rate of growth in the us economy is sharply reducing the amount of energy that the country imports and is helping to push down world energy prices and in isolation from other events is placing upward pressure on the dollar against broad range of other currencies to the extent that the additions to the merchandise trade deficit are returned to the us economy as payment for additional us exports or to acquire such assets as securities or us businesses the us trade deficit could be mitigated further table 1 presents summary data from the census bureau for the change in the volume or quantity of energyrelated petroleum imports and the change in the price or the value of those imports for 2007 and for 2008 the data indicate that the united states imported 48 billion barrels of total energyrelated petroleum products in 2007 valued at 319 billion in the januarynovember period of 2008 the quantity of energyrelated petr oleum imports fell by 50 compared with the comparable period in 2007 crude oil imports also fell by 36 from the same period in 2007 yearoveryear the average value of energyrelated petroleum products imports rose by 46 while the average value of crude oil imports rose by 534 as figure 1 shows imports of

combined with small decrease in the volumes of oil imports experienced during the period combined to post large jump in the overall cost of imported energy at times crude oil traded for nearly 148 per barrel in july 2008 indicating that the cost of energy imports would have significant impact on the overall costs of us imports and on the value of the us trade deficit since those record prices the price per barrel of imported crude oil has fallen to under 40 per barrel at times in january 2009 with an expected decrease in the volumes of energyrelated petroleum products imports for the remainder of 2008 due to slowdown in economic activity and at an average price of 90 per barrel energy related import prices could add about 90 billion to the trade deficit on an annual basis pushing the annual

energy imports and might help restrain the prices of energy imports an important factor however will be the impact atlantic hurricanes have on the production of crude oil in the gulf of mexico most immediately higher prices for energy imports will worsen the nations merchandise trade deficit add to inflationary pressures and have disproportionate impact on the energyintensive sectors of the economy and on households on fixed incomes over the long run sustained increase in the prices of energy imports will permanently increase the nations merchandise trade deficit although some of this impact could be offset if some of the dollars are returned to the us economy through increased purchases of us goods and services or through purchases of such other assets as securities or us businesses some of the return in dollars likely will come through sovereign wealth funds swfs or funds controlled and managed by foreign governments as foreign exchange reserves boost the dollar holdings of such funds such investments likely will add to concerns about the national security implications of foreign acquisitions of us firms especially by foreign governments and to concerns about the growing share of outstanding us treasury secu rities that are owned by foreigners over the longrun it is possible for the economy to adjust to the higher prices of energy imports by improving its energy efficiency finding alternative sources of energy or searching out additional supplies of energy there may well be increased pressure applied to congress to assist in this process for congress the increase in the nations merchandise trade deficit could add to existing inflationary pressures and complicate efforts to stimulate the economy should the rate of economic growth slow down in particular congress through its direct role in making economic policy and its oversight role over the federal reserve could face the dilemma of rising inflation which generally is treated by raising interest rates to tighten credit and slowing rate of economic growth which is usually addressed by lowering interest rates to stimulate investment sharp rise in the trade deficit may also add to pressures for congress to examine the causes of the deficit and to address the underlying factors that are generating that deficit in addition the rise in prices of energy imports could add to concerns about the nations reliance on foreign supplies for energy imports and add impetus to examining the nations energy strategy
