from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to stefan rahmstorf rahmstorfozeanklimade keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re latest draft of 2000year section text date tue 28 feb 2006 171045 0000 cc jtouarizonaedueysteinjansengeouibno fortunat joos joosclimateunibechdrindgissnasagov xflowed hi stefan our keith and mine understanding of this issue is that burger et 2006 tellus already published and therefore citable already point out the von storch et 2004 mistake in implementing the mann et 1998 method but we havent stated this or cited the science in press comment because burger et also demonstrate that when they implement the method without the detrending step ie following the mann et approach more accurately than von storch et did then the bias is still there though of smaller magnitude than von storch et 2004 suggested given that we already say that the extent of any bias is uncertain it does not seem necessary to go into the details any further by discussing the implementation by von storch et of the mann et method finally i think though here it is less clear from their paper and i am relying on my recollection of talking to gerd burger that burger et also show that the amount of noise von storch et added to create the pseudoproxies yields pseudoreconstruction that has much better verification skill than obtained by mann et 1998 for their real reconstruction if they increase the noise added deteriorating the skill of the pseudoproxies until they get similar verification statistics as mann et report then the size of the bias gets bigger in fact the bias they obtain with the higher noise but correct nodetrending method is actually very similar to the bias von storch et reported with lower noise but incorrect detrending method so where does that leave us i dont think theres room to put all this in of course the magnitude of the bias cannot be determined from any pseudoproxy simulation anyway and will be different for different models wed be interested to know if your or others on the cc list interpretation of burger et 2006 is significantly different to this cheers tim at 1642 28022006 stefan rahmstorf wrote hi keith and others attached is the draft keith sent on 21 feb of the 2000year section with comments and edits grey from i note that von storch et 2004 is cited without it being mentioned that they did not implement the mann et method correctly by detrending before calibration the performance of the method was greatly degraded in their model i guess you left this out because the comment to science showing this is still in press will it be added once this has been published i think it is major point as it was such highprofile paper von storchs contention that the hockey stick is nonsense cited in the us senate is based on mistake cheers stefan to reach directly please use rahmstorfozeanklimade my former addresses pikpotsdamde are read by my assistant brigitta stefan rahmstorf wwwozeanklimade wwwrealclimateorg dr timothy j osborn climatic research unit school of environmental sciences university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk email tosbornueaacuk phone 44 1603 592089 fax 44 1603 507784 web httpwwwcruueaacuktimo sunclock httpwwwcruueaacuktimosunclockhtm xflowed
