in the medicare medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa pl 106554 summary since the passage of the balanced budget act of 1997 bba pl 10533 medicare spending has set records for low or declining rates of program growth congress first addressed the issue of slower rates of growth in medicare spending with the passage of the balanced budget refinement act of 1999 bbra pl 106 113 however while part of the slower rates of growth may be attributed to under estimates of the savings derived from the bba it is difficult to pinpoint any one factor as the exact cause for this projected decline in spending provider groups argue that the bba reductions have threatened both their economic viability and their ability to provide services for medicare beneficiaries however government studies have indicated that this lower rate of growth has not resulted in inadequate reimbursement rates as the congress debated further amendments to the bba the current cbo projections were those released in july 2000 cbo projected that medicare would spend about total of 1339 trillion over the following 5 years 20012005 these figures continued to reflect downward trend in estimates fiveyear 20012005 estimates of medicare spending were down by 378 billion or more than 20 with concomitant decline in the estimated average annual rate of growth from 94 to 75 per year

106554 background since the passage of the balanced budget act of 1997 bba pl 10533 medicare spending has set records for low or declining rates of program growth in fiscal year 1998 the medicare growth rate slowed to then record low of just 15 for the entire year an amount less than would be expected allowing for increases in enrollment and for inflation the following year set new record when for the first time in the programs history medicare spending dropped from one year to the next mandatory program spending declined by about 2 billion from 211 billion in 1998 to 2093 billion in 1999 almost 1 decline according to the department of the treasury medicare spending for 2000 increased by about 3 although part of the slower rates of growth may be attributed to underestimates of the savings derived from the bba it is difficult to pinpoint any one factor as the exact cause for this projected decline in spending many factors other than the bba such as an improved economic forecast and heightened antifraud activities are significant components of the decline in the rates of growth in medicare spending see crs report rs20238 trends in medicare spending after the balanced budget act for detailed discussion of the factors affecting medicare projections provider groups argue that the bba reductions have threatened both their economic viability and their ability to provide services for medicare beneficiaries however government studies have indicated that this lower rate of growth has not resulted in inadequate reimbursement rates for example reports on the medicarechoice mc program by both the department of health and human services hhs and the gao indicate that payment levels are not too low the inspector general of the hhs reported in september 2000 that mc organizations receive more than an adequate amount of funds to deliver the medicare package of covered services gao also reported in august 2000 on their examination of 1998 payments the second year that plans were paid using the mc payment rates their examination showed that the mc program spent about 32 billion or over 13 more on health plan enrollees than if these enrollees had received services through traditional feeforservice medicare despite these findings mc organizations are withdrawing from the program disrupting coverage to many medicare beneficiaries studies of the adequacy of payment extend beyond the mc program the inspector general of hhs in series of reports on skilled nursing facilities snfs crs2 reported that even under the new prospective payment system most hospital discharge planners were able to place patients that need care in nursing facility congress first addressed the issue of slower rates of growth in medicare spending with the passage of the balanced budget refinement act of 1999 bbra pl 106113 at time of passage cbo estimated that the bbra would add approximately 16 billion in total back into the medicare program for 20012005 cbos july 2000 estimates of medicare spending released in july 2000 projected that medicare spending growth over the course of the 2001 to 2010 decade would average 73 annually over that period medicares share of the us national income was projected to increase from 23 of gross domestic product gdp in 2000 to 28 by 2010 most of medicares program growth was expected to result from two factors increased enrollment and automatic updates in reimbursements for services the table below compares cbos july 2000 projections with two earlier estimates those made in july 1999 just prior to the passage of the bbra and the january 1997 estimates calculated prior to the passage of the bba as shown in the table according to cbos july 2000 projections medicare would spend about total of 1339 trillion over the following 5 years 20012005 these figures reflected the downward trend in estimates for the 5year period cbos estimated spending was lower by 60 billion 4 reduction concurrently the projected rate of growth for medicare spending for the 5year period was reduced from 78 per year to 75 per year comparing the july 2000 estimates to prebba estimates computed 3 years ago showed significant decline in the projected rate of growth fiveyear estimates of medicare spending were down by 378 billion or more than 20 with concomitant decline in the estimated average annual rate of growth from 94 to 75 per

and then passed legislation that would increase funding to the medicare program the fy2001 budget resolution hconres 290 earmarked specific funds for the medicare spending the conference report hrept 106577 approved by both house and senate on april 13 2000 contained assumptions of both the house and senate bills in the house there was 40 billion reserve fund over 5 years 20012005 for legislation

administrations original bill the cbo estimate for the administrations revised proposal was higher 985 billion over the fy2001fy2005 period medicare bills the house commerce committee1 ordered reported hr 5291 beneficiary improvement and protection act of 2000 on september 27 2000 and the ways and means subcommittee on health ordered reported its bill to the full committee october 3 2000

that also increased medicare program funding in the senate the senate finance committee has sole jurisdiction over medicare ie over both part and part b of the program based on the provisions in the

health agencies and skilled nursing facilities the legislation also included limited expansions of certain preventive benefits and modified the appeals and coverage processes but did not address the issue of prescription drug coverage cbo estimates that this legislation will increase medicare spending by 323 billion over the 5year period 20012005 and 815 billion over the 10year period 200120102 substantial portion of these funds would be spent on the medicarechoice program 112 billion over 5 years and 325 billion over 10 years cbo also estimated significant increase in federal spending for hospital outpatient services 57 billion over 5 years and 142 billion over 10 years and hospital inpatient services 52 billion over 5 years and 96 billion over 10 years the remainder of the spending increase would be spread across medicare to cover beneficiary improvements rural health care skilled nursing facilities hospice care physicians and other medicare services the total federal budgetary impact on the medicare medicaid and schip programs is projected to be 17 billion over 5 years and 151 billion over 10 years these spending estimates reflect the increased medicare spending which is significantly offset by savings to the medicaid program however this report is limited to describing the medicare proposals included in the bill for description of the medicaid and schip proposals see
