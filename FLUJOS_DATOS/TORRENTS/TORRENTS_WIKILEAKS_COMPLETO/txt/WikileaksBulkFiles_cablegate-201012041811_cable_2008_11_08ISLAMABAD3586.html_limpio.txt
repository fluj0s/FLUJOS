hit targets classified by anne w patterson for reasons 14 b d 1 c summary codel snowe met november 11 with pakistans prime minister yousuf gilani gilani thanked the usg for its support in helping transition the country to full democracy and congratulated the us on its recent election gilani reiterated that the struggle against extremism was pakistans war which had claimed many more pakistani lives than those of all nato troops combined he requested more intelligence sharing from the usg arguing that the pakistan army would then hit the targets us drone attacks were counterproductive in winning the publics support gilani argued terrorist acts were also hurting the countrys economy and driving away international investments gilani claimed good relations with neighbor afghanistan but complained about the lack of goa cooperation on biometric border control system gilani made specific requests for gunship and heavylift helicopters nightvision equipment bulletproof vehicles and realtime satellite information end summary closer relationship 2 c the ambassador us senators olympia snowe rme and sheldon whitehouse dri as well as congressional staff eric pelofsky and john maguire met november 11 with pm yousuf gilani defense minister ahmed mukhtar interior advisor rehman malik and national security advisor ambassador mahmud ali durrani 3 c pm gilani thanked the us senate for its support of his countrys democracy he credited the usg for pakistans relative free and fair elections on february 18 pakistans women had taken on increased leadership roles throughout the new federal and provincial governments he claimed gilani recounted his two meetings with president bush this past summer and noted that he has also met with candidate now presidentelect barack obama he extended congratulations on the recent us elections gilani looked forward to closer relationship with the us ranging from intelligence sharing to educational exchanges 4 c gilani pressed the usg to share all credible actionable threat information we will hit the targets ourselves he promised gilani added that drone strikes not only violated pakistani sovereignty but also fed antius sentiment making harder his own public case that the struggle against extremists was pakistans war instead there was popular pressure on elected officials like himself to forcefully respond to alleged us border incursions which were an embarrassment for the gop the trust gap should be filled with joint actions he argued and while he might be criticized for such bilateral cooperation he believed he could effectively convince the public that those targeted were responsible for benazir bhuttos assassination and the killing of innocents at schools shopping centers and police stations 5 c gilani stated we have the will but not the capacity he claimed the gop was seeing success in separating militants from the tribals and in supporting local militias lashkars the police frontier constabulary and frontier corps should be given personnel carriers weapons bulletproof jackets and training gilani urged the army gilani continued needed realtime satellite information gunship and heavylift helicopters and nightvision equipment 6 c what more proof do you need from us that we are allies against terrorism gilani asked after all pakistan had lost more soldiers and civilians than coalition countries combined he claimed pakistan had also taken an economic hit because of its frontline status in the war on terror international investment had dried up and domestic capital was being transferred out he worried he did thank however the friends of pakistan for their support for an international financing program 7 c senator snowe reiterated usg support for pakistans return to democracy and noted the degree to which pakistanis had suffered in the war on terror pakistan was key islamabad 00003586 002 of 002 ally she added and both countries must agree on common approach to our common enemy new us administration was an opportunity for reassessment of our joint strategy snowe also noted the high opinion in the us and within the usg for pakistans new civilian administration the armys kayani and interservices intelligences isi pasha and pointed to the establishment of border coordination centers as positive developments afghanistan 8 c stable afghanistan is in pakistans interests gilani said he had reached out to afghanistans president karzai as well as indias pm singh in his first days in office against the advice of his foreign ministry he noted which wanted the neighbors to visit here first all sides needed to get past petty matters in order to tackle the terrorism destroying us all 9 c pakistan supported the paris donors conference to aid afghanistan and was moving forward with bilateral talks and jirgas gilani noted the continued strain of 35 million afghan refugees inside his country he complained however that afghanistan had only one border checkpoint to every 10 of pakistans also the goa had not agreed to biometricbased controls at the border crossings 10 c gilani asked the us to release to gop custody dr aafia siddiqui pakistani arrested in and deported from afghanistan on charges of assaulting us law enforcement officer gilani argued that the needs of her family and reports of her being ill provided humanitarian grounds for such transfer he also argued that her case whipped up mass popular support diverting his governments attention from the counterterrorism mission 11 u codel snowe did not clear this cable
