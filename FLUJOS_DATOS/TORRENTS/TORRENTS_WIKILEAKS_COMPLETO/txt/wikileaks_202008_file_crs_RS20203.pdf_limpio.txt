nunnlugar cooperative t hreat reduction programs issues for congress background when the soviet union collapsed in late 1991 congress responded to concerns about the safety and security of sovi et nuclear chemical and other weapons by establishing the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction ctr program it has allocated total of 27 billion to this effort since 1992 pro jects funded by the ctr program assist the new independent states nis of the former soviet union with the safe and secur transportation storage and dismantling of nuclear chemical and other weapons of mass destruction wm d and related materials the united states expects to help russia and other nis reduce the threat these wea pons and materials might pose to the united states for several years congress authorized and appropriated almost all c trrelated funds through the department of defense dod budget even though interagency teams whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20203crs2 often included experts from the state department and department of energy doe would negotiate and implement specific proj ects although dod served as the executive agent for the funding of threat reduction programs responsibility for coordination s rested with the coordinator of u s assistance to the nis in the department of state in fy1996 the clinton administration began to request funding for several threat reduction programs in the budgets of the agencies that managed and implemented them b fy1999 total funding for the range of threat reduction programs i n dod state and doe had nearly doubled from the 1992 level of 400 million the expanded threat reduction initiative in the wake of the financial crisis that bega n in russia in august 1998 many analysts began to believe that economic pressures could undermine russias interests and efforts in safeguarding weap ons and materials as evidence of this they cited reports that some scientific and research facilities that house nuclear materials have disconnected thei r security and monitoring systems to save money on electric bills and that they have been unable to pay the guards and officers charged with maintai ning security in addition many scientists and engineers who worked in soviet nuclear chemical and biological programs have not been paid for months at some analysts fear that these scientists might be tempted to accept work from other nations

total 37310 7424 10007 45261 source department of state the clinton administration has responded by proposing the expanded threa t reduction etr initiative according to the pre sidents budget for fy2000 funding for threat reduction programs would increase from 742 million in fy1999 to 1 billion i n fy2000 over the next five years planned spending would increase from 27 billion to 45 billion the added funds would not only augment ongoing programs to secur nuclear chemical and biological weapons and materials it would also expand programs that focus on keeping scientists and engineers away from rogue nations specifically i n fy2000 funding for dod programs and doe programs both authorized in the do d authorization and appropriated in the dod and energy and water appropriations bill s respectively would increase small amount over fy1999 levels 35 million and 2 8 million respectively while state depa rtment programs funded in the foreign operations appropriations bill would increase by nearly 200 million from fy1999 to fy2000 in the long term 11 billion of the 18 billion that the initiative adds to planned threa t reduction programs between fy2000 and fy2004 would go to dods ctr program another 500 million of the proposed additi on would go to doe programs and the state department would receive the remaining 200 million in added fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20203crs3 the next section of this report provides details on the administrations expande d threat reduction initiative the report concludes with discussio n of issues that congress might consider when it reviews the funding requests for these programs department of defense programs to date dods ctr projects fy2000 request 476 million have helped russia to transport nuclear warheads from locations in other nis states to storage areas inside russia and to improve security and weapons accounting at these storage areas ct r projects have also funded the elimination of strateg ic nuclear weapon delivery systems and facilities in russia belarus ukraine and kazakhstan the united states is also helping russia construct facility to store plutonium rem oved from russias nuclear weapons and facility that will house and destroy russias chemical weapons stockpile the etr initiat ive will add 11 billion to the dod budget from fy2000fy2004 dod plans t use much of this added funding to accelerate the elimination of strategi c offensive arms in russia if and when the russian parliament approves ratification f start ii and to construct an additional wing for the storage of plutonium remove d from nuclea r weapons at the mayak facility in russia the most significant increase however in the ctr budget proposed for fy2000 is in the area of chemical weapon s destruction in fy1999 this activity received 88 million the president has requeste d 130 million for fy2000 some members of the house have criticized this project in the past arguing that it does little to reduce the threat to the united states state department programs three fourths of the higher funding level requested i n the first year of the etr would be in state department programs these would increase from 531 million in fy1999 to 2505 million in fy2000 before dropping to 120 million in each of the fou r remaining years of the initiative state programs would expand in three areas nonproliferation of weapons expertise export controls and forces reallocation science and technology nonproliferation fy2000 request 1465 million the state department manages several programs that offer nis scientists employment an d research opportunities so that they will be less likely to sell their knowledge to rogu nations the international science and technology center istc in moscow and th science and technology center in ukraine stcu multilateral programs supported by the eu japan and others fund research i n such areas as nuclear reactor safety medicine civil aviation and energy production partners program links nis

foundation crdf is private nonprofit foundat ion originally funded by matching grants from dod and george soros i t supports us collab oration and exchanges with former nis defense scientists on civilian basic and applied research and supports projects wi th commercial applications the state department also implements pi lot project for biological weapons scientists to redirect their expertise toward commercial endeavors among other activities it has established collaborative program between the department of agricultures agricultural researchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20203crs4 service and russian scientists on agriculture research and between the department f health and human services centers for disease control national institutes of health and food and drug administratio n and russian biomedical scientists to conduct research on infectious diseases export control and border security program fy2000 request 665 million to prevent the transfer of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems th state department coordinates the activities of number of us agencies including th fbi and the us customs service these agencies provide training technical expertise and equipment including large xray trucks to strengthen georgian and central asia n border security and to improve russia and ukraine export controls forces relocation and ammo disposal fy2000 reque st 43 million under the etr the administration is proposing that the united states lead an international effort to assist with the removal of russian forces and equipment from bases outside russia s borders in particular there is concern that ammo and equ ipment in georgia and moldova are vulnerable to theft while russia needs help constructing housing for retired officers to meet its armed forces downsizing goals congr ess has prohibited such assistance since fy1996 and etr funds have been requested for this purpose instead th administration is hoping that germany or other countries will step into the breach department of energy programs materials protection control and ccounting fy2000 request 145 million the department of energys materials protection control and accounting mpca program focuses on improving security and accounting at the civilian institutes that house russias nuclear materials to date the mpca program has provided assistance at 53 facilities in the former soviet union including the installation of improved security systems that use modern technology and the development of material control and accountin g systems th program has also provided security training for russian nuclear specialists although doe originally expected to phase out mpca after 2001 the et r initiative adds approximately 500 million to mpca fundin g to maintain its current level of effort th rough that period according to rose gottemoeller the director of doe s office of nonproliferation and national security in addition to improving security t existing facilities some mpca funds may be used to help russia consolidate its nuclear materials at smaller number of facilities initiatives for proliferation prevention fy2000 request 30 million th department of energys initiatives for proliferation prevention ipp program whic h began in 1994 matches us government funds with us corporate funds in projects with nonmilitary applic ations as with the state departmentfunded programs it is designed to provid employment for nis nuclear chemical and biological weapons scientists and engineers so that they will not seek employment in other nations doe describes th program as one focused on the elite of the nis scientific blishment and geared towards projects with high science and technology content through fy1998 the ipp program had obligated 115 million to 435 projects involving more than 4 400 scientists throughout the former soviet republicshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20203crs5 in fy1999 doe requested 15 million noting that it had sufficient unexpende d funds from previous years to continue ongoing projects congress however provided 20 million for fy1999 this program has however attracted more scrutiny this year in february 1999 the general accounting office gao issued rep ort that criticized ipp implementation it noted among other things that majority of the funds allocated to ipp had been spent at us nuclear weapons labs and not sent to nis institutions in it s version of the fy2000 defense authorization bill s 1059 the senate armed services commit tee introduced number of restrictions including provision mandating that greater proportion of the funds go to russian scientists nucle ar cities initiative fy2000 request 30 million in august 1998 vic president gore and thenrussian prime minister kiriyenko signed an agreemen t establishi ng the nuclear cities initiative nci this program is designed to establis h commercial enterprises and create new jobs in russias closed nuclear cities to help ease unemployment and displacement as russia downsizes and res tructures its nuclear weapons complex and to prevent nuclear science proliferation in contrast with ipp the thi s program is designed to create range of jobs not just those that are technologybased and to employ all types of workers not just the elite scientists from the nuclear weapon s complex fy2000 funds would be used to initiate projects in 3 of the 10 closed nuclear cities doe expe cts the funding to increase under etr in future years as it expands the program to other cities in russias nuclear weapons complex issues for congress project priorities in the expa nded threat reduction initiative most members of congr ess have supported projects funded by dods ctr programs and doe s mpca programs when they address the security and elimination of weapons an d materials that can pose dir ect threat to us national security however members have been less sup portive of projects that appear to stray from this core objective some therefore may question expanded funding of individual projects supported by the et r initiative for xample much of the fy2000 increase in ctr funding is allocated to the construct ion of chemical weapons destruction facility in the past the house national securityarmed services com mittee has reduced funding for this project in part because it has viewed russias chemical weapons as more of threat to the russian environment than threat to us secur ity further some may not perceive export of scientific know how in the form of personnel as posing the same level of threat as the sale of actua l weapons system hardware especially as indications that russian scientists are currentl helping us ad versaries are hard to verify and some may not be convinced that offering alternative employment will be sufficient preventative measure for weapons scientists however administration officials point out that there is strong evidence that there is an active market for such expertise and strong anecdotal ev idence as well that were it not for us and multilateral preventative programs key weapons experts would have accepted other options that could have resulted in serious weapons proliferation does us assist ance subsidize russian weapons programs several members of congress have noted that russia continues to modernize its strategic offensive nuclear weapons nd some have questioned whether the united states might be subsidizing this modernization with threat reduction assistance few argue tha t russia is actually diverting us funds most assistance is provided inkind by us contractors but some note that russia does not have t spend its own funds to dismantle its older weapons becausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20203crs6 us funds achieve that objective so it can afford to continue with its modernizatio n programs the clinton administration argues that ongoing modernization programs particularly production of the new ss27 icbm are consistent with russias arms control obligations and are proce eding at such slow pace that it would be difficult to argue that us aid had enriched the programs furth ermore officials argue that an absence of us assistance probably would not stop russias modernization programs instead russi would contin ue to build new weapons to meet its security needs and would simply cease to implement safety security and destruction programs for its existing weapons the gao raised the issue of possible subsidy or diversion with regard to weapons scientists in its february 1999 report the r eport noted that the program had successfully employe d weapons scientists in rd projects but it stated that some of these scientists might still be working in russias wmd programs the gao also questioned whether the program was contributing to broader us nonproliferation objectives because none of the projects was yet commercial success the administration argues that any scientist who stays in russia is one less hired by rogue states or terrori sts while the etr program does not support any researchers or institutes that continue to work on illegitimate r illegal activities in cluding biological and chemical weapons it will fund continuing work in nuclear weapons faciliti as long as the work focuses on safeguarding and eliminating old rather than producing new weapons budget concerns the fy2000 request would increase state department et r programs funded by the foreign operations appro priations bill and falling under the larger 150 international affairs account by 371 to 2505 million under the curren t congressional budget resolution however overall foreign affairs spending may shrin k significantly instead of expanding as the presidents budget assumes as result etr programs could compete with many other foreign policy and assistan ce priorities further 241 million of the foreign operations etr request is in the nis account whic h traditionally supports the economic free market and political democratization objectives of the freedom support act and has only been used to very limited extent in the past in support of its nonproliferation goals roughl 5 each year versus 23 in the request within that account etr programs may also be comp eting with other program priorities potential restrictions on assistance one perennial legislative restriction would severely affect etr programs if approved every year since fy1996 congress s enacted legislation that threatens to cut foreign operations nis account assistance to the government of russia if it continues to transfer nuclear reactor technology to iran i n fy1998 half the aid allocated to the government was cut the same result is likely fo r fy1999 if state etr programs are funded under the nis account as proposed similar legislative language for f y2000 would cut the aid to russian scientists because they are employed by governmentrun institutes furthermore in r esponse to reports that chinese spies obtained nuclear secrets from doe labs members of congress have introduce d legislation that would greatly restrict entry of certain country nationals to doe nuclear weapons laboratories s 887 shelby and hr 1348 ryun referring to etrtyp programs president clinton has said that the measure would halt valuable scientifi c exchange programs with russian scientists washington post april 28 1999 ros gottem oeller stated that this legislation could shut down our mpca program carnegie endowment for international peace april 20 1999
