to be made in the senate during the 2007 session to modify the paygo rule once again the houses paygo rule was established as part of the standing rules on january 5 2007 it does not have an expiration date but the house rules must be adopted at the beginning of each congress the senates paygo rule currently prohi bits the considera tion of revenue or direct spending legislation that would cause or increase an onbudget deficit in excess of the level set forth in the most recently adopted budget resolution for any one of three applicable time periods 1 the first fiscal year covered by the budget resolution 2 the first five fiscal years covered by the budget resolution and 3 the next five fiscal years after that revenue reductions direct spending increases or combination of the two are allowed only so long as they are completely offset by revenue increases direct spe nding reductions or both in its current form however the rule does not apply to re venue reductions or direct spending increases assumed in the budget resolution and accommoda ted under paygo scorecard point of order raised under the rule may be waived by an affirmative vote of 60 senators the rule is scheduled to expire at the end of fy2008 following the establishment of th paygo rule in 1993 the senate has modified the rule several times for different reasons including establishing and extending an expiration date expanding th rules application to curtail potential evasion allowing onbudget surpluses to be used to cover re venue reductions and direct spending increases and provi ding for exemptions to the rule the houses paygo rule requires that legi slation affecting direct spending or revenues not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus over sixyear period including the current year the upcoming fi scal year and the four following fiscal years as well as an 11year period the previouslycited period and the ensuing five fiscal years unlike the senate paygo rule the house paygo rule does not provide an exemption for di rect spending or revenue changes assumed in the budget resolution neither the senates nor the house s paygo rule addresses increases or decreases in revenues or direct spending that are reflected in the calculations of the budget baseline the rules apply only to the effects of legislation that is pending therefore revenue decreases or spending increases

proposed changes in the senate s paygo rule which dates to 1993 and deals with the enforcement of revenue and direct spending legi slation and efforts to establish similar rule in the house the controversy over this matter was so great that it led to an impasse between the house and senate regarding the fy2005 budget resolution in 2005 and 2006 during house nd senate consideration of the budget resolutions for fy2006 and fy2007 respectively proposals regarding paygo rules once again raised controversy in the two ch ambers in 2007 at the beginning of the 110th congress the house

text of the houses paygo rule is provided in appendix b as formulated in the senate the p aygo rule generally has prohibited the consideration of any revenue or direct spending legislation that would cause or increase an onbudget deficit for any one of three applicable time periods 1 the first fiscal year covered by the budget resolu tion 2 the first five fiscal years covered by the budget resolution and 3 the next five fiscal years after that the budget resolution encompasses onbudget revenue s and spending only it excludes the budgetary transactions of the ffbudget social security trust funds and postal service fund revenue reduc tions direct spending incr eases or combination of the two are allowed only so long as they are completely offset by revenue increases direct spending reductions or both in its current form however the senates paygo rule does not apply to revenue reductions or direct spending increases that are assumed in the budget resoluti on and accommodated under paygo scorecard maintained by the senate budget committee any senator may raise point of order against legislation violating the rule but the rule may be waived upon the affirmative vote of threefifths of the membership 60 senators if seats are vacant neither the senates nor the hous paygo rule address increases or decreases in revenues or direct spending that are reflected in the

by the rule for many years the senates paygo rule complemented statutory paygo requirement established by the budget enforcement act of 1990 as an amendment to underlying law the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 which was first effective for fy1992 u nder the statutory p aygo requirement the net budgetary impact of revenue and direct spending legisl ation in current and future fiscal years was recorded on rolling paygo scorecard if the director of the office of management and budget determined at the end of each congressional session that revenue and direct spending

requirement was ex tended twice but effectively was terminated at the end of the 2002 session when the outyear balances on the paygo scorecard through fy2006 were set to zero6 sequester of direct spending programs ever occurred while the statutor paygo requirement was in effect this is attributable in the earlier years to effective compliance and in the later years to statutory intervention in the process using directed scorekeeping provisions and other techniques7 the paygo rules of the two chambers differ from the expired statutory paygo requirement in that they apply durin g the consideration of legislation rather than after the session has ended both mechanisms however adopted longterm approach to enforcement the paygo ru by virtue of their multiyear time frame and the statutory paygo requirement by virtue of recording futureyear costs on the rolling scorecard different formulations of the paygo rule in the senate following the establishment of the paygo rule in 1993 the senate has modified it several times the changes in the rule have occurred for several reasons including the establishment and extension of an expiration date expanding the rules application to annual appropr iations acts in an effort to curtail potential evasion allowing onbudget surpluses to be used to cover revenue reductions and direct spending increases and providing for ex emptions to the rule these different formulations which are summarized in table 1 at the end of this section have varied in their effects on the stringency of the rule the original rule section 12c of the fy1994 budget resolution hconres 64 was intended to prevent the deficit reduction expected to be achieved in subsequent reconciliation bill from being used to offset the costs of any new direct spending or reve nue legislation8 specifically it prohibited the consideration of any direct spending and revenue legislation that would increase the deficit in the fy1994 budget resolution for any fiscal year th rough fy1998 or would increase the deficit for any other fiscal year through fy2003 in this initial form the senates paygo rule had expiration datehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32835crs4 9

covered by the most recently adopted budget resolution 2 the first five fiscal years covered by the budget resolution and 3 the next five fiscal years after that9 in addition the modification provided that dir ect spending and revenue gislation would violate the rule only if it increased the deficit individually and also increased the deficit when combined with any legislation enacted since the enactment of the previous years reconciliation legislation i the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 this modification to the rule basically permitted the use of any deficit reduction provided in other legislation to be used as an offset for any subsequent deficit increasing legislation the 1994 modifica tion also added an expiration date of september 30 1998 in 1995 the senate r eaffirmed

would cause or in crease an onbudget deficit for any one of the three existing applicable time periods the modification retained the existing expiration date of september 30 2002 in 2002 the rule was

modification of internal paygo rules in the house and senate raise severa l issues including th appropriate coverage of the rule and the provision for exemptions and the period for which the rule should be in effect among others several selected issues are discussed briefly below coverage and exemptions with regard to the appropriate coverage of the paygo rule and exemptions to it atten tion has focused on whether it should apply to direct spending legislation but not re venue legislation and whether the exemption for initiatives assumed in the budget resolution should be retained those who advocate the broadest coverage of the rule point to the need to reduce the deficit which climbed to r ecord level in nominal terms 4127 billion in fy2004 but declined to 2476 bil lion in fy2006 r ecent baseline deficit projections issued by the congressional budget office show surplus of between 159 billion to 249 billion for fy2012fy2017 but the assumption that certain policy alternatives not included in the baseline ie extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and other expiring provisions i ndexation of the alternative minimum tax for inflation and increases in discretion sp ending at the growth rate of the overall economy would be pursued would change th estimates of surpluses for these years to significant persistent deficits21 in order to grapple effectively with deficit reduction challenges they argue the house and senate must ensure that their budget enforcement tools encompass the entire budget and that portion of it escapes discipline further advocates of broadened approach cite the effectiveness of the senates paygo rule as well as the statutory p aygo requirement during the early and mid 1990s before budget surpluses emerged du ring this period these two enforcement mechanisms applied to both revenue and direct spending legislation an amendment offered by senator russell feingold to the fy2006 budget resolution in march 2005 embodied this approach his amendment would have restored the senates paygo rule to its earlier form under wh ich it applied equally to revenue legislation and direct spending legislation and did not exempt legislation assumed in the budget resolution senator lincoln chafee speaking in support of the feingold amendment stated paygo is not perfect congress has found and will continue to find if it is included in this budget ways to get around it but despite its flaws it does have proven track record it tests policies of both parties in the same way pay for your priorities or find 60 senators willing to override the rule this is the wayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32835crs8 22 see the remarks of senator lincoln chafee in the congressional record daily ed mar 16 2005 pp s2803s2804 23 see the remarks of senator charles grassley in the congressional record daily ed mar continuedit should be at time when our budget is awash in red ink it only makes sense to bring discipline and accountability back to the budget process if new tax cuts or entitlement spending is so important shouldnt we be able to find way to address the costs including paygo in the budget made sense in the 1990s when the stock market was at historic highs and unemployment at historic lows and it makes sense today22 those who point to need for more narrow application of the paygo rule argue mainly that it should not apply to re venue legislation eith er by restricting its application solely to direct spending gislation or as the current senate rule provides by exempting legislation assume d in the budget resolution key element in sustaining economic growth and achie ving longerterm budgetary goals they assert is extending the various tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 that are scheduled to expire over the next several years nd possibly reducing reve nues further in other ways paygo rule applicable to revenue legislation genera lly and that does not automatically exempt taxcut legislati on assumed in the budget resolution could significantly impede this effort especially in light of the rules 60vote threshold for waiver during consideration of the fy2006 budget resolution senator charles grassley chairman of the senate fi nance committee spoke in opposition to the feingold amendment he expressed hi s view that returning to broadened application of the paygo rule would work to the disadvantage of those favoring continued tax relief compared to those favoring continued entitlement growth because most of the tax relief requires legislative action to be extended whereas most entitlement spending increases automatically under existing law further chairman grassley discounted the need to broaden the application of the rule because of the finance committee s current practice of requiring revenue neutrality except for bipartisan tax relief two kinds of tax relief bills have come out of the finance committee in the last 4 years one set of bills contai ned widely applicable tax relief those bills if you take them together and they were done under reconciliation were bipartisanthose bills enacted in 2001 and 2003 did not contain offsets the second category of bills our committee works on would cover all other bills coming as part of our committee bus iness those bills dealt with specific categories of tax relief i will give some examples charitable giving tax bill the bill to deal with xports in manufacturing bill to deal with the armed forces tax relief for our folks in iraq putting their lives on the line there are many other examples of tax relief fully offset by our committee in few rare cases such as the energy tax relief for example bills were partially offset by and large then the senate finance committee when dealing with tax policy has produced revenueneutral bills the exceptions occurred when there was bipartisan support for widely applicable tax relief23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32835crs9 23 continued 16 2005 pp s2798s2799 24 see for example the senates disc retionary spending limits for fy2006fy2008 that were included in section 404 of the fy2006 budg et resolution in the conference report to continuedduration the points of order set forth in 1974 in the congressional budget act were established on permanent basi s many of the budget enforcement mechanisms established in the ensuing decades either on statutory basis such as deficit targets discreti onary spending limits the paygo requirement and the presidents line item veto authority or as rulemaking provisions of the house and senate such as changes in the house rules pursuant to the republicans contract with america and various elastic clause pr ocedures included in annual budget resolutions were made ffective on temporary basis the trend toward adopting temporary rath er than permanent budget enforcement procedures is attributable to many differe nt factors but is explained mainly by changing budget policy and political envi ronment in which future outcomes are difficult to predict periods of economic growth may be brief or sustained but they inevitably are followed by periods of ec onomic downturn which may be shallow or deep shaped by swings in the economic pendulum changing demographic trends and other factors recent budgets have presented policymakers with drastically varying issues ranging from large deficits at times to large surpluses at other times periods of divided government are followe d by periods in which one party dominates the leadership of the federal government at times party leadership is strongly united and at other times it is marked by factional strife as consequence at any given time in recent decades it has been difficult for congressional leaders to dete rmine what budgetary challenges it will face few years hence and how much in the way of political resources it will have to marshal against them legislative compromises in this type of environment tend to favor shorter term deals budget enforcement procedur as an integral component of shorter term compromises on budget policy matters therefore often include expiration dates just as budget policies can be revisited in the future the procedural mechanisms needed to enforce them can be renegotiated at that later time the senates paygo rule has fit squarely into this patter n being revised and extended over the years through changing policy and political environment proposals to extend the senates paygo ru have assumed th need to retain an expiration date rather than to exte nd it on permanent basis as to the appropriate length of an extension rang of options is available first any modification to the rule could be made w ithout changing the current expiration date which is the end of fy2008 thus wit hout any extension the rule would remain in effect only for the upcoming fy2008 budget cycle second if the paygo rule is regarded as companion enforcement procedure to the threeyear discretionary spending limits that the senate has included in recent budget resolutions then comparable ex piration dates might be appropriate24 in thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32835crs10 24 continued accompany hconres 95 hrept 10962 apr 28 2005 on pp 2223 legislative text and pp 8083 joint expl anatory statementsession such time frame would cover fy2008fy2010 under provision in the fy2006 budget resolution section 403 many current requirements pertaining to supermajority enforcement were extended through fy2010 third as proposed in the feingold amendment to the fy2006 budget resolution the expiration date could be made consistent with the fiveyear time frame of the budget resolution itself in this session such time frame would encompass fy2008fy2012 finally much longer time frame could be incorporated into any revision of the senates paygo rule consistent with any other longerterm procedures that are finally adopted for example the fy 2006 budget resolution included in section 407 new point of order to constrain legi slation increasing direct spending over the long term from fy2016 through fy2055 other issues some of the other issues pert ain to the relationship to other budget enforcement procedures and whether the rule may lead to distortions in budget policy various budget enforcement procedures each established to deal with particular concern could unn ecessarily complicate the legislative process and the formulation of legislation if they are not well integrated consider for example some of the major budget enforcement pr ocedures that would might apply during senate considerati on of legislative proposal to increase direct spending spending increases above the ce ilings established in the current budget resolution for the current fiscal year the upcoming fiscal year and fiveyear period or long er might be subject to point of order under section 311 of the c ongressional budget act of 1974 spending increases in excess of the committee of jurisdictions spending allocations made under the current budget resolution for the same time periods might be s ubject to point of order under section 302 of the 1974 act if considered as part of reconciliation bill spending increases for years beyond the time frame of th reconciliation instructions might be subject to point of order as extraneous matter under section 313 the byrd rule of the 1974 act in the senate if not assumed in the current budget resolution spending increases not fully offset over the first fiscal year the first five fiscal years and the next five fiscal years after that might be subject to point of orde r under the current paygo rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32835crs11 in the house spending increases not fully offset over the sixyear and 11year periods beginning with the current fiscal year might be subject to point of orde r under the new paygo rule and in the senate under section 407 of the fy2006 budget resolution legislation containing net spendi ng increases that exceed 5 billion during any of four 10year peri ods beginning with fy2016 might be subject to point of order under that section each of the different procedures iden tified above serves distinct purpose judged to be necessary and valid by the house and senate the cumulative effect of the various procedures however might be to require proposal increasing direct spending to adhere to mix of defic itneutrality and fixe dlimit requirements over several different time periods involving the current fi scal year the upcoming fiscal year the first five fiscal years the next five fiscal years and four 10year periods beginning with fy2016 in view of the complexity in the interaction of the procedural requirements nd the potential complication of legislation as result modifications to the paygo rules nd other existing budget enforcement procedures and the addition of new enfo rcement procedures must be carefully evaluated in order to ensure that the complexity and complications are warranted another concern commonly expressed when budget enforcement procedures are proposed or modified is wh ether the change will promote distortions in policy in order to evade control in the case of the paygo rule some argue that excluding revenue legislation but not direct spe nding legislation from its discipline will encourage members to pursue policy initiatives and expansions through the tax side rather than the spending side of the budget many policies that can be advanced through the spending of fe deral funds may also be dvanced by granting credits deductions exemptions and the like under ta x laws for example home ownership is promoted by the federal government through various means including both spending for loan subsidies and the individual income tax deduction for home mortgage interest recent trends in the use of advance appropriations may be cited as an example by those who express this concern as stricter controls were exerted on increases in discretionary spending in annual appropriations act s the
