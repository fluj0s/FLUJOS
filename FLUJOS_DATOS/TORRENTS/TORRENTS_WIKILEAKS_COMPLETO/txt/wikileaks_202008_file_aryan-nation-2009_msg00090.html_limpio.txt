voter call list in the other she was stretched out on the carpeted floor wearing laceless skyblue converses stories from the trail on her mind it was the day before indianas primary and she had just been chased by dogs while canvassing in kokomo suburb but that was not the worst thing to occur since she postponed her sophomore year at middle tennessee state university in part to hopscotch america stumping for barack obama heres the worst in muncie factory town in the eastcentral part of indiana ross and her cohorts were soliciting support for obama at malls on street corners and in walmart parking lot and they ran into horrible response as ross put it level of antiblack sentiment that none of them had anticipated the first person i encountered was like ill never vote for black person recalled ross who is white and just turned 20 people just werent receptive story continues below advertisement for all the hope and excitement obamas candidacy is generating some of his field workers phonebank volunteers and campaign surrogates are encountering raw racism and hostility that have gone largely unnoticed and unreported this election season doors have been slammed in their faces theyve been called racially derogatory names including the white volunteers and theyve endured malicious rants and ugly stereotyping from people who cant fathom that the senator from illinois could become the first african american president the contrast between the large adoring crowds obama draws at public events and the gritty streetlevel work to win votes is stark the candidate is largely insulated from the meanspiritedness that some of his foot soldiers deal with away from the media spotlight meeting cruel reactionvictoria switzer retired social studies teacher was on phonebank duty one night during the pennsylvania primary campaign one night was all she could take it wasnt pretty she made 60 calls to prospective voters in susquehanna county her home county which is 98 percent white the responses were dispiriting one caller switzer remembers said he couldnt possibly vote for obama and concluded hang that darky from tree documentary filmmaker rory kennedy the daughter of the late robert f kennedy said she too came across lot of racism when campaigning for obama in pennsylvania one pittsburgh union organizer told her he would not vote for obama because he is black and white voter she said offered this frank reason for not backing obama white people look out for white people and black people look out for black people obama campaign officials say such incidents are isolated that the experience of most volunteers and staffers has been overwhelmingly positive the campaign released this statement in response to questions about encounters with racism after campaigning for 15 months in nearly all 50 states barack obama and our entire campaign have been nothing but impressed and encouraged by the core decency kindness and generosity of americans from all walks of life the last year has only reinforced senator obamas view that this country is not as divided as our politics suggest campaign field work can be an exercise in confronting the fears anxieties and prejudices of voters veterans of the civil rights movement know what this feels like as do those who have been involved in battles over busing immigration or abortion but through the obama campaign some young people are having their first experience joining cause and meeting cruel reaction on election day in kokomo group of black high school students were holding up obama signs along us 31 major thoroughfare as drivers cruised by number of them rolled down their windows and yelled out common racial slur for african americans according to obama campaign staffers frederick murrell black kokomo high school senior was not there but heard what happened he was more disappointed than surprised during his own canvassing for obama murrell said he had lot of doors slammed in his face but taunting teenagers on busy commercial strip in broad daylight i was very shocked at first murrell said then again i wasnt because we have lot of racism here vandalism bomb threatsthe bigotry has gone beyond words in vincennes the obama campaign office was vandalized at 2 am on the eve of the primary according to police large plateglass window was smashed an american flag stolen other windows were spraypainted with references to obamas controversial former pastor the rev jeremiah wright and other political messages hamas votes bho and we dont cling to guns or religion goddamn wright ray mccormick was notified of the incident at about 245 am farmer and conservationist mccormick had erected giant billboard on major highway on behalf of farmers for obama he also was housing the obama campaign worker manning the office when mccormick arrived at the office about two hours before he was due out of bed to plant corn he grabbed his camera and wanted to alert the media i thought this is big deal but he was told obama campaign officials didnt want to make big deal of the incident mccormick took photos anyway and distributed some video obama looks past w va primariesmay 12 having overtaken hillary clinton in what was once her formidable superdelegate lead barack obama turned his attention to defeating john mccain in the general election states nbcs andrea mitchell reports nightly newsthe pictures represent what we are breaking through and overcoming he said as mccormick who is white sees it obama is succeeding despite these incidents later there would be bomb threats to three obama campaign offices in indiana including the one in vincennes according to campaign sources obama has not spoken much about racism during this campaign he has sought to emphasize connections among americans rather than divisions he shrugged off safety concerns that led to early secret service protection and has told black senior citizens who worry that racists will do him harm dont fret earlier in the campaign 68yearold woman in carson city nev voiced concern that the country was not ready to elect an african american president will there be some folks who probably wont vote for because i am black of course obama said just like there may be somebody who wont vote for hillary because shes woman or wouldnt vote for john edwards because they dont like his accent but the question is can we get majority of the american people to give us fair hearing click for related content superdelegates put obama within reach skilled at bridging dividesobama has won 30 of 50 democratic contests so far the kind of nationwide electoral triumph black candidate has ever realized that he is on the brink of capturing the democratic nomination some say is testament to how far the country has progressed in overcoming racism and evidence of obamas skill at bridging divides obama has won five of 12 primaries in which black voters made up less than 10 percent of the electorate and caucuses in states such as idaho and wyoming that are overwhelmingly white but exit polls show he has struggled to attract white voters who didnt attend college and earn less than 50000 year today he and hillary clinton square off in west virginia state where she is favored and where the votes of workingclass whites will again be closely watched for the most part obama campaign workers say the 2008 election cycle has been exhilarating on the ground the obama campaign is being driven by youngsters many of whom are imbued with an optimism undeterred by racial intolerance weve grown up in
