resources science and industry division margaret mikyung lee american law division november 5 2008 abstract phthalates refers to group of chemical compounds that are heavily produced and widely used to make the plastics found in thousands of consumer products the most common use of phthalates is to increase the ﬂexibility of polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyvinylidene chloride pvdc polymers phthalates are released from those products over time and are dispersed to the air water soil and living things some but not all of these phthalates are known to cause reproductive damage in rodents recent interest by governmental bodies including congress in the potential adverse human health eﬀects that might be related to phthalate exposure has focused on six phthalates that are produced and used in very large quantities the six phthalates are di2ethylhexyl phthalate dehp dibutyl phthalate dbp benzyl butyl phthalate bbp diisononyl phthalate dinp diisodecyl phthalate didp and dinoctyl phthalate dnop hr 4040 the consumer product safety commission reform act as amended and approved by conferees would prohibit the sale of childrens toys and child care articles that contain more than 01 of dehp dbp or bbp similar ban would apply for dinp didp and dnop until the consumer product safety commission issues rule either establishing or eliminating the ban on permanent basishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34572g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

used to make the plastics found in thousands of consumer products ranging from medical tubing to automotive dashboards to bath toys these phthalates are not tightly held by the plastics and are released into the environment over time congress is concerned about possible human health effects from exposure to six of these chemicals di2ethylhexyl phthalate dehp di butyl phthalate dbp benzyl butyl phthalate bbp diisononyl phthalate dinp diisodecyl phthalate didp and dinoctyl phthalate dnop dehp dbp bbp and to less extent di np are known to be toxic to the reproductive systems of rodents recent rodent experiments monstrate that prenatal exposure at sufficient level to these same phthalates disrupts the normal action of hormones and can cause malformations of the reproductive organs of offspring especially males disruption of hormonal functions in humans is known to result in abnormal reproductive development many scientists believe that the phthalates toxic to rodents might be able to cause similar malformations in humans however human health effects of phthalate exposure have not been conclusively demonstrated very few studies have looked at possible effects in humans but their results appear consistent with the results of rodent experiments more research would be needed to test this hypothesis recent us rveys have found almost universal human exposure to phthalates individuals may be exposed to high enough levels of phthalates to cause reproductive abnormalities scientists at the national toxicology program have expressed serious concern about human male infants undergoing intensive medical procedures and concern about development of human males less than year old who are exposed to dehp in light of these concerns the national academy of sciences is evaluating the risk of aggregate human exposure to multiple phthalates federal agencies have taken several actions some as early as the mid 1980s to evaluate and regulate phthalates but consumer product to date has been banned outright the agency responsible for regulating toys and most other childcare products is the consumer product safety commission cpsc the consum er product safety improvement act of 2008 pl 110314 enacted august 14 2008 includes provision in tended to ensure protection of children from six phthalates by restricting their use in toys and childcare products the scientific basis for concerns about human health risks appears to be strong in the case of some phthalates such as dehp adequate with respect to others perhaps dinp and weak for the remaining chemicals for example didp and dnop the strongest evidence with respect to developmental effects has been produced since about the year 2000 the new law codifies voluntary agreements previously reached by cpsc with product manufacturers and should reduce exposure to one particular phthalate new formulations for toys and childcare products may pose greater or fewer risks than current formulations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34572g18g145g157g145g138g149g138g157g142g156g561g146g151g561g18g149g138g156g157g146g140g156g561g138g151g141 g561g18g152

not extremely toxic that is they do not cause acute illness after short period of lowlevel exposure however controlled experiments with rodents have demonstrated that some phthalates3 at high doses damage reproduction and development4 moreover if administered at sufficient levels5 and at the appropriate time to pregnant females some phthalates can cause malformations of the reproductive organs of offspring especially males6 in rats exposure during gestation to some phthalates can cause testicular cancer in mature offspring7 the higher the phthalate exposure the 1 the ph is silent 2

fetuses are most susceptible but older rats can also be affected at somewhat higher levels of exposure8 disruption of hormonal functions in humans is known to result in abnormal reproductive development many scientists believe that the phthalates toxic to rats and mice might be able to cause similar malformations in humans because the male hormones affected by phthalates are important to the normal development of the male reproductive tract in all species of mammals however human health effects of phthalate expos ure have not been conclusively demonstrated very few studies have looked at possible effects in humans9 but their results have been consistent with the results of rodent experiments study published in 2005 provided the first evidence of subtle developmental effects similar to those seen in animal studies in human male infants exposed prenatally to breakdown products of phthalates10 more research would be needed to determine with certainty the effects of phthalates in humans additional information about health effects is provided below in the section the six phthalates g10g158g150g138g151g561g7g161g153g152g156g158g155g142g561 results of the national health and

but children appear to be the group most exposed to dehp dbp and bbp children also are more exposed to dnop but these exposures appear to be lower than those for hp dinbutyl phthalate and bbp levels of breakdown product of dinp were not detectable in children surveyed but see section below on dinp and didp was not measured in 20012002 12 studies of amniotic fluid have also documented exposure to multiple phthalates for human fetuses13 more generally babies may be the most heavily exposed group14 phthalates are dispersed throughout the air water soil and living things in the developed world

exposure through the placenta personal care items including baby lotion and powder may be significant sources of exposure for infants18 for some individuals certain medications also may be important sources19 finally medical devices may dominate exposure sources for critically ill patients individuals such as newborns in intensive care may be exposed to levels of dehp much closer to but still less than 1 of levels that cause reproductive harm in rats20 phthalates do not bioaccumulate in the body or the environment rather they break down rapidly however exposure to phthalates is continuous

phthalate23 it is used primarily to improve the flexibility of vinyl that is polyvinyl chloride pvc plastic dehp is found in medical devices such as plastic tubing used for catheters and intravenous drug and fluid delivery and many home and garden products the ntp has expressed serious concern24 that certain intensive medical treatments of male infants may result in dehp exposure levels that adversely affect development of the male reproductive tract25 in addition the ntp expressed concern for effects of dehp exposure on development of the male reproductive tract for infants less than one year old some concern for effects of dehp exposure on development of the reproductive tract of male children older than one year and also some concern for developmental effects for the offspring of pregnant women26 after this dehp monograph was issued several studies began to explore associations between dehp and other heal th effects such as effects on thyroid hormone levels asthma and obesity27 additional research is being conducted in these areas and it is too soon to draw any conclusions regarding the potential role of dehp in causing such problems

of the american chemistry council trade group representing chemical manufacturers 38 the ntp monograph on dinp was published in 2003 but like the other monographs that have not been updated it primarily considers research published before 2001 the scientific evidence for developmental effects from dinp exposure of rodents is adequate to conclude that dinp might adversely affect development of the human fetus if the levels of exposure are sufficiently high according to ntp 39 but the evidence for effects was not as strong as for dehp and dbp and in one study that compared the effects of exposure to various phthalates dinp was found to be less potent than dehp or dbp by an order of magnitude40 in his recent testimony before house subcommittee dr leon earl gray rated the relative potency for producing developmental harm of various phthalates he gave dinp rating of 015 relative to dehp dbp both forms and bbp which he rated 10 41 number of studies of the potential effects on

there is some evidence of enhanced allergic responses due to dinp exposure43 review by the european commission ec in 2006 concluded in light of the divergent scientific views and the conclusions of the assessment of the risk for consumers under this regulation and taking into account the uncertainties in the evaluation of exposure to dinp from to ys and childcare articles precautionary considerations support the consideration at community level of proportionate restrictions for the use of dinp in toys and childcare articles such measures should be reviewed after 3 4 years in light of further scientific developments 44 several studies have been conducted to estimate the level of exposure of children to dinp in toys due to mouthing one study by the consumer product safety commission cpsc estimated dinp exposure through measurement of the time children spent in mouthing behavior and an analysis of dinp movement out of various toys 45 ntp used that data to conclude that its concern was minimal for developmental effects in children46 ntp also had minimal concern for dinp causing adverse effects to human reproduction or fetal development47 however this conclusion was controversial48 japanese study also looked at dinp release from toys and and time spent mouthing and found considerably higher exposures than the cpsc49 as mentioned above it appeared from the nhanes that exposure to dinp was negligible in children surveyed by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc in 2001200250 however this result was based on measurement of the metabolite monoisononyl phthalate minp the traditional measure of exposure to dinp recent study of how the human body processes dinp found that minp is minor metabolic product while monocarboxyisooctyl phthalate

negligible concern for effects on adult reproductive systems but it was unable to form an opinion on an appropriate level of concern with respect to developmental risks due to the lack of available exposure data and lack of toxicity data for exposure levels that might have relevance for human exposure58 an online search by crs of publications using medline revealed new studies after 2001 that

depending on use phthalates are potentially regulated by various regulatory agencies including the environmental protection agency epa the occupational safety and health administration osha the food and drug administration f da and the consumer product safety commission cpsc epa regulates various phthalates released to the environment under most of its statutes for example dehp is regulated as hazardous air pollutant drinking water contaminant water pollutant and hazardous waste osha regulates worker exposure to phthalates the current focus of congressional concern howev er is federal regulation of consumer products from which phthalates might be released federal agencies have taken several actions some as early as the mid 1980s to evaluate and regulate phthalates for example epa has required manufacturers of phthalates to conduct certain tests to better inform federal regulators these test orders were withdrawn in 1996 when epa determined that it had received the necessary information which focused at the time on ca rcinogenic potential to date however phthalatecontaining consumer product has been banned outright

foods directly but are regulated by fda as food contact substances or indirect food additives where they are components of packaging that may leach into foods or beverages fda permits the use of variety of phthalates for these purposes65 in recent congressional testimony fda reported that fda has recently established phthalate task group ptg to review all available use and toxicology information associated with phthalate exposure from food contact use and to better characterize any potential risk from these uses the primary focus of the ptg will be to determine the most realistic exposure estimation and risk associated with phthalate use in food packaging the ptg will review and address past studies on phthalates and any new information available if our review indicates that existing data longer supports the continued safe use of these materials in food contact material fda will take appropriate regulatory action to remove these materials from the marketplace 66 under the authority of the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca fda regulates the safety of cosmetics and personal care products such as nail polish shampoo and lotions67 many of which contain phthalates cosmetic products and ingredients are not subject to fda premarket approval but fda can prohibit the marketing of cosmetic product if it is adulterated meaning among other things that it contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to users under labeled or customary conditions of use 68 according to fda the principal phthalates used in cosmetic products are dbp dimethylphthalate dmp and diethylphthalate dep fda reports that at the present time it does not have compelling evidence that phthalates as used in cosmetics pose safety risk but that it is conducting survey of phthalate levels in certain cosmetic products to more accurately assess infant exposure69 under the authority of the fair packaging and labeling act pl 89755 fda requires that retail

regulate phthalates in consumer products including toys and other childrens products under either the federal hazardous substances act fhsa 15 usc 1261 et seq or the consumer product safety act cpsa 15 usc 2051 et seq two of the statutes that it administers and enforces consumer products as defined in the cpsa do not include food drugs medical devices and cosmetics which fall under the jurisdiction of the fda the fda has juri sdiction over food containers with regard to substances that may leach into food from the container cpsc has jurisdiction with regard to other defects such as shattering or choking hazards it also has jurisdiction over toys childrens furniture such as cribs and car seats and other childrens consumer products including pacifiers teething rings and apparel pl 110314 the consumer product safety improvement act cpsia signed by the president on august 14 2008 strengthened regulatory and enforcement authority 71 the cpsc may regulate phthalates under either the cpsa or the fhsa the cpsa and the fhsa differ with regard to the rulemaking procedures the precise nature of the acts prohibited with regard to products or substances that fail to comply with safety standards and other issues therefore there are advantages and disadvantages to promulgating standards under the cpsa versus the fhsa one disadvantage of the cpsa rulemaking procedure was eliminated by the cpsia the cpsa formerly did not expressly provide injunctive enforcement authority for state attorneys general unlike the fhsa which di d cpsia amends the cpsa to provide state attorneys general authority to enjoin violations of the federal standard additionally the recent reform legislation addressed other concerns critics alleged problems with the ability of the cpsc to establish safety standards in timely fashion for example some asserted that the rulemaking procedures under the cpsa and other acts under the cpscs jurisdiction such as the fhsa were unnecessarily onerous requiring protections beyond those required by the administrative procedure act 72 the cpsia streamlined the rulemaking procedures of the cpsa by eliminating the required extra step of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking the cpsia did not amend the cpsa provisions that encourage the cpsc to rely heavily on voluntary standards where an adequate standard exists with which the industry widely and substantially complies the voluntary nature of some safety standards limits the action that can be taken by the cpsc for violations however the cpsia legislated mandatory safety standards or rulemaking for certain childrens products including toys durable infant or toddler products and standards for lead content and phthalates in certain childrens products the cpsia revised and expanded the scope of acts prohibited under the cpsa to include manufacture sale or importation of products that are the subject of voluntary recall under both the cpsa and the fhsa the cpsc may order reca ll andor other remedies for products that violate safety standard under the pertinent act and may inspect factories where products are made products violating safety standard may be denied importation 71 for general discussion of the statutes administered and enforced by the cpsc see crs report rl34684 consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 pl 110314 by margaret mikyung lee 72 the administrative procedure act title 5 subchapter ii of the us code 551559 directs federal administrative agencies to promulgate regulations according to standard procedure which includes such

standards regarding phthalates in childrens products as discussed below the cpsc had not promulgated such standards prior to the cpsia in 1983 the cpsc determined that dehp in childrens products might result in substantial exposure of children to an animal carcinogen73 the cpsc is not permitted to initiate rulemaking relating to risks of cancer birth defects or gene mutations unless it first establishes chronic hazard advisory panel to study the issue and make recommendations the panel appointed to study the risks of dehp concluded that it could put children at risk of cancer from mouthing of products containing dehp accord ingly the cpsc worked with the childrens products industry to reach voluntary agreement banning the use of dehp from pacifiers rattles and teethers 74 although other childrens products were not included in the agreement between cpsc and the industry most manufacturers subs tituted other phthalates for dehp in other childrens products dinp was the substitute despite studies conducted by the industry in the late 1990s linking dinp to liver toxicity and cancer in rodents the cpsc concluded that the risk to children from mouthing childrens products was minimal however the cpsc achieved voluntary agreement with the industry banning dinp and dioctyl phthalate from pacifiers and bottle nipples the cpsc appointed chronic hazard advisory panel on dinp and conducted other studies in response to petition to initiate rulemaking regarding phthalates in childrens products the panel concluded in 2001 that dinp pos ed minimal or nonexistent risk of cancer to humans after further consideration of the pa nel report and other studies in 2003 the cpsc denied the petition to establish safety standard for pvc containing phthalates in childrens products intended for children five years of age and younger75

decision 1999815ec78 that banned phthalates in toys and childcare articles as renewable emergency measure in response to phthalate studies conducted by various member states and assessed by the scientific committee on toxicity ecotoxicity and the environment79 the language of the decision differs from that of the directive in that it limits the ban on the six phthalates to products that can be mouthed by children under three years of age while the directive does not contain the age limit this decision apparently was last extended in 2004 until september 20 2005 but council directive 200584ec refers to the decision as being renewed regularly regardless of whether the decision continues to be renewed eu member states were required to take necessary measures to comply with the standards described in the decision therefore those measures would continue in effect it appears that the decision may not have been renewed in anticipation of council directive 200584ec an d the regulation ec 19072006 80 which was recently enacted and will repeal council directive 76769eec effective june 1 2009 while retaining the same phthalate in childrens product standard effective june 1 2009 the new regulation also retains the directives requirement that the european commission reevaluate this standard by january 16 2010 in light of new scientific information and amend the standard accordingly if justified while the directive is binding law on the member states of the eu requiring them to take necessary measures to bring their respective national laws into compliance with the directive standards the new regulation is directly binding on the member states this means they are obligated to comply with the standard and enfor ce it without any implementing legislation or rule at the national level one group of phthalates dehp dbp and bbp is banned without limitation because they are classified as reproductive toxicants that present an unacceptable risk given the general safety requirements of the european union the othe r group dinp didp and dnop are banned only for products that can be placed in the mouth by children despite inconclusive scientific evidence of harm these phthalates were banned under the precautionary principle81 of the european union given the potential risk posed to children82 78 oj l 315 46 issued december 7 1999 this decision in turn was

recently enacted legislation establishing safety standards for phthalate content in childrens articles the permanent and interim federal phthalates safety standards of the cpsia are considered safety standards under the cpsa and as such they preempt any nonidentical standards in these statutes except as the cpsa otherwise provides for exemptions any permanent standard resulting from the consideration of the interim standard for dinp didp or dnop would also similarly preempt nonidentical state laws the cpsia clarifies that neither it nor the cpsa shall be construed as preempting any state requirements concerning phthalate alternatives that are not specifically regulated in consumer product safety standard under the cpsa under th cpsa upon application by state or locality the cpsc may by rule exempt from preempti on state or local standard that provides significantly higher degree of protection from injury than the federal standard and that does not unduly burden interstate commerce the three state phthalate standards all appear to have been at least partly modeled on current or earlier versions of the eu regulations aside from the age limit specified for the phthalate standard or for subcategories of childrens products if any the existing state statutes do not define childrens products generally in terms of an age ceiling for child or children in addition to these state standards hawaiis senate has adopted resolution requesting the hawaii department of health to monitor research being conducted regarding the risks posed by phthalates and bisphenola in consumer products and to report recommendations and proposed legislation before the 2009 legislative session 83 oregons legislature has adopted joint memorial urging congress to regulate phthalates at the federal level as substance in cosmetics personal care products and childrens toys 84 additionally several other states have introduced legislation concerning phthalates beginning january 1 2009 the california statute85 will prohibit the manufacture sale or distribution in commerce of any toy or childcare article that contains dehp dbp or bbp in concentrations exceeding 01 and of any toy or childcare article intended for use by children under three years of age that can be mouthe d that contains dinp didp or dnop in concentrations exceeding 01 the statute requires manufacturers to use the least toxic alternative when replacing phthalates in such products and also prohibits them from replacing phthalates with certain carcinogens including substances known likely to be or suggestive of being human carcinogens or reproductive toxicants identified in accordance with federal or california laws toys are defined as all products designed or intended by the manufacturer to be used by children when they play and child care article is defined as all products designed or intended by the manufacturer to facilitate sleep relaxation or the feeding of children or to help children with sucking or teething this statute appears to be partly modeled on an earlier version of the eu council directive 76769eec with regard to the threshold concentration level for the ban and the definition of childcare articles and toys it does not include the amendment made by eu directive 200584ec december 14 2005 adding hygiene to the scope of childcare articles which effectively included items such as lotion powder baby oil etc it also includes the threeyearold 83 sres 68 24th leg haw 2008 84 s jt memorial 8 74th leg or 2007 85 cal health safety code 108935108939 current on lexisnexis

the eu commission decision 1999815ec december 7 1999 it added teething to the scope of childcare articles for which the eu includes sucking but not teething the vermont statute86 appears to be modeled on the california statute but with some differences beginning july 1 2009 it will prohibit the manufacture sale or distribution in commerce of any toy or childcare article intended for use by child under three years of age that contains dehp dbp or bbp in concentrations exceeding 01 and of any toy or childcare article intended for use by child under three years of age that can be placed in the mouth and that contains dinp didp or dnop in concentrations exceeding 01 the vermont statute provides for an under threeyearsold age limit for the first group of phthalates unlike the california statute the vermont law adopts the california statutory definition of child care article and toy and additionally defines phthalate as any one of group of chemicals used as plasticizers to provide flexibility and durability to plastics such as polyvinyl chloride pvc like the california statute it requires manufacturers to use the least toxic alternative to phthalates and prohibits them from substituting carcinogens including substances known likely to be or suggestive of being human carcinogens or reproductive toxicants identified by the epa under federal law but not under state laws apparently because vermont does not have such environmental laws identifying carcinogens or reproductive toxicants the vermont law provides that violation of the phthalates law shall be deemed violation of the vermont consumer fraud act and that the provisions of that act concerning the enforcement authority of the vermont attorney general and the rights of private parties shall apply to violations of the phthalates law it further clarifies that nothing in the phthalates law regulates firearms ammunition shooting ranges or huntingfishing equipment the washington provision banning phthalates in chil drens products is part of broader statute 87 concerning chemicals in childrens products generally it covers lead and cadmium content and also provides among other things for the iden tification of chemicals of high concern to children and childrens products by the washington department of ecology for notification to the department by manufacturer that its childrens product contains chemical of high concern and for product safety education campaign to promote awareness of unsafe childrens products with regard to phthalates beginning july 1 2009 it prohibits manufacturer wholesaler or retailer from manufacturing knowingly selling offering for sale or distributing for sale or for use in the state childrens product or product component containing phthalates individually or in combination at concentration exceeding 01 by weight thousand parts per million it defines phthalates as meaning the six phthalates discussed in this report it adopts the california definition of toy but does not refer to childcare articles instead it defines childrens product which includes the california definition of childcare article expanding it to include childrens clothing and also includes toys childrens cosmetics for children under the age of 12 childrens jewelry for children under the age of 12 and car seats it also includes list of items not considered childrens products 86

2008 the house and senate conferees for hr 4040 the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 announced that an agreement on final text had been reached resolving the differences between the senate and house versions of the bill the bill was approved in both chambers before the august recess and signed into law by the president on august 14 2008 pl 110314 beginning 180 days after enactment the cpsia 108 permanently bans the three phthalates whose toxicity is not disputed and temporarily bans three other phthalates pending review by chronic hazard advisory panel chap it prohibits childrens toys or child care articles that contain more than 01 percent dehp dbp or bbp the sale of childrens toys that can be placed in the mouth or child care articles containing concentrations of more than 01 percent of dinp didp or dnop is prohibited on an interim basis until review by chap after the cpsc receives the report from the chap it would determine by rule whether to continue the interim ban the provision does not restrict phthalate alternatives it defines childrens toy as consumer product designed or intended by the manufacturer for child 12 years of age or younger for use by the child when the child plays child care article is defined as consumer product designed or intended by the manufacturer to facilitate sleep or the feeding of children age 3 and younger or to help such children with sucking or teething the statute includes guidelines for determining whether product was intended or designed for use by children of the specified ages and whether toy can be placed in childs mouth as discussed above this provision also clarified any preemptive effect these standards would have on state laws nonidentical provisions w ould be preempted unless state applied for and the cpsc granted an exemption for stronger protections under state laws and the federal law would not preempt restrictions on phthalate alte rnatives the cpsia standard differs somewhat from each of the existing state laws described above for example the federal law differs from the state laws with regard to the definition of toys childrens products or childrens articles and the age group for which these consumer products are intended it appears that the new federal phthalates safety standard preempts the recent state laws that were enacted in the absence of federal standards to the extent that they do not provide identical protection for the same risk of injury the final phthalates provision resolved differences between the senate and house treatment of phthalates ban and between proponents and opponents of permanent ban on all six phthalates named in the legislation including restrictions on certain alternatives

feinsteinboxer amendment for the two california senators who in troduced this specific amendment to the bill was modeled on the california statute with some changes but would have placed the provisions in the context of the federal hazardous substa nces act fhsa framework it adopted the california statutory definition of child care article and did not adopt its definition of toy but instead defined childrens product as toy or any other product designed or intended by the manufacturer for use by child when the child plays which effectively included the same products as the california statute the provision would have treated as banned hazardous substance under the fhsa any childrens product or childcare article which 1 contains in any part any combination of dehp dbp or bbp in concentrations exceeding 01 or 2 is intended for use by child that can be placed in childs mouth and either contains any combination of dinp didp or dnop in concentrations exceeding 01 or contains any combination of any of the six phthalates in concentrations exceeding 01 any prohibitions under fhsa 4 15 usc 1263 would have applied to such products including the introduction receipt or delivery into interstate commerce of such products failure to permit inspections of any factory warehouse or other establishment where such products are manufactured processed packed or held etc like the california statute the provision would have prohibited manufacturer from replacing phthalates with certain carcinogens including substances known likely to be or suggestive of being human carcinogens or reproductive toxicants identified by the epa however unlike the california statute the provision would not have required manufacturers to use the least toxic alternative as substitute for phthalates section 40 would have provided that neither it nor fhsa 18b1b 15 usc 1261 note concerning preemption of nonidentical state or local regulations of banned hazardous substances would preempt state or local laws applying to phthalate other than the six described in the bill applying to phthalate described in the bill that is not otherwise regulated by the bill requiring warning of risk illness or injury regarding any phthalate or prohibiting the use of alternatives to phthalates not prohibited under this bill as discussed above generally under the cpsc as amended by the cpsia nonidentical st ate or local regulations are preempted unless an exemption is granted by the cpsc upon request by the state or locality g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 there were two issues of particular concern during development of the final phthalate provisions of the cspia first what is the scientific basis for health concerns about exposure to these chemicals second would the provision reduce the risks without generating greater risks these issues are discussed briefly here based on the scientific and legal information presented above

health appears to be strong in the case of some phthalates adequate with respect to othe rs and weak for the remaining chemicals the strongest evidence with respect to developmental effects has been produced since about the year 2000 many of these studies were not available to the ntp or to cpsc when they reviewed the phthalate literature in 2000 or 2001 at that time regulators focused on carcinogenic effects rather than effects on fetal development this more recent animal evidence strongly supports

and juvenile development in rats the structureactivity relationship between the molecular structure of the phthalates and developmental damage is well understood such that scientific concern focuses now on dehp dbp and dbb89 dinp also is developmental toxicant but is only about 15 as potent as the most potent phthalates to the extent that it is still studied it is generally studied together with other more potent toxic phthalates to evaluate additivity of effects scientific evidence regarding the other phthalates mentioned in the new law is lacking limited evidence indicates that didp dinp and dnop might have effects on the immune system but these phthalates appear to be much less toxic to developing rodents data indicate that people are exposed to many phthalates especially dehp dbp dinbutyl and dbb children appear to be most heavily exposed data are insufficient to judge exposure for dinp didp and dnop individuals such as newborn babies in the intensive care units of hospitals face multiple and continuous phthalate exposures scientists are just beginning to explore the additive effects of exposure to multiple phthalates as well as to phthalates in combination with certain pesticides 90 to date studies suggest there may be additive effects of multiple phthalate exposures91 the national academy of sciences is evaluating the risk of aggregate human exposure to multiple phthalates and is expected to report before the end of 2008

the use of six phthalates in childcare items and toys the new law codifies the voluntary agreements reached by cpsc with product manufacturers to keep dehp and dinp out of nipples pacifiers and teething toys and dehp out of toys that might be mouthed and should reduce exposure to dinp the only phthalate currently used in the united states to produce toys the effect of banning use of the other phthalates is less clear because their childrelated uses are not known however because the law prohibits their use as substitutes for dinp in toys toys should be eliminated as source of exposure 89 according to dr paul foster acting toxicology branch chief of the national toxicology program personal communication july 9 2008 the structure that is known to produce toxic effects is benzene ring of 6 atoms with two linear side chains in the ortho position of between 4 and 6 carbon atoms each longer or shorter side chains are not developmentally toxic or are much less toxic 90 rider cv j furr
