advocacypolitical advertising by corporations and labor unions soft money generally sections 203 and 201 of bcra respectively prohibit labor unions and corporations and any persons us ing funds donated by corporation or labor union from using treasury funds for electi oneering communications they must use separate segregated fund also known as pa c in order to fund such ads and require disclosure to the federal election commissi on fec of disbursements for the costs of producing and broadcasting elec tioneering communications by any spender exceeding 10000 per year bcra generally defines an electioneering communication as broadcast cable or satellite advertisement that refers to clearly identified federal candidate is made within 60 da ys of general election or 30 days of primary and if for house or senate elections is targeted to the relevant electorate5 in the event that the primary definition of electioneering communication is held to be unconstitutional section 201 of bcra provi des backup definition any broadcast cable or satellite comm unication which promot or supports candidate for that office or attacks or oppos candidate for that office regardless of whether the communication expressly advo cates vote for or against candidate and which also is suggestive of plausibl meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against specific candidate in mcconnell v fec the threejudge district cour t ruled 2 to 1 that the primary definition of electioneering communication is unconstituti onal and accordingly ruled that the prohibition on labor unions and co rporations and any persons using funds donated by corporation or labor union using treasury funds for electioneering communications and the requirement for disc losure to the fec of spending for all electioneering communications is unconstitu tional under the primary definition the court upheld however the backup definition of electioneering communication deleting the last clause and which also is sugges tive of plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or agai nst specific candidate and hence generally upheld the disclosure requirements and the prohibiti on on labor unions and corporations funding electioneering communications as defined by portion of the backup definition6 as result of this ruling corporations and bor unions are generally prohibited from using treasury funds to pay for any broadcas t cable or sate llite communication at any time in the election cycle which promotes or supports or attacks or opposes candidate for that office regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates vote for or against candidatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21511crs4 7 this provision of bcra is named after its primary sponsors in the senate senator olympia

massachusetts citizens for life mcfl9 had provided an asapplied exception for non profit corporations that satisfied certain criteria10 section 204 of bcra however know n as the wellstone amendment11

internal revenue code sections 501c4 and 527e1 are not permitted to use their general treasury funds for electioneer ing communications13 as the mcconnell court noted the wellstone amendment was codi fied in separate portion of bcra in order to preserve severability14 indeed the mcconnell threejudge panel struck down the wellstone amendment in sec tion 204 as it applies to corporations that meet
