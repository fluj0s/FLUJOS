from 6 in 2000 to recessi onary 21 in 2001 the economic growth rate in south korea also is plunging from 88 in 2000 to 20 in 2001 during the 199799 asian financial crisis the united states served as an export market of last resort in 1998 countries in asia were able to begin recovery largely by exporting to the booming us market this time however the slowdown in the united states is being spread to many of the countries in asia that depend on exports to the us market particularly in in formation technology as the bust in us information technology markets has proceeded some of the first suppliers to be cut off have been those overseas taiwan in particular is dropping into recession partly because its exports to the united states of electrical machinery including integrated circuits and computers are down as othe r countries have slowed moreover their demand for imports from the united states also has turned sluggish even though overall us exports are declining only slig htly over the first eight months of 2001 us exports to taiwan dropped 23 and to south korea fell by 19 some of this is attributable to the strong us dollar but deteriorating growth abroad is major cause this is combined with declining consumer confidence and problems still unresolved from the previous fi nancial crisis still the drop in us imports because of the weak us economy is more than offs etting the decline in us exports to cause the overall us balance of trade to improve somewhat contagion in world financial crises how does financial crisis in one c ountry such as thailand in 1997 set off global responses destroy billions of dollars in wealth throw millions of people into poverty and even set off events leading to changes of governments in the current economic scene how does economic weakne ss in one country get transmitted across borders to bring down economic activity in another what are the roads of contagion for economic conditions economies always have interacted with each other but globalization has added new dimension to the international pathways among them financial markets today are international in scope and are more linked volatile leveraged and of greater sizehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30272crs5 2 bank for international settlements central bank survey of foreign exchange and derivatives market activity 1998 may 1999 p 14than at any time in history the economies of the world have become more interconnected not only through trade in goods and services but through flows of investment capital speculative financial activities and bank loans these extensive linkages have combined with rapid comm unications to make currency and stock markets more volatile and eas ily influenced by events and economic conditions in other countries financial investments also have become more leveraged with borrowed funds when markets suddenly rn these highly leveraged positions can generate enormous losses or gains the magnitude of the flows of capital among countries also has become huge and unprecedented study by the bank for international settlements indicates that the volume of foreign exchange transac tions in 43 markets has exploded to an estimated 15 trillion per day fter making corrections for double counting or about 60 times as great as world trade in goods and services2 private capital flows have grown to the extent that many c ountries longer can maintain adequate foreign exchange reserves to handle sudde n outflows or to keep such outflows from pushing down exchange rates between 1990 and 1998 the assets of mature market institutional investors more than doubled to reach 30 trillion about equal to world gross domestic product in 2000 net inflow s into the united states the worlds largest recipient of capital flows exceeded 400 billion this included record level of foreign portfolio i nvestment in us equ ities and corporate bonds these increased levels of trade and inve stment provide the pathways by which business cycles are transmitted from one econom to another the extent to which foreign economic conditions can affect particular economy however depends on how large the economy is how large the foreig n sector is relative to the rest of the economy and whether domestic monetary and fiscal policies as well as economic activity go counter to or complement that which is happening in other economies of the world each country will experience economic shocks that can be purely domestic such as the crash of the info rmation technology market in the united states other economic shocks can be globa l such as spike in oil prices or simultaneous downturn in europe and asia the larger an economy the less it is lik ely to be affected by international economic fluctuations in world ec onomy of 31 trillion the economies of the united states 98 trillion gdp the eur opean union 78 trillion and japan 34 trillion are large enough that their domestic economic conditions nd to affect other economies more than they are affected by them still they are not immune to international economic conditions and international commodity prices such as that for petroleum are transmitted to them directly for particular countries the larger its international trade flows relative to the size of its economy the greater the role tr ade is likely to have in transmitting effects of foreign business cycles in the united states and japan total trade imports and exports of goods and services accounts fo r about 20 of gdp in major european countries total trade accounts for more of gdp about 50 but much of this ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30272crs6 3 how do currency crises spread federal reserve bank of san francisco ec onomic letter august 28 1998 on the internet at httpwwwfrbsforgeconrsrchwklyltrwklyltr98el9825htmltrade within the european community ca nadas trade dependence at about 70 of gdp is quite dependent on trade particularly with the united states while smaller exportoriented countries such as singa pore in which trade may account for more than 100 of gdp are heavily depende nt on trade and quite susceptible to fluctuations in extern economic conditions over the past three currency crises the european crisis in 1992 the mexican peso crisis in 1994 and asia financial crisis in 1997 the best predictor of the path of contagion has been along trade lines currency crises have tended to be regional among those countries that trade the most with each other or trade with similar markets3 the major reason that currency crises spread along trade lines is that once country devalues its currency its ne ighbors suffer competitive disadvantage in export markets and in selling to that countryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30272crs7 causes of financial crises the case of asia how do financial crises begin in th case of the 199799 asian case the global economic turmoil can be traced to many factors most of them problems with either the financial system or activities by actors in the system first there were foreign exchange rates in asia tied to the appreciating us dollar and too inflexible to adjust to changing trade and capital flows s econd were bankers and corporations who borrowed shortterm on international mark ets to finance longterm investments some of dubious value in booming local ec onomies third were emerging markets without developed financia l infrastructure and with insufficient regulation and market discipline in which the allocation of capital and resources was influenced excessively by personal connections and politics cronyism fourth were highly confident businesses that overbuilt manufacturing capacity and office buildings in asia and began to default on bank loans fifth were real estate and stock market bubbles by which excess liquidity was pour ed into land and corporate equities creating euphoria as prices rose but so generating huge losses as prices fell some of the above problems have been corrected as part of the reforms following the asian financial crisis but some are so deeprooted in economies that they remain today the most progress has been made with exchange rate regimes countries now rely on variety of exchange rate regimes that allow for more flexibility some countries such as chin ahong kong argentina estonia and number of smaller nations still peg their exchange rate against single or composite of currencies most large economies allow their currencies to fluctuate either freely or within specific crawling bandshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30272crs8 source data

had appreciated to level higher than its precrisis level following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks most of these currencies dipped momentarily before r ecovering despite the direct attack on the united states the lowering of us interest ra tes and the prospect that the federal government could return to deficit spending the value of the dollar has been rising the japanese yen in particular has declined in value still there have been precipitous drops in exchange values except that of brazil whose rate declined and then recovered the most precarious situati on in late 2001 was in argentina it must chose between devaluing its currency fu lly dollarizing its economy adopting the dollar as its domestic currency or taking similar drastic actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30272crs9 4 frankel jeffrey and andrew k rose empirical research on nominal exchange rates in handbook of international economics vol iii edited by g grossman and k rogoff amsterdam elsevier 1995 pp 169091what is the mechanism by which wea kness in one currency drives down the values of other currencies in order to understand the pr ocess one must recognize that trade flows longer dominate foreign exchange markets in times past foreign exchange was bought primarily for use in foreign trade transactions for the international buying and sellin g of goods and services now nontrade transactions dominate foreign exchange markets capital flows completely overshadow trade flows in value and effect on exchange rates foreign currencies are bought by investors seeking higher rates of retur n by wealthholders seeking safety from political or economic instability by multinational corporations building manufacturing or distribution facilities abroad by speculators betting on movements in exchange rates and by others for variety of reasons trade flows remain important but they are only one factor in determining foreign exchange values because currencies play such variety of roles in the world financial system their value fluctuates as underlying financial conditions macroeconomic variables investor expectations and actions of central monetary authorities change like stock markets there is sure method of pred icting shortterm movements in exchange rates many economists have concluded that while underlying financial and macroeconomic conditions such as inte rest rates trade deficits and economic growth rates influence exchange rate s over the long run in the short run fluctuations are more random and unpredictable in nature4 for example in 1997 once thailand allowe d the value of its currency to fall malaysia the philippines and indonesia neighboring countries that compete in similar export markets suddenly found their exports significantly more expensive than those of thailand not did this affect their balance of trade but speculators and other buyers of foreign exchange placed fi nancial bets that those other countries would have to allow their currencies to depreciate also th is unleashed tremendous downward pressures on exchange rates in th countries in the asian financial crisis the lines of transmission led from thailand to malaysia the philippines and indonesia then later to hong kong and s outh korea after th at the problem became more global as it spread to ea stern europe russia and brazil since underlying macroeconomic conditions affect the longrun exchange rate of country speculators and investors may target certain currenc ies for devaluation if their countries exhibit macroeconomic nd financial features similar to the country that has devalued its currency for exam ple since thailands main problems in 1997 were its weak banks rising current acc ount deficit and an accumulation of short term foreign currency loans countries with similar macroec onomic and financial conditions were targeted by speculators this is one of the reasons that countries with scanty trade ties with country in crisis also can find themselves subject to currency speculation or capital flight by their own citizens seeking safe haven to store their wealth in 1997 for exampl as hong kongs currency came under attack speculators also descended upon tonias currency like hong kong estonia also has currency board in south koreas case its currency came underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30272crs10 source trendlines seoul composite tokyo nikkei 225 hong kong

stock and securities markets the process is twofold first when curre ncy depreciates it also reduces the value of any asset denominated in that currency such as stocks and bonds if investors both foreign and domestic in nati onal equity markets anticipate currency depreciation they may sell their stocks and convert the proceeds into foreign currency before the depreciation or before the currency depreci ates further sec ond when country is facing rapidly declining currency the countrys monetary authorities may raise interest rates to stem capita l flight and adopt restrictiv fiscal policies to raise savings and reassure invest ors which may slow economic growth reduce corporate profits and raise the return on bonds or money market accounts relative to stocks both higher interest rates and lower profits tend to redu ce equity values as funds are moved from troubled economy to safe r haven such as the united states or europe equity values or bond prices may well be bid up in

individual company if the outlook for its profits diminish the price of its stock relative to expected earnings will rise making its stock price expensive relative to other investments such as more secure government securities this is reflected in the priceearnings ratio per or pe for stocks per of 20 is roughly equivalent to an i nvestment that pays return of 5 since 20 investment at 5 would generate 1 return each year in the case of japans stock market bubble in the 1980s pers reached twice or three times normal levels for the nasdaq until its crash in 200001 some pers were as high as 100 or meaningless because firms were not generating any profits at all their high stock values were being justified on the basis of future profit potential much of which never appeared in assigning blame for the asian currency crisis some pointed the finger at speculators even though speculators certa inly were not to blame for the underlying economic conditions that contributed to th perceived overvaluati on of the currencies in the first place speculators often managers of large international investment funds generate gains by taki ng advantage of perceived w eaknesses in exchange rates they place financial bets on depreciation r appreciation based on their perceptions of underlying forces of demand and supply they also combine currency speculation with financial maneuvering in derivatives stocks securities and money markets for smaller emerging markets these financ ial actions may trigger currency crises and may be paralleled by similar maneuvering by other investors and businesses engaged in currency transactions the mechanics of currency speculation are complicated essentially the process involves currency buyers and llers generating profits from fluctuations in exchange rates by using spot markets markets fo r current delivery of foreign exchange forward or futures markets markets for fu ture delivery currency swaps loans and other financial maneuve rs the key to this process is that when speculators expect depreciation in local currency they begin short sales w ithout the currency in hand of forward or future contracts to deliv er that currency at future date in the hope that they will be able to buy the curre ncy at lower price before they have to deliver it they also can speculate in st ock market futures by amassing holdings of currency to dump on the market in order to elicit response from monetary authorities who often will raise interest rates in order to maintain the exchange rate the higher interest rates in turn cause equity values to fall once currency begins to show signs of weakening astute investors and speculators who profit from volatility in exchange markets take actions to minimize losses and maximize gains the ensuing flight from investments in and holdings of the local currency pushes its value down even further until it often overshoots what would be considered an equilibrium rate recovery may be slow the

september 2001international financial cr ises in coordinating support packages for its member countries experiencing bala nce of payments difficulties these packages include loans and secondary lines of credit the imf was created to promote international monetary cooperation to facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade to promote exchange stability to assist in the establishment of multilateral system of payments to make its general resources temporarily available to its members experiencing balance of payments difficulties under adequate safeguards and to shorten the duration and lessen the degree of disequilibrium in the international balances of payments of members as of june 30 2001 the imf had credit and loans outstanding to 90 countries worth about 65 billion the financial assistance provided by the imf enables countries to rebuild their international reserves stabilize their currencies and continue paying for imports without having to impose trade restricti ons or capital controls unlike development banks the imf does not lend for specific pr ojects imf loans are usually provided under an arrangement which stipulates the conditions the country must meet in order to gain access to the loan all arrangements must be approved by the executive board whose 24 directors represent the imfs 183 member countries arrangements are based on economic programs formulated by countries in consultation with the imf and are presented to the imf executive board in letter of intent with permission of the borrowing country letters of intent are posted on the imfs internet site5 loans are then released in phased installments as the program is carried out6 financial s upport packages are in itiated by request to the imf from the country experiencing financial difficulty this request then requires an assessment by imf officials of the conditions in th requesting nation if support package is approved the imf usually begins with an initial loan of hard currency to the borrowing nation subsequent amounts are made available usu ally quarterly only if certain performance targets are met and program reviews are completed during the asian financial crisis the support pack ages were designed to restore investor confidence both international and domestic in the economies of the recipient nations the packages constituted threepronged approach to the problems 1 immediate efforts to restore liquidity in currency markets 2 structural reforms aimed at strengthening fina ncial sectors and 3 governance issues underlying the crisis which included improving the efficiency of markets breaking the crony capitalism links between business and gove rnment in several of the distressed countries liberalizing capital markets nd providing for more transparency in disclosing data on external reserves and liabilities the volume of loans provided by the im f has fluctuated significantly over time the oil shock of the 1970s and the bt crisis of the 1980s were both followed by sharp increases in imf lending in the 1990s the transition process in central and eastern europe and the crises in emerging market economies led to another surge in the demand for imf resources over the years the imf has developed number of loan instruments or facilities that are tailored to address the specific circumstances of its diverse

stabilizing currencies and preventing financial crises are the standby arrangements and extended fund facility the sba is designed to address shortte rm balanceofpayments probl ems and is the most widely used facility of the imf the length of sba is typically 1218 months repayment must take place within maximum of 5 year s but countries are expected to repay within 24 years the eff was establis

brazil turkey indonesia and the ukraine to tal standby arrangements totaled the equivalent of 370 billion while extended arrangemen ts summed to 125 billion as result of the asian financial crisis the imf introduced two new facilities to cope with needs for huge amounts of f unds for relatively short terms introduced in 1997 the supplemental reserve facility is designed to meet needs for very shortterm financing on large scale countries must repay the loan after maximum of 25 years but are expected to repay one year earlier all srf loans carry surcharge of 35 percentage points also established in 1997 contingent credit lines differ from other imf facilities in that they aim to help members prevent crises they are designed for countries implementing sound economic policies which

the commission considered the future roles of seven international financial institutions the in ternational monetary fund the world bank three regional development banks the wo rld trade organization and the bank for international settlements with respect to the imf the commission made the following recommendations the imf should be restructured as smaller institution with three major purposes 1 to serve as quasi lender of st resort standby lender to prevent panics to em erging economies but its lending operations should be limited to the provision of liquidity shortterm funds at penalty inte rest rates above the borrowers recent market rates to solvent member governments when financial markets close 2 to collect and publish financial and economic data from member countries and disseminate those data in timely and uniform manner and 3 to provide dvice but not impose conditions relating to economic policy as part of regular consultations with member

development and encourage sound economic policies be the responsib ility of reconstructed world bank and regional velopment banks the commission listed four preconditions for country to quality for imf assistance 1 competitive banking system that allows greater presence for foreign financial institutions 2 the regula r publication of information regarding that nations outstanding debts and liabilities 3 commercial banks that are adequately capitalized and 4 proper fiscal policy the commission suggested that these rules be phased in over fiveyear period and th at they be suspended if necessary for global stability in the event of major crisis several members of the commission dissented from the recommendations of the report the dissent with respect to the imf centered on the constraints placed on the imf in combating financial turmo il and on who would qualify for assistance the four dissenters for example argued that the suggested preconditions for crisis loans would ignore the macroeconomic policy stance of the country in turmoil because the imf would not be authorized to negotiate policy reform in short the imf might end up supporting countries with runaway budget defic its and profligate monetary policies the prequalifying conditions also might preclude support for countries that are critical for global financial stability10 other objections by commission members were that it did not ddress worker rights or sustainable development issues and that it might undercut the fight against global poverty other studies in the aftermath of th global financial crisis have made recommendations similar to those of the advisory commission in june 1999 the finance ministers of the g7 group of seven industrial nations recommended reforms in six priority areas strengthening and reforming the international financial institutions and arrangements enhancing transparency and best practices strengthening financia l regulation in industrialized

which are to 1 promote sound monetary fiscal exch ange rate and financial sector policies 2 carefully monitor economic conditions and 3 deal with critical problems in the international financial system as soon as they are detected in order to provide greater financial stability and facilitate trade the imf should put more effort into crisis prevention including the pursuit of sound policies by countri the development of robust financial sectors and the adoption of internationally accepted standards and codes the imf needs more transparency particularly in releasing information and assessments to the private sector in order to enable markets to make informed judgemen ts and to give countries strong incentives to pursue sound policies the imf should increase its accountab ility

international monetary fund progress in strengthening the architecture of the international financial system factsheet july 31 2000the imf should not create expecta tions that reduce the incentives for countries and for individuals to take policy acti ons essential to prevent crises expectations of continued or add itional financial support in the case of poor policy d ecisions in country reduce the incentives to make good economic decisions moreover expectations that c ountries can and will use imf financial support to meet payments on debt instru ments held by the private sector reduce due diligence required to make sound financial decisions the imf should focus its work on areas in which it has expertise and responsibility rather than to use conditions on its loans to go beyond relevant macroeconomic reforms within its expertise14 the imf response and new financial architecture the imf along with the world bank and member governments have been addressing the above critic isms and problems in the international financial architecture this architecture is the institutions markets and practices that governments businesses nd individuals use when they carry out economic and financial activities the underlying goal is to build stronger more stable international financial system that will make the world less vulnerable to financial crises while allowing all countries to benefit from the pro cess of globalization to date the most progress by the imf has been in the increase in the quality and ca ndor of economic information that governments and other institutions are making available to the public the growing implementation of c odes of good practices that are essential to wellf unctioning economy and the creation of contingent credit lines ccl an imf facility that enables the fund to lend preemptively to help prevent crisis15 fundamental criticism of imf and governments during the asian financial crisis was that insufficient information was available to the public to protect their investments and to determine what actions the imf and government were taking some also asserted that the imf kept information confidential that might have warned investors of potential problems lthough release of such information itself might trigger precisely the financial cr isis the country and the imf would be attempting to avoid governments also were not gathering sufficient data on financial transactions to assess their expos ure to tightening of credit or financialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30272crs21 panic the imf now releases with member government permission public information notices and staff reports follo wing consultations under article iv with member countries letters of intent and other documents the letters of intent in particular provide tail on the actions being required as condition of loans the imf also is releasing statements of the chairman of its executive board summarizing the boards views following discussions of members use of fund resources most of these documents are available on the imf internet site the imf also claims that substantial pr ogress has been made in developing and assessing internationally accepted financial standards standard s and codes of good practices help ensure that economies func tion properly at the national level which is key prerequisite for wellfunctioning international system in consultation with others the imf has developed special da ta dissemination standard the code of good practices on fiscal transparency th code of good practices on transparency in monetary and financial policies and guidelines concerning financial sector soundness currently 47 countries subscribe to the imfs special data dissemination standard which encourages mber countries to provide detailed and reliable national economic and financial data third area of focus for the imf is in financial sector strengthening particularly the ability of banks and other financial institutions to improve internal practices including risk assessment and manage ment and upgrading supervision and regulation of the financial sector to keep pace with the modern global economy the imf and the world bank have intensif ied and enhanced their assessment of countries financial systems through join t financial sector assessment programs which serve to identify poten tial vulnerabilities in countries financial systems the basle committee on banking supervision also is addressing gaps in regulatory standards strong criticism of the financial support programs coordinated by the imf during the asian financial crisis is that those programs may have created moral hazard causing more risky behavior by reducing the adverse c onsequence of it if lenders know the imf will bail out countri unable to repay international debts for example lenders may extend loans with risks higher than those reflected in the interest rate and other terms of the loans the imf claims however that it works under the basic operating principle that its financing should not relieve debtors or creditors of their responsibility for the risks they take holders of equity incur financial losses immediately as values on stock markets decline holders of loans however may not see immediate losses becau imf loans may provide the foreign exchange for countries to serv ice foreign loans in the resolution of financial crises therefore the imf is to involve the privat sector more in the resolution of crises particularly lenders and holders of bonds this may require actions such as debt restructuring by creditors during the asian financial crisis the imf was criticized severely for imposing conditions on its loans that were viewed as too severe for the countries in turmoil many blamed imf conditions that resulted in fiscal stringency and high interest rates for causing economies to turn downward more than was necessary and throwing millions of people into poverty particul ar complaint was that the imf tended to require that central government budgets be balanced or in surplus despite the needhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30272crs22 16 köhler horst the imf in the process of change april 29 2001 on internet at

governments to ensure that its loans are used appropriately to pr omote adjustments considered to be necessary to prevent future crises the imf however also cla ims that it recognizes that countries cannot carry out major structural changes overnig ht the fund therefore asserts that henceforth it intends to focus conditionality on those measures that are critical to the macroeconomic objectives of country progra ms the imf states that will not weaken conditionality but make it more efficient effective and focused there also is broad agreement within the imf that the fund must promote good governance in borrowing countries both through initiatives such as the work on standards and codes and through specific measures to improve the decision making and administrative processes in government and the private sector in 2001 as world economies have been slipping into recession the imf is taking measures to keep the world economy on track16 it particularly is working closely with countries such as argentin to ensure that slowing world economic activity does not trigger another international financial crisis this is test to see if the new international financial architecture is able to prevent another global financial crisis17 us economic policy since the united states is the larg est economy in the world global economic conditions depend greatly on the state of the us economy as the developing recession in the united states has pulled down other economies strong recovery could do much to lift the economies in the rest of the world this can be pursued primarily through monetary and fiscal policies both dom estic and coor dinated with those of other nations and internationa l trade policy being pursued to increase global market efficiency and to ameliorate the adverse effects of foreign unfair trade practices with respect to monetary policy while congress plays an important oversight role actual policy is determined by the us federal reserve in accord with its own assessments from mid1999 thoug h most of 2000 inflation remained threat and labor markets were tight the fed raised interest rates several times to ease labor and price pressure s and to provide lternative investments to the high rising us stock market as the us economy has slowed the federal reserve has dropped interest rates aggressively it lowered for example its discount rate the interest rate it charges banks from 60 in 2000 to 575 in january 2001 and executed ten more rate cuts until th rate reached 15 in november 2001httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30272crs23 with respect to

not receive full rebate under that law as for international trade policy pressures are building in two areas the first is in the size of the us trade deficit the merchandise trade deficit reached high of 3288 billion in 1999 and increased further to record 4361 billion in 2000 the us current account deficit likewis reached 3244 billion in 1999 and record 4447 billion in 2000 while these deficits cu rrently are being matched by inflows of capital into the relatively safe us market the trade imbalance reflects growing pressures on us industries that export to the troubled economies or compete with imports while reducing the trade deficit itself is not necessarily an objective of us trade policy increasing us exports enhancing market efficiency through reducing import barriers abroad and ensuring that imports into the american market are traded fairly are us policy goals the united states can open markets abroad through trade negotiations coordinate monetary and fi scal policies to
