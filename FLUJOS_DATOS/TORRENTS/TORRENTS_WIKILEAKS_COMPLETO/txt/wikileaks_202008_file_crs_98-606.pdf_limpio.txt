beginning with george washington who of course served before there even was white house primarily these were and remain needs for advice and assistan ce undoubtedly there have always been many who are ready and more than willing to offer the president their advice however what has probably always been sired by presidents in this regard were few loyal and intelligent individuals w ho would offer counsel when asked and would keep such consultations confidential loyalty competence and ability to keep confidences were also qualities to be sought in individuals providing immediate assistance with

congress would be to make careful study of the organization of the executive branch of the government with the primary pur pose of considering the problem of administrative management fdr went on to stress that many new agencies have been created during the emergency some of which will with the recovery be dropped or greatly curtailed wh ile others in order to meet the newly realized needs of the nation will have to be fitted into the permanent organization of the executive branch22 little concern with efficien cy and economy through government reorganization was evident in the presiden ts letter instead the emphasis was upon structuring the chief executives authority for effectively executing his constitutional responsibilities the brownlow committee reported approximately ten months later among its recommendations was proposed addition of six assistants to the presidents staff and vesting re sponsibility in the president for the continuous reorganization of the executive branch23 released to congress on january 12 1937 the report soon became lost in high politics three weeks after submitting the brownlow committees report to congress fdr nnounced he wanted to enlarge the membership of the supreme court his court packing plan not only fed congressional fears of pres idential power grab but also so preoccupied congress that the brownlow committees reorganization recommendations were ignored the brownlow committees report made recommendation for an executive office of the president what was sought was modest enlargement of the number of congressionally authorized presidential assistants the president had initially been granted funds in 1857 to employ private secretary24 in 1929 congress was persuaded to add two more secretaries and an administrative assistant to the presidential payroll25 the current situation in th view of the brownlow committee called for more the president needs help his immediate staff assistance is entirely inadequate he should be given small number of executive assistants who would be his direct aides in dealing with the managerial agencies and administrative departments of the government these assistants probably

office as the ins titutional realization of administrative management and the effective coordinati on of the tremendously widespread federal machinery he called the initial version little thing compared to its later size it grew under roosevelt and it continued to expand and was further regularized by statute by appropriation acts and by more reorganization plans during the succeeding
