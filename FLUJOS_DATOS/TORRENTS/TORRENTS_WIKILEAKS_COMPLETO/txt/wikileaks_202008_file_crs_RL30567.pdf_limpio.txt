and other information for each tables have been updated as of the reports issuance date to reflect leadership changes the report will be updated as ch anges in house and senate party leadership positions occur although party divisions appeared almost from the first congress the formally structured party leadership organizations now taken for granted are relatively modern development constitutionallyspecified leaders namely the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate can be identified since the first congress other leadership posts however were not formally recognized until about the middle of the 19th century and some are 20th century creations in the earliest congresses those house members who took some role in leading their party were often designated by th president as his spokesperson in the chamber by the early 1800s an informal system developed when the speaker began naming his lieutenant to chair one of the most influential house committees eventually other members wielded significant influence via other committee posts eg the post1880 committee on rules by the end of the 19th century the formal position of floor leaders had been established in the house the senate was slower than the hous to develop formal party leadership positions and there are similar problems in identifying individual early leaders for instance records of party conferences in the 19th century senate are not available memoirs and other secondary sources reveal the identities of party conference or caucus chairs for some but not all congresses after about 1850 but these posts carried very little authority it was not uncommon for senators to publicly declare that within the senate parties there was single leader rather through the turn of the 20th century individuals who led the nate achieved their position through recognized personal attributes including persuasion and oratorical skills rather than election or appointment to fo rmal leadership posts th formal positions for senate party floor leaders eventually arose from the position of conference chair owing to the aforementioned problems in identifying informal party leaders in earlier congresses the tables in this report identify each leadership pos ition beginning with the year in which each is generally regarded to have been formally established the report excludes some lead ership posts in order to render the amount of data manageable an appendix explains the abbreviations used to denote political parties and bibliography c ites useful references especia lly in

specialist at crs th listed author has updated and expanded this report and is available to respond to inquiries on the subject 3 see the source notes and bibliography section at the end of this report for description and citation of the multiple sources used in identifying leaders in the house of representativesthis information reflects the leadership elections and appointments for the first session of the 111th congress made in party or ganizational meetings held in november 2008 at the end of the 110th congress2 included for each post are leaders names party and state ffiliations and dates and congresses of service for most congre sses the report indicates years of service only except in the tables for the house speaker and the senate president pro tempore both of which include specific date s of service when member died while holding leadership office however the da of death is included as the endof service date except in table 13 in cases where leadership change occurs during the course of congress exact dates of service are indicated where possible with respect to length of service the report includes all instances in which member held particular leadership post regardless of whether the member held the post for the entire congress or only portion of it official congressional documents house journal and senate journal congressional record and predecessor publications can be used to document the tenure of the constitutionallyspecified leaders ie speaker and president pro tempore the actions of the party organi zations in choosing other leaders such as floor leaders or caucus or conference ch airs frequently went unacknowledged in these sources however in the frequent abse nce of party caucus records in the latter half of the 19th century scholars have had to re ly on secondary sources such as memoirs and correspondence for evidence of party leadership positionholding the concluding portion of this report sour ce notes and bibliography provides more information about sources and the reliability of leadership lists identifying house leaders the changing nature of congressional l eadership provides dditional challenges to identifying leaders not constitutionally specified eg floor leader3 even for party elected posts determining who held other positions can be problematic in earlier congresses for example identifying each partys conference or caucus chair often requires reliance on incomplete historical records of conference meetings or inferences made from informal practices eg noting which member nominated his partys candidate for speaker motion that often fell to the conference chair in the house for example it was the common practice of president thomas jefferson and his immediate successors to signate member as their principal legislative spokesman often these spoke smen held other formal leadership position in the house and presidents freque ntly designated new spokesmen or even specialized spokesmen for individual measur as their terms progressed as thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30567crs3 4 woodrow wilson congressional government boston hought onmifflin 1885 p 223and other leaders were not chosen by congressional party group or by party leader such as the speaker these presiden tial designees have not been included here as party leaders most historians who study the 19th century house acknowledge that an informal positional leadership system emerged possibly as early as the war hawk congress 18111813 under speak er henry clay under this system the speaker who at the time designated the chairmen of the standing committees would name his principal lieutenant to be chairman of the ways and means committee after the appropriations committee was split from the ways and means committee in 1865 the speakers principal floor lieut enant received either of these chairs sometimes the speaker chose rival for the speakership to chair one of these committees in an effort to resolve intraparty disputes it is somewhat inaccurate however to consider these early leaders to be majority leaders in the modern sense nd they have not been included here the position of chair of the appropriations or ways and means committee inevitably made the incumbent powerful congressional figure because of the important legislation reported from these committees these chairs were not however chosen in vote by the full party organization as the majority or minority house leaders are now furthermore other leading congressiona l figures such as the republican leader thomas brackett reed achieved their positi ons of influence within the house by service on other committees such as in reeds case the post1880 rules committee identifying senate leaders the senate developed an identifiable party leadership later than the house the few existing records of party conferences in the 19th century senate are held in private collections memoirs and ot her secondary sources reveal the identities of party conference or caucus chairs for some but not all congresses after about 1850 these posts however carried very little authority it was not uncommon for senators to declare publicly that within the senate parties there was single leader4 instead through the turn of the 20th century individuals who d the senate achieved their position through recognized personal attri butes including persuasion and oratory skills rather than the current practice of election to most official leadership posts the development of senate party floor leaders was one of slow evolution like the house but they arose for the most part from the post of conference chair not until 1945 did senate republicans specify that the conference chair and floor leader posts must be held by sepa rate senators am ong senate democrats the floor leader is also chair of the conference in many secondary sources senators are identified as floor leaders before existing party conference records so identify them in this report

sec ondary sources reporting on pa rty leaders often relied upon the information compiled in early editions of the biographical directory of the united states congress as the editors of the 1989 edition of the biographical directory noted the most serious source of error and c onfusion in previous editions of the biographical directory was the designations of party affiliation many of the party labels added to the editions of 1913 and 1928 were anachronistic claiming for the two modern parties senators nd representatives elected to congress before the modern democratic or republican parties existed other entries ignored the frequent shifts in party ffiliation during the nineteenth century or omitted reference to shortlived and regional political parties and thus failed to reflect the vigor and diversity of nineteenthcentury politics5 the 1989 and 1997 ed itions of the biographical directory resolved these differences and their designations of party affiliations are principal sources for this report the 1997 edition of the biographical directory in particular included more complete notations where members changed their party affiliations while serving in congress6 the main source for early party affiliations of senator leaders principally presidentspro tempore is volume four of senator robert c byrds the senate 17891989 historical statistics 17891992 7 an appendix

full senate as the formal institutional leader and in current practice is the longest serving member of the majority party8 until 1890 the senate elected president pro tempore whenever the vice president was not in attendance whether for day or permanently as in the case of the vice presidents death or resignation when the vice president returned the president pro tempore lost his place when the vice president was again absent the senate again elected president pro tempore in many cases the same senator who had been chosen before by the standing order agreed to on march 12 1890 the senate

points of order and enforce decorum on the floor the president pro tempore has other formal powers eg appointing conferees appointing certain senate officers and serving on or appointing others to

conference chair in the 65th congress on august 24 1918 to replace senator gallinger senator lodge was not officially floor leader he was simply reelected to the conference chair post in 1919 and the

example riddick majority and minority leaders of the senate table i p 7 b riddick identifies senator gorman as the first democratic conference chair in 1893 tho ugh byrd does not designate him as such

as conference chair in the 58th congress is the first that can be confirmed from official caucus minutes died june 4 1906httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30567crs30 f secondary sources generally identify senator kern as the first democratic floor leader in the modern sense of the term see for example oleszek john worth kern p 10 others have made case for designating senator blackburn as the first since he was referred to as the democrats chosen official leader in congratulatory resolution see riddick p 3 still others consider senator martin an early floor leader see oleszek john worth kern note 13 senator underwood is the first person to be officially called floor leader in minutes of the party conference so some sources eg byrd treat him as the first democratic floor leader g elected june 9 1906 h died november 12 1919 an in itial caucus vote to replace senator martin resulted in tie between senator gilbert m hitchcock and senator underwood hitchcock briefly was acting leader
