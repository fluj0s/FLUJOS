relates to conflict 18 do some good indications for assessing assistances impacts on conflict 20 when is divider connector 23 what is do harm and why try to do harm the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 1 what is do harm beginning in the early 1990s number of international and local ngos collaborated through the local capacities for peace project also known as the do harm project dnh to learn more about how assistance that is given in conflict settings interacts with the conflicts we knew that assistance is often used and misused by people in conflicts to pursue political and military advantage we wanted to understand how this occurs in order to be able to prevent it the collaboration was based on gathering and comparing the field experience of many different ngo programmes in many different contexts through this we were able to identify very clear patterns regarding how assistance and conflict interact why try to do harm although it is clear that by itself assistance neither causes nor can end conflict it can be significant factor in conflict contexts assistance can have important effects on intergroup relations and on the course of intergroup conflict in dnh implementation project area for example one ngo provided 90 of all local employment in sizable region over number of years in another the ngo estimated that militia looting of assistance garnered us 400 million in one brief and not unique rampage both of these examples occurred in very poor countries where assistances resources represented significant wealth and power at the same time giving assistance would also have an impactoften negative the dnh has thus chosen to focus on how to provide assistance more effectively and how those of us who are involved in providing assistance in conflict areas can assume responsibility and hold ourselves accountable for the effects that our assistance has in worsening and prolonging or in reducing and shortening destructive conflict between groups whom we want to help conflicts are never simple d harm does not and cannot make things simpler rather d harm helps us get handle on the complexity of the conflict environments where we work it helps us see how decisions we make affect intergroup relationships it helps us think of different ways of doing things to have better effects the aim is to help assistance workers deal with the real complexities of providing assistance in conflicts with less frustration and more clarity and it is hoped with better outcomes for the societies where assistance is provided some fundamental lessons of the do harm project the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 2 some fundamental lessons of the do harm project it is possibleand usefulto apply d harm in conflictprone active conflict and postconflict situations and doing so prompts us to identify conflictexacerbating impacts of assistance much sooner than is typical without the analysis heightens our awareness of intergroup relations in project sites and enables us to play conscious role in helping people come together reveals the interconnections among programming decisions about where to work with whom how to set the criteria for assistance recipients who to hire locally how to relate to local authorities etc provides common reference point for considering the impacts of our assistance on conflict that brings new cohesiveness to staff interactions and to our work with local counterparts and the most important single finding enables us to identify programming options when things are going badly in fact many people involved in the project say that for some time they have been aware of the negative impacts of some of their programmes but that they thought these were inevitable and unavoidable d harm is useful precisely because it gives us tool to find better waysprogramming optionsto provide assistance the do harm framework brief description of seven steps the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 3 the do harm framework brief description of seven steps the d harm analytical framework was developed from the programming experience of many assistance workers it provides tool for mapping the interactions of assistance and conflict and can be used to plan monitor and evaluate both humanitarian and development assistance programmes the framework is not prescriptive it is descriptive tool that 1 identifies the categories of information that have been found through experience to be important for understanding how assistance affects conflict 2 organizes these categories in visual layout that highlights their actual and potential relationships and 3 helps us predict the impacts of different programming decisions step 1 understanding the context of conflict step one involves identifying which conflicts are dangerous in terms of their destructiveness or violence every society has groups with different interests and identities that contend with other groups however manyeven mostof these differences do not erupt into violence and therefore are not relevant for d harm analysis do harm is useful for understanding the impacts of assistance programmes on the sociopolitical schisms that cause or have the potential to cause destruction or violence between groups step 2 analyzing dividers and tensions once the important schisms in society have been identified the next step is to analyze what divides the groups some dividers or sources of tension between groups may be rooted in deepseated historical injustice root causes while others may be recent shortlived or manipulated by subgroup leaders proximate causes they may arise from many sources including economic relations geography demography politics or religion some may be entirely internal to society others may be promoted by outside powers understanding what divides people is critical to understanding subsequently how our assistance programmes feed into or lessen these forces step 3 analyzing connectors and local capacities for peace the third step is analysis of how people although they are divided by conflict remain also connected across subgroup lines the d harm project dnh found that in every society in conflict people who are divided by some things remain connected by others markets infrastructure common experiences historical events symbols shared attitudes formal and informal associations all of these continue to provide continuity with nonwar life and with former colleagues and coworkers now alienated through conflict similarly dnh found that all societies have individuals and institutions whose task it is to maintain intergroup peace these include justice systems when they work police forces elders groups school teachers or clergy and other respected and trusted figures in warfare these local capacities for peace are not adequate to prevent violence yet in conflictprone active conflict and postconflict situations they continue to the do harm framework brief description of seven steps the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 4 exist and offer one avenue for rebuilding nonwar relations to assess the impacts of assistance programmes on conflict it is important to identify and understand connectors and lcps step 4 analyzing the assistance programme step four of the d harm framework involves thorough review of all aspects of the assistance programme where and why is assistance offered who are the staff external and internal how were they hired who are the intended recipients of assistance by what criteria are they included what is provided who decides how is assistance delivered warehoused distributed step 5 analyzing the assistance programmes impact on dividers and connectors using the concepts of resource transfers and implicit ethical messages step five is analysis of the interactions of each aspect of the assistance programme with the existing dividers tensions and connectors lcps we ask who gains and who loses or who does not gain from our assistance do these groups overlap with the divisions we identified as potentially or actually destructive are we supporting military activities or civilian structures are we missing or ignoring opportunities to reinforce connectors are we inadvertently undermining or weakening lcps we ask what resources are we bringing into the conflict what impact are our resource transfers having we ask what messages are we giving through the way in which we work what impact are we having through our implicit ethical messages each aspect of programming should be reviewed for its actual and potential impacts on dts and clcps step 6 considering and generating programming options finally if our analysis of 1 the context of conflict 2 dividers and tensions 3 connectors and local capacities for peace and 4 our assistance programme shows that our assistance exacerbates intergroup dividers then we must think about how to provide the same programme in way that eliminates its negative conflictworsening impacts if we find that we have overlooked local peace capacities or connectors then we should redesign our programming not to miss this opportunity to support peace step 7 test programming options and redesign project once we have selected better programming option is crucially important to recheck the impacts of our new approach on the dividers and connectors outline of seven step approach to assistance programming in the context of violent conflict the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 5 outline of seven step approach to assistance programming in the context of violent conflict step 1 understanding the context of conflict identify the appropriate arenathe geographic and social space which is relevant to your assistance programme identify which intergroup conflicts have caused violence or are dangerous and may escalate into violence how does the assistance project relate to that context of conflict step 2 analyze identify and unpack dividers and sources of tension step 3 analyze identify and unpack connectors and lcps step 4 analyze identify and unpack the assistance project analyze the details of the assistance programme remember it is never an entire programme that goes wrong it is the details that determine impact step 5 analyze the assistance programmes impact on the context of conflict through resource transfers rts and implicit ethical messages iems how do the programmes rts and iems impact on dividers and sources of tension how do the programmes rts and iems impact on connectors and lcps step 6 generate programming options if an element of the assistance programme has negative impact on dividers strengthening reinforcing dividers feeding into sources of tension or if an element of the programme has negative impact on connectors weakening undermining connectors and lcps then generate as many options as possible how to do what you intend to do in such way as to weaken dividers and strengthen connectors step 7 test options and redesign programme test the options generated using your your colleagues experience what is the probable potential impact on dividers sources of tension what is the probable potential impact on connectors lcps à use the best optimal options to redesign project in programming doing steps 1 to 6 does not make sense if you dont do step 7 as welloutline of seven step approach to assistance programming in the context of violent conflict the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 6 other ways to use the framework the dnh framework is flexible tool it has been used during programme design project monitoring project evaluation and programme redesign it has also been used as tool for context analysis and for peace and conflict impact analysis pcia steps 1 to 3 analyzing conflict understanding context steps 1 to 5 evaluating project steps 1 to 5 assessing project impact steps 1 to 7 project designsystematically taking into account context of conflict steps 1 to 7 monitoring project impact the point is improve our programmes using the experience we have notes on using the framework and its elements the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 7 notes on using the framework and its elements the do harm framework tool for analyzing assistance in the context of conflict emphasizes the lessons learned by the do harm project dnh the framework embodies three distinct ideas ø identifying relationships ø unpacking context ø analyzing interactions 1 identifying relationships the relationship of humanitarian and development assistance to conflict assistance whether relief or development always becomes part of the context in which it is given humanitarian and development assistance given in context of conflict becomes part of that context situations of conflict are characterized by two realities there are those things that divide people from each other and serve as sources of tension there are also always elements which connect people assistance interventions interact with these dividers sources of tension and with these connectors or local capacities for peace lcp s components of an assistance project can exacerbate the dts assistance can lessen the cs assistance can likewise strengthen the cs and serve to lessen some of the dts the fact that elements of humanitarian and development assistance interact with the context of conflict is an important thing to consider this simple and powerful message forces us to take responsibility and to ask ourselves what can we do what are our options how can we prevent negative interactions and reinforce positive ones 2 unpacking context unpacking the context and the relationships the framework prompts us to analyze the situation in order to do that we first need to know the facts in the conflict situation what are people doing what are the things which divide people or are sources of tension between them and what are the things which connect them or potentially connect them you say something is divider how do you know how does it divide people why is it important what do you actually know about it notes on using the framework and its elements the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 8 you say something is connector how do you know how does it connect people why is it important what do you actually know about it what are people doing in order to assist you in your unpacking and to prompt you to think in depth the framework includes series of five categories these categories were developed by assistance workers for three purposes they encourage brainstorming if you consider these categories and what people are doing you will not leave out something important they help you to organize information and perhaps to identify relationships they force disaggregation if something fits in more than one category you can unpack it b unpacking the assistance program an assistance program consists of number of decisions answering questions about who will receive assistance what kind of support will be appropriate where it will be given etc just as the dts and the cs have been unpacked in order to help you understand the conflict situation you also need to unpack the assistance program in order to understand the impact of the decisions on the conflict it is never whole assistance program that is having an impact it is piece of an assistance program it is one or several of the decisions that result in negative or positive impact on the conflict the questions in the framework represent those usually asked whether implicitly or explicitly in an agencys project planning process the questions in the framework again serve the three purposes outlined above 1 encouraging brainstorming 2 organization of your information 3 forcing disaggregation these questions must be asked and reasked it is very seldom in analyzing an assistance program once that you can answer these questions usually an assistance program has enough components that these questions need to be asked and answered many times before the program is thoroughly unpacked notes on using the framework and its elements the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 9 3 analyzing interactions the analytical process the analysis of the assistance program in the context of conflict requires identifying the relationships between the individual decisions of an assistance program and the dts andor the cs what is the interaction where do they interact how do these things interact what are the mechanisms by which these things affect each other an analytical process often does not serve up easy answers in onetoone correspondence often many elements are interrelated therefore the framework helps you to identify which are the most important identify the places in the process where you need more information identify the places where you need to do more unpacking b resource transfers and implicit ethical messages assistance is transfer of resources both material and non material remember that some of the material resources are in fact immaterial eg training these are the direct mechanisms by which humanitarian and development assistance interact in situation of conflict in order to change the impact of an assistance program we must understand what is the impact how is the assistance program having that impact which decisions led to that impact c developing alternative programming options experience has shown that there are always alternative ways of doing what our assistance is mandated to do knowing the patterns or mechanisms by which the various elements of our assistance project or programme interact with the elements that constitute the context of conflict causing either negative or positive impact we can identify alternative ways of how to do what we are mandated to do avoiding negative impact developing alternative programming options involves three steps generate as many options as possible quantity generates quality the more options you generate the more good options you will have identify those options that can most likely be implemented test the options to verify that they will not at the same time have another negative impactapplying the framework the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 10 applying the framework i gathering the facts analyze the context of conflict dividers sources of tension capacities for violence connectors local capacities for peace unpack the assistance project list the details of the project ii analyzing the facts analyze assistances impact on the context of conflict through resource transfers implicit ethical messages iii programming alternatives generate options for alternative ways of implementing the project generate options à quantity generates quality test the options à verify they do not at the same time have other negative impacts choose options for redesign brief notes on resource transfers and implicit ethical messages the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 11 brief notes on resource transfers and implicit ethical messages resource transfers assistance is vehicle for providing resources to people who need them assistances most direct impacts on conflict are result of the introduction of resources food health care training shelter improved water systems etc into conflicts assistance resources represent both wealth and power in situations where these matter in intergroup struggle what resources are provided how they are distributed and to whom and who decides about these matters all affect the economy of war or peace and intergroup competition or collaboration theft very often assistance good are stolen by warriors to support the war effort either directly when food is stolen to feed fighters or indirectly as when food is stolen and sold in order to raise money to buy weapons market effects assistance affects prices wages and profits and can either reinforce the war economy enriching activities and people that warrelated or the peace economy reinforcing normal civilian production consumption and exchange distributional effects when assistance is targeted to some groups and not to others and these groups exactly or even partially overlap with the divisions represented in the conflict assistance can reinforce and exacerbate conflict assistance can also reinforce connectors by crossing and linking groups by the way it is distributed substitution effects assistance can substitute for local resources that would have been used to meet civilian needs and thus free these up to be used in support of war there is political substitution effect that is equally important this occurs when international agencies assume responsibility for civilian survival to such an extent that this allows local leaders and warriors to define their roles solely on in terms of warfare and control through violence as the assistance agencies take on support of nonwar aspects of life such leaders can increasingly abdicate responsibility for these activities legitimization effects assistance legitimizes some people and some actions and weakens or sidelines others it can support either those people and actions that pursue war or those that pursue and maintain non war peace brief notes on resource transfers and implicit ethical messages the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 12 implicit ethical messages assistance also affects conflict environments through implicit ethical messages these are the impacts that assistance workers feel their own actions and attitudes have on conflict they include the ways that assistance workers operate to reinforce the modes and moods of warfare or alternatively to establish nonconflictual relations mutual respect and intergroup collaboration arms and power when international agencies hire armed guards to protect their goods from theft or their workers from harm the implicit ethical message perceived by those in the context is that it is legitimate for arms to determine who gets access to food and medical supplies and that security and safety drive from weapons disrespect mistrust competition among assistance agencies when agencies refuse to cooperate with each other and even worse bad mouth each other the message received by those in the area is that it is unnecessary to cooperate with anyone with whom one does not agree further you dont have to respect or work with people you dont like assistance workers and impunity when assistance workers use the goods and support systems for their own pleasures and purposes the message is that if one has control over resources it is permissible to use them for personal benefit without being accountable to anyone else different value for different lives when agencies adopt differential policies for two groups of people eg expatriate and local staff or act in ways to suggest that some lives and even some goods are more valuable than other lives they present message similar to that in warfare powerlessness when fieldbased staff disclaim responsibility for the impacts of their assistance programmes the message received is that individuals in complex circumstances cannot have much power and thus they do not have to take responsibility belligerence tension suspicion when assistance workers are nervous and worried for their own safety they can approach situations with suspicions and belligerence and their interactions with people can reinforce the modes of warfare and heighten tension the message received is that power is indeed the broker of human interactions and it is normal to approach everyone with suspicion and belligerence publicity when international agencies use publicity pictures that emphasize the gruesomeness of warfare and the victimization of parties they can also reinforce the demonization of one side the message is that there are victims and criminals in warfare while in most wars individuals act both criminally and kindly and both sides perpetrate atrocities and suffer victimization reinforcing the sense that there are good and bad sides in war can reinforce the motivations of people to push for victory and excuse their own behavior using the framework worksheet for analyzing the impacts of an assistance programme on conflict the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 13 using the framework examination of the context using the categories of dividers and connectors think hard about the current situation it is preferable to have team which regularly discusses these issues regions where there are conflicts are dynamic it is important to update your understanding of the context regularly among the elements to consider are historical issues and how they play out in the present b external influences and how they affect the local context and c which issues are broad in their impact affecting large number of people and which are narrow affecting smaller number of people yet still important we have found that the issues that are most important to people in their relationships with each other do not stay constant historical issues can continue to be factors into the present but how they manifest themselves and how important they are changes over time we want to understand what issues are currently most important where our project is if these issues are of recent origin or historical and to explore the dynamic of shifting importance whether particular issue is significant and what circumstances have brought it to the forefront or contributed to its recession can assist us in determining the impact the programme may have b we have found that external influences often play role in postconflict communities people have many and varied contacts with other people throughout the region as well as having perspective on the larger international situation these contacts and perspectives can alter the local perception of local circumstances people act and react to local situations in ways that are shaped by and continue to shape the larger regional situation external factors may or may not be as important to the situation as local factors but they are among the elements to be considered c we have found that there are issues that are important to broad segments of community while there are others that have much narrower impacts two questions will guide discussion of dividers and connectors 1 what are the current threats to peace and stability here 2 what are the current supports of peace and stability here using the framework analyzing the impacts of an assistance programme on conflict or the details matter the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 14 using the framework analyzing the impacts of an assistance programme on conflict or the details matter any assistance programme whether humanitarian intervention or development project an advocacy campaign or peacebuilding effort embodies series of decisions answering fundamental set of questions why have we chosen this activity with these resources in this place with these people how did we select these beneficiaries these resources and these staff who made these decisions and how every organization has programme planning process that outlines how such decisions are to be made however these processes often leave the reasons behind the choices unspoken or implicit because each of these choices potentially has an impact on the conflict it is necessary to make these decisions explicit and transparent it is important to remember that it is never whole project that is having negative impact project may itself be doing the good it set out to do while at the same time some piece of the decisionmaking is feeding into and exacerbating the conflict in these cases the programme does not need to be stopped it needs to be adapted the do harm framework captures the decision making process through seven basic questions it is not enough when analyzing programme to ask these questions once it is necessary to ask them again and again until the whole structure of the programme has been made explicit and clear the basic questions are why what are the needs that lead us to plan programme in the first place what do we hope to stop or change through our intervention why us what is the value added that our organization brings to addressing this need in this place where why did we choose this location what criteria did we use why these villages and not those why this province and not that one why on this side of the front lines and not that one or both who did we leave out and why what are the other locations we have chosen that have an impact why did we rent these buildings from who why do we drive this route why do we buy these resources here using the framework analyzing the impacts of an assistance programme on conflict or the details matter the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 15 when why have we chosen this time to bring in our intervention what is it about the current situation that makes now the right time for our intervention is the situation postconflict preconflict or is the conflict still hot why us now how long is our project going to last how will we know when our project is finished what criteria what will have changed and how will we know do we have an exit strategy what the specific content of the resources can have an impact on the content are we bringing in food shelter money training experts vehicles radios tools etc be specific what kind of food what kind of shelter what types of resources are appropriate to this circumstance with whom how did we choose the beneficiaries what was the criteria for choosing some people over others who did we leave out and why who else benefits from our presence landlords drivers stevedores farmers hotels by whom who are our staff are they local or expatriate how were they selected what were the criteria for hiring these people and are these criteria different in different places who do the criteria leave out and why how what is the mechanism of the delivery of the assistance foodforwork or cash is training through lectures by outsiders or through participatory methods how exactly do we do our work how exactly do we act do expatriates drive to work in the morning while our local staff walk or take public transport human rights and the do harm framework the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 16 human rights and the do harm framework in conflict and postconflict situations assistance workers whether humanitarian or development need to take several things into account among these are the impacts of their programmes on the context with regard to the conflict and the issues surrounding the conflict also among these and especially important in conflict situations is how their programmes address the human rights concerns of the people in the situation international humanitarian law clearly lays out the responsibilities of those in authority to their constituencies while also dealing with the rights that people should expect to be able to exercise international assistance must work within this framework supporting both the efforts of the authority to meet its responsibilities and of people to exercise their rights human rights and the implications of assistance programming on the human rights situation cannot be ignored the do harm framework was developed to analyze and review the impacts of assistance on the conflict it was not developed to explicitly deal with human rights and as such it is not the human rights tool there are other better tools for addressing the totality of the legalities regarding human rights nonetheless human rights are included in the dnh framework human rights clearly and regularly arise in the context analysis section dividers and connectors on the positive side human rights appear as shared values and experiences that connect people they appear in the cultural and governmental systems and institutions that promote nonviolent attitudes and actions and nonviolent ways of resolving disputes they appear in certain occasions and in symbols that people use to promote connectedness on the negative side those elements of society in conflict that are actively engaged in attacking human rights are dividers whether discriminatory legal or education system particular warlord or militia or direct attacks on officials responsible for human rights for example the merit of the dnh framework as it addresses human rights is that it looks at human rights in an immediate and operational fashion what do people do to demonstrate their support for human rights how do they promote rights what do people do to denigrate and undermine human rights how do they attack them where and when do they attack them in the dnh framework human rights is not concept to be considered in the abstract the actual impacts of conflict on people and on their human rights are taken into account in order to develop good and effective programmes cda will continue to work on the implications of human rights within the context of the dnh framework one particular finding of our recent efforts to think more explicitly about human rights in the context of the dnh framework intrigues us the dnh framework encourages us to think more human rights and the do harm framework the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 17 systematically about potential responses to human rights violations what are the options for dealing with violations dnh does not prejudge nor does it prescribe single response but instead it deals with actual situations and examines options for accountability on the basis of existing and identified connectors we have been struck by the range of options that people and nations use to address violations of human rights that occur in their conflicts people are simultaneously extremely creative and forgiving they know what systems of forgiveness and punishment will and will not work in their communities and they almost always work to promote activities to heal their societies this strikes us as profoundly hopeful and also as outsiders to these societies and the direct effects of their conflicts extremely humbling gender analysis as it relates to conflict note for programmers of humanitarian and development assistance the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 18 gender analysis as it relates to conflict note for programmers of humanitarian and development assistance assumptions some of which are questionable many people believe that women are less prone to violence than men this belief is based both on the sex roles and the gender roles of women sex roles historically in some societies because the male sex does not give birth or nurse children men did the things that required mobility such as hunting gathering and fighting correspondingly women because they give birth and nurse babies did the things associated with locational stability furthermore in many societies the roles of birthing and nursing are connected to longerterm nurturing and child rearing gender roles in addition societies very often assign gendered role to women and girls by teaching and expectingthem to be the family or intergroup peacemakers many people assume that these sex and gender roles whereby women take care of and nurture children and families predispose women to reject violence and to seek peace experience shows 1 that women are underrepresented in peacemaking as they are also under represented in the military business institutions wealth etc 2 that women can be as fiercely committed to war and warfare as men and that men can be as committed to peacemaking as women in the same context women who are very similar in all other respects can be heard to say either they killed my child i will not rest until we have killed every one of their children or they killed my child i will find the mothers on the other side and join then to stop this killing 3 that neither sex nor gender roles are predictor of peaceableness 4 that gender analysis is useful for identifying ways to provide assistance that can lessen conflict andor rebuild intergroup connections 5 that women in many conflict areas report that because they are seen as politically marginal they have special opportunities to speak out against war and to undertake gender analysis as it relates to conflict note for programmers of humanitarian and development assistance the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 19 political antiwar initiatives because they are not taken as seriously they can go farther in this direction than men who are supposed to be fighters however ifwhen women become effective in mobilizing antiwar sentiment they are as endangered as men who oppose conflict recent assassinations of women attest to this fact 6 that the easy designation of women as peacemakers allows men to abdicate their responsibility for this work how this connects to gender analysis how can we understand how aid programmes interact with conflict and what importance gender andor sex roles have in these interactions the dnh project identification of dividers and connectors provides one important analytical tool for integrating gender analysis and conflict analysis aid workers should determine how gender roles affect dividers and connectors take the example of womens groups are they dividers or connectors in some instances women join together to reach across group boundaries around common concern or enterprise egs hostel initiated by tutsi and hutu widows in rwanda postwar tajikistan promotion of carpet weaving and wool production in two formerly warring villages in which women undertook these linked and interdependent enterprises in these cases these womens groups and the activities in which they engage represent connectors alternatively women may organize among their own group to pursue their interests egs credit groups centered in neighborhoods representing only one side of conflict rebuilding focused on those who suffered the most who it happens because of the conduct of the war represent one side very often in these cases womens groups represent dividers similarly programs focused on young males whose gender roles mean that they are likely to be former soldiers or easy draftees can mitigate divisions and tensions identification of roles of men can help aid workers target where programmes should focus on their roles in order to reduce divisionsstrengthen connectors applying gender analysis in context can help aid workers identify special opportunities to avoid worsening dividers and to support and strengthen connectors it can also help us avoid making the dreadful mistake of reinforcing divisions and undermining connectionsindications for assessing assistances impacts on conflict the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 20 indications for assessing assistances impacts on conflict we need to identify clear and consistent ways to understand the impacts of assistance on conflict the do harm project first thought of developing list of indicators of impacts however we quickly changed our approach to adopt instead the terminology of indications of impact there were two reasons for this first because indicators is term commonly used to refer to scientific precision we knew that in the context of assistance in conflict we did not want to mislead our colleagues into believing inor even seekingsuch proof of the single identifiable source of causation second we found that while it is extremely challenging to imagine how to trace cause and effect of assistance and conflict in theoretical framework when we are actually in given field location the ways that assistance and conflict interact can be fairly clearly observed it was the latter reality that we want to highlight and observe it is important to remember and recognize both the limits and the power of our roles in conflict settings there are three types of events in conflict setting to consider when thinking about the impact of assistance some things happen in conflict settings that bear relation to assistance and on which assistance has effect even if we applied all the lessons of past experience and carried out perfect programmes wars for example would still happen b there are also things that happen in conflict settings to which assistance is connected and on which it has an effect these events would happen whether assistance existed or not but because assistance is in the context where they occur it has an impact on them c finally there are events that assistance itself causes to happen as we increase our awareness of the impacts that assistance can have on conflict it is critical that we remember to focus on the second and particularly on the third type of event where assistance has its greatest impact through careful attention to the mechanisms whereby assistance has an impact on conflict through resource transfers and implicit ethical messages we are able to identify the following indications of whether assistance is having negative worsening impact on conflict the following questions highlight indications of negative impacts yes answer indicates negative impact are assistance goods stolen especially by those connected directly to warring side what are the market impacts of assistance in the given area specifically are prices of goods connected to the war economy rising are incentives for engaging in the war economy rising are prices of goods connected to the peacetime economy falling are incentives for engaging in peacetime economic activities falling indications for assessing assistances impacts on conflict the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 21 is assistance provided in ways that benefit one some subgroups over others does the assistance agency employ people more from one group than others do material goods go more to one group than others is assistance providing sufficiently significant amount of material to meet civilian needs that more local goods are freed up to be used in warfareby armies local leaders take little or responsibility for civilian welfare what are the manifestations of this is assistance being given in ways that legitimize warrelated individuals giving them more power prestige or access to international attention or wealth is assistance being given in ways that legitimize the actions of war for eg reinforcing patterns of population movements that warriors are causing linking to divisions in the society thus reinforcing them is assistance being given in ways that legitimize war supporting attitudes for eg rewarding those who are most violent being given separately to all groups in assumption that they cannot work together does the assistance agency rely on arms to protect its goods andor workers does the assistance agency refuse to cooperate or share information and planning functions with other assistance agencies local government or local ngos does it openly criticize the ways that others provide assistance and encourage local people to avoid working with other agencies do field staff separate themselves from the local people with whom they are working and do they frequently use assistance goods or the power they derive from them for their personal benefit or pleasure does the assistance agency apportion its institutional benefits salaries or per diem scales equipment such as cars phones offices expectations of time commitments to the job rewards for work done vacation r r evacuation plans in ways that favor one identifiable group of workers more than others do the assistance staff express discouragement and powerlessness in relation to their staff superiors home offices or donors do they express disrespect for these people but often cite them as the reason why something is impossible are assistance staff frightened and tense do they express hatred mistrust or suspicion for local people any of the local people do they frequently engage their local staff counterparts in conversation about violence war experiences the terrible things they have experienced thus reinforcing the sense that these are the things that matter does the agency promote or in other ways exceptionally reward staff members who have served in more violent placessituations does the assistance agencys publicity andor fundraising approach demonize one side of the war does it treat one group as always victimized by the other in addition to deciding if an assistance agencys programme deserves yes answer to the above questions people involved in these projects must also assess the degree to which any of these actions attitudes or situations actually matters in the given context the question to ask in this regard is does this impact directly relate to events that are effected by or caused by assistance note if the answers to these questions are consistently and furthermore rather than doing the things described in the questions the agency and its staff are actively pursuing alternative approaches it is important also to assess the significance of this in relation to the conflict is the alternative approach recognized and commented upon by community leaders or large numbers of indications for assessing assistances impacts on conflict the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 22 local people with appreciation are incidences of violence between groups or of lawlessness among warriors dropping can any of this be attributed to change in climate to which the assistance agencys approaches have contributed again following what lcpp has learned about connectors and local capacities for peace the following represent the questions that reflect the indications of positive impacts ie lessening tensions andor supporting local capacities for peace has the assistance agency actively sought to identify things in the conflict area that cross the boundaries and connect people on different sides has it designed its programme to relate to these connectors is the assistance delivered in ways that reinforce local sense of inclusiveness and intergroup fairness are programmes designed to bring people together are they designed so that for any group to gain all groups must gain is the assistance delivered in ways that reinforce rather than undermining attitudes of acceptance understanding and empathy between groups is the assistance delivered in ways that provide opportunities for people to act and speak in nonwar ways does the agency provide opportunities for its local staff to cross lines and work with people from the other side does the assistance respect and reinforce local leaders as they take on responsibility for civilian governance does it provide rewards for individuals groups and communities that take intergroup or peacereinforcing initiatives do assistance agency staff reinforce the attitudes of their friends and counterparts as they remember or reassert sympathy and respect for other groups again in addition to answering these questions with yes those involved in the implementation pilot projects must try to assess the significance of these actions in relation to the conflict or its mitigation the local capacities for peace project as whole will be engaged in refining ways to make this assessment in different settings and circumstances when is divider connector the do harm framework for analyzing the impact of assistance on conflict 23 when is divider connector 1 an international ngo has been intervening for some time in the area of the river where there have been ongoing conflicts or tribal clashes between several different groups with rough division between agriculturalist and pastoralist lifestyles the pastoralist peoples herd cattle and other livestock and range widely through the area without great regard for the settlement of land the agriculturalist peoples raise cereals and vegetables and some have also taken to rearing livestock in small way the agricultural communities live in monoethnic clusters close to the river while the pastoralists live further in the hinterland the normal migration pattern for the pastoral population means moving towards the river during dry season and back to the hinterland during the rainy season 2 in keeping with the pastoralist mentality which does not readily accept ownership of land land is seen as common property for grazing the pastoralists often allow their cattle to graze on the crops of the agriculturalists this clearly has been flashpoint in addition various types of raiding are prevalent interpastoralist raids for cattle pastoralist against agriculturalist and particularly pastoralist against members of the agriculturalist community who have recently taken to rearing cattle against type the area is droughtprone and clashes between the two groups become more severe when water is scarce curiously however in the workshop the river was identified as both divider and connector in this context how 3 the answer becomes clear with analysis it turns out that in times of plenty but even on occasion when things are difficult casual encounters on the banks of the river between members of different communities seeking water for their different needs have been significant factor for cohesion in the area for long time such encounters give people the chance to exchange pleasantries indulge in gossip or even petty trade even during drought there is usually enough water in the river for everyone so resource scarcity is not significant flashpoint in this instance 4 however access to water can be significant source of tension much of the river bank areas consist of small agricultural plots used by the various farming communities access to the river for livestock to drink therefore often involves pastoralists and their herds traversing land which the agriculturalists consider theirs and to which they may at times even hold legal title moreover as might be expected the cattle trample and graze on the crops as they pass further enflaming resentments by the farmers 5 this example demonstrates two connected points first that whereas it may seem that the river represents both connector and divider careful further analysis reveals that different aspects of the same larger phenomenon are individually connector meetings by the river and divider access to the river second by using such analysis to carefully distinguish between the two aspects of the riverone positive and one negativewe open up the possibility that assistance agencies could more carefully orient their actions to reinforce the connector and diminish the source of division programme options discussed included the idea that the agency might develop cattle troughs or water points near pastoral communities in the hinterland at distance from the agricultural plots thus reducing livestock migrating to the river for water and correspondingly reducing conflict but though this would lessen the tension side of the river issue avoiding cattle trampling and grazing crops it would weaken the connector side casual encounters at the rivers edge would lessen better option from do harm perspective therefore was the suggestion to negotiate specific and agreed access corridors to the river that would be acceptable to both sides
