comparison of selected provisions with previous law passing the 1996 farm bill pressure grew quickly for congress to pass farm legislation after president clinton vetoed the omnibus reconciliation proposal hr 2491 on december 6 1995 it included an agricultural title and conservation provisions with many provisions of the 1990 farm law expiring or about to expire farmers wanted to know their federal commodity program options as they started to make 1996 planting decisions farm program supporters feared the potential negative budgetary and political consequences of farm programs reverting to permanent legislation if commodity prices should drop causing federal commodity program costs to grow the senate and house each passed omnibus farm legislation in february and the conference committee completed its work quickly both chambers approved the conference committee report on march 27 the conference committee deleted four conservation proposals that had been included in the senate bill but not in the house bill these proposals would have made water bank program contracts part of the conserv ation reserve program established pilot projects to restore closed drainage

provisions supported by environmental interests and others supported by agricultural interests as in the conservation title enacted in the 1990 farm law congress was able to incorporate some but not all the goals of the major interests from environmental to commodity organizations during the debate especially early on it appeared that agricultural interests would prevail but when congress completed its deliberations the conservation title addressed broad array of issues the conservation title probably included more initiatives than any of these interests anticipated when the debate started these provisions more fully integrate resource conservation and environmental concerns with agricultural policies continuing trend that started with the 1985 farm law and continued with the 1990 farm law provisions in this title change the resource conservation effort in significant ways that go beyond individual programs total funding for conservation is estimated to grow by about 300
