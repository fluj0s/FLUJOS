and social impact of escalating pay for corporate execu tives has led to controversy regarding the practices of paying these executives in stated attempt to provide investors with clearer and more complete picture of compensation to principal executive officers principal financial officers and the other highest paid executive officers and directors1 the securities and exchange commission sec or commission has re cently issued rules concerning the disclosure of executive compensation the rules however have created controversy of their own on july 26 2006 the sec voted to adopt revisions to its rules concerning disclosure of executive compensation2 these compensation disclosure rules were particularly focused upon companies providing investors with details about executives stockoption grants and corporate stockoption programs the rules required companies to prepare principlesbased compensation discussion and analysis section in their proxy statements annual reports and registration statements 3 in these july 26 rules the commission required companies to make tabular and narrative disclosure about all aspects of stock option grants and provide additional guidance about the disclosure of company stockoption practices4 the tables would have to contain such information as the grant date fair value the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards rule 123 fas 123r grant date the closing market price on the grant date if the closing market price is greater than the exercise price of the award and the date on which the board

accounting standards 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment fas 123r the amendment was made in the form of interim final rules that would become effective upon publication in the federal register 5 the commission went on to state that fas 123r requires recognition of the costs of equity awards over the period in which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award using this same approach in the executive compensation disclosure will give investors better idea of the compensation earned by an executive or director during particular reporting period consistent with the principles underlying the financial disclosure statement 6 the sec briefly summarized some of the importa nt provisions of the amendment as follows the dollar values required to be reported in the stock awards and option awards columns of the summary compensation table and the director compensation table are revised to disclose the compensation cost of those awards before reflecting forfeitures over the requisite service period as described in fas 123r forfeitures are required to be described in accompanying footnotes 1 71 fed reg 78338 78339 december 29 2006 2 71 fed reg 53158 september 8

of the grant date fair value of each individual equity award computed in accordance with fas 123r and the director compensation table required under item 402 of regulation sk is revised to require footnote disclosure of the same information the grants of planbased awards table is revi sed to require disclosure of any option or stock appreciation right that was repriced or otherwise materially modified during the last completed fiscal year including the incremental fair value computed as of the repricing or modification date in accordance with fas 123r and the director compensation table required under item 402 of regulation sk is revised to require footnote disclosure of the same incremental fair value information 7 these december 22 amendments have resulted in criticism by some investor groups investor groups criticism has focused on what they believe to be the obfuscation of executive pay packages an example given is the following say the chief executive of american widget gets 24 million option grant on december 1 of this year with the options vestingmeaning they may be exercisedover four years he is not eligible for retirement perhaps because he joined the company only few years ago or perhaps because he has not reached th companys minimum retirement age of 60 in the summary table the value of that option will be shown as 500000 that is because he has worked just one month of the 48 months needed for the optio n to become fully exercisable over at national widget americans main competitor the chief executive gets an inferior options package on the same day it is worth 5 million with the same fouryear schedule but that executive is eligible to retire although he has intention of doing so the compensation summary will show he got 5 million option the reality is that one man received options worth nearly five times what the other one was awarded the appearance is very different 8 on the other hand some business groups claimed that the executive compensation disclosure requirements as originally proposed by the sec needed to be revised because they did not provide completely accurate picture of actual annual executive compensation9 congressional proposals concerning executive compensation may be classified into two broad categories additional disclosure of executive compensation to shareholders and limiting for tax purposes the amounts deferred under nonqualified deferred compensation plan an example of additional disclosure is hr 4291 109th congress this bill would have amended section 16 of the securities exchange act of 193410 to require that each reporting issuer must include in the annual report and in any proxy solicitation comprehensive statement of the issuers compensation plan for the principal executive
