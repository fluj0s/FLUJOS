china for influence in asia objectives that seem to support us interests however japans fta program to date has not been robust enough to have much impact constrai ned by domestic pressures to continue protection of its agricultural sector the fta agreements japan now has implemented with singapore and mexico and is scheduled to implement next year with the philippines malaysia and thailand are unlikely to have significant impact on japans economy agr eements with larger countries where the commercial stakes are greater such as south korea australia and china are either stalled or being shied away from agriculture is japans biggest constr aint on moving forward on ftas while some progress is being ma in cutting tariffs on food items that serve small markets highly protected rice and beef markets are not being offered for liberalization moreover in the absence of substantial farm reform program that would make liberalization of these products easier many japanese decisionmakers hope protectionist pressures will go away over time with an aging farmer population that is shrinking and increasingly parttime japans fta program assuming the cu rrent cautious and defensive course

jeffrey j free trade agreements boon or bane of the world trading system in bergsten c fred the united states and the world economy institute for international economics 2005 japans free trade agreement program introduction japans trade policy has historically centered on multilateral negotiations and dispute resolution mechanisms the rules of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and the world trade orga nization wto have provided tokyo an ability to interact with its trade partners on an equal basis given its global trade interests contentious bilateral past with the united states and historic legacy with asian countries particularly korea and china reliance on the multilateral system has helped promote japans trade interests1 over the past five years japan has shifted course some what by pursuing negotiations in the wto but by also seeking free trade agreements ftas and economic partnership agreements epas with mostly asian countries an fta is an agreement between two countries or regional groupings to eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers while an epa goes further by also attempting to facilitate the free movement of people and capital am ong the partners to an agreement2 non members find their exports discriminated against as practical matter offi cials at japans ministry of economy trade and industry meti acknowledge that there is little difference between an fta and epa meti however prefers the epa bel based on the view that it does less to provoke domestic political opposition th an the free trade moniker3 the pursuit of ftas is occurring

issues and implications for the united states by bruce vaughn 7 hatakeyama noboru japans movement toward ftas speech delivered at the institute for international economics washington dc may 8 2003economists still disagree about the mer its of negotiating ftas on the grounds that discrimination may undermine the mu ltilateral trading system while others believe that ftas promote multilateral deal s in the long run the concern is that ftas could lead to spaghetti bowl of overlapping conflicting trading partnerships each with its own set of rules at the expe nse of more unified and nondiscriminatory set of multilateral rule s but domestic support in japa n for an fta program appears strong prime minister koizumi is firmly behind the approach as well as the ruling ldpkomeito coalition while the democr atic party the major opposition party supports the general thrust of the policy some members mainta in that the united states and china should be consider ed as prospective fta partners5 given its own aggressive fta program the united states is hardly in position to criticize japans new policy orientation but it has consid erable interest in whether japans policy evolves in manner that is supportive of us interests in asia which include promoting stable balance of power and insuring that us trade and investment interests are not discriminated against in the region6 motivations japans fta program has been motivated by combination of economic and political objectives the most important entail avoidance of becoming isolated as other major trading countries actively pur sue ftas energizing domestic economic activity and promoting japa nese influence in asia7 japans concern about the possible em ergence of economic blocs in the americas and in europe goes back to the early 1990s in 1994 the ited states entered into the north america free trade agreement nafta and announced plans to create free trade area of the americas europe at the same time was busy entering into preferential trade agreemen ts and subsequently has come to conduct trade relations on multilate ral or nondiscriminatory ba sis with only handful of trading partners including japan and th united states in 1999 the collapse of multilateral trade nego tiations at the wto minister ial in seattle shook japanese confidence in the future of multilateralism chinas d ecision in 2001 to negotiate an fta with asean countries was also minal event providing more ammunition for those in japan that were advo cating change of policy course the case for developing an fta progra m was also

increasingly vital to japans economic future8 ftas and epas are viewed as one way to deepen economic ties with east asia and facilitate new division of labor and production sharing the experience of the european union has demonstrated that as institutional integration develops so too does intraregional division of labor that leads to more effective production network and to more efficient industrial structures as result meti maintains that both individual parties to an fta as well as th region as whole can enjoy more robust economic growth powered by an ex pansion of exports and imports reformminded meti officials also hope that an aggressive ftaepa program will serve as force for promoting domestic agricultural reforms by entering into negotiations with trading partners that c ontinue to demand liber alization of japans protected agricultural sector it is hoped that domestic support for programs that might aid farmers transition to less prot ected environment would be proposed and implemented finally many decision makers see ftas providing japan with varied political and diplomatic advantages these rang from increasing japans bargaining power in wto negotiations to helping japan better compete with china for influence in asia under the view that ftas symbolize special relationships based on political trust japan hopes to bolster its diploma tic influence on range of political and security issues9 status of japans fta negotiations three regions asia north america nd europe account for 80 of japans total trade given that the simple average tariff rates imposed by the united states and the european union are low 36 fo r the us and 41 for the eu compared to east asia 10 for china 145 for malaysia 161 for south korea 255 for the philippines and 375 for indonesia the government of japan goj placed priority on negotiating ftas w ith countries in east asia10 not only do east asian countries impose the highes t trade barriers against japanese exports they also account for the highest and most dynamic sh are of japans trade thereby providing the greatest additional opportunities for expa nding japans economy via cuts in both foreign and domestic

4786 of its imports in 2004 up from 3959 in 1998 accordingly in developing its fta strategy the goj placed the highest priority on negotiating ftas with the republic of korea and the four largest asean member states thailand the philippines malaysia and indonesi an fta with mexico now in effect was also made priority due to the relatively high tariffs japanese companies face compared to those companies from the united states canada and european union the latter enjoy duty free treatment for the most part due to nafta 1994 and the eumexican fta 2000 after achieving ftas with priority countries the goj views china and australia as the next most promising candida partners consider ation is also being given to countries outside east as ia including chile and switzerland12 since japan launched its first fta nego tiation with singapore in 2000 progress has been hampered by defensive agricu ltural position while some liberalization has been achieved the amount so far has b een greatly constrained by an inability to offer major reductions in its most protected crops beef rice starches wheat and dairy and to open up its borders to foreign labor some critics have argued that japan following course of least resist ance could end up with numerous watered down ftas that neither harm nor energize the japanese economy according to this view the ftas with the largest benefits for japan such as australia china and south korea are also the most politically challenging and the most likely to fail13 short synopsis of the main features and significance of japans fta program

japanese exports received dutyfree treatment from mexico whereas 70 of mexican exports entered duty free15 from japans perspective the agreement helps eliminate the disadvantages its companies have incurred in competing against north american and european firms since nafta went into effect in 1994 and the eumexican fta went into effect in 2000 facing an average mexican tariff of 16 japan saw its share of mexican imports drop sharply from 61 in 1994 to 37 in 200016 since the fta became operational its import share increased to 48 in 2001 to 55 in 2002 and 44 in 200317 japans auto and steel

australia wont enter into negotiations if agriculture is not on the table in effectively downplaying the prospects for this fta prime minister koizumi noted that an fta with australia that included beef would have an adverse effect on relations with the united states29 while many japanese officials are intrigued by the possibility of negotiating an fta with china the consensus is that it is much too early to move forward for the present japan wants to monitor chinas fulfillment of wto obligations the status of its stateowned sectors and progress in doha round of multilateral negotiations30 switzerland is what one japanese trade official calls g ood pipeline project an attractive feature of this prospective negotiation is that the swiss do not want to liberalize agriculture so there

interests through an aggressive ftaepa program is constrained by protec tion of its agricultural sector and rigid immigration policies while the ftaepa negotiations themselves provide pressures for more open policies the min istries charged with these portfolios agriculture and justice respectively have not yet advanced effective reform policies that would make substantial difference agriculture agriculture accounts for only 13 of japans gdp and 46 of its total employment but remains heavily supporte d and protected from import competition according to the oecd support to producer s as percent of gross receipts was 58 in 200204 down from 61 in 19861988 but still almost twice the oecd average rice wheat other grains meat sugars and dairy are the most heavily supported commodities tariffrate quotas are employ ed to shield these commodities from international competition resu lting in food prices that in tokyo are on average 130 higher than the rest of the world32 many in japan believe that support fo r agricultural protection will disappear over time they cite the declining share of the population engaged in agriculture and the high percentage of farmers 60 w ho are over 65 years old and who derive the majority of their income from nonagricultu ral activities in the process the hold of the agricultural lobby is said to be slippi ng as evidenced by the slippage of the ldp in the 2004 upper house election33 the ldp derives most of its support from rural areas in part due to japans disproportiona electoral distric ting system each rural vote is worth an estimated 2 urban votes34 however policy reforms to help move japan away from considerable agricultural protection have been slow to materialize while the ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries has released papers that have raised the idea that japan should stop wasting resources on crops that can be imported more cheaply little followup has occurred these reports dvocate consideration of policies that would increase competition in the sector by encouraging new entrants and providing direct compensation to farmers through tax incentives in lieu of price controls and high tariffs35 in large measure

major stumbling block for concluding econo mically meaningful ftasepas immigration among industrial nations japan mainta ins the tightest policy towards accepting foreign workers and remains extremely cau tious about changing course however due to declining birthrate and an aging workforce japans decisionmakers are under increased pressure to accept more fo reign workers to keep the economy from stagnating the demands of fta negotiatin g partners such as the philippines and thailand to liberalize japans labor market prohibitions have brought added pressures and debate about more open door policy36 1999 government employment plan ca lled for japan to promote foreign employment in specialized and technical areas but careful approach based on national consensus towards manual workers despite the needs in certain sectors to accept more foreign workers such as nurses and care provi ders public support is lacking concerns about increased crime rates the social costs of accepting more foreigners and an adverse impact on japa nese homogeneity tend to dominate along with the resistance of labor unions in ddition neither the ldp or the democratic party stand clearly in favor of liberalizing immigration37 the significance of the immigration issue transcends the problems it creates for japan reaching closure on fta negotiations with its asian partners such as thailand and the philippines the continuation of exclusionary immigration policies may also undercut japans ambition to play lead ing role in more integrated and interdependent asian economy implications for us interests japans fta program assuming the curre nt defensive cour persists may have varied effects on us interests on the one hand it is likely to provide positive yet small boost to increasing ja

open its agricultural market further in the absence of japanus fta as realistic option other forms of comprehensive engagement may be considered on the other hand lack of meaningful agricultural re form program bodes poorly for positive support from japan in the agricultural negotiations of the doha round there are also concerns that defensive and weak ft program pursued by japan could allow

with growth proj ections of more than 1316 over the next five years japan will not be in position to play much of locomotive role either for the united states or the region this assessment is not likely to be altered by the estimated weak impact of japans fta program on growth lagging china in ftas with asian countries as well in other trade and inves tment linkages japan currently cannot be

issues with the exception of japans ban of the imports of beef from the united states there have been few bilatera l trade disputes and tensions perhaps due to declining share of the us trade ficit

economic initiative cei between japan and the united states the cei is seen as way for japan and the united states both governments and pr ivate sector representatives to consider actions to promote trade investment financial flows nd deregulation and to harmonize standards and coordinate competition policy41 rising china china has been much more aggressive than either japan or the united states in negotiating ftas beijing has concluded partial fta with asean ahead of japan and south korea42 china has also opened its tropi cal farm products to thailand in partial fta and has also agreed to start fta negotiations with singapore australia and new zealand moreover chinas longterm goal may be to form the center of an east asian trade bloc43 given that the united states has limited fta agenda with asian countries ftas in place with singapore and australia and talks contemplated with only south korea an east asian trade bloc c ould have the potential for substantial discrimination against us exports in ddition such bloc could have adverse effects on us influence in the region44 also worrisome is the possibility of japanchina fta much of japans private sector reportedly is thusiastic about such deal45 japanese government sponsored study found that china fta could boost japans gdp by 05 the most among any potential partner country or region46 while many big obstacles stand in the way of japanchina fta the possibility should give pause to ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33044crs13 47 japan us set for game of diplomacy on fta the nikkei weekly june 7 2004 48 japan settles for lowrisk low return fta goals the japan times april 22 2005policymakers some observers opine that the united states would actively work to deter japan from entering into an fta with china47 at the same time chinas aggressive fta program is said to being used by tokyos opposing fta negotiators for ne gotiating advantage trade negotiators representing asean for example reporte dly have played this china card by telling japan that china is more forthcoming and willing to negotiate an fta than japan48 presumably this kind of gamesm anship could nudge japan to take more aggressive and trade liberalizing fta positions how this confluence of fta developments in asia ultimately impacts us interests is uncertain what seems clear however is the need for us policymakers to give appropriate ttention to how us trade policies can best affect trends in the region to evolve in direction favorable to us interests httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33044crs14 table 1 japans top export
