august 29 2005 hurricane katrina made landfall on the gulf coast with high velocity winds and 30foot storm surge accompanied by heavy rainfall katrina has proven to be the most devastating disaster in recent us history exceeding hurricane andrew 1992 and the terrorist attacks on the world trade center 2001 coastal towns and cities were flooded with parts of mississippi completely devastated and buildings left standing in some towns new orleans was deluged by flood water from lake pontchartrain and also from the mississippi river after levees broke catastropheinsured losses in 2005 totaled 661 billion from 24 disasters estimated insured losses from katrina alone were 436 billion stemming from 175 million claims despite the severity of storm damages hurricane katrina and other

years and experienced significant growth in policyholder surplus insurers in fact earned record profits in each of the last three years 20042006 in the aftermath of katrina policymakers disaster experts and insurance company representatives have expressed concerns about the potential vulnerability of the insurance industry to future megacatastrophic event and raised questions about what role if any the federal government should play in financing catastrophe risks most insurance market analysts note that there is state in the union that is not subject to catastrophe exposure and the current state of affairs suggests that the exposures are far greater than the insurance industry is now prepared to handle although the insurance industry has emerged largely intact from hurricane katrina and is better capitalized now than ever it simply does not have sufficient capital to pay for megacatastrophe this fact is not new insurers and financial market experts knew after hurricane andrew in 1992 that outside capital was needed to supplement industry capacity as members of congress explore ways to respond to the increasing risk and uninsured losses from tropical storms earthquakes and disruptive and costly inland flooding they may be called upon to consider federal policy alternatives to build national capabilities for disaster risk management among measures that

disaster risks introduction on august 29 2005 hurricane katrina struck several states along the gulf coast from louisiana to the western edge of the florida panhandle including mississippi and alabama causing deaths injuries property and infrastructure damage economic loss and human suffering1 the storm caused an unprecedented amount of damage to residential industrial largely oil and chemicalrelated and commercial property hurricane katrina was different from other hurricanes because of the extensive flooding that resulted from record 30foot storm surge and the breaching of three levees that protected new orleans from lake pontchartrain and the mississippi river katrina left over million people without electricity communications and drinking water casualties are expected to number in the hundreds2 in the aftermath of hurricane katrina concerns have been expressed by insurance industry participants emergency managers policymakers and disaster policy experts about the following the unprecedented property damages and huge recovery costs and challenges facing the region louisiana mississippi and alabama and nation the longterm budgetary implication of federal disaster recovery expenses given that the american people will ultimately be responsible for the cost of hurricane katrina through either taxes insurance policy premiums or federal postdisaster assistance 1 according to the us national hurricane center hurricane katrina initially made landfall between hallandale beach and aventura florida as category 1 storm on august 25 2005 then made second landfall on august 29th near southeastern louisiana burastriumph louisiana as category 4 storm with winds of 140 miles per hour 2 the last hurricane that made direct hit on new orleans was hurricane betsy in 1965 the storm surge from betsy left 50 of the city under water and 60000 residents homeless following hurricane katrina new orleans evacuation plans removed 80 of the metropolitan areas 14 million people but failed to empty the city of thousands who were forced to remain for various reasons in neighborhoods susceptible to flooding crs2 whether or not in light of the massive floodrelated claims filed by property owners and the resulting financial deficits in the nfip the program should be overhauledrestructured to operate more like private insurance company the vulnerability of the property insurance industry to future mega catastrophic event of such magnitude that substantial portion of the industry could not support its various obligations which could lead to ripple effect of potential insolvencies of multistate insurers and whether and how the federal government could improve our nations ability to insure and mitigate risks of largescale natural disasters there appears to be growing support among policymakers and disaster policy experts on the need to reexamine how the country manages and finances economic noninsured and insured losses and to seek new and innovative ways to do both3 traditional disaster policy has focused on coping with disasters using warnings before the disaster strikes emergency relief and hazard insurance after disaster occurs and hazard reduction measures such as levees and floodplain managementlanduse ordinances to reduce damages from disasters with this in mind economists note that individual households and businesses have two options to reduce losses from natural disasters predisaster mitigation that reduces physicalenvironmental vulnerabilities and risk financing designed to reduce financial vulnerabilities the first step in the disaster risk management framework is to mitigate damages from disasters the residual economic risk can then be managed with risk financing strategies financing is thus an integral part of managing catastrophe risk it would not be feasible to quickly reconstruct the damaged property and infrastructure following hurricane katrina and also to restore the livelihood of the affected persons without adequate financial arrangements as members of congress explore ways to respond to the destruction caused by hurricane katrina the longterm budgetary implications of disaster recovery expenses incurred by the federal government as well as federal potential alternatives to build national capabilities for financing disaster risk may emerge as prime consideration the 110th congress will likely continue to consider various approaches to ensure the availability and affordability of disaster insurance to protect residential and commercial property against future disasters this debate could involve finding ways to improve insurers access to capital in the reinsurance banking and securities markets to ensure adequate capacity and solvency of the industry to meet consumer needs the us economy and natural disasters when disaster occurs productive resources in particular region or state are destroyed or crippled resources from other parts of the country must be redirected 3 jeff harrington spur for national fund st petersburg florida times august 30 2005 p 1 crs3 to compensate the victims and rebuild or repair that which is lost whether the disasteraffected region or state is better or worse off depends on what portion of their losses if any are covered by insurance or government disaster assistance physical damage to the general building stock and the infrastructure following hurricane katrina could very well lead to reduction in the flow of goods and services and an aggregate loss of income to the local state and national economy the degree to which the storm disrupts the economy depends on the magnitude and duration of the disaster the structure of the local economy the geographical areas affected the population base and the time of day the disaster occurs the largest effects on output employment wages and capital stock occur at the local or regional level and to lesser extent at the national level depending on whether economic activity is sufficiently impeded or whether the disaster affects large enough percentage of the population or an important industry for example the us economy in 1994 was adversely affected by the northridge earthquake and the winter storms in the south midwest and east which affected 50 of the us population disrupted construction in the housing industry and caused significant reductions in the output of automobiles steel and appliances national estimates for economic growthoutput were revised downwards as result of these series of natural disasters during disaster recovery period the affected region or state will engage in redevelopment and cleanup efforts assuming willingness on the part of investors and the public to redevelop the area that tend to increase local employment and other economic activities insurance payments and disaster assistance government purchases and income transfer payments provide flow of funds into the area realizing the potential for profits investors will likely be attracted to the building boom in the devastated area although private domestic investment becomes important in terms of facilitating production employment and the demand for products the apparent positive contribution to the areas aggregate income from increased investment spending is largely ambiguous the reason is that the investment does not represent net additions to the stock of capital as destroyed physical assets are replaced with assets that incorporate the latest advanced technology the productivity of communitys physical assets and the incomes generated from those assets will be enhanced depending on how much of the loss is recovered from the rest of the country the affected region may be better off the nation as whole however is unambiguously hurt by the disaster catastrophe losses from 2005 hurricanes according to the insurance services offices iso property claim services unit catastropheinsured losses in 2005 totaled 661

and economic losses from business interruption and adjustments for losses covered by residual market mechanisms and foreign reinsurers the figures will also change as the courts resolve lawsuits filed

150000 whichever is less8 grants are now available to thousands of homeowners outside of special flood hazard areas commonly known as the flood plain or the flood zone who were not required by federal law to purchase flood insurance9 propertycasualty insurers withstood record catastrophe losses the pc industry experienced favorable financial and underwriting conditions during 2005 despite record catastrophe losses there are four reasons the pc industry emerged financially strong from record catastrophe losses of 661 billion in 2005 following record losses of 302 billion in 2004 first insurers learned important lessons from hurricane andrew in 1992 and these lessons prompted them to make changes to both protect the industrys balance sheets and stabilize the property insurance markets in the aftermath of moderate hurricane10 for example after hurricane andrew the florida state legislature worked with private insurers and regulators to create hurricane catastrophe system designed to mitigate losses to the insurance industry and prevent insurers from withdrawing from the florida insurance market the florida hurricane catastrophe fund was created as reinsurancelike entity funded by portion of insurance premiums and managed by the florida state board of administration florida also began using percentage deductibles tied to the value of homes instead of dollar amount such as 500 per claim florida created state regulated insurer of last resort to provide insurance when company is willing to underwrite disaster risks these strategies for countering the challenges presented by hurricanes saved the property insurance industry from financial disaster after the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons second insurers experienced strong underwriting gains following the imposition of sound risk management practices after the four major hurricanes in 2004 insurers imposed tighter underwriting standards and sought regulatory approval for 7 continued block grant funds in disaster relief and recovery by eugene boyd 8 on june 15 2006 president bush signed into law the fourth emergency supplemental for 198 billion in support of short and longerterm needs of the gulf coast the 198 billion includes 52 billion in additional cdbg funds with 42 billion intended for louisiana and the remaining 1 billion to support the renovation and construction of affordable rental housing in the affected states 9 in order to qualify for the 150000 compensation the home must 1 be outside the flood zone established by the federal government 2 be owneroccupied and 3 have had homeowner or similar insurance coverage at the time of katrinas landfall these criteria were established to eliminate the possibility of assistance to homeowners who lived within known flood area and yet did not maintain flood insurance or homeowners who did not maintain standard home insurance 10 for more information on insurance lessons learned form hurricane andrew see crs report rl32825 hurricanes and disaster risk financing through insurance challenges and policy options by rawle king crs6 higher rates however insurers faced regulatory scrutiny when they sought to adjust rates to reflect higher catastrophe risk and higher reinsurance costs not able to get approval to charge higher rates some insurers opted to limit their overall exposure in hurricaneprone areas along the gulf and atlantic coasts this in turn precipitated an insurance availability and affordability problem that continues through early 2007 third insures were able to withstand record catastrophe losses in 2005 because policyholder surplus11 measure of claimspaying capacity rose unexpectedly by 92 in 2005 from 3935 billion at yearend 2004 to 4271 billion as of december 31 2005 table 2 shows that at the end of the third quarter of 2007 the pc industry had 5218 billion in policyholder surplus supporting about 3233 billion in earned premiums only fraction of this industrywide total surplus however would be available to compensate victims of catastrophic event insurers must rely on this same limited pool of surplus to pay for other potentially catastrophic and unpredictable risks such as terrorism mold and medical malpractice and asbestos liability claims prior to hurricane hugo in 1989 the insurance industry had not experienced any losses from single disaster of over 1 billion today one billion dollar disaster is quite common predictable and manageable but most insurance experts would agree that the 100 billionplus catastrophic event remains challenge for the us propertycasualty insurance industry12 estimates of the probable maximum losses pmls from catastrophic earthquake or hurricane striking the us range up to 120 billion and this figure could be even higher depending on the location time and intensity of the event the pml loss from category 5 hurricane directly hitting densely populated area along the gulf and atlantic coasts eg miamift lauderdale could exceed the total capacity policyholder surplus of the us insurance industry13 the fourth reason insurers were able to withstand record catastrophe losses in 2005 was their high investment income rising interest rates that boost the industrys substantial bond portfolio and strong stock market gains allowed insurers to generate 495 billion in 2005 and 523 billion in 2006 on their investment portfolio 11 policyholder surplus is referred to as net worth or owners equity in other industries it represents the financial resources capital that stand behind every policy underwritten by an insurer 12 ross j davidson jr

policymakers to question whether the pc insurance industry has the capacity to insure megacatastrophic event in the aftermath of hurricane katrina some members of congress have expressed concerns about the availability and affordability of natural disaster insurance for residents and business owners in disasterprone states15 in the shortrun in order to make homeowners insurance available and affordable state governments have created statesponsored insurance pools to provide catastrophe insurance or reinsurance coverage at subsidized rates these statesponsored insurance programs however are inadequately capitalized to handle the megacatastrophic event the florida hurricane catastrophe fund fhcf for example began 2007 with about 1 billion in cash and total insured residential values of 18 trillion fhcf issues up to 15 billion of reinsurance to residential insurers at about 30 the upfront cost of private reinsurance by shifting the actual cost of risk into the future with longterm

through 2007 since the early 1970s congress has considered several legislative proposals to establish federal disaster insurancereinsurance program but none were enacted until the passage of the terrorism risk insurance act tria of 200216 most of those calls for action typically followed major disaster and public policy debate about how best to respond to the us exposure to high levels of risk from natural disasters primarily hurricanes floods earthquakes and windstorm risks tria provided temporary federal reinsurance backstop once high insurance industry loss is sustained the law which was scheduled to expire at the end of 2005 was extended through december 31 201417 the first of these proposals hr 4480 and hr 4462 introduced in the 101st congress sought to address only the

and volcanoes both hr 21 and hr 1552 would have established federal program to provide reinsurance to improve the availability of homeowners insurance the two bills took slightly different approaches however whereas hr 21 would have established new federal disaster reinsurance fund to provide up to 25 billion in annual coverage to state insurance pools hr 1552 would have authorized the secretary

legislation in the house hr 4836 108th congress the 108th congress considered several major federal disaster insurance bills but the approach that received the most attention involved changing federal tax law to authorize taxdeferred treatment of private insurers catastrophe reserves19 allowing private insurers to build up catastrophe reserves to pay natural disasterrelated claims that have low probability of occurrence it is argued would lower insurers costs of holding capital and in turn lower the premiums they must charge for given level of disaster coverage alternatively critics charge that the tax deductibility of catastrophe reserves would cause the us treasury to lose tax revenue paid by insurers would the lost tax revenue be an acceptable price to pay to achieve the publicsector goal of reducing overall disaster losses how would someone measure success these were central questions in the debate all federal disaster insurancereinsurance bills including tria share one feature they seek to improve the nations ability to finance catastrophe risk through insurance as opposed to increased direct spending for federal disaster assistance their justification has been based on the argument that such initiatives will 1 enhance the current catastrophe funding system 2 make property insurance more available and affordable in highrisk areas 3 promote the funding of research studies ie earthquake science actuarial science economics and finance on disaster insurance issues and 4 expand our knowledge and understanding of the scientific and financial aspects of natural hazards in addition proponents of federal disaster insurance have argued that such scheme would reduce dependence on free disaster assistance and support efficient risk management by households and businesses20

exposures journal of insurance regulation vol 7 2 winter 1998 p 134 crs11 opponents to federal intervention in catastrophe insurance markets believe there is sufficient private sector capacity and federal intervention would only crowd out private capital for insuring disasters and stifle innovative catastrophe risk financing through insurance moreover critics of federal intervention say such measures would conflict with longestablished sociological economic and actuarial principles that focus on the true cost of government programs the opportunity cost of the funds the foregone benefits of competitive insurance marketplace eg cost efficiency and rate competition and the absence of consumer choice the ability to decide whether to purchase coverage21 citing the development of new financial instruments to fund catastrophe coverage and expanded reinsurance capacity critics of public insurance systems say there is need for federal insurance program at this time they insist that such programs would shield the private sector from loss while creating sizable taxpayer financed subsidies that undermine privatesector incentives for efficient risk management moreover it has been argued that these programs would encourage population growth and development in highrisk hurricaneprone areas that should not be developed and would allow insurers to cherry pick the best risks and send the federal government the poor risks concluding remarks historically congress has been reluctant to enact federal disaster insurance legislation because of lack of consensus on what will work and concerns about adequate provisions for mitigation and avoidance of unnecessary government intrusion into markets being adequately served by private sector financial entities congressional reluctance to establish federal disaster insurance program has been based on the recognition that such program would conflict with sociological economic and actuarial principles that emphasize the true cost of government programs the opportunity cost of the funds the forgone benefits of competitive insurance marketplace eg cost efficiency and rate competition and the absence of consumer choice the ability to decide whether to purchase coverage22 the federal government has played an important role in the us economic system by assuming risks that the private sector either will not undertake at any price or will accept but at price so high that most potential beneficiaries will not purchase the coverage for example government riskbearing now occurs in environmental disasters nuclearplant accidents toxic waste dumps and flooding establishing an explicit federal disaster insurance system to ameliorate the potential damages to homes and commercial buildings stemming from natural disasters would represent another government riskbearing program one that could expose taxpayers to 21 howard kunreuther and richard j roth sr paying the price the status and role of insurance against

nevertheless supporters of federal disaster insurance program argue that it would be justified by the national scope of the hurricane katrina disaster and by the inability of the private insurance industry to handle future high payouts from megacatastrophic event without federal government involvement as members of the 110th congress explore longterm ways to respond to hurricane katrina consideration might be given to whether there is need to improve the nations ability to finance catastrophic risk and if so how previous congresses responded to similar concerns by considering legislation to create federal catastrophe reinsurance program for residential property despite broad support for several bills over the past few years congress did not authorize federal reinsurance program until the enactment of the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 finally most observers would agree that for the very highest layers of catastrophe risk the government and consequently the taxpayer is now by default the insurer of last resort in the 110th congress any one of number of policy options could be pursued and will likely be influenced by whether it can be shown that potential losses from hurricane katrina are beyond the capacity of private markets to diversify natural hazard risks members will likely be grappling with several policy questions for example will reinsurance and securitization be enough to maintain insurance solvency after megacatastrophic hurricane or earthquake how can the various funding sources available for catastrophe insurance be expanded and refined to cope with catastrophic hurricane finally what role if any should the federal government play in catastrophe insurance crs13 appendix summary of federal disasters insurance legislation
