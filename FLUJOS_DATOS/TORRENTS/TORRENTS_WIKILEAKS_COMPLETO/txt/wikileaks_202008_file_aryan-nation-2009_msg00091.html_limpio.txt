to write matthew hale is thoroughly despicable human being the selfstyled white supremacist stands for everything i have lived my life against as university of illinois student i went to springfield to support open housing freedom of residence i worked for civil rights causes in college and through law school and every year since then i belong to completely integrated multicultural multiethnic church i condemn racial or ethnic hatred of any kindbut as lawyer i know the law often makes grave mistakes i personally have been abused by corrupt judges and lawyers injustice happens every day to the innocent and the guilty alikewith each passing day america is moving further and further away from the democratic traditions which we espouse and broadcast to the world we are adopting the totalitarian methods of our vilest adversaries america is becoming dictatorship where any person can be falsely accused prosecuted into penury and jailed for crime he or she did not commiteven the guilty are entitled to due process as justice stewart on the us supreme court once wrote even thief is entitled to deny he is burglar justice is served not only in protecting the innocent but also in meting out measured punishment to the guiltymatthew hales sentencing was kangaroo court travesty of justice joke and disgrace to america but rather than fighting antisemitism and racism the us government is in the process of creating yet another martyrto racism and antisemitismi admire and respect us attorney patrick fitzgerald he is as decent and honorable man as ever occupied his office for the northern district of illinois but sometimes even decent human beings honest and honorable people can be blinded by their own sense of rectitude and revenge thats where contrarian columnists come inhale was accused of soliciting the murder of u s district judge joan lefkow we saw only few weeks ago how mistaken society could be hale was suspected of being the orchestrator of the murder of lefkows husband and mother hale protested his innocence he was innocentthe punishment of hales parents denying them visits with their for year because he protested his innocence of the lefkow murders through them is disgrace to justice worthy of the soviet state during its worse abuses worthy of china today few weeks ago lawyer in new york was convicted of representing vile client who was also held incommunicado now america stoops to punish parents because they protested their sons innocencehale protested his innocence again yesterday but before we get to guilt or innocence before we ask what just punishment would be for hale we have to ask how any judge worthy of the name could allow someone who has been incarcerated as caged rat for year could allow someone in that state of mind to rise and speak on his own behalfeven if the court was constrained to permit hale to speak the court failed to hear argument from an impartial attorney represented as amicus curiae to speak on behalf of justice itself one who has been caged and abused can reasonably be expected to be rational in proceeding where his life is at stake thats why we have lawyers the legal profession and the law failed us todaythere was basis to hold hale incommunicado he is loathsome individual thoroughly devilish human being but as the seventh circuit once wrote in decision alhough he might not win popularity contest in this circuithe still retains the same constitutional rights as every other defendant brought before this bar in like fashion hale has been crucified in all probability for crime he did not commit injustice never extinguishes the flames it only fans the fires that will likely be the outcome with halehis followers know hale was framed railroaded set up by an fbi informant how many people have said in the throes of angry divorce i wish i could kill my spouse people say im going to kill you every day they are not being sent to jail for forty years we dont imprison actual murderers that longwe were told antiterrorism laws were being passed to combat foreign enemies terrorists such as osama bin laden now they are being turned on us whos next patriot act anybody whatever hale is and he is not very much he is not terroristjudge moody who sentenced hale wrote an epitaph for our judicial system he said he said hales conduct strikes at the very core of our system of government sir judge moody manufacturing crimes and prosecuting people for manufactured crimes strikes at our democracy judge moody your unprincipled sentencing of bad man is what really strikes at the very core of our system of government your imposing antiterrorism laws on neighborhood lout is what strikes at the heart of our constitution sadly hale may be victim when he should have been the vanquished but in being made victim by the divine majesty of the u s department of justice hale has become the ultimate victor he has shown that what he claimedthough for the wrong reasonswas corrupt society is indeed corrupt society where the fbi can manufacture crime use governmentpaid employee to orchestrate that crime and then jail someone with life sentence for crime that the person never committedamerica today is in the business of making the innocent guilty we are creating gulags all around the world where we exterminate helpless prisoners branding them as our perceived enemies as though the mere act of branding was sufficient basis to extinguish life or torture someone into oblivion we absolve our perpetrators of these crimes obstruct investigations and kill little bit of every american every time we tolerate such subhuman behavior by nation that should light unto all nationsas someone who has devoted major part of his life to justice and the judicial system to fighting crooked judges corrupt legal system and the wholesale imposition of injustice on the innocent i can attest that when we fail to protect the guilty we endanger the innocent hale is bad person but in protecting his rights we protect our ownwe are all guilty of being complicitors as our heritage of due process is slowly eroded by the pious platitudes of the bush administration america is being diminished we are too blind to see this happening too timid to admit and face realitytoday osama bin laden was also big winner he is hater too he won because our adversaries are not stupid they can see what we do how we preach justice and democracy and yet allow our courts to be controlled by political considerations our enemies know we have confined the innocent abused the innocent and even murdered the innocent while frustrated that we cannot easily separate the guilty from the innocent so we kill them all abuse them all disgrace us all now even china and russia are emboldened to mock our history of civil rights and civility and theyre right we do not have monopoly on virtuemake mistake if hale was guilty of the crime of which he was accused i would be the first to send him away if someone is terrorist i would be the first to seek harsh punishment death if necessary but hale is not alone since 911 we have tortured and abused and falsely prosecuted or imprisoned thousands of people who were not guilty of the crimes with which they were charged or who were not charged with any crime at all my experience has been that the judicial system is often capable of sorting out excessive punishments i am hopeful that when cooler heads prevail as they usually do on the 27th floor of the united states courthouse the american people will obtain justice hale may be worthy of some punishment but not forty years in gulag not being held incommunicado not for terrorism not for crime he probably did not commit and not with his parents being harassed and abused by the attorney general of the united statesi am ashamed not because hale is innocent but because the process of justice has once again proven itself guiltyandy martin is the nationally syndicated independent contrarian columnist for
