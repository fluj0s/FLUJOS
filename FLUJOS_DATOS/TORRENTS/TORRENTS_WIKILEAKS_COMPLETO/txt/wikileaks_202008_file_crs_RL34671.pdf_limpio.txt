summary on august 27 2008 the governor of alas ka signed legislation awarding license to transcanada alaska transcanada to permit develop and build natural gas pipeline from prudhoe bay alaska to the gas market hub in alberta canada with 500 million of state support since th discovery of significant oil and gas reserves in prudhoe bay in 1968 alaska st ate and federal polic ymakers have sought to accelerate bringing these important energy resources to market especially to market in the lower48 states the trans alaska pipeline system taps began shipping crude oil from pr udhoe bay in 1978 efforts to build gas pipeline still have achieved little progress 30 years later this report provides brief review of fforts to develop and construct natural gas pipeline from prudhoe bay status re port on recent efforts to proceed and an analysis of major relevant policy issues in 1976 congress passed the alaska na tural gas transportation act angta as one element of multipronged effort to respond to the natural gas supply problems caused by earlier wellhead price c ontrols engineering work was underway on the pipeline when in the early 1980s th natural gas market in north america entered prolonged period of relatively low prices for natural gas because domestic producers had responded vigorously to high prices during the phased decontrol of wellhead prices through the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa interest in developing the pipeline waned becau of the poor market prospects in 1997 the united states became net im porter of liquefied natural gas lng for the first time in retrospect this was leading indicator of tightening natural gas supply for the north american market congress again promoted development of the pipeline in the alaska natural gas pipeline act angp in 2004 and with related amendments in the ener gy policy act of 2005 epact 2005 the state of alaska has pursued the na tural gas pipeline development with sense of urgency for several years in 2001 alaska established an interagency task force to move forward with pipeline the administration immediately preceding the current governor reached controversial agreement with the prudhoe bay producers exxonmobil bp conocophillips the current governor proceeded with new initiative the alaska gasline inducement act agia that has led to the august 27 signing mentioned earlier two producers conocophillips and bp have formed denali pipeline to develop prudhoe baytomarket pipeline without agia support the third and largest producer exxonmobil has not supported an currently active pipeline development initiative many challenges remain at this time the key parties however appear constructively engaged in the effort to make available this significant energy supply

introduction forty years ago major oil and natural gas resources were discovered at prudhoe bay alaska since 1976 congress has acted to promote the successful development of natural gas pipeline from the alaska north slope ans to the lower48 states1 in the alaska natural gas pipeline act of 2004 congress established statutory finding of public need for this proj ect stating in section 103b2 that public need exists to construct and operate the proposed alaska natural gas transportation project and b sufficient downstream capacity will exist to transport the alaska natural gas moving through the project to markets in the contiguous united states on august 27 2008 alaskas governor signed legislation into law that officially awarded to transcanada corporation transcanada license to permit develop and build an alaska natural gas pipeline from pr udhoe bay alaska to the lower48 states with 500 million from the state at full initial capacity of 45 billion cubic feet per day this pipeline could initially supply an amount equal to about 7 of us natural gas consumption in 20072 this report provides brief review of the history of efforts to develop this project report on recent developments and project status and summary of remaining policy issues and th project outlook at this time3 historical overview since the discovery of the major natural gas and oil reserves on the alaska north slope in 1968 congress has passed several measures to encourage the development of the natura l gas resources there table 1 presents several highlights of this processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34671crs2 4 the federal power commission fpc was the predecessor of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 5 see discussion in d fried and w hederman the benefits of an alaska natural gas pipeline the energy journal vol 2 1 january 1981 p22 6 natural gas supply bubble is temporar oversupply of capacity to produce natural gasin 1976 congress passed the alaska natu ral gas transporta tion act angta the purpose of that legislation was to provide for sound decisionmaking on the natural gas transportation system that provided for congressi onal and presidential participation in the process and to expedite construction and the start of operations briefly the policy steps of the process moved expeditiously all completed in 1977 in step one the federal power commission transmitted recommendation of one of three transportation system options may 1977 the landbased pipeline route along the alaska highway4 two alternatives were land based pipeline systems and one was combination pipeline across alaska and an lng export terminal in valdez in step two the president recommended the same alaska highway alternative september 1977 in step three congre ss approved the presidents decision through joint resolution that may have been th last time this project proceeded according to the original plan in the winter of 19771978 the nation experienced serious problems with natural gas deliveries through the interstate market because of the distortions of wellhead natural gas price controls these price controls had been driven by supreme court decision in 1954 phillip s petroleum co v wisconsin 347 us 672 in response to these delivery pr oblems congress passed the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa nd the powerplant and indus trial fuel use act of 1978 pifua as natural gas supply and demand bega n to res pond favorab ly to the energy policy legislation of 1978 the desirability of the alaska natural gas transportation system declined5 moreover in an often repeated pattern for major us energy supply projects cost estimates for this tran sport system increased natural gas prices softened significantly as natural gas supply bubble develope d and persisted for years in response to wellhead price decontrol6 commercial attention to the alaska gas pipe initiative essentially disappeared during the 1980s although the full pipeline project made progress as canadian natural gas supplies from the western canadian sedime ntary basin increased in the late 1970s and early 1980s producers from the province of alberta canadian authorities and us and canadian pipeline companies work ed to prebuild the downstream legs of the alaska natural gas transportation sy stem angts from alberta to california and to the midwest the concept was that canadian producers would loan the gas to the us consumers and be repaid in ki nd when the alaska north slope supplies arrived this concept led to tight provincial regulatory scrutiny

and the denali project two smaller projects focus on intra alaska issues the bullet line to south ce ntral alaska and an lng project with pipeline to valdez that could pro ceed with varying levels of

transportation system angts transcanada has stated that it will not be responsible for natura l gas treatment into the pipeline and will only accept pipeline quality gas into the pipe it also stated willingness to develop the gas tr eatment facilities if necessary the pipeline would follow the transal aska pipeline system taps past fairbanks to delta junction then follow the alaska highway to alberta canada the natural gas would move through albert via transcanadas existing pipeline network the natural gas would continue to the lower48 states via the angts pre build lines and other

three pr udhoe bay producers were to build private pipeline with capacity for others it woul d not provide an incentive for additional exploration and production from others on the ans the ferc has required open access on this pipeline22 project risk management and sharing this pipeline project would be the largest civilian construction project in the history of north america current cost

financial market and political risk congress has ac knowledged the magnitude of these risks and authorized up to 18 billion of loan guaran tees to help address the risk challenge angpa 2004 pl 108324 the congre ssionally approved 18 billion loan guarantee relates to the risks associated with potential drop in delivered natural gas values compared to current forecasts alt hough current prices and forecast prices are high natural gas prices and the ou tlook for future prices can change currently it appears that an alaska natural gas pipeline would operate under tariffs approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for the united states and by the national energy board neb for canada the pipeline operators would have contractual commitments from shippers for transporting gas through the pipeline producers and the state of alaska might face financial risk on the price of the natural gas produced the value of the natu ral gas on the alaska north slope would be the market value where the pipeline delivered the gas minus the tariff payment to deliver the natural gas to market as cu rrently envisioned the alaska north slope producers would be the shippers local gas distribution companies ldcs or other natural gas consumers or marketers could also commit to transport contracts with the pipeline in the case of ldcs it appears th at most state regulators would not

that all participants in this project accept fair share of the risks so that th ey will take responsib ility and be accountable for successful implementation for example supply risk appears minor but th point thompson natural gas may be necessary to realize the economies of scale on the pipeline the state of alaska and exxonmobil continue to dispute the pace of development there this dispute could endanger the timely availability of these natural gas volumes and harm project economics construction risk appears serious with regard to cost overruns given the recent cost escalation experienced in energy projects generally the potential for this project to cost more than the 26 billion us dollars23 initial estimate appears likely and to exceed the highest estimates heard to date 40 billion remains possible engineering completion risk appears small all the potential project developers bp c onoco philips exxonmob il and transcanada have relevant and ppropriate scale pipeline system engineering experience market risk appears moderate in terms of the potential market value at time of delivery the canadian energy research institute ceri has reportedly estimated that market value for the natural gas would need to exceed 10 canadian pe r million btu for the project to be viable24 because it appears producers must deliver the natural gas to alberta or the lower48 states the market risks fall on them this explains the importance to them of control over project costs which affect the netback value at pr udhoe bay alternatively gas distribution companies or other natural gas purchasers could also purchase pipeline capacity and assume some market risk current state regulatory practice does not appear to encourage such long term commitments this is policy area that would benefit from additional analysis but is statelevel issue the three prudhoe bay producers have sought guarantees on alaska tax and royalty policy that the state has viewed as unreasonable on longterm multidecade agreements flexibility from all parties is often key to successful agreements rather than locking all factors down permanently up front agreeing to the timing of renegotiation and

example dow jones news servic exxon set to work with transcanada conoco bp on alaska pipeline august 7 2008 240 pm esttranscanada in its agia app lication also proposed another measure to mitigate

by alaska in the agia invitation if the pipeline were built with 45 billion cubic feet per day bcfd capacity and natural gas producer s or customers signed on for capacity the levelized annual bridge shipper contingent liability for all capacity could be as high as approximately 3 billion nominal per year for 25 years25 the primary purposes of this proposal appear to be 1 to buttress the attractiveness for those who might finance the project and 2 to llow the project to proceed without prudhoe bay producer commitments so that it will be easier to make the case later on that these producers are not working diligently to develop the resource the magnitude and complexity of the risks for this project have always presented challenges for success and for project startup there is little reason to expect these challenges to diminish significantly diligent development the slow pace of development on the alaska natural gas pipeline has led some pipeline proponents to conclude that the prudhoe bay producers would prefer not to develop these resources at this time this controversy has expanded on the ans when in april 2008 the alaska state depa rtment of natural resources terminated exxonmobils lease in the point thompson unit east of prudhoe bay exxonmobil disputes the termination and this matter will likely end up in the court system for many years if there is

the alberta pipeline network status oil sands development which could consume significant quantities of natural gas as fuel nd alberta natural gas production the mackenzie valley in the canadian arctic contains an estimated 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas it was discovered at approximately the same time as the alaska north slope gas at prudhoe bay at one time devel opment of mackenzie valley gas appeared likely to be through spur line connecting to the pipeline from alaska that configuration appears less likely today and canadian interests hope to proceed with mackenzie valley pipeline before the alaska pipeline project begins27 mackenzie valley gas if developed may go to the oil sands of northern alberta to provide fuel for the steam generation required to produce crude oil there the demand for steel and pipe for mackenzie valley project are significant and it is not clear that there is adequate large diameter pipe reduction capacity in the entire world to serve both alaska and mackenzie valley projects at the same time supporters of the mackenzie valley pipeline intend to precede the alaska project mackenzie valley pipeline supporters fear that if the alaska line

canada in canadas northern pipeline act npa section 21 with the rightofway approved pursuant to section 37 of the npa has been an important consideration throughout aska pipeline discussions at this time there appears to be the expectation that in ten years when alaska natural gas could start to flow through alberta there will be spare capacity in the alberta pipeline grid the treaty provisions included in the npa appear to commit to providing sufficient capacity without sp ecifying capacity figure and there is sunset date in the legislation oil sands development has accelerated in northern alberta and costs have increased as pressure mounts for the ava ilable labor and othe r input requirements much of the mackenzie natural gas is exp ected to serve the growing oil sands load alberta gas production has been declin ing there is the potential that unconventional gas production c ould reverse this trend but there is concrete evidence of turnaround at this time another potentially

application judged incomplete more recently the chairman of gazprom has expressed an interest in participating in the bp nd conoco philips denali project28 alaska economic development the alaska natural gas pipeline project has important implications for the states economic health through c onstruction job creation nd revenue generation from production royalties in addition the presen ce of major interstate pipeline from the ans to the lower48 would change the economics for many local energy markets within alaska for example both transc anada and denali have agreed to provide up to five delivery points within alaska this can allow local communities without natural gas service to gain service if they are near the pipe rightofway presumably one of the delivery points would link with the anchoragefairbanks gas bullet line this would allow ans natu ral gas to flow south to anchorage and other south central alaska markets when cook inlet production declines there might also be development opportunity for relatively small pipeline to south alaska for lng exportation this woul d be another local valueadd and job generator transcanada has also assured the state that if shippers preferred to go to south alaska for an lng system they would accommodate that environmental effects the addition of the significant natura l gas supplies from alaskas north slope to the lower 48 fuel supplies is generally considered positive development in terms of the environment the immensity of the roughly 1750mile construction project has caused some concern bout potential environmental effects to the land and wildlife near the construction area congress has addressed this issue by delegating the federal energy regulatory commission as the lead federal agency to assure all environmental regulations of the national environmental policy act and epa are met and that relevant agencies worked to meet environmental impacts statement deadlines established by the commission in recognition of the complexity of this particular project congress created an office of the federal coordi nator ofc to enhance coordination and progress canadian regulators also coordinate with the ofchttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34671crs15 conclusion concerted effort by the state of aska and other inte rested parties has resulted in new momentum to proceed with an alaska natural gas pipeline from prudhoe bay to the lower48 states many ch allenges remain at this time the key parties however appear constructively engaged in the effort to make available this significant energy supply option
