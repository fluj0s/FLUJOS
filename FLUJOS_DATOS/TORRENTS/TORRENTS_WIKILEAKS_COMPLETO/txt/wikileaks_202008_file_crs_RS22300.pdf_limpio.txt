court is to hold c ontinuous annual term commencing on the first monday in october and ending on the day be fore the first monday in october of the following year2 congress likewise determines the number of justices that are to comprise the supreme court currently providing at 28 usc 1 that the court is to consist of chief justice of the united states and eight associate justices3 congress has further established quorum requirements for the court pr oviding that any six justices shall constitute quorum4 this requirement is reflect ed in supreme court rule 42 which further provides that in the absence of quorum on any day appointed for holding session of the court the attending justices or the clerk or deputy clerk if justice is present may announce that the cour t will not meet until there is quorum5 while not specified in statute or rule the general pr actice of the court is that majority of the quorum may act for the court6 in the event that the participating justices are equally divided on the merits of case opinion is issued and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed but not accorded any value as precedent7 this practice of affirmance adheres generally in the event of deadlock however as is discussed below the court may holdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22300crs3 8 28 usc 2109 9 id 10 see stern gressman n6 supra at 726 11 see stern gressman n6 supra at 727 12

delineated procedures to be followed in the event that quorum of qualified justices is unavailable to decide case or controversy before the court if quorum is available to hear nd determine direct appeal from federal district court the chief justice may order th remittal of the case to the appropriate court of appeals whereupon the court of appeals sitting banc or through specially composed panel of three senior circuit judges hears the case and renders final and conclusive decision8 in all other cases where quor um is lacking congress has established that if majority of the qualified justices termine that the case cannot be heard and determined at the next ensuing term the court shall enter its order affirming the judgment of the court from which the case wa s brought for review with the same effect as upon affirmance by an equally divided court9 petitions for rehearing supreme court rule 44 permits an unsu ccessful party to submit petition for rehearing within 25 days of the entry of an adverse decision or judgment on the merits or denial of ceritiorari despite the existence of this option it has been noted that the supreme court seldom grants rehearing of any kind of order judgment or decision10 the infrequency with which petitions for rehearing are granted would appear to be generally attributable to the fact that th court engages in thorough consideration of each case before it prior to issuing decision11 thus petition for rehearing is unlikely to be successful due to the pr esentation of improved arguments or the fact that the court was closely divided in reaching decision12 this principle generally adheres even in instances where change in the composition of the court makes change in the outcome likely largely due to the operation of rule 441 which provides that petition for rehearing will not be granted except by ma jority of the court at the instance of justice who concurred in the judgment or d ecision thus apart from instances where the full bench is able to rehear case originally decided by an equal division the court will grant petition for rehearing only in exceptional situations where the court itself has substantial doubts as to the correctness of wh at it has decided or where the unanticipated consequences of the courts decision are clearly explained only in the rehearing petition13 this dynamic seems attributable in turn to the fact that the court is more likely to order rehearing sua sponte prior to issuing decision on the merits in instances where the filling of vacancy or chan ge in the composition of the court has implications for the outcome of particular casehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22300crs4 14 the term reargument is often used intercha ngeably with the term rehearing however reargument generally refers to oral argument before the court while rehearing also encompasses requests for written briefs and submissions to questions from the court see rosemary krimbel rehearing sua sponte in the us supreme

prac tice has been for the incoming justice not to participate in the consideration of whether or not to order reargument but to take part in the consideration and judgment of cas subsequent to such an order id 18 see the supreme court 1969 term 84 harv l rev 247 n1 1970 19 see the supreme court 1970 term 85 harv l rev 344 1971 20 idreargument sua sponte while not mentioned in rule or statute the court possesses inherent authority to order the reargument of case14 such orders may be issued as result of the courts identification of additional issu for consideration or termination that more time is needed to resolve the questions that have been presented15 the court may also order reargument in instances where it is equally divided as noted bove the supreme court has traditionally followed the principle that affirmative action can be had in cause where the judges are equally divided in opinion as to the judgment to be rendered or order to be made16 thus in instances where an equal division occurs due to the recusal or unavailability of justice or by virtue of vacancy the court may hold case for reargument this practice is particularly prev alent when the installment of new justice makes majority decision possible17 supreme court practice in this context is especially pertinent in light of justice oconnors announcement that she will retire upon the confirmation of her successor additionally the potential that justice oconnor will sit for only part of the term raises rela ted questions regarding how and under what circumstances her vote will be counted in th disposition of cases before the court an example of court practice in this c ontext may be found in actions taken during the supreme courts terms in 1969 and 1970 s upreme court justice abe fortas resigned abruptly and amidst scanda l on may 19 1969 the vacancy created by his resignation was not filled until over one year later when the oath of office was administered to harry blackmun on june 9 197018 in the absence of ninth justice for its entire 1969 term the court avoided reaching the merits in several controversial cases through an extraordinary number of jurisdictional or justiciability holdings19 additionally the court rescheduled an inordinate number of cases for reargument during the 1970 term20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22300crs5 21 id 22 see crs report rl31989

paradox 93 mich l rev 1433 1445 1995 citing david j continuedin all the court heard reargument in seventeen presumably deadlocked cases from the 1969 term upon the installment of justice blackmun in 197021 similar approach seems to have been followed with the installment of justice anthony m kennedy on the court subseque nt to his confirmation on february 3 198822 justice lewis f powell had retired on june 26 1987 and justice kennedy was president ronald reagans third choice to fill the powell vacancy subsequent to the senates rejection of nominee robert h bork which was followed in turn by judge douglas h ginsburgs decision to withdraw his name fro m consideration prior to actually being nominated23 consequently the court operated with only eight justices for the first several months of its 1987 term according to former solicitor ge neral walter dellinger in most instances where there was an equal division over cases argued during this period the court simply listed the cases for reargument so that justice kennedy could cast the deciding vote24 likewise it would appear that the installment of justice clarence thomas on the court resulted in orders for reargument justice thomas replaced justice thurgood marshall who had retired on october 1 1991 leaving the court with eight members until justice thomas took his seat on october 23 199125 subsequently the court ordered reargument in three cases th at were originally heard during the period between justice marshalls retirement and the seating of justice thomas it has been speculated that at least one of these cases was reargued due to an equal division among the justices26 it should be noted that it is not unpreceden ted for the court to order reargument in the event of the installment of new justices even when there is not an equal division between the sitting members subsequent to the retirement of justice hugo black and justice john marshall harlan ii shortly before the start of the 1971 term the courts remaining seven members heard oral argument in roe v wade and doe v bolton 27 after the confirmation of justices powell and william h rehnquist chief justice burger led an effort to have the cases reargued so the two new justices could participate in the decision28 justice blackmun concurred stating that i believe on an issue so sensitivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22300crs6 28 continued garrow

joined the majority and so emotional as this one the country serves the conclusion of nineman not sevenman court29 the court heard reargument in both cases on october 11 1972 ultimately issuing 72 decision in favor of abortion rights30 the decision to order reargument in theses cases indicates that the court may use its inherent authority in this context to allow new justices to participate in cases of special import or significance in addition to the more common practice of orde ring reargument to enable the breaking of deadlock conclusion in light of the aforementioned statutes rules and precedents it would appear that the supreme court possesses significant authority and discretion in termining whether case merits reargument indeed as illustra ted above the court may respond not only to formal petition for rehearing but may also exercise its inherent authority to order reargument under wide variet of circumstances including change in the composition of the court applying prior court practice to the pending retirement of justice oconnor the governing principles identif ied above appear to establis h that her vote will be counted in any case where judgment is issued while she remains on the bench conversely if decision in any case on which justice oconnor voted has not been issued prior to her retirement her vote will not be counted with the subsequen tly issued decision resting upon the majority vote of the remaining justices finally in the event of an equal division among the remaining justices in case argu ed prior to but handed down after justice oconnors retirement the court may order the case to be reargued with the newly installed justice participating
