l ron hubbard basics books and lectures better understanding of yourself leads to being more cause i think reading dianetics was the best thing i could have done it was the missing piece to the puzzle for growing up in scientology i had never even read this basic book although i always wanted to i had little back off on it because people kept telling how difficult it was reading it with the new glossary and synopsis i was shocked to find out how simple it was and how quickly i could get through it before i read it i really had reality on dianetics and how it worked and therefore couldnt really explain it to anyone now i have thoroughly complete understanding of it and how it relates to scientology i had so many wins reading it from gaining better understanding of the mind and how it works to actually turning off recurring somatic just by figuring out what caused it better understanding of yourself leads to being more cause because you know why you do the things you do i am so grateful for the chance to get to study the newly updated dianetics it really was what i was looking for i realized so much about myself what are the things i dont like and that something can be done to put an end to them i feel like new person now i have the biggest relief after 30 years of study nightmare reading dianetics i realized that in the past i had thought that the book was very technical and i knew i did not get it but i had the basic principle i was in complete fog so i knew i was bad student it was even to the point i had trouble in my dianetics auditing i remember my auditors showing references over and over and i just could not get it now i have the biggest relief after 30 years of study nightmare now it is simple gee it is simple my relief is tremendous for the first time ever since ive been in scientology i have certainty that i am able to study actually understand something and apply it more doubt on whether i got it or not and this happened on dianetics page 17 2007 bridge publications inc all rights reserved click here for copyright and trademark information mailed from bridge publications 4751 fountain ave angeles ca 90029
