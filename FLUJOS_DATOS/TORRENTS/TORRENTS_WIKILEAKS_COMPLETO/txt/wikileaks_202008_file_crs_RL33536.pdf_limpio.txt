resolution cases against china in the wto including chinas failure to protect ipr and afford market access for iprrelated products discriminatory regulations on imported auto parts and import and export subsidies to various industries in china in addition the administration reversed longstanding policy that countervailing cases dealing with government subsidies could not be brought against nonmarket economies and has initiated several countervailing cases against china in response to growing concerns over the health safety and quality of certain chinese products the united states has attempted to boost cooperation with chinese health and safety agencies to improve chinas regulatory and enforcement regime further complicating the economic relationship is chinas large holdings of us debt such as treasury securities in september 2008 china surpassed japan to become the largest foreign holder of such securities on the one hand some analysts welcome chinas purchases of us debt

that us dependency on china for advanced technology products is rapidly increasing many analysts contend that the sharp increase in us imports from china is largely the result of movement in production facilities from other primarily asian countries to china9 that is various products that used to be made in japan taiwan hong kong etc and then exported to the united states are now being made in china in many cases by foreign firms in china and exported to the united states an illustration of this shift can be seen in table 6 on us imports of computer equipment and parts from 20002007 in 2000 japan was the largest foreign supplier of us computer equipment with 196 share of total shipments while china ranked 4 th with 121 share in just seven years japans ranking fell to 4th the

imports while us imports of computer equipment from china rose by 436 over the past seven years the total value of us computer imports from the world rose by only 26 many analysts contend that large

dollar in order to compete with chinese products they further note that while china is still developing country it has been able to accumulate massive foreign exchange reserves estimated to have

the united states has pressed china to improve its ipr protection regime since the late 1980s in 1991 the united states under section 301 case threatened to impose 15 billion in trade sanctions against china if it failed to strengthen its ipr laws although china later implemented number of new ipr laws it often failed to enforce them which led the united states to once again threaten china with trade sanctions the two sides reached trade agreement in 1995 which pledged china to take immediate steps to stem ipr piracy by cracking down on largescale producers and distributors of pirated materials and prohibiting the export of pirated products establishing mechanisms to ensure longterm enforcement of ipr laws and providing greater market access to us iprrelated products under the terms of chinas wto accession see above china agreed to immediately bring its ipr laws in compliance with the trips agreement the us trade representatives ustr office has stated on number of occasions that china has made great strides in improving its ipr protection regime noting that it has passed several new iprrelated laws closed or fined several assembly operations for illegal production lines seized millions of illegal audiovisual products curtailed exports of pirated products expanded training of judges and law enforcement officials on ipr protection and expanded legitimate licens ing of

steps to halt movie and internet piracy it also pledged to improve government coordination of enforcement efforts and to ensure the use by all levels of the chinese government including stateowned firms of legitimate software products in addition the chinese government agreed to delay implementing proposed regulations restricting government purchases of foreign made software on october 26 2005 the united states initiated special process under wto rules to obtain detailed information on chinas ipr enforcement efforts however on december 22 2005 china responded by challenging the legal basis

of ten movie dvds are fake and 2005 losses from piracy in china were an estimated 244 million 38 major causes of the high piracy levels in china are attributed to be the chinese governments tight restrictions on the number of foreign movies allowed to be imported 20 per year extensive periods of government review and censure requirements before foreign movie can be legitimately shown tight limits on distribution of films by foreign companies and government pressure on movie houses to show only chinesemade movies 33 press release available at httpwwwmpaaorgpressreleasesasp 34 new york

high piracy rates in china estimated by iipa at 90 in 2007 trade and investment barriers on legitimate products and largescale exports of pirated music cds by illegal chinese firms piracy of music and recordings is estimated to have cost us firms 451 million in 200739 pirated music music videos and movies are also widely distributed over the internet in china40 the chinese government estimates that counterfeits constitute between 15 and 20 of all products made in china and are equivalent to about 8 of chinas annual gross domestic product study by the motion picture association of america estimated that chinas domestic film industry lost about 15 billion in revenue to piracy in 2005 and that the combined losses of both foreign and chinese film makers totaled 27 billion41 it also found that about half of pirated films in china are chinese movies the chinese government estimates that 500 million pirated books are produced each year42 opinions differ as to why the chinese government has been unable make significant reduction in the level of piracy in china some explanations put forward by various analysts include the following chinas transformation from sovietstyle command economy in which the government owned and controlled nearly every aspect of the economic life to one that is becoming more marketbased is very recent occurrence ipr is relatively alien or unfamiliar concept for most people in china to grasp as is the concept of private property rights and thus it is difficult for the government to convince the public that piracy is wrong43 chinese leaders want to make china major producer of capitalintensive and hightechnology products and thus they are tolerant of ipr piracy if its helps chinese firms become more technologically advanced44 although the central government may be fully committed to protection of ipr local government officials are often less enthusiastic to do so because production of pirated products generates jobs and tax revenue and some officials may be obtaining bribes or other benefits which prompts them to tolerate piracy 39 the international federation of the phonographic industry ifpi estimates that more than 350 million illegal discs were sold in china in 2005 40 ipr piracy has become so prevalent in china that it has produced number of humorous quips such as if you did not see fake dvd you were not in china and in

lacks the resources and sophisticated legal system to go after and punish ipr violators and that establishing an effective enforcement regime will take time45 as practical matter ipr enforcement in china will always be problematic until chineseowned companies begin to put pressure on the government to protect their own brands and other iprrelated products chinese trade barriers and regulatory restrictions on iprrelated products and their distribution are so onerous that they prevent legitimate products from entering the market or raise costs so high that they are unaffordable to the average individual thus creating huge demand for lowcost pirated products

officials were reportedly on the verge of filing wto dispute resolution case against china in the fall of 2006 over its inadequate ipr enforcement but were convinced by the chinese government to give them more time to implement new ipr enforcement policies in addition us officials indicated that they were are in the process of building wto case on ipr that would also include chinese trade barriers to iprre lated products which is seen as major factor in the high piracy rates in china 46 despite various efforts on the part of the chinese government to improve ipr enforcement the ustr decided to file two wto cases against china on april 10 200747 the us wto cases on chinas ipr regime represent the most comprehensive and complex cases the united states has filed against any wto to date most wto cases involve specific restrictions on specific products however these two cases challenge broad range of chinas ipr policies and could potentially lead the wto to authorize the united states to impose significant level of sanctions against china48 specifically the us wto complaints against chinas ipr regime involve the following issues49 the thresholds for criminal prosecutions of ipr violations are too high meaning the government will only pursue cases it considers to be serious or excessively large creating safe harbor for smaller producers or violators in addition the thresholds for prosecuting ipr violations are based on the value of the pirated products rather than the value such legitimate products would fetch in the marketplace such thresholds make it very difficult to pursue cases against many commercial producers of illegal iprrelated products 45 some critics of this argument note that china seems to be very efficient at going after political dissenters and others deemed to be threats to social stability 46 inside us trade february 21 2007 47 for example the chinese government claimed it seized 73 million pirated products in 2006 made improvements to its legal system and increased prosecutions and that it developed national comprehensive strategy to deal with piracy 48 if the cases go to wto dispute resolution panel and that panel ruled in favor of the united states the panel would seek to estimate that level of trade losse s suffered by the united states due to chinas failure to enforce its ipr laws or to provide market access to iprrelated products this figure could potentially be over billion dollars based on us industry estimates of trade losse s from ipr piracy in china 49 see ustr april 9 2007 press release and related documents at

market rather than disposing of them chinas copyright laws fail to protect imported works such as movies that are under review by chinese censorship authorities and must be approved before the works can be distributed in china as result pirated copies of the works can be widely distributed without violating copyright law and thus do not face prosecution chinese ipr laws do not appear to allow producers of pirated products to be prosecuted unless they also illegally distribute such products china has not abided by its 2001 wto accession agreement to liberalize its rules on trading rights and distribution services as result us iprrelated products face significant trade barriers in china and such barriers are major factor for causing the high rate of piracy in china the ustrs 2008 special 301 report issued on april 25 2008 stated that its top ipr protection and enforcement priorities were china along with russia the report stated that despite progress in many areas the level of piracy in china remained unacceptably high with piracy of us ipr related products at 85 to 95

trade policies contend that the chinese government provides significant level of subsidies to many of its industries such as preferential bank loans and grants debt forgiveness and tax breaks and rebates 51 in addition some analysts charge that chinas currency policy constitutes form of government export subsidy52 such critics contend that us countervailing laws which seek to address the negative impact foreign government subsides on exported products may have on us producers in the united states should be applied to nonmarket economies such as china53 until very recently the commerce department contended that us countervailing laws could not be applied to nonmarket economy because of the assumption that most production and prices in such an economy are determined by the government and thus it would be impractical to determine the level of government subsidy that might be conveyed to various exported products however in november 2006 the commerce department decided to pursue countervailing case against certain imported chinese coated free sheet paper products on march 30 2007 the commerce department issued preliminary ruling to impose countervailing duties ranging from 11 to 20 against the products in question commerce contends that while china was still nonmarket economy for the purposes of us trade laws economic reforms in china have made 50 for additional
