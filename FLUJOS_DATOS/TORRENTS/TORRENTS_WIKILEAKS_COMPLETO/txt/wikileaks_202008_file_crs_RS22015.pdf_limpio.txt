representatives generally grant members an opportunity to review legislative measures by governing the length of time they must be made available before being considered on the floor different house rules establish availability requirements for reported bills and resolutions conference committee reports and special rules resolutions reported by the rules committee intended to regulate floor consideration of measure named in the resolution

matters reported by committees may not be considered on the house floor until the committee report on the matter has been available to members for at least three calendar days excluding weekends and legal holidays unless the house is in session on such days the house rule exempts several kinds of measures spec ified in the rule including resolutions reported by the rules committee1 g5g152g151g143g142g155g142g151g140g142g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g156g561g507g20g158g149g142g561g26g26g11g11g496g561g140g149g138g158g156g142g561g350g507g138g508g508g561 the house rule requires that before conference report can be considered its text and its accompanying joint explanatory statement must be available in the congressional record for three calendar days excluding weekends and legal holidays unless the house is in session on such days in addition copies of conference report and the joint explanatory statement must be available for at least two hours prior to its consideration according to the rule this threeday availability requirement does not apply during the last six days of session in contemporary practice however it is difficult to implement this exception to the rule adjournment resolutions usually are not approved until very shortly before the adjournment takes place this practice usually makes it impossible to know when the last six days of session begin absent resolution setting future date for adjournment the threeday rule applies even as the house nears the end of session the threeday availability requirement for conference reports would cease to apply only in the last six calendar days before the constitutional end of session on january 3 2

or resolutions reported from the rules committee which can waive any or all of the above rules special rules are required to lie over for one legislative day which means the special rule cannot be reported and considered on the same legislative day legislative day is not necessarily calendar day legislative day begins the first time the house meets after an adjournment and ends when the house adjourns again 1 the threeday rule also does not apply to 1 resolution to fund committee operations reported by the committee on house administration 2 resolution presenting question of the privileges of the house reported by any committee 3 measure declaring war or national emergenc or 4 resolution of disapproval in addition according to section 305a1 of the congressional budget act budget resolution is subject to threeday layover requirement 2 william holmes brown and charles w johnson house practice guide to the rules precedents and procedures of the house washington gpo 2003

legislative and calendar days usually coincide rule xiii also provides several exceptions to the layover requirement for special rules first special rule may be considered the same day it is presented if it proposes only to waive the rules mandating that committee reports and conference reports be available for three days if the rule however in addition to waiving the availability requirement also sets the terms for the consideration of the matter perhaps by waiving points of order then the rule is required to lie over for one legislative day second special rule may be considered the same day it is presented to the house in the last three days of session in modern practice however as mentioned above the house rarely agrees to an adjournment date far in advance usually making it impossible to know when the last three days begin third the oneday layover requirement for specia l rules can be waived if twothirds of the members voting agree to the waiver quorum being present in addition as discussed below the rules committee may report special rule that waives the oneday layover requirement for subsequent special rules g25g138g146g159g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g3g159g138g146g149g138g139g146g149g146g157g162g561g20g142g154g158g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g156g561 the house has several means for waiving its rules when it wishes to act expeditiously the house for example may set aside any of its availability requirements by unanimous consent it may also call up and agree to bill or conference report that has not met the availability requirements by twothirds vote to suspend the rules 3 as previously mentioned according to rule xiii clause 6a1 the oneday layover requirement for special rule can be waived by twothirds of the members voting the house can also waive the availability requirements by simple majority if majority of the house desires to do so the house can vote on measure the same calendar day that the text was made available to members the house usually does this by agreeing to two special rules as explained below it may also achieve the same result by convening for two legislative days on the same calendar day in the manner also described below

rules committee may report special rule that waives the threeday availability requirement for bills resolutions or conference reports if the rule only waives the availability requirement then the report on the rule can be presented and called up on the same day special rules however often set the terms for considering measure as well special rule for the consideration of measure might waive the threeday availability requirement but also structure the amending process such rule would be required to lie over for one legislative day unless this requirement was waived by twothirds vote similarly rule for the consideration of conference report often waives points of order against the conference report and against its 3 for more information on suspension of the rules see crs report

required to lie over for one legislative day unless the requirement is waived by twothirds vote in short special rules that only waive the threeday availability requirement are not required to lie over for one legislative day to waive the oneday layover requirement of rule xiii clause 6a for special rule the rules committee may report special rule that waives this requirement the rule providing this waiver is subject to the same oneday layover requirement if such special rule is adopted the house can then consider and adopt special rule providing for the consideration of measure later on the same legislative day the special rule for the consideration of the measure can waive the threeday availability requirement for the measure in this way the house of representatives by majority vote has the potential to call up debate and pass measure in single day even if the measure has not been made available prior to consideration in order to achieve this result however the rules committee must have reported the additional special rule on the previous legislative day in summary simple majority of the house can call up debate and vote on measure in single calendar day regardless of how long the text has been available by taking the following steps first the house agrees to special rule waiving the oneday layover requirement for any special rule for the consideration of specified matter this rule is required to lie over for one legislative day second the house agrees to separate special rule setting the terms of consideration of the measure and waiving any availability requirements for the measure itself this rule need not lie over for one legislative day the first special rule waived the oneday layover requirement for this special rule third the house calls up debates and votes on the measure g5g155g142g138g157g146g151g144g561g138g561g16g142g160g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g6g138g162g561 although the house rarely chooses to do so it could agree to call up and consider measure in single calendar day by convening two legislative days in single calendar day4 it would do this by agreeing to motion to adjourn for brief period at some point during its session agreement to this motion would terminate the legislative day and when the house returned from its brief adjournment pursuant to this motion new legislative day would begin if the rules committee presents special rule before the house adjourns the rule can be considered on the next legislative day regardless of how much time has elapsed in other words if special rule were reported and the house adjourned and then shortly thereafter reconvened the special rule would have been available for one legislative day meeting the layover requirement of the standing rule the house could then consider the special rule that among other things could waive the threeday availability requirement for resolution bill or conference report5 4 house practice p 862 5 for example in the 107th congress rule hres 600 for the consideration of bill to establish the department of homeland security was presented and considered on different legislative days but the same calendar day the rules committee presented the special rule hres 600 for the cons ideration of the homeland security bill at 756 am on continued

uncommon for the rules committee to report several special rules at the end of session that waive the availability requirements for subsequent special rules for the consideration of certain specified measures in the past the house has also agreed to resolutions reported by the rules committee near the end of session that waived availability requirements in general special rules that waive availability requirements are sometimes referred to as same day rules they are also sometimes referred to particularly by their opponents as martial law rules the term has been used by members of the house for at least 15 years but it has not been applied consistently to any one type of special rule it has been used for example to describe both special rules that waive the oneday layover requirement for subsequent special rules6 and to describe broad special rules that trigger some provisions of house rules and waive others for the remaining duration of session 7 supporters of endofsession resolutions that waive availability requirements sometimes argue that these special rules are meant to achieve the sa end as the standing rules that make certain provisions of house rules inapplicable during the final days of the session as mentioned above the threeday availability requirement for conference reports does not apply in the last six days of session the oneday layover requirement for special rules does not apply in the last three days of session in recent years congress has not agreed to concurrent resolution setting an adjournment date until just before adjournment takes place as result these standing rules are not triggered in the contemporary house by agre eing to same day rule near the end of the session the house can achieve the same end as the existing but technically inapplicable standing rules that waive availability requirements at the end of session opponents of these endof session resolutions sometimes argue that all representatives should be guaranteed some time to examine legislative proposals regardless of when they are presented during the course of session continued the calendar day of nov 13 2002 and the legislative day of nov 12 2002 the house had not adjourned on nov 12 at the same time it also presented special rule hres 601 to waive the oneday layover requirement for any rule providing for consideration of the homeland security bill th house adjourned at 758 am on legislative day nov 12 and met again on legislative and calendar day nov 13 2002 at 10 am the house considered and passed hres 600 that afternoon
