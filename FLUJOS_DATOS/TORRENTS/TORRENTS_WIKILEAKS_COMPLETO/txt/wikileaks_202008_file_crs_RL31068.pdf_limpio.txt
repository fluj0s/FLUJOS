budget enforcement procedures in past years federal budget policie s have been enforced under two major statutes the congressional budget ac t of 1974 and the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 19855 budget enforcement procedures under the 1974 congressional budget act are for th most part permanent and ongoing whereas the key budget enforcement proce dures under the 1985 balanced budget act effectively expired in late 20026 while several efforts have been made to extend the procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act they have not been successfulhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31068crs3 7 for more information on points of order under the 1974 act see crs report 97865 points of order in the congressional budget process by james v saturno 8 more detailed explanation of sequest ration is presented in crs report rl31137 sequestration procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act by robert keith congressional budget act of 1974 the 1974 c ongressional budget act title iix of pl 93344 as amended provides for the adoption by congress of an annual concurrent resolution on the budget the budget resolution recommends the total level of reve nues spending the surplus or deficit and the public debt for each year covering at least fiveyear period spending for each fiscal year is distributed among the functional categories of the budget such as national defense ag riculture and transportation in addition total spending is allocated to each of the house and senate committees with jurisdiction over discretionary or di rect spending the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide their spending allocations by subcommittee if the house and senate wish to compel their committees to develop legislation conforming existing revenue di rect spending or debt limit law to budget resolution policies they may include reconciliation directives in the budget resolution so instructing the appropria committees reconciliati on submission s from committees usually are consolidated into an omnibus bill that is considered under expedited procedures enforcement of budget resolution policie s occurs as individual revenue and spending measures including any required reconciliation legisla tion are considered points of order establishe d in different provisions of the 1974 congressional budget act allow members to object to legisla tion that would violate budget resolution policies unless the points of or der are waived or set aside7 balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 the 1985 balanced budget act title ii of pl 99177 as amended by the budget enforcement act of 1990 and other laws established adjustable limits on discretionary spending and subjected direct spending and revenue legislation to payasyougo paygo requirement under the paygo requirement direct spending and revenue legislation enacted for fiscal year could not in the net incur deficit on multiyear paygo scorecard the discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement were enforced by sequestration procedure involving larg ely acrosstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt programs8 sequestration was triggered shortly after the end of congressional session if the di rector of the office of management and budget omb estimated in sequestration report that one or more of the discretionary spending categories would be breached or the paygo requirement would be violated section 254 of the 1985 balanced budget act require d the president to issue sequestration order carrying out any spending reductions identified by the omb director as being necessary to eliminate spending limit breach or paygo violationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31068crs4 9 the current section originated as section 254 of the 1985 act 99 stat 10781080 and was renumbered and modified by section 13101 f of the budget enforcement act of 1990 104 stat 1388593 through 595 it is codified at 2 usc 907a in its original form the section also provided for the suspension of poi ntoforder provisions in section 301i and 304b of the 1974 act however these pointoforder provisions later were dropped from the 1974 act and the reference to them in the suspension procedures was dropped as wellsuspension of procedures budget enforcement procedures under the 1974 and 1985 acts generally have tended over the years to restrict the consid eration of legislation that would create or worsen deficit in times of economic downturn such as recession or low growth the federal government may wish to pursue stimulative fiscal policy entailing increases in spending or reductions in revenue some antirecessionary features of the federal budget are automatic due to the design of permanent laws eg spending for unemployment compensation and welfare benefits ri and payroll tax revenues fall as workers lose their jobs but congress may choose to augment these features by enacting legislation to further increase spending or cut taxes the suspension procedures discussed here are intended to allow congress to set aside in single action key procedural roadblocks that could st ymie the quick enactment of spending and revenue legisl ation needed to deal with serious economic downturn five budget enforcement procedures in the 1974 and 1985 acts were subject to suspension due to low economic growth see table 1 suspension would have occurred upon the issuance of lowgrowth report by cbo and the subsequent enactment into law of suspension reso lution pursuant to section 258 of the 1985 balanced budget act9 section 258a provided for the development and consideration of suspension resolution section 258b indicated the specific budget enforcement procedures suspended upon th enactment of suspension resolution and section 258c provided for the restoration of the procedures four of the mechanisms involved point s of order under the congressional budget process against legislation that violated 1 the spending ceilings or revenue floors in the budget resolution and in the senate onl social security surpluses or deficits 2 committee allocations and subdivisions of spending made under the budget resolution 3 deficitneutral requirement for amendments offered to reconciliation bills and 4 in the senate only the di scretionary spending limits established under statute these four pointoforder pr ovisions form the core of substantive enforcement of the budget resolution nonetheless there are many other points of order established under the 1974 act and their opera tion is unaffected by determination of low economic growth some of these points of order pertain to timing or jurisdictional issues eg section 303a bars the consideration of spending or revenue legislation for fiscal year until th budget resolution for th at fiscal year has been adopted and section 306 bars the cons ideration of legislation changing the budget process unless it has been repor ted or discharged from the budget committee but some also deal with substantive enforcement issues in additionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31068crs5 budget enforcement procedures such as the senates paygo rule may be included in annual budget resolutions the fifth procedural mechanism subject to suspension during period of low economic growth was the questration process under the 1985 balanced budget act which enforced the discretionary spending limits and the statutory paygo requirement table 1 budget enforcement mechanisms subject to suspension due to low economic growth requirement source 1 cost of legislation may not exceed committee allocations and subdivisi ons of spending under the budget resolutionsection 302f of the 1974 congressional budget act 2 amendments to reconciliation measures must be deficitneutralsection 310d of the 1974 congressional budget act 3 cost of legislation may not violate spending ceilings or revenue floors in the budget resolution and in the senate only social security surpluses or deficitssection 311a of the 1974 congressional budget act 4 cost of legislation in the senate only may not exceed the discretionary spending limits established under statutesection 312b of the 1974 congressional budget act 5 presidential sequestration order providing for largely acrosstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt programs must be issued if annual appropriations exceed the statutory limits on discretionary spending or the net effect of direct spending and re venue legislation enacted for the fiscal year leads to deficit on the paygo scorecardsection 254 of the 1985 balanced budget act cbo lowgrowth report under section 258 of the 1985 bala nced budget act the responsibility for notifying congress of actua l or estimated low economic growth rested with cbo specifically cbo was required to inform congress if actual real economic growth was less than 1 or estimate d real economic growth was projected to be negativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31068crs6 10 section 258 mistakenly referred to cbo lowgrowth report issued under section 254j of the 1985 act not section 254 i section 254j formerly dealt with cbo lowgrowth reports but section 10206 of the b udget enforcement act of 1997 111 stat 704 renumbered the paragraphs in section 254 without also changing the reference in section 258 to be consistent the revised section 254j dealt with ombs use of ec onomic and technical assumptions in sequestration reportsunder section 254 i10 of the 1985 balanced budget act cbo was required to notify congress at any time if either of two situations occurred 1 cbo or omb estimated two consecutive quarters of real economic growth ie economic growth adjusted to remove the effects of inflation less than zero during the six quarter period consisting of the most recently completed quarter the current quarter and the four ensuing quarters or 2 the commerce department indicated in its advance preliminary or final reports of actual real economic growth that real economic growth was less than 1 for the most recently reported quarter and the quarter before that consequently any on of three different agencies could have prepared determinations of low economic growth but it was cbos responsibility alone to transmit that information to congress for purposes of triggering suspension resolution section 254 i was silent regarding the form of the cbo notification in the past it had taken the form of letter from the cbo director to the speaker of the house and the president of the senate the cbo lowgrowth report sometimes was inserted the into the congressional record by the senate majority leader upon his introduction of suspension resolution and sometimes has been printed as house document suspension resolution section 258a of the 1985 act set forth procedures for the development and consideration of suspension resolution the issuance of lowgrowth report by cbo triggered the introduction of suspension resolution the senate major ity leader was required to introduce the legislation but such action was optional for the house majority leader suspension resolution had to be drafted in accordance with the form prescribed in section 258a2 the box below provides an exampl of the text of suspension resolution upon its introduction by the majority leader suspension resolution was referred in the senate to the budget committee and in the house to the appropriate committees which presumably could have included the budget and rules committees the committees had to report the resolution to their respective houses within five days without amendment if committee did not report suspension resolution within five days it was automatically discharged and the resolution was placed on the appropriate calendarhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31068crs7 11 under senate precedents the chair would call for vote on the suspension resolution by midnight of the fifth day if the senate had not already taken this action this matter is discussed in us congress senate committee on the budget

as described in section 258b of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 in the senate vote on final passage of suspension resolution had to occur within five days of session after it had been reported or discharged11 the suspension resolution was considered to be privileged measure nd section 258a4 set forth several procedures to expe dite its consideration incl uding limitation of five hours for debate and bar agains t offering any amendments although section 258a did not provide any similar procedures to expedite floor consideration in the house the hous routinely employs special rules reported by the house rules committee or other devices to expedite the consideration of legislation the second house to act on suspension resolution was required at the time of the vote on final passage to consider the measure passed by the other body accordingly assuming that amendmen ts had been added passage of the suspension resolution by the second body woul d have caused it to be sent directly to the president for his approval w ithout the need for conference specific enforcement proce dures subject to suspension section 258 b of the 1985 act indicated the

cong ressional budget act provides for the allocation to committees of the aggregate spending levels in the budget resolution the house and senate appr opriations committees in turn subdivide their total spending allocations among their subcommittees this process allows the spending policies in the budget resoluti on to be enforced as individual bills particularly the annua l appropriations acts are cons idered section 302f generally prohibits the consideration of legislation that would violate committee spending allocation or subdivision sections 310d1 and 2 section 310 of the 1974 act sets forth budget reconciliation procedures under reconciliation budg et resolution may include directives to house and senate committees to recommend changes in direct spending and revenue laws in order to bring direct spending and revenue levels into conformity with budget resolution policies the r ecommendations of the instructed committees usually are incorporated into an omnibus reconciliation bill which is considered under expedited procedures sections 310d1 and 2 generally prohibit amendments to reconciliation measures considered in the house and senate respectively that ar not deficit neutral section 311a section 311a of the 1974 act generally prohibits the consideration of budgetary measures that w ould violate the aggregate levels in the budget resolution ie total budget author ity outlays and reve nues violations would occur if the legislation was expected to cause spending to exceed the ceilings or revenues to fall below the floors section 311a also prohibits in the senate only the consideration of legislation that would decrease social security surpluses or increase social security deficits relative to such levels as set forth in the budget resolution the house uses different forcement mechanism independent of the 1974 act to protect the soci security balances section 312b1 section 312b1 of the 1974 act provides for point of order in the senate against the consideration of any measure that would cause the discretionary spending limits establishe d under section 251 of the 1985 balanced budget act as adjusted to be exceeded comparable point of order in the sena was first established in law in 1990 as part of temporary title of the 1974 act title vi budget agreement enforcement provisions12 title vi was repealed by the budget enforcement act of 1997 but the senate pointoforder provisi on was incorporated into the 1974 act as section 312b113 section 258b in indicating the specifi c enforcement mech anisms that are suspended includes an outdate d reference to title vi of the 1974 act however when the senate point of order was dded to section 312 in 1997 provision for itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31068crs9 14 this provision is sometimes referred to as the byrd amendment after its sponsor senator harry f byrd jr of virginiasuspension upon the enactment of susp ension resolution under section 258 of the 1985 act was included as section 312b2 part c of the 1985 balanced budget act as stated previously the 1985 balanced budget act as amended by the budget enforcement act of 1990 and other laws established discreti onary spending limits and paygo requirement enforced by sequestration section 254 of the 1985 act required omb to issue sequestration reports at least three times year preview report in conjunction with the submission of the presidents budget early in the session an update report in august and final report within 15 days after congressional session ended cbo issued sequestration reports as well but they were advisory only any sequester under the discretionary spending limits the paygo requirement or both would have occurred shortly after the final omb report was issued in addition withinsession sequester under the discretionary spending limits could have been required during the following session but prior to july 1 if the enactment of supplemental appropriations measure caused violation of the discretionary spending limits section 258b would have precluded the subsequent issuance of any sequestration report or any sequestration or der for example if suspension resolution were enacted in late in year eg 2001 but before the end of the congressional session the issuance of om bs final sequestration report for the pertinent fiscal year eg fy2002 would have been prevented and sequester for that year could have occurred similarly there would have been sequestration reports or sequester for the following fi scal year eg fy2003 the enactment of suspension resolution would not however have canceled sequestration order that already had been issued 31 usc 1103 section 258b also would ve suspended another provision of law 31 usc 1103 which generally states congresss commitment to the goal of avoiding deficits14 however this reference probably is mistaken another provision of title 31 31 usc 1105f required the presidents annual budget submission to comply with the deficit targets established in the 1985 balanced budget act this requirement was terminated several years later when the use of deficit targets was abandoned presumably the drafters of section 258b had intended to refer to sec tion 1105f not sec tion 1103 in any event section 1103 does not contain any enforcement mech anism merely policy exhortation restoration of enfo rcement procedures section 258c of the 1985 balanced budg et act provided for the restoration of budget enforcement procedures following period of suspension under the section enforcement procedures were restored automa tically for the first fiscal year beginning at least 12 months after the enactment of suspension resolution using the previous example if suspension resolution were enacted in late 2001 but before the end of the

onciliation act of 1990 reached only three months earlier further they pointed out that many economists expected the recession to be mild and over by midyear even without any legislative action by congress if necessary they maintained fiscally stimulative legislation could be accommodated by designating spending in creases or revenue reductions to be emergency requirements thus exempting them from enforcement procedures additionally they pointed to the need to avoid actions that could cause further uncertainty regarding the economy while th united states was engaged in hostilities with

sasser and ranking member domenici of the budget committee spoke against passage of the suspension resolution although the recession had persisted for months they stated its depth had adhere d to recent projections which showed the recession coming to an end in the near term several senators dissented from this view arguing in particular that spending needed to be increased sharply for extended unemployment benefits and other emerging priorities chairman sasser maintained that the emergency designation featur of the budget enforcement procedures allowed the necessary flexibility to provide spending increases for high priority items without abandoning budget discipline altogether when we crafted the budget law we understood the limitations of the suspension mechanism suspension w ould be only last resort and we understood that there had to be an interi m remedy between the extremes there had to be remedy between absolute chaos if we suspend and absolute immobility if nothing is done in time of economic distress and the interim remedy that was fashioned was called emergency designation safety valve if you w ill designed for onetime spending to alleviate sudden and

daily report for executives 217 tuesday november 13 2001 page g1 29 the cbo lowgrowth report was printed as hdoc 107144 february 4 2002commented on the need to enact legisla tion stimulating the weakened economy and responding to the terrorist attacks of ptember 11 2001 but argued that longterm fiscal discipline should not be undermined in acting on such measures he stated the suspension resolution would have us decide now in one fell swoop whether to suspend budget enforcement for the next 2 years i think it is very important that everybody understand what would happen if we went against the recommendation of the budget committee and threw out these budget procedures there would be protections special pr otections for fiscal discipline for the next 2 years i think such blanket waiver would be most unwise we will be much better off if we continue to look at each bill and amendment individually and retain the abi lity to invoke budget enforcement procedures against those that thr eaten our longterm fiscal discipline this is fundamental way we protect the integrity of the trust funds of social security and medicare for the long term26 senator phil gramm spoke in favor of not suspending budget enforcement procedures arguing that they were needed to thwart pending efforts to spend more than the 40 billion in emergency spending that congress had agreed to in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks there seems now to be mad rush to force feed the president into spending money27 representative jim nussle chairman of the house budget committee recommended in letter to house majority leader richard armey that the house not consider suspension resolution he wrote i believe the congress should avail itself of other tools to permit the consideration of the stimulus package and other terroristrelated legislation under existing law the congress can ffectively exempt legislation from budget controls by designating it as an emergency it can also selectively waive components of the budget resolution to permit consideration of specific bills28 the house did not consider suspension resolution in connection with the fourth cbo lowgrowth report sjres 31 107th

committee inserted brief statement into the congressional record in the statement he cited recent indicators of an increasingly positive economic outlook bipartisan interest in ma intaining budget enforcement procedures and the flexibility to waive the procedures when necessary as reasons to reject the suspension resolution the tools of fiscal discipline must be contained so we can convey to the american public and the markets that we are keeping an eye not only on the current challenges we face but so those longer term challenges we must maintain the provisions of the budget act that provide us with that future discipline and we must deal with both tax and spending legislation today while waiving the budget act on case by case basis as needed31
