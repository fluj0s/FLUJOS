reform how much of role could personal retirement accounts play summary numerous proposals have called for cr eation of personal retirement accounts to replace or supplement the benefits of future social security recipients some are based on the belief that better way to pr ovide retirement income would be to have workers accumulate assets directly others are designed to offset social security benefit cuts that might be made to restore the system to sound financial footing much of the debate is fueled by the pe rception that per dollar of contributions personal accounts invested in the private sector would exceed the value of future social security benefits particularly since those benefits will likely need to be curtailed as social securitys future costs rise opponents argue that personal accounts will place many individuals at risk because they might make unwise investment decisions the timing of their acquisitions and liquidations may be unfortunate or they may spend what they otherwise should save they also contend th at the rates of return on stocks are likely to be lower in the future to compensate for the runup in the stock market over the past two decades that were characterized by priceearnings ratios that were far higher than their historical average given these contrasting assertions ther is considerable confusion over how to evaluate the possible role of personal accounts in reforming social security critical part of the debate is how much personal account coul d provide relative to future social security benefits this report provides illustrations by projecting potential personal account assets at the time of retirement and comparing them to projected lifetime social secur ity benefits under current law because any investment be nefits from compound growth over many years the illustrations show that even under the more optimistic of the two investment scenarios 10 annual return older wo rkers ie the baby boom would not have enough time to build large accounts relative to their social security benefits for workers who retire at age 62 in 2010 those with average earnings who set aside 2 of pay beginning in 2003 would have an acc ount equal to only 3 of their benefits age62 workers retiring in 2020 would ve built only modest accounts equaling 13 of their benefits thus the more rapid the phasein to constrained or alternative social security system the more difficult it would be for many baby boomers to make up for foregone social security benefits the accounts become more significant th longer the period of time in which to grow for workers retiring at age 62 in 2030 2 of pay contribution rate earning 10 could reach level equal to 29 of an averagewage earners social security benefits with return matching the govern ment bond rate assumed to be 609 annually 2 contribution rate c ould grow to level equal to 16 of benefits for aged 62 workers retiring in 2050 having 41 years to invest the accounts would become substantial 2 contribution rate growing at 609 would reach level equal to 24 of social secu rity benefits 10 annual return would produce an account equal to 55 of social security

2under the social security trustees 2002 intermed iate forecast social security is projected to have an average 75year deficit equal to 187 of taxable payroll under current law this amount is equal to about 14 of the average inco of the system over the period in terms of todays taxable payroll this would be equivalent to 80 billion per year crs1social security reform how much of role could personal retirement accounts play1 introduction in response to repeated reports that th social security system has longrange funding problems2 and growing public skepticism about whether the system can be sustained in its current form numerous proposals have called for the creation of personal retirement savings acc ounts to replace or supplement the benefits of future social security recipients among the proposals are ones suggested by presidents clinton and george w bush also all three options proposed by president bushs commission to strengthen social s ecurity feature individual accounts the social security taxes workers pay flow into the governments general treasury and are recorded as income to the social security trust funds they are not accredited to individual taxpayers to accumulate and later be used to pay for the individuals benefits instead most of th social security taxes paid by current workers pay for the benefits of current retirees and future workers will pay for the benefits of future retirees some pr oponents of establishi ng personal accounts believe that better way for workers to secure their retirement income would be to have them accumulate assets through inve stment of their individual contributions others propose personal accounts as way to ffset cuts in social security benefits that might be made in or der to restore the system to sound financial footing much of the support for creating persona l accounts is fueled by the perception that per dollar of contributions their accumulated assets would exceed the value of future social security benefits particularly if future social security benefits are curtailed as the financing demands of paying benefits to future retirees rise the pressure will grow on future congresses to consider s caling them back proponents of creating personal accounts argue that ch accounts would establish contractually binding claims for future retirees ie not alterable by congress and that the stock market potentially could bring much greater returns than are possible from the current social security systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98195crs2 3this report examines the role of personal accounts on retirement benefits not on survivor or disability benefits while number of recent proposals would create personal accounts to replace or supplement all forms of social security benefits others are directed exclusively toward the systems retirement bene fits the nature of the systems protections vary receipt of retirement benefits is viewed as something for which people plan and save for whereas disability and survivor protection is viewed as an unforeseen event for which people can buy insurance it has been posited that private insurance could provide these social security protections but that would raise other policy and operational questionsopponents of personal account s say that the past performance of the stock market is unlikely to be repeated in the fu ture they contend that the rate of return on stocks may be lower in the future to compensate for the runup in the stock market over the past two decades that was characterized by priceearnings ratios far higher than in the past return to historical averages in priceearnings ratios would require period of downward adjustment in the market during which there could be less favorable results for personal account s moreover they argue that many individuals will make unwise investment decisions the timing of their acquisitions and liquidations may be bad and they may exhaust their accounts prematurely they argue that social security is better mech anism to assure workers future retirement income and to minimize old age dependency for society as whole the aim of this report is not to prom ote or dismiss the concept of personal savings accounts rather its purpose is to illustrate potential accumulations in personal savings accounts using two different rates of return that span the range of likely future returns on investments and thus to provide tool that could be used to evaluate the possible role of personal acc ounts these illustrations do not simulate the effect of any single idea or bill they simply address the question if personal accounts are part of social security reform plan what range of retirement benefits3 might one expect to receive from them how would personal accounts be funded perhaps the most significant policy question about establishing personal accounts is how they would be financed so far three generic approaches have been suggested 1 diverting or carving out portion of existing social security taxes 2 adding on to the social security pr ogram by requiring workers to contribute portion of their earnings or 3 adding on by using fede ral general revenues the carve out approach 124 of workers first 84900 in annual earnings in 2002 is paid in taxes by employees and employers 62 by each to finance the social security system in recent years most proposals that create personal accounts require or llow workers to use part of these taxes to do so although he has not as yet proposed or ndorsed specific plan president bush has stated that he favors allowing workers to choose on voluntary basis to divert part of their payroll taxes into personal acc ounts in 2001 he appointed commission to recommend ways to restore social securitys longrange solvency all of the commissions members were on record as favoring some sort of personal accounts as part of social security reform th eir report issued in december 2001 featuredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98195crs3 4an immediate and permanent carve out of 2 of earnings for example would more than double the size of the longrange deficit 5this add on approach was part of the socalled individual accounts or ia plan sponsored by advisory council chairman ed ward gramlich and member marc twinney the plan included other measures to raise the income of the social security system and reduce its expenditures the intent was to gi ve recipients combination of benefits from constrained social security program and individual accounts approximately equal to what they would receive from social security under the benefit rules of current lawthree reform alternatives all of whic h included voluntary personal accounts two of the plans featured diversions of payr oll taxes this approach also has been reflected in number of bills introduced in the 105th 106th and 107th congresses with deposits in personal accounts rangin g from 10 to 124 percentage points obviously if it is projected that the taxes that finance the system are insufficient to pay for future promised benefits dive rting part of them to fund personal accounts would make this shortfall larger4 thus to restore the systems solvency would require larger future tax increases or be nefit reductions some proposals address this issue by placing larger reductions in so cial security benefits on workers who participate in personal accounts the goal of these proposals is not to make the current systems problems worse but to replace it in part or in whole with these measures the key problem is financing th existing social security program during the transition to the new system the larger the amount of foregone tax revenues the less money there is to meet current expenditures the commitments to people currently receiving benefits or nearing retirement would have to be met so to some extent the amount of the potential tax carve out is constrained at least in the early years of such proposal by the need to keep the existing system going add on by withholding more from earnings some have suggested that instead of diverting social security ta xes to fund personal accounts they could be funded by allowing or requiring todays wo rkers to set aside an additional part of their earnings one faction of the 19941996 social security advisory council suggested that workers pay an additi onal 16 of pay to fund personal accounts5 the goal was not to replace the existing system but to offset with private assets some of the benefit reductions needed to restore its solvency the third alternative plan of the bush commission combines both the car ve out and additional withholding from earnings approaches under this plan wo rkers would be allowed to contribute an additional 1 of their pay to pers onal retirement account and receive 25 matching contribution up to 1000 annually from their payroll taxes add on by using general revenues third possibility would be to have the government use general reve nues to make deposits into new personal accounts this approach would be neither tax carve out nor an additional amount of withholding from wages instead it would be contin gent upon diverting budget resources from other purposes ie new spending initiatives tax cuts or debt reduction such an approach was proposed by president clint on in his 1999 state of the union address in which he suggested the creation of u niversal savings accounts it is also reflected in some bills introduced in recent congresseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98195crs4 6fica refers to the federal insurance contri butions act the current fica tax rate is 765 62 for social security and 145 for medicares hospital insurance program for wage or salaried workers having earning s up to 84900 in 2002 3 addon would raise the total employee deduction to 1065 of pay an increase of 392 3765 392this report does not make an assumptions about what the source of funding for personal savings accounts would be it simply shows how much might be accumulated for retirement in personal accounts and represents this value as percent of the projected lifetime value of soci security benefits under current law it should be kept in mind that under the social security trus tees latest best guess assumptions ie their intermediate forecast the systems benefits would not be payable in future decades at the levels prescribed by current law under the trustees assumptions which underpin the anal ysis of this report the trust funds are projected to be depleted in 2041 ongoing tax receipts at that point would be sufficient to finance only 73 of benefit commitments hence the social security benefits projected in this report should be seen only as baseline for the analysis they are hypothetical in 2041 and thereaf ter because the system would not have sufficient resources to pay them in full factors determining the value of the personal account the eventual value savings account pends on 1 amounts deposited 2 the length of time the account grows and 3 the rate of return the account earns amounts deposited as mentioned earlier proposals th at feature personal accounts specify contribution rates ranging from 1 to 124 of pay illustrating the effect of all these rates would lead to voluminous arra of outcomes however for couple of reasons it could be posited that the upper range of contribution rates is unlikely first more than 8 out of 10 in social security taxes are currently needed to pay social security benefits these taxes are expected to exceed expenditures for only 15 more years even if benefit cuts were enacted to enhance these surpluses they probably would have to be pha sed in slowly as result there would not be large amount of surplus social security revenue to divert for carve out plans second if payroll withholding were increased it is not clear how acceptable it would be to the public hike in mandatory withholding of 3 of pay would be the equivalent of nearly 40 increase in fica withholding6 in addition proposed mandatory increase in withholding might be viewed and criticized as simply new taxation scheme given these circumstances for illustr ative purposes this report uses contribution rate ranging from 1 to 3 of pay the effect of larger contribution rates can be calculated by multiplying the result from 1 contribution rate by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98195crs5 7for future years the minimum wage is assumed to increase at the same rate as average wages in the economy 8social security administrati on office of the actuary internal rates of return under the oasdi program for hypothetical workers actuarial note 144 june 2001 the pattern in these scaled earnings histories s hows relatively low earnings at the beginning of the career fairly rapid growth through the ddle of the career and gradual tapering off of earnings at the end of the career 9assuming the legislation is enacted in 2002larger rate for example to observe the ffect of 5 contribution rate the results shown under 1 contribution ra should be multiplied by 5 the other factor affecting th amount contributed is the level of workers pay clearly set percentage of highpaid workers earnings will be larger dollar amount than that of lowpaid worker th ree different workers are illustrated it is assumed that they follow typical lifetime earnings patterns that would produce social security benefit equivalent to that of single workers with career earnings of either 1 the federal minimum wage7 2 an average wagea wage equal to social securitys average wage series or 3 the maximum wage creditable under social security also the pattern of workers pay can affect the eventual value of personal account typically many workers start work in entry level jobs with relatively low wages and earn higher wages as they advance in their careers because of the power of compound growth contribu tions made early in career have disproportionate effect on the eventual va lue of the account everything else held equal the lower contributi ons made early in career would result in smaller account balances than if the lifetime earnings were averaged over the career in recognition of these concerns the averagewage worker illustrated in this report has yearly earnings that are scaled in accordance with recent publication of the social security administration ssa that adjusts work histories to take into account typical career patterns8 consistent with the data in the ssa document the minimum and averagewage workers are assumed to begin work at age 21 and the maximum wage earner is assumed to begin work at age 22 all three earners work every year until retiring at age 62 the age at which most workers retire today for purposes of computing social security benefits and personal account accumulations this assumption results in 41year work career for workers earning minimum or average wages and 40year career for workers earning the maximum wage investment period the report looks at the asset accumulations for workers retiring at age 62 in 20102050 the projections assume that the new accounts would take effect sooner than 20039 thus someone retiring at ag 62 in 2010 may have 40 or 41 year career for social security purposes but would have only seven years to grow new personal account someone retiring in 2020 would have 17 years to do so someone retiring in 2030 would have 27 years and so on in effect the projections would not show the effect of full car eers worth of investing until 2043 or 2044httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98195crs6 10these rates of return are expressed in nominal terms the corresponding real rates of return are the nominal rates reduced by the underlying inflation assumption 30 annually under the trustees intermediate assumptions therefore the real rates of return shown in this report are 3 106091030 103 and 68 1101030 1068 11under the trustees 2002 intermediate forecast the nominal annual rate of interest is expected to range from 49 in 2002 to 64 in 2005 and to 60 in 2008 and thereafter when the latter rate is compounded semiannually the result is an effective rate of 609 12the one percentage point adjustment is cr ude proxy for these fees eg for the costs of buying and selling securities marketing and account maintenance index fund investments might have costs of fraction of percent whereas actively traded personally directed accounts might have much larger transaction charges thus costs will vary with the level of services offered to account holders also it is likely that collecting contributions from all the nations employers including many mom and popoperations and maintaining records for all the nations workers including potentially very small accounts would drive up administrative costs of social security individual accounts considerablyrate of return in analyses of personal accounts this fa ctor is usually the most contentious proponents of individual accounts point out th at historically the stock market has outperformed other investments and maintain that if workers social security taxes had instead been invested in broad stoc k portfolio they would have provided much higher benefits than are provided by soci security critics of the stock market approach point out that it carries greater risk that over time the markets performance has been inconsistent and that therefore if personal accounts are to be replacement of or supplement to social security the nations primary means of providing basic retirement income they should be tie d to safer and more predictable financial instruments eg bonds also some ec onomists argue that if the returns from investing in stocks are adjusted to account for risk they would be little different from those for longterm bonds to accommodate these two views this report measures account accumulations using two average annual rateofreturn scenarios 609 and 1010 the first scenario represents the same rate of return projected for the securities held by the social security trust funds which the tr ustees assume will u ltimately be 609 per year11 these are federal securities that earn rates of interest equivalent to medium and longterm federal bonds boug ht and sold in the financial markets the second scenario 10 annual rate of return represents the appr oximate growth rate of the standard and poors sp 500 stock market index including re invested dividends over the period from 1927 through 2001 minus one percentage point per year to reflect administrative costs and related management fees12 because the return from stocks and to lesser degree from bonds is volatile the assets in personal account s generally would fluctuate rather than grow steadily the degree of variability would increase if individuals were to have the choice of investing the assets of th eir personal accounts in individua l stocks rather than broad index funds furthermore many proposals re quire that part or all of the payments from personal accounts be in the form of an annuity ie spreading them out over thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98195crs7 13for illustrations of how the values of persona l accounts could fluctuate because of changes in economic and market conditions see crs report rl31324 social security reform the effect of economic variability on i ndividual accounts and their annuities by geoffrey kollmann dawn nuschler and patrick purcell these illustrations show that if economic and market conditions in the past were to r ecur in the future under some circumstances the proportion of social security benefits repl aced by personal accounts could be four times higher than that occurring under other circumst ances this figure applies to workers who contributed to personal accounts throughout 41year career the volatility for workers who would contribute for shor ter amount of time would be greater for example for workers who would contribute to pers onal account for only 20 years under some circumstances the proportion of social security benefits replaced by personal accounts could be seven times higher than that occurring under other circumstances 14the report computes social security bene fits using the intermediate economic and demographic assumptions in the 2002 trustees report under these projections wages are assumed to grow at an ultimate annual rate of 41 and prices at 30 for computations of present value of benefits the annual interest rate is 609 and the probability of survival in each year is based on interpolated unisex mo rtality assumptions for retirements at age 62 and 70period of retirement the amount of th monthly payment from the annuity usually is function of the rate of interest prevailing at the time of retirement as these rates also fluctuate the value of the personal account would be subject to further volatility13 because personal accounts are proposed as way to replace social security or to augment its benefits in the face of possible cutbacks this report compares the amounts in the personal account at the time of retirement to the projected value of persons lifetime social security benefits including costofliving adjustments under current law it measures and expre sses the value of lif etime social security benefits in present value terms14 by doing so it shows in single figure the amount of benefits that an individual would r eceive over the course of his or her retirement years assuming the person experiences the average mortality of his or her age cohort if those payments were paid as lump sum at the time of retirement and that lump sum earned constant real rate of interest over th period of retirement the report does not include the possible effects of income taxes on social security benefits and persona l accounts social security taxes are computed using beforetax earnings of employees ie so cial security taxes are not deductible in computing income taxes the employers share however is deductible as business expense because social security benefits are taxable only for recipients whose income exceeds certain levels the degree of taxation is highly variable from zero up to 85 of social security benefits may be taxable while recognizing that income tax effects can alter the results to simplify the analysis assumptions are made about the income tax treatment of either 1 social security taxes and benefits or 2 the contributions to and payments from the hypothetical personal accounts summarized in this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98195crs8 results the following table illustrates the pr oportion of social security benefits promised under current law that would be replaced by personal accounts for workers retiring at age 62 under several scenarios the variables in the scenarios are the year of retirement the level of earnings the pe rcentage of pay contributed to personal account and the accounts rate of return note that the percent of the social security benefit replaced is directly proportional to the contri bution rate the proportion

rules using the intermediate assumptions of the 2002 social security trustees report see footnote 14httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98195crs9 analysis personal accounts in the transition period because it is assumed that contributions to personal accounts would begin sooner than 2003 the full effect of pr oposal to create personal accounts as an alternative or supplement to social secu rity would not be achieved until 2043 and 2044 when the first cohorts that could ve contributed throughout their entire career would become eligible for social security retirement benefits hence the 20032043 period would have to be considered transition in the context of the current debate it might be usef ul to consider retirees in this period as parts of three successive age groups the baby boomers born in the 19461964 period the baby troughers born from the late 1960s to the late 1970s the children of the baby boomers the babyboom echo born in the late 1970s through the 1980s the baby boomers the baby boomers will reach age 62 in the 20082026 period those who wait until age 70 to co llect benefits will retire from 2016 to 2034 since their hypothetical personal accounts are assumed to start earlier than 2003 older baby boomers would have less time to accumulate assets in their personal accounts than would younger baby boomers those who work to later ages eg to age 65 or 70 would have more time to build their accounts as table 1 shows even under the more optimis tic investment scenario 10 rate of return the oldest baby boomer s would not have nough time to accumulate large personal accounts relative to their proj ected lifetime social security benefits with 2 of pay contribution rate workers with average earnings retiring at age 62 in 2010 would have accumulated fund equa l to only 33 of their lifetime social security benefits with 1 contributi on rate the fund would equal 17 of their benefits and with 3 cont ribution rate 50 even ter baby boomers ie those retiring at age 62 in 2020 would have accumulated only modest amounts 64 of benefits with 1 of pay contributi on rate 128 with 2 contribution rate and 193 with 3 contribution rate thus the more rapid the phasein to constrained or alternative social security system the more difficult it would be for many baby boomers to make up for fo regone social security benefits the baby troughers by 2030 workers would have had 27 years to build their personal accounts and they should be mo re substantial 2 of pay setaside for instance earning 10 annual retur n could grow to an amount equal to 285 of the lifetime value of an averagewage earners social security benefits even with rates of return matching the government bond rate 609 per year 2 of pay contribution rate could produce an acco unt accumulation equal to 160 of workers social security benefits put into policy context it might be noted that this would more than compensate for the magnitude of the cut 14 for workers retiring at age 62 associated with propos raising the age for full social securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98195crs10 15the proposal would raise the age for full social security benefits by 2 months per year over the 20002029 period 16benefits are computed by applying formul to an average of persons earnings from work subject to the social security tax th formula applies three progressive factors 90 32 and 15 to three different levels or brackets of average monthly covered earnings these earnings brackets change ach year to reflect changes in national wage levels the formula is designed so that workers with low average career earnings receive benefit that is larger proportion of thei r earnings than do workers with high average career earningsbenefit to 70 by 202915 one of number of proposals often suggested as means to help alleviate social securitys financing problems minimumwage earners who generally have the least pr oportion of their social security benefit replaced by personal accounts could have cut of th is size approximately offset if they contributed 3 of their pay to an account earning 609 or if they contributed 2 of pay to an account earning 10 the children of the baby b oomers the babyboom echo the accounts for workers retiring in the 20432050 period reflecting full careers worth of investing would become quite substan tial even with modest investment success for those retiring at age 62 in 2050 who earned average wages the 41year accumulation resulting from contributing 1 of pay to an account growing at the government bond rate 609 per yea r would r each level equal to 118 of lifetime social security be nefits 2 contribution ra would equal 235 and 3 contribution rate woul d equal 353 with 10 annual return the account buildups range from levels equal to 274 of be nefits with 1 contribution rate to 822 with 3 contribution rate effect of personal accounts on the lowwage tilt of the social security system table 1 also shows that personal account accumulations would represent larger percentage of social security benefits for highwage earners than lowwage earners for example if th contribution rate to pers onal account is 2 of pay and the rate of return is 10 the value of the account for worker earning the maximum wage retiring at age 62 in 2050 would be 927 of benefits whereas for worker earning the minimum wage it would be 395 this outcome reflects the tilt in the social security benefit formula in favor of lowwage earners16 although social security benefits are not based on worke rs taxes comparison of taxes paid to benefits received will show that lowerwage earners receive higher return on their taxes than higherwage earners similarly when benefits in the first year of retirement are compared to workers final earnings lowerwage earners have larger percentage of their earnings replaced by benefits this design is deliberate and has existed since the programs inception it is one of its social features reflecting the view that social security should provide means through which lowwage workers can sustain at least minimal standard of living in retirement without resorting to welfarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98195crs11 17examples of possible general reduction measures include raising the age for full social security benefits beyond 67 reducing cost ofliving adjustments and slowing the indexing embedded in the social security be nefit computation rules these approaches tend to reduce benefits by an equal percentage regardless of the level of workers underlying earnings history one approach that has been suggested to mitigate the lessening of the tilt for lowwage earners is to increase the progressivity of the benefit formula also some proposals that create personal accounts ttempt to reduce the perceived advantage that higherpaid workers would have by limiting the amount they could contribute to the accounts or conversely by augmenting the amount that lowerpaid workers could contribute to the accountshowever everything else held equal the value of personal account is directly proportional to the level of persons earnings thus for given rate of contributions and rate of return personal account would represent larger percentage of social security benefits for highwage earners this means that if social securitys longrange imbalance were addressed by an acrosstheboard cut in benefits coupl ed with the creation of personal accounts lowerwage earners could appear disadvantaged for example table 1 shows that if benefits were cut acro ss the board by 15 by 2030 under the 2 contribution rate and 609 rate of return scenario the reduc tion would match almost exactly the value of the personal account of averagewage earners 16 but not that of minimum wage earners whose personal accounts w ould equal on ly 91 of their social security benefits the value of the pe rsonal account of highwage earners on the other hand would significantly exceed the cut in benefits the value of their personal accounts would equa l 233 of their social security benefits17 said another way when the reduced social security benefits and the new personal account are combined the result reduces the degree of the tilt in favor of lowerpaid workers as illustrated in table 2 below httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98195crs12 18this table assumes that some underlying m echanism is established for annuitizing the personal account accumulations or in some other way paying benefits periodically from these accountstable 2 replacement rates assuming uniform 15 cut in social security benefits for workers retiring at age 62 in 2030 with personal account

the 2002 social security trustees report see footnote 14 table 2 shows that at rate of return of 609 the reduction in total benefits is slightly more than offset by the personal account for the maximum wageearner almost exactly offset for the average wage earner but only partially offset for the minimum wageearner on the other hand th table shows that under the higher rate of return scenario the combined benefits of minimum average and maximumwage earners would all exceed the social secur ity benefits projected under current law compare fourth column to second column hence while the systems tilt might be lessened from relying on pe rsonal accounts the growth in the minimumwage earners account might be such that the wo rker is worse off than if currentlaw social security bene fits were sustainedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98195crs13 effect of delaying retirement the obvious effect of workers delaying retirement is that their personal accounts could be larger because they coul d make additional cont ributions and there would be more time for the accounts to grow however another effect is that they would earn larger social security benefi ts workers who delay retirement would incur fewer or agerelated reductions in their social s ecurity benefits and if they retired after they attained the full retirement age their benefits would be augmented by delayed retirement credits hence while their personal accounts would grow to larger levels if they delayed retirement there would be little change in their value expressed as percentage of social security benefits in fact because of increasing longevity which raises the value of life time social security benefits by 2058 under the 609 rateofreturn scenario the relativ value of personal account for worker who retired at age 70 would be slightly lowe r than if he or she had retired at age 62 see table 3 table 3 value of personal accounts as percent of current law social security benefits for averagewage earners contributing

security benefits were calc ulated under currentlaw rules using the intermediate assumptions of the 2002 social security trustees report see footnote 14 effect of contributing to personal account over full career full careers worth of contributions nd investing for an averagewage earner is illustrated in table 1 by the account accumulations for workers retiring in 2050 the table shows that 2 contribution rate growing at the same rate as the social security trust funds would yield an sset accumulation at age 62 equal to 235 of the value of lifetime social security bene fits with 10 nnual return the asset accumulation would equal 548 of the lif etime social secu rity benefits httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98195crs14 key observation is that 2 of pay is equal to less than onefifth of the long range cost 1047 of pay of retired work er benefits yet if invested using relatively safe investment strategy ie at the g overnment bond rate it would generate an asset accumulati on equal to 235 of retiree s projected lifetime social security benefits this result implies that the pe rsonal account would produce better return than the equivalent taxes paid to the social security system ie setting aside less than onefifth of the taxes c ould produce personal account worth almost quarter of the benefits sa id another way the inherent rate of return in the current social security system for worker with steady averagewage record would appear to be less than the governme nt bond rate because of the tilt in the social security benefit discussed earlier this inherent rate of return would be relatively higher for lowwage earners and relativel lower for highwage earners while some consider this to be funda mental flaw in the system others do not in its current form social security is considered to be social insurance as such its purpose is not simply to provide annuities similar to those from private retirement savings plan it also attempts to insure society against widescale dependency among the aged it has tilted benefit formula favoring lowwage earners it pays benefits to workers dependents with corresponding increase in the workers contributions it assumes the market risks of annuitization which the private sector would otherwise charge for as well as the risks of inflation by providing automatic costofliving adjustments and workers benefits are not strictly based on their own contributions or those of their age cohorts but are defined in law in fundamental sense the vel of benefits is directly related to the income of the system ie its payasyougo rather th an fullyfunded system in effect part of workers social security wit hholding is social tax it reflects progressive philosophy and in this contex t it would be reasonable to expect high wage earners and perhaps average earners to have less of return on their taxes than lowwage earners the advantages to society of giving measure of economic independence to its elderly and greater sense of economic security to its workers would be seen as intangibles that are not reflected in strict taxestobenefits analysis this is not to suggest that the systems current design and its varying returns on taxes at different income levels necessarily reflect the best policy today or in the future the system was created 67 year s ago under very diffe rent economic and social circumstances the point is that while understanding the potential returns from private investments is important ultimately it is value judgment and political matter whether the social features that the system provides to todays workers should be maintainedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98195crs15 for additional reading for more information on congressional nd other proposals that would allow or require personal savings accounts see
