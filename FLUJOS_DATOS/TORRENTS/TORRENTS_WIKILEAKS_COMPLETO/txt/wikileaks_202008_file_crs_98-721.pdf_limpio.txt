mously complex process it entails dozens of subprocesses countless rules and procedures the efforts of tens of thousands of staff persons in the executive and legislative branches millions of work hours each year and the active participation of the president and congressional leaders as well as other members of congress and executive officials the enforcement of budgetary decisions involves complex web of procedures that encompasses both congressional and executive actions in recent years these procedures have been rooted principally in two statutesthe congressional budget act of 1974 and the budget enforcement act bea the 1974 act established congressional budget process in which budget policies are enforced by congress during the consideration of individual measures the bea is the most recent embodiment of additional enforcement procedures first established in 1985 and renewed with substantial modification in 1990 and 1997 that have been used by the executive to enforce budget policies after the end of congressional session the bea enforcement procedures were waived in recent years and effectively expired toward the end of the 107 th congress efforts to renew them in the 108th through 110th congresses were not successful the presidents budget is required by law to be submitted to congress early in the legislative session while the budget is only request to congress the power to formulate and submit the budget is vital tool in the presidents direction of the executive branch and of national policy the presidents proposals often influence congressional revenue and spending decisions though the extent of the influence varies from year to year and depends more on political and fiscal conditions than on the legal status of the budget the congressional budget act of 1974 establishes the congressional budget process as the means by which congress coordinates the various budgetrelated actions such as the consideration of appropriations and revenue measures taken by it during the course of the year the process is centered around an annual concurrent resolution on the budget that sets aggregate budget policies and functional spending priorities for at least the next five fiscal years because concurrent resolution is not lawit cannot be signed or vetoed by the presidentthe budget resolution does not have statutory effect money can be raised or spent pursuant to it revenue and spending amounts set in the budget resolution establish the basis for the enforcement of congressional budget policies through points of order congress implements budget resolution policies through action on individual revenue and debt limit measures annual appropriations acts and direct spending legislation in some years congress considers reconciliation legislation pursuant to reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution reconciliation legislation is used mainly to bring existing revenue and direct spending laws into conformity with budget resolution policies initially reconciliation was major tool for deficit reduction in recent years reconciliation has been used mainly to reduce revenues

constitution lists the power to lay and collect taxes and the power to borrow as powers of congre ss further it provides that funds may be drawn from the treasury only pursuant to appropriations made by law the constitution does not state how these legislative powers are to be exercised nor does it expressly provide for the president to have role in the management of the nations finances during the nations early years the house and senate devised procedures for the enactment of spending and revenue legislation as these procedures evolved during the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century they led to highly fragmented legislative actions in the course of each session congress passed many separate appropriations bills and other measures affecting the financial condition of the federal government neither the constitution nor the procedures adopted by the house and senate provided for budget systemthat is for coordinated set of actions covering all federal spending and revenues as long as the federal government was small and its spending and revenues were stable such budget system was not considered necessary early in the 20 th century the incessant rise in federal spending and the recurrence of deficits spending exceeded revenues in half of the 20 years preceding fy1920 led congress to seek more coordinated means of making financial decisions the key legislation was the budget and accounting act of 1921 which established the executive budget process the 1921 act did not directly alter the procedures by which congress makes revenue and spending decisions the main impact was in the executive branch the president was required to submit his budget recommendations to congress each year and the bureau of the budget renamed the office of management and budget omb in 1970was created to assist him in carrying out his budgetary responsibilities congress it was expected would be able to coordinate its revenue and spending decisions if it received comprehensive budget recommendations from the president in line with this expectation the house and senate changed their rules to consolidate the jurisdiction of the appropriations committees over spending the 1921 act also established the general accounting office gao headed by the comptroller general and made it the principal auditing arm of the federal government the gao recently was renamed the government accountability office the 1921 act as amended remains the statutory basis for the presidential budget system after world war ii the belief that the presidential budget sufficed to maintain fiscal control gave way to the view that congress needed its own b udget process some members of congress feared that dependence on the executive budget had bolstered the presidents fiscal powers at the expense of congresss others felt that as long as its financial decisions were fragmented congress could not effectively control expenditures the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 established congressional budget process centered around concurrent resolution on the budget scheduled for adoption prior to legislative consideration of revenue or spending bills the congressional budget process initiated in the 1970s did not replace the preexisting revenue and spending processes instead it provided an overall legislative framework within which the many separate measures affecting the budget would be considered the central purpose of the budget process established by the 1974 act is to coordinate the various revenue and spending decisions which are made in separate revenue appropriations and other budgetary meas ures to assist congress in making budget

office cbo and directed it to provide data on and analyses of the federal budget during the years that the congressional budget process has been in operation its procedures have been adapted by congress to changing circumstances following decade of experience with the 1974 congressional budget act congress made further changes in the budget process by enacting the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 also known as the grammrudmanhollings act the budget enforcement act of 1990 the line item veto act in 1996 and the budget enforcement act of 1997 among other laws the 1985 act prescribed declining deficit targets intended to achieve balance in fy1991 the targets were enforced by sequestration process involving automatic acrosstheboard cuts in nonexempt spending programs if the targets were expected to be exceeded the 1990 act replaced the deficit targets with caps on discretionary spending and payasyougo requirement for revenue and direct spending legislation sequestration was retained as the means of enforcing the two new mechanisms the 1996 act authorized the president to cancel discretionary spending in appropriation acts as well as new direct spending and limited tax benefits in other legislation subject to expedited legislative procedures by which congress could overturn the cancellations the supreme court struck down the line item veto act in june 1998 as unconstitutional finally the 1997 act extended the bea procedures for several more years

spending and borrowing and debt of the government revenues come largely from taxes but stem from other sources as well such as duties fines licenses and gifts spending involves such concepts as budget authority obligations outlays and offsetting collections the numbers are computed according to rules and conventions that have accumulated over the years they do not always conform to the way revenues and spending are accounted for in other processes g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g162g561g138g151g141g561g17g158g157g149g138g162g156g561 when congress appropriates money it provides budget authority that is authority to enter into obligations budget authority also may be provided in legislation that does not go through the appropriations process direct spending legislation the key congressional spending decisions relate to the obligations that agencies are authorized to incur during fiscal year not to the outlays made during the year obligations occur when agencies enter into contracts submit purchase orders employ personnel and so forth outlays occur when obligations are liquidated primarily through the issuance of checks electronic fund transfers or the disbursement of cash the provision of budget authority is the key point at which congress exercises control over federal spending although the outlay level often receives greater public attention because of its bearing on the deficit congress does not directly control outlays each years outlays derive in part from new budget authority and in part from carryover budget authority provided in prior years for example president bushs initial budg et submission for fy2009 estimated that outlays would total 3107 billion for that year approximately 2411 billion of this amount was estimated to come from new budget authority for the fiscal year while the remainder 696 billion was estimated to come from budget authority enacted in prior years

program and depends on spendout rates the rates at which funds provided by congress are obligated and payments disbursed in program with high spendout rate most new budget authority is expended during the fiscal year if the spendout rate is low however most of the outlays occur in later years regardless of the spendout rate the outlays in the budget are merely estimates of the amounts that will be disbursed during the year if payments turn out to be higher than the budget estimate outlays will be above the budgeted level the president and congress control outlays indirectly by deciding on the amount of budget authority to be provided or by limiting the amount of obligations to be incurred certain receipts of the federal government are accounted for as offsets against outlays rather than as revenues various fees collected by government agencies are deducted from outlays similarly income from the sale of certain assets are treated as offsetting receipts most such receipts are offsets against the outlays of the agencies that collect the money but in the case of offshore oil leases and certain other activities the revenues are deducted from the total outlays of the government

general fundlargely derive from the general exercise of the taxing power and general borrowing and for the most part are not earmarked by law to any specific program or agency one component of federal funds called special funds are earmarked as to source and purpose the use of federal funds is determined largely by appropriations acts trust funds are established under the terms of statutes that designate them as trust funds to account for funds earmarked by specific sources and purposes the social security funds are the largest of the trust funds revenues are collected under social security payroll tax and are used to pay for social security benefits and related purposes the unified budget includes both the federal funds and the trust funds the balances in the trust funds are borrowed by the federal government they are counted therefore in the federal debt because these balances offset budget deficit but are included in the federal debt the annual increase in the debt invariably exceeds the amount of the budget deficit for the same reason it is possible for the federal debt to rise when the federal government has budget surplus capital and operating expenses are not segregat ed in the budget hence monies paid for the operations of government agencies as well as for the acquisition of longlife assets such as buildings roads and weapons systems are reported as budget outlays proposals have been made from time to time to divide the budget into capital and operating accounts while these proposals have not been adopted the budget provides information showing the investment and operating outlays of the government the budget totals do not include all the financial transactions of the federal government the main exclusions fall into two categoriesoffbudget entities and governmentsponsored enterprises in addition the budget includes direct and guaranteed loans on the basis of the accounting rules established by the federal credit reform act of 1990 which are discussed below offbudget entities are excluded by law from the budget totals the receipts and disbursements of the social security trust funds the oldage and survivors insurance fund and the disability httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98721g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g157g145g142g561 g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g4g158

as well as spending for the postal service fund are excluded from the budget totals these transactions are shown separately in the budget thus the budget now reports two deficit or surplus amountsone excluding the social security trust funds and the postal service fund and the other on unified basis including these entities the latter is the main focus of discussion in both the presidents budget and the congressional budget process the transactions of governmentowned corporations excluding the postal service as well as revolving funds are included in the budget on net basis that is the amount shown in the budget is the difference between receipts and outlays not the total activity of the enterprise or revolving fund if for example revolving fund has annual income of 150 million and disbursements of 200 million the budget would report 50 million as net outlays governmentsponsored enterprises gses historically have been excluded from the budget because they were deemed to be private rather than public entities the federal government did not own any equity in these enterprises most of which received their financing from private sources although they were established by the federal government their budgets were not reviewed by the president or congress in the same manner as other programs most of these enterprises engaged in credit activities they borrowed funds in capital markets and lent money to homeowners farmers and others in total these enterprises had assets and liabilities measured in trillions of dollars financial statements of the governmentsponsored enterprises were published in the presidents budget although some gses continue to operate on this basis the economic downturn and credit instability that occurred in 2008 fundamentally changed the status of two gses that play significant role in the home mortgage market fannie mae and freddie mac in september of 2008 the federal housing finance agency fhfa placed the two entities in conservatorship thereby subjecting them to control by the fe deral government until the conservatorship eventually is brought to an end

about the budget deficit in the mid1980s the deficit exceeded 150 billion and amounted to about 6 of gdp at one point in the early 1990s the deficit approached the 300 billion level following four years of surpluse s fy1998fy2001 the budget returned to deficit for fy2002 current budget projections show sizeable deficits persisting over the coming years the size of the deficit depends on how it is measured the unified budget deficit combines all on budget federal funds and trust funds with the offbudget entities the social security trust funds and the postal service fund the unified budget deficit generally is regarded as the most comprehensive measure of the impact of the budget on the economy narrower measure of the deficit is derived by excluding the social security trust funds from the totals this exclusion is mandated by law although social security is counted in the budget in reports on the deficit excluding social security from computations of the deficit or surplus results in higher deficit or lower surplus figures httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98721g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g157g145g142g561 g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g4g158

the measure used it is evident that the deficit was unusually high for an extended period of time the chronic deficits of the 1980s prompted congress to enact the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 the 1985 act established deficit targets for each year through fy1991 when the budget was to be balanced and sequestration process under which budgetary resources would be canceled automatically through largely acrossthe board spending cuts if the estimated deficit exceeded the amount allowed under the act even with the targets the actual deficit for the covered years was above the targeted level failure to achieve the deficit targets and other problems led congress to revise the process in the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 sequestration procedures were retained but the fixed deficit targets were replaced by adjustable ones which expired at the end of fy1995 adjustable limits were imposed on discretionary spending and payasyougo paygo process was established for revenues and direct spending the discreti onary spending limits and paygo process were extended through fy1998 by the omnibus budg et reconciliation of 1993 and again through fy2002 by the bea of 1997 the bea enforcement procedures were waived in recent years and they effectively expired toward the end of the 107 th congress efforts to renew them in the 108th through 110th congresses were unsuccessful although it is not clear at this point whether they will be revived in their current form during the 111th congress the recurrence of persistent deficits suggests that additional enforcement procedures modeled on discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement could be adopted under the discretionary spending limits different categories of discretionary spending were used for different periods under the 1997 changes disc retionary spending limits applied separately to defense and nondefense spending for fy1998fy1999 and to violent crime reduction spending for fy1998fy2000 for the remaining fiscal year s the 1997 changes merged all discretionary spending into single general purpose category in 1998 as part of the transportation equity act for the 21 st century congress added separate categories for highway and mass transit spending finally in 2000 congress added category for conservation spending unlike the other categories the conservation spending category had six subcategories the paygo process required that the budgetary impact of revenue and direct spending legislation be recorded on multiyear p aygo scorecard and that in the net any such legislation not yield negative balance for the upcoming fiscal year legislation reducing revenues or increasing direct spending for fiscal year had to be offset in the same or other legislation by revenue increases or reductions in direct spending for that fiscal year so that the applicable balance on the paygo scorecard remained at or above zero the senate supplemented the statutory paygo requirement with special paygo rule included in annual budget resolutions following the expiration of the statutory paygo requirement the senate extended its paygo rule currently through fy2017 the house adopted its own paygo rule for the first time at the beginning of the 110 th congress although the senate paygo rule has been revised significantly from time to time it presently is similar in approach to the house rule both rules provide for points of order to bar the consideration of any legislation that proposes changes in direct spending or revenue that are not deficit neutral over sixyear and 11year time periods including the current fiscal year under the bea procedures violations of the discretionary spending limits or the paygo requirement were to be enforced by sequestration

the distinction drawn by the bea and the cong ressional budget process between discretionary spending which is controlled through the annual appropriations process and direct spending which is provided outside of the annual appropriations process recognized that the federal government has somewhat different though over lapping means of dealing with these two types of spending one set of procedures pertained to discretionary spending another to direct spending most of the direct spending subject to the paygo process under the bea involved entitlement programs the rest consisted of other forms of mandatory spending provided through authorizing legislation and interest payments in fact entitlements now account for about half of total federal spending all direct spending including net inte rest accounts for about twothirds of the total the impressive feature of this trend is that most of the growth in spending and in the number of recipients has been built into existing law for the most part it has not been the result of new legislation the procedures for discretionary and direct spending converge at two critical points in federal budgeting formulation of the presidents budget and formulation of the congressional budget resolution both of these policy statements encompass discretionary and direct spending but the procedures used in budgeting for these types of expenditure differ greatly the distinctions have some notable exceptions some procedures associated with direct spending are applied to particular types of discretionary programs and vice versa nevertheless the generalizations presented here help to explain the complications of the budget process and explain how decisions are made 1 budgetary impact of authorizing legislation an authorization for discretionary spending program is only license to enact an appropriation the amount of budgetary resources available for spending is determined in annual appropriations acts for direct spending programs principally entitlements on the other hand th authorizing legislation either provides or effectively mandates the appropriation of budget authority in those entitlement programs that are subject to annual appropriation the appropriations committees have little or discretion as to the amounts they provide 2 committees that provide or mandate budget authority the appropriations committees have jurisdiction and effective control over discretionary spending programs while authorizing committees effectively control direct spending programs including those funded in annual appropriations acts in fact committee jurisdiction determines whether program is classified as discretionary or direct spending all spending under the effective control of the appropriations committees is discretionary everything else is direct spending accordingly when legislation establishes program as discretionary or direct spending it not only determines the character of spending but the locus of congressional committee control as well 3 frequency of decisionmaking discretionary appropriations are with few exceptions made annually for the current or next fiscal year direct spending programs typically are established in httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98721g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g157g145g142g561 g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g4g158

that continues in effect until such time as it is revised or terminated by another law the fact that many entitlements have annual appropriations does not diminish the permanence of the laws governing the amounts spent it should be noted however that some direct spending programs such as medicare have been subject to frequent legislative changes the purpose of such legislation has been to modify existing law not to provide annual funding 4 means of enforcing the budget resolution the procedures used by congress to enforce the policies set forth in the annual budget resolution differ somewhat for discretionary and direct spending programs for both types of spending congress relies on allocations made under section 302 of the 1974 congressional budget act to ensure that spending legislation reported by house and senate committees conforms to established budget policies but although this procedure is effective in controlling new legislationboth annual appropriations measures and new entitlement legislationit is not an effective control on the spending that results from existing laws hence congress relies on reconciliation procedures to enforce budget policies with respect to existing spending and revenue laws reconciliation is not currently applied to discretionary programs funded in annual appropriations measures 5 budget enforcement act controls discretionary programs have been subject to the spending limits set in the bea direct spending has not been capped but has operated under the paygo process which required that direct spending and revenue legislation enacted for fiscal year not cause the deficit to rise or the surplus to decrease the lack of caps was due to the fact that most direct spending programs are openended with spending determined by eligibility rules and payment formulas in existing law rather than by new legislation budget enforcement depends on timely information concerning the status of federal revenues and spending when it acts on legislation congress must be informed of the estimated impact on future budgets measuring these impacts often is referred to as scoring or scorekeeping scoring discretionary spending measures is much simpler task than scoring direct spending and revenue legislation in the latter case scoring always is done in reference to baseline projections of future revenues and spending most appropriations are for definite amount and the budget authority is provided for single fiscal year the main task is to estimate the outlays that will derive in the next year and beyond from the budget authority provided in the appropriations bill cbo and the appropriations committees base these estimates on outlay or spendout ratesthe percentage of budget authority that is spent in each year these outlay rates vary by account and are based on historical records for example if 1 billion is appropriated to an account which has spendout rate of 80 in the first fiscal year that funds become available the outlay estimate for that fiscal year will be 800 million the remaining 200 million will become outlays in one or more subsequent years scorekeeping is much more complex in enforcing paygo requirement for one thing unlike appropriations revenue and direct spending legislation usually is openended it does not specify the amount by which revenue or spending will be changed for another the impact of this type of legislation continues in future years in enforcing the statutory paygo requirement congress had to estimate the revenue gain or loss for the ensuing five years under the house and senate paygo rules revenue estimates must cover 10 years congress cannot develop the revenue estimates simply by referring to the text of the legislation being scored it must also take into account the behavior of taxpayers economic conditions and other factors that affect revenue collection httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98721g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g157g145g142g561

baseline projections issued by cbo sometimes in cooperation with omb the baseline is an extrapolation of future budget conditions typically for each of the next five years based on the assumption that current policies will continue in effect the baseline projections incorporate assumptions about future inflation and workload changes mandated by law these projections are made for the budget aggregates as well as for individual programs and accounts when congress considers revenue or direct spending legislation cbo estimates the amount of revenues or outlays that would ensue if the measure were enacted in the case of most revenue legislation cbo uses estimates prepared by the joint tax committee it then compares this amount with the baseline projection to score the legislation thus the score measures budgetary impact as the difference between the amount projected under current policies and the amount estimated if the legislation were enacted score is reported for each of the years and often for the sum of the years as well the bea gave omb the authority to determine whether offsets or sequester were required under the paygo rules however congress usually relies on the cbo score while it is considering legislation the omb and cbo scores on legislation sometimes differ in addition to enforcing paygo baseline projections and scoring are used in computing the amount of deficit reduction agreed to in budget summit negotiations between the president and congress and enacted in reconciliation acts

made fundamental changes in the budgetary treatment of direct loans and guaranteed loans the reform which first became effective for fy1992 shifted the accounting basis for federally provided or guaranteed credit from the amount of cash flowing into or out of the treasury to the estimated subsidy cost of the loans credit reform entails complex procedures for estimating these subsidy costs and new accounting mechanisms for recording various loan transactions the changes have had only modest impact on budget totals but substantial impact on budgeting for particular loan programs the new system requires that budget authority and outlays be budgeted for the estimated subsidy cost of direct and guaranteed loans this cost is defined in the 1990 act as the estimated long term cost to the government of direct loan or loan guarantee calculated on net present value basis excluding administrative costs under the new system congress appropriates budget authority or provides indefinite authority equal to the subsidy cost this budget authority is placed in program account from which funds are disbursed to financing account

and other information supporting the presidents recommendations the presidents budget is only request to congress congress is not required to adopt his recommendations nevertheless the power to

decisions though the extent of the influence varies from year to year and depends more on political and fiscal conditions than on the legal status of the budget the constitution does not provide for budget nor does it require the president to make recommendations concerning the revenues and spending of the federal government until 1921 the federal government operated without comprehensive presidential budget process the budget and accounting act of 1921 as amended prov ides for national budget system its basic requirement is that the president should prepare and submit budget to congress each year the 1921 act established the bureau of the budget now named the office of management and budget omb to assist the presiden t in preparing and implementing the executive budget

year to which it pertains and about 29 mont hs before the close of that fiscal year the early stages of budget preparation occur in federal agencies when they begin work on the budget for fiscal year

agencies formulate their budgets they maintain continuing contact with the omb examiners assigned to them these contacts provide agencies with guidance in preparing their budgets and also enable them to alert omb to any needs or problems that may loom ahead agency requests are submitted to omb in late summer or early fall these are reviewed by omb staff in consultation with the president and his aides the 1921 budget and accounting act bars agencies from submitting their budget requests directly to congress moreover omb regulations provide for confidentiality in all budget requests and recommendations prior to the transmittal of the presidents budget to congress however it is quite common for internal budget documents to become public while the budget is still being formulated the format and content of the budget are partly determined by law but the 1921 act authorizes the president to set forth the budget in such form and detail as he may determine over the years there has been an increase in the types of information and explanatory material presented in the budget documents in most years the budget is submitted as multivolume set consisting of main document setting forth the presidents message to congress and an analysis and justification of his major proposals the budget and supplementary documents providing account and program level details historical information and special budgetary analyses the budget appendix historical tables and analytical perspectives among other things much of the budget is an estimate of requirements under existing law

establishes the congressional budget process as the means by which congress coordinates the various budgetrelated actions such as the consideration of appropriations and revenue measures taken by it during the course of the year the process is centered around an annual concurrent resolution on the budget that sets aggregate budget policies and functional priorities for at least the next five fiscal years because concurrent resolution is not lawit cannot be signed or vetoed by the presidentthe budget resolution does not have statutory effect money can be raised or spent pursuant to it the main purpose of the budget resolution is to establish the framework within which congress considers separate revenue spending and other budgetrelated legislation revenue and spending amounts set in the budget resolution establish the basis for the enforcement of congressional budget policies through points of order the budget resolution also initiates the reconciliation process for conforming existing revenue and spending laws to congressional budget policies

congressional budget act requires the budget resolution for each fiscal year covered to set forth budget aggregates and spending levels for each functional category of the budget the aggregates included in the budget resolution are as follows total revenues and the amount by which the total is to be changed by legislative action total new budget authority and outlays the surplus or deficit and the debt limit with regard to each of the functional categories the budget resolution must indicate for each fiscal year the amounts of new budget authority and outlays and they must add up to the corresponding spending or aggregates aggregate amounts in the budget resolution do not reflect the revenues or spending of the social security trust funds although these amounts are set forth separately in the budget resolution for purposes of senate enforcement procedures the budget resolution does not allocate funds among specific programs or accounts but the major program assumptions underlying the functional amounts are often discussed in the reports accompanying each resolution some recent reports have contained detailed information on the program levels assumed in the resolution these assumptions are not binding on the affected committees finally the 1974 act allows certain additional matters to be included in the budget resolution the most important optional feature of budget resolution is reconciliation directives discussed below the house and senate budget committees are responsible for marking up and reporting the budget resolution in the course of developing the budget resolution the budget committees hold hearings receive views and estimates reports from other committees and obtain information from cbo these views and estimates reports of house and senate committees provide the budget committees with information on the preferences and legislative plans of congressional committees regarding budgetary matters within their jurisdiction cbo assists the budget committees in developing the budget resolution by issuing early each year report on the economic and budget outlook that includes baseline budget projections the baseline projections presented in the report are supported by more detailed projections for accounts and programs cbo usually revises the baseline projections one or more times before the budget committees mark up the budget resolution in addition cbo issues report analyzing the presidents budgetary proposals in light of cbos own economic and technical assumptions in past years cbo also issued an annual report on spending and revenue options for reducing the deficit or maintaining the surplus the extent to which the budget committees and the house and senate consider particular programs when they act on the budget resolution varies from year to year specific program decisions are supposed to be left to the appropriations committees and other committees of jurisdiction but there is strong likelihood that major issues will be discussed in markup in the budget committees reports and during floor co nsideration of the budget resolution although any programmatic assumptions generated in this process are not binding on the committees of jurisdiction they often influence the final outcome

house and senate rules and practices in the house the rules committee usually reports special rule simple house resolution which once approved establishes the terms and conditions under which the budget resolution is considered this special rule typically specifies which amendments may be considered and the sequence in which they are to be offered and voted on it has been the practice in recent years to allow consideration of few amendments as substitutes for the entire resolution that present broad policy choices in the senate the amendment process is less structured relying on

considerations many of the factors that determine whether budgetary goals will be met are beyond the direct control of congress if economic conditions growth employment levels inflation and so

mechanism was the ceiling on total budget authority and outlays and the floor under total revenues set forth in the budget resolution the limitations inherent in this mechanism soon became apparent for example the issue of controlling breaches of the spending ceilings usually did not arise until congress acted on supplemental appropriations acts when the fiscal year was well underway the emergency nature of the legislation often made it difficult to uphold the ceilings as part of the budget process changes made by the bea of 1997 the aggregate levels set in the budget resolution and

inadequacies in the early years of congressional budgeting of relying on enforcement of the budget totals congress change d the focus of enforcement in the 1980s to the committee allocations and subdivisions of spending made pursuant to section 302 of the act the key to enforcing budget policy is to relate the budgetary impact of individual pieces of legislation to the overall budget policy because congress operates through its committee system an essential step in linking particular measures to the budget is to allocate the spending amounts set forth in the budget resolution among house and senate committees section 302a provides for allocations to committees to be made in the statement of managers accompanying the conference report on the budget resolution section 302a allocation is made to each committee which has jurisdiction over spending both for the budget year and the full period covered by the budget resolutionat least five fiscal years the committee allocations do not take into account jurisdiction over discretionary authorizations funded in annual appropriations acts the amounts of new budget authority and outlays allocated to committees in the house or senate may not exceed the aggregate amounts of budget authority and outlays set forth in the budget resolution although these allocations are made by the budget committees they are not the unilateral preferences of these committees they are based on assumptions and understandings developed in the course of formulating the budget resolution after the allocations are made under section 302a the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide the amounts they receive among their 12 subcommittees as required by section 302b the subcommittees section 302b subdivisions may not exceed the total amount allocated to the committee each appropriations committee reports its subdivisions to its respective chamber the appropriations bills may not be considered until such report has been filed

budgetary effects of pending and enacted legislation and assessing its impact on budget plan in this case the budget resolution in the congressional budget process scoring serves several broad purposes first scoring informs members of congress and the public about the budgetary consequences of their actions when budgetary measure is under consideration scoring information lets members know

budgetary goals finally scoring is designed to assist congress in enforcing its budget plans in this regard scorekeeping is used largely to determine whether points of order under the 1974 act may be sustained against legislation violating budget resolution levels the principal scorekeepers for congress are the house and senate budget committees which provide the presiding officers of their respective chambers with the estimates needed to determine if legislation violates the aggregate levels in the budget resolution or the committee subdivisions of spending the budget committees make summary scoring reports available to members on frequent basis usually geared to the pace of gislative activity cbo assists congress in these activities by preparing cost estimates of legislation which are included in committee reports and scoring reports for the budget committees the joint committee on taxation supports congress by preparing estimates of the budgetary impact of revenue legislation g18g152g146g151g157g156g561g152g143g561g17g155g141g142g155g561 the 1974 congressional budget act provides for both substantive and procedural points of order to block violations of budget resolution policies and congressional budget procedures one element of substantive enforcement is based on section 311 of the act which bars congress from considering legislation that would cause total revenues to fall below the level set in the budget resolution or total new budget authority or total outlays to exceed the budgeted level the house and senate both enforce the spending ceilings for the first fiscal year only the revenue floor however is enforced for the first fiscal year and the full number of fiscal years covered by the budget resolution in the house but not the senate section 311 does not apply to spending legislation if the committee reporting the measure has stayed within its allocation of new discretionary budget authority accordingly the house may take up any spending measure that is within the appropriate committee allocations even if it would cause total spending to be exceeded neither chamber bars spending legislation that would cause functional allocations in the budget resolution to be exceeded section 302f of the 1974 act bars the house and senate from considering any spending measure that would cause the relevant committees spending allocations to be exceeded in the house the point of order applies only to violations of locations of new discretionary budget authority further the point of order also applies to suballocations of spending made by the appropriations committees in addition to points of order to enforce compliance with the budget resolution and the allocations and subdivisions made pursuant to it the 1974 act contains points of order to ensure compliance with its procedures perhaps the most important of these is section 303 which bars consideration of any revenue spending entitlement or debtlimit measure prior to adoption of the budget resolution however the rules of the house permit it to consider regular appropriations bills after may 15 even if the budget resolution has not yet been adopted when the house or senate considers revenue or spending measure the chairman of the respective budget committee sometimes makes statement advising the chamber as to whether the measure violates any of these points of order if point of order is made or if the point of order is waived the house or senate may consider measure despite any violations of the 1974 act the house often waives points of order by adopting special rule the senate may waive httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98721g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g157g145g142g561 g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g4g158

sequestration was the principle means used to enforce statutory budget enforcement policies in place from 1985 through 2002 although sequestration procedures currently are not in effect they are described here because they could be employed again if congress and the president decide to reinstate the statutory enforcement policies sequestration involved the issuance of presidential order that permanently cancelled budgetary resources except for revolving funds special funds trust funds and certain offsetting collections for the purpose of achieving required amount of outlay savings to reduce the deficit once sequestration was triggered by an executive determination spending reductions were made automatically this process therefore was regarded by many as providing strong incentive for congress and the president to reach agreement on legislation that would avoid sequester from its inception in 1985 until its revision by the budget enforcement act bea in 1990 the process was tied solely to the enforcement of fixed deficit targets the bea changed the sequestration process substantially first it effectively eliminated the deficit targets as factor in budget enforcement second the bea established adjustable limits on discretionary spending funded in the annual appropriations process third the bea created payasyougo procedures to require that increases in direct spending ie spending controlled outside of the annual appropriations process or decreases in revenues due to legislative action were offset so that there was effectively net increase in the deficit or reduction of the surplus the bea established adjustable limits on disc retionary spending for fy1991fy1995 these limits were extended through fy1998 in 1993 the budget enforcement act bea of 1997 revised the limits for fy1998 and provided new limits through fy2002 the limits were established for the following categories of discretionary spending defense and nondefense for fy1998fy1999 discretionary single genera l purpose category for fy2000fy2002 and violent crime reduction for fy1998fy2000 in 1998 as part of the transportation equity act for the 21 st century separate categories were added for highway and mass transit spending finally spending conservation category was added in 2000 the limits expired at the end of fy2002 and efforts to renew them in the 108 th congress were unsuccessful it is unclear at this point whether the 109th congress will decide to revive them the discretionary spending limits had to be adjusted periodically by the president for various factors including among others changes in concepts and definitions special outlay allowance to accommodate estimating differences between omb and cbo and the enactment of legislation providing emergency funding and funding for the international monetary fund international arrearages an earned income tax credit compliance initiative and other specially designated purposes

legislation increasing direct spending or decreasing revenues for fiscal year had to be offset so that the balance on the paygo scorecard for that year did not fall below zero the paygo process did not require any offsetting action when the spending increase or revenue decrease was due to the operation of existing law such as an increase in the number of persons participating in the medicare program direct spending consists largely of spending for entitlement programs most direct spending and revenue programs are established under permanent law so there is not necessarily any need for recurring legislative action on them and the paygo process did not require such action the paygo process did not preclude congress from enacting legislation to increase direct spending it only required that the increase be offset by reductions in other direct spending programs which could include increases in offsetting receipts by increases in revenues or by combination of the two in order to avoid sequester if sequester under this process was required it would have had to offset the amount of any net deficit increase or surplus reduction for the fiscal year caused by the enactment of legislation in the current and prior sessions of congress and would have been applied to nonexempt direct spending programs spending for social security benefits and federal deposit insurance commitments as well as emergency direct spending and revenue legislati on so designated by both the president and by congress was exempted completely from the paygo sequestration process all remaining direct spending programs were covered by the paygo process to the extent that legislation affecting their spending levels was counted in determining whether net increase or decrease in the deficit has occurred for fiscal year if paygo sequester had occurred however many direct spending programs would have been exempt from reduction in 1997 coverage of the paygo requirement was extended to legislation enacted through fy2002 however the paygo process was slated to remain in effect through fy2006 to deal with the outyear effects of such measures consequently paygo sequester could have occurred in fy2003fy2006 based on legislation enacted before the end of fy2002 at the end of the 107 th congress legislation was enacted setting all of the remaining paygo balances to zero effectively terminating the paygo requirement the multiple sequestration procedures established by the bea remained automatic to be triggered by report from the omb director for sequestration purposes generally there was only one triggering report issued each year just after the end of the congressional session but preliminary and update sequestration reports were issued earlier in the session additionally omb reports triggering sequester for discretionary spending could be issued during the following session if legislative developments so warranted ie the enactment of supplemental appropriations the cbo director was required to provide advisory sequestration reports shortly before the omb directors reports were due sequestration procedures could be suspended in the event declaration of war was enacted or if congress enacted special joint resolution triggered by the issuance of cbo report indicating low growth in the economy also there were several special procedures under the act by which the final sequestration order for fiscal year coul d be modified or the implementation of the order affected

spending legislation policies involvin g discretionary spending are implemented in the context of annual appropriations acts whereas policies affecting direct or mandatory spending which for the most part involves entitlement programs are carried out in substantive legislation all discretionary spending is under the jurisdic tion of the house and senate appropriations committees direct spending is under the jurisdiction of the various legislative committees of the house and senate the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee have the largest shares of direct spending jurisdiction some entitlement programs such as medicaid are funded in annual appropriations acts but such spending is not considered to be discretionary the enforcement procedures under the congressional budget process mentioned above apply equally to discretionary and direct spending in recent years many of the most significan t changes in direct spending programs from budgetary standpoint have been made in the reconciliation process see discussion below the greatest number of spending decisions in any year occurs in the annual appropriations process

an appropriation is made for them an authorizing act is law that 1 establishes program or agency and the terms and conditions under which it operates and 2 authorizes the enactment of appropriations for that program or agency authorizing legislation may originate in either the house or the senate and may be considered any time during the year many agencies and programs have temporary author izations that have to be renewed annually or every few years action on appropriations measures sometimes is delayed by the failure of congress to enact necessary authorizing legislation the house and senate often waive or disregard their rules against unauthorized appropriations for ongoing pr ograms that have not yet been reauthorized the budgetary impact of authorizing legislation depends on whether it contains only discretionary authorizations for which funding is provided in annual appropriations acts or direct spending which itself enables an agency to enter into obligations

agencies legal authority to incur obligations and the treasury department authority to make payments for designated purposes the power of appropriation derives from the constitution which in article i section 9 provides that money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law the power to appropriate is exclusively legislative power it functions as limitation on the executive branch an agency may not spend more than the amount appropriated to it and it may use available funds only for the purposes and according to the conditions provided by congress

since the first congress the practice has been to make appropriations for single fiscal year appropriations must be used obligated in the fiscal year for which they are provided unless the law provides that they shall be available for longer period of time all provisions in an appropriations act such as limitations on the use of funds expire at the end of the fiscal year unless the language of the act extends their period of effectiveness the president requests annual appropriations in his budget submitted each year in support of the presidents appropriations requests agencies submit justification materials to the house and senate appropriations committees these materials provide considerably more detail than is contained in the presidents budget and are used in support of agency testimony during appropriations subcommittee hearings on the presidents budget congress passes three main types of appropriations measures regular appropriations acts provide budget authority to agencies for the next fiscal year supplemental appropriations acts provide additional budget authority during the current fiscal year when the regular appropriation is insufficient or to finance activities not provided for in the regular appropriation continuing appropriations acts provide stopgap or fullyear funding for agencies that have not received regular appropriation in typical session congress acts on 12 regular appropriations bills and at least two supplemental appropriations measures because of recurring delays in the appropriations process congress also typically passes one or more continuing appropriations each year the scope and duration of these measures depend on the status of the regular appropriations bills and the degree of budgetary conflict between the president and congress in recent years congress has merged two or more of the regular appropriations acts for fiscal year into single omnibus appropriations act by precedent appropriations originate in the house of representatives in the house appropriations measures are originated by the appropriations committee when it marks up or reports the measure rather than being introduced by member beforehand before the full committee acts on the bill it is considered in the relevant appropriations subcommittee the house and senate appropriations committees have 12 parallel subcommittees the house subcommittees typically hold extensive hearings on appropriations requests shortly after the presidents budget is submitted in marking up their appropriations bills the various subcommittees are guided by the discretionary spending limits and the allocations made to them under section 302 of the 1974 congressional budget act the senate usually considers appropriations measures after they have been passed by the house when house action on appropriations bills is delayed however the senate sometimes expedites its actions by considering senatenumbered bill up to the stage of final passage upon receipt of the housepassed bill in the senate it is amended with the text that the senate already has agreed to as single amendment and then passed by the senate hearings in the senate appropriations subcommittees generally are not as extensive as those held by counterpart subcommittees in the house the basic unit of an appropriation is an account single unnumbered paragraph in an appropriations act comprises one account and all provisions of that paragraph pertain to that account and to other unless the text expressly gives them broader scope any provision limiting the use of funds enacted in that paragraph is restriction on that account alone httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98721g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g157g145g142g561

relatively small number of accounts it is typical for federal agency to have single account for all its expenses of operation and additional accounts for other purposes such as construction accordingly most appropriation accounts encompass number of activities or projects the appropriation sometimes earmarks specific amounts to particular activities within the account but the more common practice is to provide detailed information on the amounts intended for each activity in other sources principally the committee reports accompanying the measures in addition to the substantive limitations and other provisions associated with each account each appropriations act has general provisions that apply to all of the accounts in title or in the whole act these general provisions appear as numbered sections usually at the end of the title or the act the standard appropriation is for single fiscal yearthe funds have to be obligated during the fiscal year for which they are provided they lapse if not obligated by the end of that year an appropriation that does not mention the period during which the funds are to be available is one year appropriation congress also makes noyear appropriations by specifying that the funds shall remain available until expended noyear funds are carried over to future years even if they have not been obligated congress sometimes makes multiyear appropriations which provide for funds to be available for two or more fiscal years appropriations measures also contain other types of provisions that serve specialized purposes these include provisions that liquidate pay off obligations made pursuant to certain contract authority reappropriate funds provided in previous years transfer funds from one account to another rescind funds or release deferred funds or set ceilings on the amount of obligations that can be made under permanent appropriations on the amount of direct or guaranteed loans that can be made or on the amount of administrative expenses that can be incurred during the fiscal year in addition to providing funds appropriations acts often contain substantive limitations on government agencies detailed information on how funds are to be spent along with other directives or guidance is provided in the reports accompanying the various appropriations measures agencies ordinarily abide by report language in spending the funds appropriated by congress the appropriations reports do not comment on every item of expenditure report language is most likely when the appropriations committee prefers to spend more or less on particular item than the president has requested or when the committee wants to earmark funds for particular project or activity when particular item is mentioned by the committee there is strong expectation that the agency will adhere to the instructions g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 article i section 8 of the

referred subsequently to the ways and means committee most revenues derive from existing provisions of the tax code or social security law which continue in effect from year to year unless changed by congress this tax structure can be expected to produce increasing amounts of revenue in future years as the economy expands and incomes rise nevertheless congress usually makes some changes in the tax laws each year either to raise or lower revenues or to redistribute the tax burden congress typically acts on revenue legislation pursuant to proposals in the presidents budget an early step in congressional work on revenue legislation is publication by cbo of its own estimates developed in consultation with the joint tax committee of the revenue impact of the presidents budget proposals the congressional estimates often differ significantly from those presented in the presidents budget the revenue totals in the budget resolution establish the framework for subsequent action on revenue measures the budget resolution contains only revenue totals and total recommended changes it does not allocate these totals among revenue sources although it does set out medicare receipts separately nor does it specify which provisions of the tax code are to be changed the house and senate often consider major revenue measures such as the tax reform act of 1986 under their regular legislative procedures however as has been the case with direct spending programs many of the most significant changes in revenue policy in recent years have been made in the context of the reconciliation process although revenue changes usually are incorporated into omnibus budget reconciliation measures along with spending changes and sometimes debtlimit increases revenue reconciliation legislation may be considered on separate legislative track eg the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 when the reconciliation process is used to advance revenue reductions or spending increases that would lead to deficit or would enlarge an existing deficit section 313 of the 1974 congressional budget act referred to as the senates byrd rule limits the legislative changes to the period covered by the reconciliation directives accordingly some recent tax cuts have been subject to sunset dates in enacting revenue legislation congress often establishes or alters tax expenditures the term tax expenditures is defined in the 1974 congressional budget act to include revenue losses due to deductions exemptions credits and other exceptions to the basic tax structure tax expenditures are means by which the federal government pursues public policy objectives and can be regarded as alternatives to other policy instruments such as grants or loans the joint tax committee estimates the revenue effects of legislation changing tax expenditures and it also publishes fiveyear projections of these provisions as an annual committee print

the frequency of congressional action to raise the debt limit has ranged in the past from several times in one year to once in several years when the federal government incurred large and growing

raise the public debt limit falls under the jurisdiction of the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee although consideration of such measures in the house usually is constrained through the use of special rules senate action sometimes is far ranging with regard to the issues covered in the past the senate has added many nongermane provisions to debtlimit measures such as the 1985 balanced budget act in 1979 the house amended its rules to provide for the automatic engrossment of measure increasing the debt limit upon final adoption of the conference report on

house and senate could enact debtlimit legislation originating under the gephardt rule or arising under conventional legislative procedures during the past decade congress has enacted debtlimit increases as part of omnibus budget reconciliation measures continuing appropriations acts and other legislation the house recodified the gephardt rule as house rule xxiii at the beginning of the 106

significant budget policies section 310 of the 1974 congressional budget act sets forth special procedure for the development and consideration of reconciliation legislation reconciliation legislation is used by congress to bring existin g revenue and spending law into conformity with the policies in the budget resolution reconciliation is an optional process but congress has used it more years than not during the period covering 1980 through 2007 19 reconciliation measures were enacted into law and three were vetoed the reconciliation process has two stagesthe adoption of reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution and the enactment of reconciliation legislation that implements changes in revenue or spending laws although reconciliation has been used since 1980 specific procedures tend to vary from year to year reconciliation is used to change the amount of revenues budget authority or outlays generated by existing law in few instances reconciliation has been used to adjust the public debt limit on the spending side the process focuses on entitlement laws it may not be used however to impel changes in social security law reconciliation sometimes has been applied to discretionary authorizations which are funded in annual appropria tions acts but this is not the usual practice reconciliation was used in the 1980s and into the 1990s as deficitreduction tool beginning in the latter part of the 1990s some reconciliation measures were used principally to reduce revenues thereby increasing the deficit at the beginning of the 110 th congress both chambers adopted rules requiring that reconciliation be used solely for deficit reduction httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98721g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g157g145g142g561

committees to report legislation changing existing law or pending legislation these instructions have three components 1 they name the committee or committees that are directed to report legislation 2 they specify the amounts by which existing laws are to be changed but do not identify how these changes are to be made which laws are to be altered or the programs to be affected and 3 they usually set deadline by which the designated committees are to recommend the changes in law the instructions typically cover the same fiscal years covered by the budget resolution sometimes budget resolutions have provided for more than one reconciliation measure to be considered during session the dollar amounts are computed with reference to the cbo baseline thus change represents the amount by which revenues or spending would decrease or increase from baseline levels as result of changes made in existing law this computation is itself based on assumptions about the future level of revenues or spending under current law or policy and about the dollar changes that would ensue from new legislation hence the savings associated with the reconciliation process are assumed savings the actual changes in revenues or spending may differ from those estimated when the reconciliation instructions are formulated although the instructions do not mention the programs to be changed they are based on assumptions as to the savings or deficit reduction or in some cases increases that would result from particular changes in revenue provisions or spending programs these program assumptions are sometimes printed in the reports on the budget resolution even when the assumptions are not published committees and members usually have good idea of the specific program changes contemplated by the reconciliation instructions committee has discretion to decide on the legislative changes to be recommended it is not bound by the program changes recommended or assumed by the budget committees in the reports accompanying the budget resolution further committee has to recommend legislation estimated to produce dollar changes for each category delineated in the instructions to it when budget resolution containing reconciliati on instruction has been approved by congress the instruction has the status of an order by the house and senate to designated committees to recommend legislation usually by date certain it is expected that committees will carry out the instructions of their parent chamber but the 1974 congressional budget act does not provide any sanctions against committees that fail to do so

when more than one committee in the house and senate is subject to reconciliation directives the proposed legislative changes usually are consolidated by the budget committees into an omnibus bill the 1974 congressional budget act does not permit the budget committees to revise substantively the legislation recommended by the committees of jurisdiction this restriction pertains even when the budget committees estimate that the proposed legislation will fall short of the dollar changes called for in the instructions sometimes the budget committees working with the leadership develop alternatives to the committee recommendations to be offered as floor amendments so as to achieve greater compliance with the reconciliation directives

reconciliation legislation in either the house or the senate be deficit neutral to meet this requirement an amendment reducing revenues or increasing spending must offset these deficit increases by equivalent revenue increases or spending cuts during the first several years experience with reconciliation the legislation contained many provisions that were extraneous to the purpose of reducing the deficit the reconciliation submissions of committees included such things as provisions that had budgetary effect that increased spending or reduced revenues or that violated another committees jurisdiction in 1985 the senate adopted rule commonly referred to as the byrd rule on temporary basis as means of curbing these practices the byrd rule has been extended and modified several times over the years in 1990 the byrd rule wa s incorporated into the 1974 congressional budget act as section 313 and made permanent although the house has rule comparable to the senates byrd rule it may use other devices to control the inclusion of extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation in particular the house has used special rules to make in order amendments that strike such matter

2006 by the house and senate but the two chambers did not come to resolution of the issue the issue has been addressed again by both chambers during the 110th congress while definitions of earmarking vary an earmark generally is considered to be an allocation of resources to specificallytargeted beneficiaries either through earmarks of discretionary or direct spending limited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits earmarks may be proposed by the president or may be originated by congress concern about existing earmarking practices arose because some of them were inserted into legislation or accompanying reports without any identification of the sponsor and the belief that many earmarks were not subject to proper scrutiny and diverted resources to lesserpriority items or items without sufficient justification thereby contributing to wasteful spending or revenue loss the essential feature of earmark reform proposals is bar against the consideration of legislation that does not identify individual earmarks and the members who sponsored them the distribution of such information in way that makes it readily available before the legislation is considered and certification by earmark sponsors that neither they nor their spouses have financial interest in the earmark an earmark reform provision requiring the identification of earmarks and their sponsors before legislation may be considered and imposing other restrictions on the use of earmarks was contained in title iv section 404 of the houses rules package for the 110 th congress hres 6 adopted on january 5 2007 the

authorized activities therefore when an agency fails to use all or part of an appropriation it deviates from the intentions of congress the impoundment control act of 1974 prescribes rules and procedures for instances in which available funds are impounded an impoundment is an action or inaction by the president or federal agency that delays or withholds the obligation or expenditure of budget authority provided in law the 1974 impoundment control act divides impoundments into two categories and establishes distinct procedures for each deferral delays the use of funds rescission is

practice they are limited to major actions that affect the level or rate of expenditure as general practice only deliberate curtailments of expenditure are reported as impoundments actions having other purposes that incidently affect the rate of spending are not recorded as impoundments for example if an agency were to delay the award of contract because of dispute with vendor the delay would not be an impoundment if the delay were for the purpose of reducing an expenditure it would be an impoundment the line between routine administrative actions and impoundments is not clear and

congress specifying the amount to be rescinded the accounts and programs involved the estimated fiscal and program effects and the reasons for the rescission multiple rescissions can be grouped in single message after the message has been submitted to it congress has 45 days of continuous session usually larger number of calendar days during which it can pass rescission bill congress may rescind all part or none of the amount proposed by the president if congress does not approve rescission in legislation by the expiration of this period the president must make the funds available for

available beyond the fiscal year the president may defer the funds again in the next fiscal year at present the president may defer only for the reasons set forth in the antideficiency act including to provide for contingencies to achieve savings made possible by or through changes in requirements or greater efficiency of operations and as specifically provided by law he may not defer funds for policy reasons for example to curtail overall federal spending or because he is opposed to particular program the comptroller general reviews all proposed rescissions and deferrals and advises congress of their legality and possible budgetary and program effects the comptroller general also notifies congress of any rescission or deferral not reported by the president and may reclassify an

individual items in legislation that he proposed not go into effect the identification was based not just upon the statutory language but on the entire legislative history and documentation the president had to notify congress promptly of his proposals and provide supporting information cong ress had to respond within limited period of time by enacting law if it wanted to disapprove the
