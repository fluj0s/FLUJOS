summary solid gas hydrates are potentially huge resource of natural gas for the united states the us geological survey estima ted that there are about 85 trillion cubic feet tcf of technically recoverable gas hydrates in northern alaska the minerals management service estimated mean value of 21000 tcf of inplace gas hydrates in the gulf of mexico by comparison tota l us natural gas consumption is about 23 tcf annually the inplace estimate disregards technical or economical recoverability and likely overestimates the am ount of commercially viable gas hydrates even if fraction of the us gas hydrates can be economically produced however it could add substantially to the 1300 tcf of technically recoverable us conve ntional natural gas reserves to date however gas hydrat have confirme d commercial production gas hydrates are both potential resource and risk representing significant hazard to conventional oil and gas drilling and production ope rations if the solid gas hydrates dissociate suddenly and release expanded gas during offshore dr illing they could disrupt the marine sediments and compromise pi pelines and production equipment on the seafloor the tendency of gas hydrates to dissociate and release methane which can be hazard is the same characteristic that research and development efforts strive to enhance so that methane can be produced and recovered in commercial quantities developing gas hydrates into commercially viable source of energy is goal of the us department of energy doe methane hy drate program initially authorized by the methane hydrate research and developm ent act of 2000 pl 106193 the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 subtitle f 968 extended the authorization through fy2010 and authorized tota l appropriations of 155 milli on over fiveyear period gas hydrates occur naturally onshore in perm afrost and at or below the seafloor in sediments where water and gas combine at low temperatures and high pressures to form an icelike solid substance1 methane or natural gas is typically the dominant gas in the hydrate structure in gas hydrate frozen water molecules form cagelike structure around high concentrations of natural gas the gas hydrate structure is very compacthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22990crs2 2 us department of energy energy information agency eia at httpwwweiadoegov cneafcoalquarterlyco2_articleco2html

global proved reserves of conventional natural gas are over continuedwhen heated and depressurized to temper atures and pressures typically found on the earths surface one atmos phere of pressure and 70o fahrenheit its volume expands by 150 to 170 times thus one cubic foot of solid gas hydrate found underground in permafrost or beneath the seafloor woul d produce between 150 to 170 cubic feet of natural gas when brought to the surface gas hydrates are potentially huge global ergy resource the united states and other countries with territory in the arctic or with offshore gas hydrates along their continental margins are interested in deve loping the resource countries currently pursuing national research and development programs include japan india korea and china among others although burning natural gas produces carbon dioxide co2 greenhouse gas the amount of co2 liberated per unit of energy produced is less than 60 of the co2 produced from burning coal2 in addition the united states imports 20 of its natural gas consumed each year3 increasing the us supply of natural gas from gas hydrates would decrease the nations relian ce on imported gas and reduce us emissions of co2 if domestically produced gas hydrates substitute for coal as an energy source gas hydrate resources there are several challenges to commercially exploiting gas hydrates how much and where gas hydrate occurs in commercially viable concentrations are not well known and how the resource can be extracted safely and economically is current research focus estimates of global gas hydrate resour ces which range from at least 100000 tcf to possibly much more may greatly overestimate how much gas can be extracted economically reports of vast gas hydrat resources can be misleading unless those estimates are qualified by the use of such terms such as inplace resources technically recoverable resources and proved reserves the term inplace is used to describe an estimate of gas hydrate resources without regard for technical or economical recoverability generally these are the largest estimates undiscovered technically recoverable resources are producible using current technology but this doe s not take into account economic viability proved reserves are estimated quan tities that can be recovered under existing economic and operating conditions for example the us department of energys energy information agency eia estimates that total undiscove red technically recoverabl conventional natural gas resources in the united states are approxima tely 1300 tcf but proved reserves are only 200 tcf4 this is an important distinction because there are proved reserves for gashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22990crs3 4 continued 6185 tcf see eia at httpwwweiadoeg ovemeuaerpdfpagessec4_3pdf and http

the interio rs us geological survey usgs and minerals management service mms have reported only inplace estimates of us gas hydrate resources however novemb er 12 2008 usgs estima of undiscovered technically recoverable gas hydrates in nor thern alaska probably represents the most robust effort to identify gas hydrates that ma be commercially viable sources of energy5 despite lack of production history the usgs report cites growing body of evidence indicating that some gas hydrate resources such as those in northern alaska might be produced with existing technology despite only limited field testing gas hydrates on the north slope alaska the usgs assessment indicates that the north slope of alaska may hos t about 85 tcf of undi scovered technically recoverable gas hydrate

of gas hydrate resources for the gulf of mexico7 the report gives statistical probability of the volume of undiscovered inplac gas hydrate resources with mean estimate of over 21000 tcf the mms report estimates how much gas hydrate may occur in sandstone and shale reservoirs using combination of data and modeling but does not indicate how much is recoverabl with current technology the report notes that porous and permeable sa ndstone reservoirs have the greatest potential for actually producing gas from hydrates and gives m ean estimate of over 6700 tcf of sandstone hosted gas hydrates about 30 of the tota l mean estimate for the gulf of mexico8 even for sandstone reservoirs however the inpl ace estimates for gas hydrates in the gulf of mexico likely far exceed what may be commerc ially recoverable with current technology the mms is planning similar inplace gas hydr ate assessments for other portions of the us outer continental shel f ocs including alaska gas hydrates along continental margins globally the amount of gas hydrate to be found offshore along tinental margins probably exceeds the amount found onshore in permafrost regions by tw orders of magnitude according to one estimate9 with the exception of the assessments discussed above none of the global gas hydrate estimates is well defined and all are speculative to some extent10 one way to depict the potential size and producibility of global gas hydrate resources is by using resource pyramid figure 2 11 the apex of the pyramid shows the smallest but most promising gas hydrate reservoir arctic and marine sandstones which may host tens to hundreds of tcf the bottom of the pyra mid shows the largest but most technically challenging reservoir marine shales httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22990crs5 12 timothy s

newsletter fall 2006 gas hydrate hazards gas hydrates are significant haza rd for drilling and production operations12 gas hydrate production is hazardous in itself as well as for conventiona l oil and gas activities that place wells and pipelines into permafro st or marine sedime nts for activities in permafrost two general categor ies of problems have been id entified 1 uncontrolled gas releases during drilling and 2 damage to well casing during and after installation of well similar problems could occur during offshore drilling into gas hydratebearing marine sediments offshore drilling operations that disturb gas hydratebearing sediments could fracture or disrupt the bottom sedime nts and compromise the wellbore pipelines rig supports and other equipment involved in oil and gas production from the seafloor13 problems may differ somewhat between onshore and offshore operations but they stem from the same characteristic of gas hydr ates decreases in pressure andor increases in temperature can cause the gas hydrate to dissociate and rapidl release large amounts of gas into the well bore during drilling operation oil and gas wells drilled thr ough permafrost or offshore to reach conventional oil and gas deposits may encounter gas hydrates which companies generally try to avoid because of lack of detaile d understanding of the mechani cal and thermal properties of figure 2 gas hydrate reservoir pyramidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22990crs6 14 moridis and kowalski 2006 15 collett and dallimore 2002 16 personal communication ray boswell mana ger methane

wells are cased typically using steel pipe that lines the wall of the borehole to separate and pr otect the well from the gas hydrates in the shallower zones as drilling continues deeper unless precau tions are taken tinued drilling may heat up the sediments surrounding the wellbore cau sing gas from the dissociated hydrates to leak and bubble up around the casing once il production begins hot fluids flowing through the well could also warm hydrateb earing sediments and cause dissociation the released gas may pool and build up pressure against the well casing possibly causing damage15 some observers suggest that exploiting the gas hydrate resources by intentionally heating or by depressurization poses the same risks requiring mitigation as drilling through gas hydrates to reach deeper conventional oil and gas deposits16 gas hydrate research and development goal of the doe methane hydrate research and development rd program is to develop knowledge and technology to llow commercial

assessing commercially viab gas hydrate deposits both projects have international and industry partners researchers identify need to better understand how geology in the permafrost regions and on continental ma rgins controls the occurrence and formation of methane hydrates18 they underscore the need to unders tand fundamental aspects porosity permeability reservoir temperatures of the geologic framework that hosts the gas hydrate resource to improve assessment and exploration to mitigate the hazard and to enhance gas recovery together with advances in rd economic viability will depend on the relative cost of conventional fuels as well as other factors such as pipe lines and other infrastructure needed to deliver gas hydrate methane to market additionally price volatility
