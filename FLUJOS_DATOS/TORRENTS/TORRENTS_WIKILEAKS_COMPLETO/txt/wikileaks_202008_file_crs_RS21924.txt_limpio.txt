extent permitted by law agencies must adopt the principles in the eo existing laws governing three social service programs have provisions barring religious discrimination in employment head start1 the workforce investment act wia2 and substance abuse and mental health block grant funds under the public health services act3 the house voted in 2003 to repeal the head start and wia prohibitions on religious discrimination in employment head start on july 25 hr 2210 and wia on may 8 hr 1261 the senates counterpart measures s 1940 and s 1627 lacked these provisions in both cases there was final congressional action in the 108th congress in its final rule governing substance abuse and mental health services administration samsha charitable choice provisions the bush administration held that religious nondiscrimination hiring rules of samsha law are inapplicable to religious organizations that demonstrate that the rules would substantially burden their exercise of religion the administration maintained that the religious freedom restoration act of 1993 pl 103141 forbids the government from substantially burdening persons httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21924 exercise of religious unless this is the least restrictive way to further compelling government interest charitable choice regulations between january 4 and july 16 2004 the departments of agriculture education health and human services hhs housing and urban development hud justice labor and veterans affairs issued final regulations to incorporate charitable choice principles in their social service programs the cardinal charitable choice rule is that religious organizations should be eligible to compete for funding on the same basis as other organizations this repudiates the doctrine that public funds given to pervasively sectarian organizations violate the constitution by promoting religion the new regulations spell out the terms under which faithbased organizations can provide federally funded services as follows 1 federal funds directly received by an organization cannot be used to pay for inherently religious activities such as worship religious instruction or proselytization 2 if the organization engages in religious activities it must offer them separately in time or location from services paid with direct federal funds 3 if federal funds are received indirectly by an organization through vouchers or certificates as the result of the independent choice of the beneficiary the money may finance religious activities 4 religious organizations that provide federally funded services retain their independence and may continue to carry out their mission 5 the organization may give preference to coreligionists in hiring staff unless the law 1 section 654 of the head start act requires each head start grant or contract to specifically provide that person with responsibilities in operation of the program will discriminate with respect to the program project or activity because of creed or belief among other factors 2 section 188 of wia provides that person shall be denied employment because of religion among other factors 3 the public health service act provides that one shall be excluded from denied benefits of or subjected to discrimination under program or activity receiving block grants from the substance abuse and mental health services administration samsha on grounds of religion courts have held that these prohibitions against religious discrimination apply to employment practices as well as to beneficiary service crs3 of specific program prohibits this4 and 6 the organization must not discriminate on religious grounds in providing the social service many of the new regulations drop longstanding restrictions examples follow the department of education has eliminated rule barring use of its grants for services provided by school or department of divinity the labor department has rescinded rule against having religious services on the same premises as job corps centers the department of veterans affairs longer requires that religious providers of services for the homeless certify that they will not exert religious influence in their program and it longer prohibits religious preference in hiring by religious organizations hud has rescinded rule barring religious groups from directly owning housing projects the new rules of hud and the department of agriculture permit federal funds to be used to acquire construct or repair structure used for provision of both secular services and religious activities so long as the governmentsponsored areas are not the principal place of worship agriculture department regulations clarify preexisting practice under which religious schools that receive school lunch funds may require their students to attend religious classes the justice department has dropped rule barring religious groups from ever making religious use of certain property transferred to them for social httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21924 service purposes and now permits religious usage after five years justice department regulations also allow use of federal funds to pay for chaplains to work with inmates in penal institutions missing from the new regulations is major provision of the housepassed hr 7 requirement that beneficiary who objects to provider on grounds of religion be offered an alternate and accessible provider hhs declined to include this requirement but noted in the preamble to its regulations that one commentor insisted that redeemable vouchers that give beneficiaries choices between programs are only as real as the choices among programs asked by one commentor for definition of faithbased hhs said that it used the terms religious organization and faithbased organization interchangeably it added that neither the us constitution nor the relevant supreme court precedents contain comprehensive definition of religion or religious organization the bush administration has pursued its faithbased initiative vigorously setting up offices of faithbased and community initiatives ofbcis in 10 agencies and the white house the white house ofbci has conducted an outreach campaign sponsoring regional conferences and agency ofbcis have sponsored workshops offering technical help in applying for federal funds in his 2004 state of the union address president bush said he wanted congress to codify the regulatory expansion of charitable choice 4 the workforce investment act wia and head start law bar specifically bar religious discrimination in employment program employment court rulings have held that samsha law prohibitions against religious discrimination apply to program employment but the administration has taken the stand that the religious freedom restoration act of 1993 may override this crs4 table 1 major provisions of the charitable choice expansion act and executive order 13279 charitable choice expansion act of 2001 eo 13279 lists
