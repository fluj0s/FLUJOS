recent nomination of judge samuel lito jr to serve as an associate justice on the us supreme court has generated considerable intere st in his judicial opinions during his 15 years as an appellate judge judge alito has served on the united states court of appeals for the third circuit since april 30 1990 this report is based on revi ew of all the reported envi ronmental decisions of the third circuit in which judge alito was on the threejudge panel that initially decided the case or in the banc group of judges that heard the case on review of the panel decision1 it does not confine itself as did the recently reported washington post study to third circuit opinions in which there was dissent2 we construe environmental broadly to include insurance c overage fourth amendment nd other issues arising in an environmental context and in cluded 34 decisions in our review not surprisingly given the heavy concentration of industrial activity in some of the states within the

convictions for having held 20000person gathering in national forest without permitcircuit3 fully dozen of these decisions invol ve liability for cleanup of contaminated sites under federal or state superfund laws judge alitos environmental decisions generally generally judge alitos environmental decisions are based on straightforward readings of statutes and regulations with little disposition to infer rights or duties not clearly stated they contain little in the way of broad philosophical statements his opinions reveal obvious bias either for or against environmental causes per in the 20 opinions out of 34 in which it seemed ther was clear environmental side to the arguments in the case judge alito took th environmental side in ten and took the contrary position in the other ten4 this 5050 split could be better interpreted however if we possessed information on whether it is typical of appellate judges generally5 suggestive of judge alitos lack of any agenda in the environmental area is that with the exception of the insurancecoverage decisions the cases reviewed showed environmental decisions in which he dissented that is he was never out on limb by himself similarly of all the decisions reviewed judge alito himself authored majority or dissenting opinion in 11 but four of th arose in the four insurancecoverage decisions subtracting these out judge alito wrote in only seven out of 30 environmental rulings in which he participated judge alitos environmental cases f ound him favoring the prosecution side in criminal cases as commentators have observed is typically his wont for example in two fourth amendment cases judge alito join ed unanimous panels upholding warrantless coast guard searches of vessels seekin g evidence of unlawful oil

2000judge alitos decisions on larger jurisprude ntial issues likely to affect environmental cases while judge alitos decisions authored or joined reveal obvious sentiment as to environmental suits per they argu ably suggest his ndorsement of larger jurisprudential principles that may pres ent hurdles to environmental suits agency enforcement and cong ressional legislating 1 standing probably the most prominent of potential hurdles is judge alitos view on standing to the extent it can be inferred from his joining the twojudge majority opinion in public interest research group of new jersey v magnesium elektron inc 7 clean water act citizen suit the majority opinion found that plaintiffs pirg and friends of the earth could not establish organizational standing to challenge manufacturers multiple violations of its npdes permit8 through discharges into creek that flowed into canal and river to establish organizational sta nding blackletter law has it that these groups have to show that some of their members have standing to sue on their own which in the majoritys view they could not do it wa s not enough said the majority that four of the groups members fished and recreated ss in the canal and river based on their concerns about the multiple upstream pe rmit violations those members had not demonstrated actual injury to the waterways the court below had accepted the testimony of magnesium elektrons expert limnologists who found that the companys discharges had not actually harmed the creek recreating less without actual injury to the affected waterways the majority said does not satisfy the injury in fact element of the supreme courts constitutional standing test9 the view of injury in fact endorsed by the majority opinion joined by judge alito was stringent one it required considerable evidentiary showing by plaintiffs in the threshold portion of their case as to matters harm to the environment that were not part of the case on the merits discharge in exceedance of permit limits regardless of harm to the environment three years later the supreme court came to the opposite view coincidentally also in clean water act citizensuit case in friends of the earth inc v laidlaw environmental services toc 10 inc the court held 72 that the relevant showing for article iii standing is not injury to the environment but injury to the plaintiff to insist on the former rather than the latter is to raise the standing hurdle higher than the necessary showing for success on the merits in an action alleging noncompliance withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22359crs4

joined by justice thomas articulated general demand for environmental injury as part of standing similar to that of the majority view joined by judge alito in magnesium elektron 2 agency evidentiary burden as in magnesium elektron in connection with standing judge alito appears to favor high evidentiary hurdles for agencies defending administrative procedure act challenges at least based on the key decision on point in wr grace co v us epa 12 judge alito joined twojudge majority opinion v acating as arbitrary and capricious an epa emergency order under the safe drinking wa ter act the epa order had sought to protect citys drinking water wells fro m an ammonia groundwater plume emanating from the companys nearby fertilizer plant in support of its ruling the majority opinion contended that technical study had been done to determine the appropriate ammonia standard hence epas adoption in the or der of 12 mgl standard was unjustified moreover the majority said epa provided rational basis for selecting the remedy it chose cleanup of the aquifer to 12 mgl when consultant had c oncluded that another approach would also be effective the dissenting judge argued that given the emergency public health context high degree of defe rence to epas decision was called for and given such deference the agencys action was adequately justified in contrast with the foregoing evidenceintensive case judge alito shows himself as more deferential to epa when it comes to the agencys interpretation of its statutory authority13 3 federalism commerce clause many federal environmental statutes are based on congress power under the commerce clause14 that being so the supreme court s renewed interest in the clause as part of its renewed interest in the constitutional relationship between the federal government and the states generally has been of special interest in the environmental area since the courts seminal commerce clause decisions in lopez15 and morrison

rationales that the ban was not violation of the commerce cl ause as noted in separate crs report federalism selected opin ions of judge samuel alito judge alitos dissent appears to be an argument for more limited interpretation of the commerce clause than is consistent with current case law20 the reader is referred to that report for extended analysis 4 federalism eleventh amendment and state sovereign immunity second federalismtype c onstraint on congress power derives from the eleventh amendment the arcane terms of this amendment have been read expansively by the supreme court to embody but not to exhaus t broad principles of state sovereign immunity the amendment bars congress from authorizing private lawsuits against the states unless one of veral exceptions applies21 of importance here is the exception allowing congress to abrogate state sove reign immunity through its authority under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment to enforce the guarantees of that amendment the eleventh amendment constraints on federal environmental statutes are limited in scope and arguably much less important than those unde r the commerce clause should it be narrowed by the supreme court the amendment bars actions against only states not their political subdivisions or nongovern mental actors and only by private entities not other states or the united states envi ronmentally related private actions against states those not covered by the ame ndments exceptions arise principally in connection with nonsovereign state activity eg state ownership of solid waste landfills the amendment has also insulated states from whistle blower actions brought under federal environmental stat utes by state employees alle ging retaliatory treatment by their state employershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22359crs6 22 226 f3d 223 3d cir 2000 23 crs report rl33214 supra note 20 at 15in chittister v dept of co mmunity and economic devpmt 22 judge alito wrote for
