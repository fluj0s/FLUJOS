6108c29 shspec46 basics of auditing good auditing is not question of memorizing the rules of auditing if you are worried about the rules of auditing theres something basically wrong per the original thesis auditor pc is greater than the bank and the auditor is there to see that auditing gets done to direct the pcs attention so as to confront unknowns to straighten out the bank the less auditing you do or the less effective auditing you do the more upset the pc will be when the auditor sits down in the auditing chair and the pc in the pc chair what contract exists very simple the pc sits down to be audited ie to get on towards clear even if he doesnt know it consciously hes not there to have arc breaks run ptps handled or to straighten out his rudiments in fact ruds go out to the degree that auditing doesnt get done if you use the whole session to put ruds in or if you spend time on it little or auditing gets done somewhere in here is the optimum amount of time spent on ruds say five minutes if you spend most of the session getting ruds in hes got new ptp how to get auditing he doesnt consider ruds to be auditing so hes out of session he thinks auditing is things getting done towards going clear so your main chance is to audit the pc if it gets to choice between auditing and some obscure rud that his attention isnt on to the pc auditing is handling anything his attention is fixed on eg the hidden standard chronic ptps goals etc if you endlessly handle arc breaks you get more because you are creating ptp violating the contract with the pc he will sit there and endlessly run routine 1a because its in the direction of his problems do keep the ruds in but dont make session out of them the pc will protest strongly against handling his minor ptps he assigns high value to his auditing time and wants to use it towards his goal of going clear if an auditor takes positive controlling downtobusiness approach his pcs will swear by him because he audits escape as philosophy is complicated subject it has to do with the orientation of an auditor its the only thing that can get in his road as long as he follows scientology and goes on auditing all the levels of the prehav scale have to do with escape if any of them is hot or unflat on auditor youll get the auditor letting the pc escape because its his modus operandi of handling situations its totally wrongheaded as far as getting the pc clear is concerned this is why an auditor doesnt control session when he doesnt he thinks hes being nice to the pc under the same heading comes subjective case reality that is necessary in an auditor what are we looking at when we find scientologist who has never seen or gone through an engram never collided with ridge is not aware of the thenness of incidents if he is not aware of those things he will continue to make mistakes and amount of training will overcome it just knowing this will overcome it if he has never been stuck on the track has never seen ridges its because his basic philosophy of life is escape he doesnt have case reality because hes running from his case his way to handle case is to get out of it so thats all he does with pc so the pc is never in session its pure kindness from the auditors point of view one way to do this is to change the process another is to q and the auditor shortsightedly gives the pc freedom at the price of not getting him clear the auditor who has case reality dramatizes the engram hes stuck in and which hes trying to escape by not confronting when he gets into the engram what hell see is what he looked at to avoid confronting the pain or unpleasantness which he suppressed to escape from it he escapes mentally unconsciousness is an escape it works cf red blanchard and his blackouts this person will have odd somatics and difficulties that he cant account for he cant see the pictures because hes putting his attention on the solution escape all the mechanisms of notis will be present here if he contacts the engram at all itll be very brief he pulls his attention right off of it but he will have somatic that doesnt notis hes stuck in pt which is really the ends of all his engrams so he will keep his pc in pt at all times because the auditor is in pt he wont guide the pcs attention through an engram because escape is the better philosophy theres direct cure for this oneshot process that gives these auditors an enormous reality on what were running namely what unknown might you be trying to escape from this unstacks all those notised engrams youre running the reverse of escape which is confront you dont have to erase the whole bank you can just get familiarity with it the mechanism of escape is one used widely by thetans of course thetan would be in bad way if when his body dies he couldnt exteriorize its not bad thing to be able to escape but when someone is compulsively escaping he never escapes escape as philosophy gets in the road of auditing case reality is necessary in the auditor ie willingness to stay there and take look person who doesnt have reality on the bank has consistently escaped from bank he of course does odd things in auditing when he audits pc he doesnt know what the pc is doing or thinks he shouldnt be doing it so we get clearing if you as an auditor pull the pcs attention away from the incident hes running he gets confused sticks there feels betrayed you could educate that auditor endlessly without producing any change in that philosophy unless you hit the philosophy itself you cannot educate an auditor who has that philosophy into giving smooth session keeping the pc in session with his attention on his bank when an auditor makes consistent mistakes does lot of q and yanks the pcs attention to pt we assume that that auditor has the philosophy of escape theres sense in putting up laws to counter it just spot it and handle it about responsibility for the session from the original thesis you have the law of auditor pc greater than the bank and pc less than the bank thus for instance selfauditing produces minor results at best it just remedies havingness on auditing selfauditing tends to happen when true auditing is scarce for instance by having an auditor whose philosophy is escape to handle this just audit reestablish the pcs confidence in the fact that he is being audited and will be audited if the preclear werent less than the bank the bank wouldnt give him any trouble even though hes creating the bank hes created something out of control someone whos aberrated is less than the bank someone whos psychotic is the bank being totally overwhelmed by the bank recognizing that one is auditing someone who is to degree overwhelmed by his bank and realizing the laws from the original thesis we should realize that the auditor has got to be running the pc at his bank to get anything done when the auditor withdraws from doing this he collapses the pcs bank back on the pc way to get major collapse of the pcs bank is to take direction of the pcs and follow it there are two reasons for this 1 the auditor is taking directions from the bank 2 the auditor has subtracted himself from the basic equation it looks to the pc as if only he is confronting the bank he loses the illusion that the auditor is confronting it too and his bank collapses on him the pc is now just selfauditing pcs do this out of anxiety to get auditing they take over responsibility and try to take control if you take one direction from the pc his bank collapses on him matter how reasonable his direction may seem this is the first time weve really looked at this mechanism its the primary method by which the auditor ceases to take responsibility for the session this may mean model session should be rewritten its there to give the illusion of courtesy thats all if the auditor doesnt want the pc to be butchered by the bank hed better stick by his ideas of what he should be doing matter how wrongheaded or upsetting those ideas may appear to be never do what the pc says matter how right he may be or how wrong you are if you take the pcs advice on some direction youve given him matter how screwy and uncompliable with your direction was youve made very major error and collapsed the pcs bank in on him you can also put pc at responsibility for the session by considering that pcs ought to do such and such that makes the pc responsible for the condition hes in in session this makes for the equation auditor pc is less than the bank this is failure to grant beingness to the pc in session pc is doing what he is doing and he should be doing what he is doing auditors code 14 considerations on top of this about what the pc should be doing interrupt responsibility for making the pc do something as long as your intentions are wrapped up with what the pc ought to be doing in inspecting pictures and so on you are making this occur the error is that instead of making the pc do or become what you want him to you add the sneak consideration the pc ought to this faintly implies im not responsible this winds up with collapsed bank the most prevalent kind of q and is where every time the pc says something you follow it this lets the pc spot what you should be auditing you are thus dropping your responsibility and you have permitted him to escape from the original question the pc never wants to handle what you want him to handle but he has been running away for trillions of years and knows quite well that he has to face up he just needs some backup on it this doesnt mean you must be totally unreasonable if the pc wants to go to the bathroom you can let him its not session direction but if he wants to go again five minutes later its an escape so you say invalidation is the basic overwhelm the pc says its my father you say it cant be you could run whole case probably with who has been invalidated what is death sickness or punishment but invalidation you are taking him on tour of the bank getting him familiar hell come out the other end not afraid dont let him escape with ruds or his own directions about what to do etc an auditor would win even if ignorant of fine points of tech if he followed these principles the pc must feel able to talk to the auditor so you dont shut him up when he tells you that something is wrong with the process or whatever auditors
