american national government government and finance division duration of continuing resolutions in recent years summary continuing appropriations acts commonly known as continuing resolutions have been an integral component of the annual appropriations process for decades whenever action on one or more of the regular appropriations acts for fiscal year is incomplete as the end of congressional session nears one issue that arises is the appropriate duration of any period for which continuing resolutions will be used continuing resolutions may have relatively short duration in the expectation that action on the regular appropriations acts will be concluded within several days or weeks alternatively continuing resolutions may have longer duration to postpone final action on appropriations decisions until after elections or into the beginning of the next congressional session finally continuing resolution may provide funding for the remainder of the fiscal year the duration of continuing resolution refers to the period for which continuing appropriations are made available for the use of agencies legislative provisions as opposed to funding provisions contained in continuing resolution may remain in effect for longer period even as permanent law the period ends either upon enactment of the applicable regular appropriations act or on an expiration date specified in the continuing resolution whichever occurs first over the past half century the timing patterns for congressional action on regular appropriations acts have varied considerably but tardy enactment has been recurring problem during the 57year period covering fy1952fy2008 all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted on time in only four instances fy1977 fy1989 fy1995 and fy1997 continuing resolutions were enacted for three of these fiscal years but continuing resolutions were enacted for fy1977 to fund certain unauthorized programs whose funding had been dropped from the regular appropriations acts further continuing resolutions were enacted for fy1953 even though all but one of the regular appropriations were enacted late fullyear continuing resolutions provide funding for one or more of the regular appropriations acts for the remainder of the fiscal year while congress has employed fullyear continuing resolutions on many occasions it has not done so consistently over time for each of the 11 fiscal years covering fy1978fy1988 congress enacted fullyear continuing resolution three years later congress enacted another fullyear continuing resolution for fy1992 most recently full year continuing resolution was enacted for fy2007 during the past 11 fiscal years fy1998fy2008 congress provided funding under continuing resolutions for an average each year of about three and onehalf months 110 days the period for which continuing appropriations were provided in these 11 years ranged from 21 days to 365 days on average each of the 75 continuing resolutions enacted during this period lasted for about 16 days this report will be updated as developments warrant contents features of continuing resolutions 1 persistent need for continuing resolutions 3 use

resolutions in recent years continuing appropriations acts commonly known as continuing resolutions have been an integral component of the annual appropriations process for decades whenever action on the regular appropriations acts for fiscal year is incomplete as the end of congressional session nears one issue that arises is the most appropriate duration of any period for which continuing resolutions will be used continuing resolutions may have relatively short duration in the expectation that action on the regular appropriations acts will be concluded within several days or weeks alternatively continuing resolutions may have longer duration to postpone final action on appropriations decisions until after elections or into the beginning of the next congressional session finally continuing resolution may provide funding for the remainder of the fiscal year this report provides information on congressional practices with respect to the duration of continuing resolutions including the use of fullyear measures and focuses particularly on the period covering fy1998fy2008 features of continuing resolutions the routine activities of most federal agencies are funded by means of annual appropriations provided in one or more of the regular appropriations acts1 when action on the regular appropriations acts is delayed congress turns to one or more continuing appropriations acts to provide stopgap funding2 in the absence of regular appropriations the failure to enact continuing appropriations in timely manner results in funding gap3 funding gaps usually require that affected federal agencies shut down and furlough many of their employees4 1 the number of regular appropriations acts varied between 11 and 14 during the past half century but was fixed at 13 for the period covering fy1968fy2005 realignment of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees at the beginning of the 109th congress reduced the number of regular appropriations acts beginning with fy2006 to 11 further realignment at the beginning of the 110th congress changed the number to 12 beginning with fy2008 2 for general information see crs report rl30343 continuing resolutions fy2008 action and brief overview of recent practices by sandy streeter 3 additional information on this topic is provided in crs report rs20348 federal funding gaps brief overview by robert keith 4 exceptions are made under law so that activities for certain authorized purposes such as protecting property and the safety of human life may continue during funding gap crs2 continuing appropriations acts commonly are referred to as continuing resolutions or crs because usually they provide continuing appropriations in the form of joint resolution rather than bill occasionally however continuing appropriations are provided in bill form in most of the years in which continuing resolutions have been used series of two or more have been enacted into law continuing resolutions may be designated by their order eg first continuing resolution second continuing resolution and so on or after the initial continuing resolution has been enacted designated merely as further continuing resolution the duration of continuing resolution refers to the period for which continuing appropriations are made available for the use of agencies legislative provisions as opposed to funding provisions contained in continuing resolution may remain in effect for longer period even as permanent law the period ends either upon enactment of the applicable regular appropriations act or on an expiration date specified in the continuing resolution whichever occurs first the duration of continuing resolution may vary for different agencies covered thereunder as an agencys regular appropriations act is enacted and its coverage under the continuing resolution ceases in addition continuing resolution may contain an expiration date for one or more agencies or programs that differs from the one that applies generally to the covered agencies and programs section 107 of pl 10884 117 stat 1043 the first continuing resolution for fy2004 which began on october 1 2003 set the duration of the measure at 31 days sec 107 unless otherwise provided for in this joint resolution or in the applicable appropriations act appropriations and funds made available and authority granted pursuant to this joint resolution shall be available until enactment into law of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in this joint resolution or b the enactment into law of the applicable appropriations act by both houses without any provision for such project or activity or c october 31 2003 whichever first occurs oftentimes subsequent continuing resolutions simply will replace the expiration date in the preceding continuing resolution with new one for example section 1 of the second continuing resolution for fy2004 pl 108104 117 stat 1200 stated that public law 10884 is amended by striking the date specified in section 107c and inserting november 7 2003 this action extended the duration of the preceding continuing resolution by seven days based upon their duration continuing resolutions may be classified as either partialyear or fullyear measures partialyear continuing resolutions provide funding for periods usually measured in days or weeks but sometimes months while fullyear continuing resolutions provide funding through september 30 of the next congressional session the last day of the fiscal year by enacting series of partialyear continuing resolutions congress secures increments of time for itself to complete action on some or all of the remaining crs3 regular appropriations acts before ending the congressional session the duration of the continuing resolutions may be shortened sometimes to single day to keep pressure on legislators to conclude their business or may be lengthened to weeks to accommodate lengthy negotiations or congressional recesses in some cases continuing resolutions have carried over into the next session when congress wanted to postpone making difficult political or policy decisions finally when it does not seem likely that one or more of the regular appropriations acts for fiscal year will be enacted separately fullyear continuing resolution may be used to complete legislative action continuing resolutions usually fund activities under formulatype approach that provides spending at restricted level such as at rate for operations not exceeding the current rate ie generally equivalent to the total amount of appropriations provided for the prior fiscal year the amount of funding available for particular activities often is increased when the regular appropriations act subsequently is enacted congress is not bound by these conventions in determining funding levels however and there have been several variations in practice in continuing resolutions over the years in addition continuing resolutions generally do not allow new activities to be initiated instead funding usually is available only for activities conducted during the past year and existing conditions and limitations on program activity are retained persistent need for continuing resolutions over the past half century the timing patterns for congressional action on regular appropriations acts have varied considerably but tardy enactment has been recurring problem during the 57year period covering fy1952fy2008 all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted on time in only four instances fy1977 fy1989 fy1995 and fy1997 continuing resolutions were enacted for three of these fiscal years but continuing resolutions were enacted for fy1977 to fund certain unauthorized programs whose funding had been dropped from the regular appropriations acts further continuing resolutions were enacted for fy1953 even though all but one of the regular appropriations were enacted late5 in an effort to reduce the reliance on continuing resolutions the congressional budget act of 1974 lengthened the time available for congress to act on annual appropriations measures by moving the start of the fiscal year back three months from july 1 to october 16 procedures under the act first were implemented fully for fy1977 during the preceding 25 fiscal years covering fy1952fy1976 congress did not once enact all of the regular appropriations acts on time as result one or 5 section 1414 of pl 82547 66 stat 661 made regular appropriations enacted late available as of july 1 1952 the first day of fy1953 and ratified any obligations incurred before their enactment 6 section 501 88 stat 321 of pl 93344 july 12 1974 this section later was replaced by the federal credit reform act of 1990 but the start of the fiscal year remains october 1 see 31 usc 1102 crs4 more continuing resolutions were enacted each year during this period except for fy19537 the change made by the 1974 act in the start of the fiscal year yielded immediate results all 13 of the regular appropriations acts for fy1977 were enacted on time despite this achievement two continuing resolutions were enacted to fund certain unauthorized programs that had been excluded from the regular appropriations acts the initial success was shortlived and congressional reliance on continuing resolutions has persisted in the ensuing years after fy1977 all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted on time in only three other instances for fy1989 fy1995 and fy1997 consequently one or more continuing resolutions were needed each year during this period except for these three fiscal years in most years more than one continuing resolution was needed as congress worked to complete action on the regular appropriations acts the number of continuing resolutions enacted for fiscal year during the period covering fy1977 fy2008 ranged from zero to 21 on average about five continuing resolutions were enacted each year during this interval use of fullyear continuing resolutions fullyear continuing resolutions provide funding for one or more of the regular appropriations acts for the remainder of the fiscal year ie through june 30 for fy1976 and prior years and through september 30 for fy1977 and subsequent years they represent determination by congress to abandon any further efforts to enact separately any unfinished regular appropriations acts for the fiscal year and to bring the annual appropriations process for that year to close except for the later consideration of supplemental appropriations acts while congress has employed fullyear continuing resolutions on many occasions it has not done so consistently over time prior to the full implementation of the 1974 congressional budget act for fy1977 fullyear continuing resolutions were used periodically fullyear continuing resolutions for example were enacted into law for four of the six preceding fiscal years fy1971 fy1973 fy1975 and fy19768 following the successful completion of action on the regular appropriations acts for fy1977 congress returned to the use of fullyear continuing resolutions for more 7 although regular appropriations measures for fy1953 were enacted into law after the start of the fiscal year on july 1 1952 continuing appropriations were provided section 1414 of pl 82547 july 15 1952 supplemental appropriations measure for fy1953 resolved the legalities arising from the tardy enactment of appropriations for that year 8 the fullyear continuing resolution for fy1976 pl 94254 provided funding through the end of the fiscal year june 30 1976 as well as through the end of transition quarter september 30 1976 made necessary by the change in the start of the fiscal year from july 1 to october 1 crs5 than decade for each of the 11 fiscal years following fy1977 covering fy1978 fy1988 congress enacted fullyear continuing resolution three years later congress enacted another fullyear continuing resolution for fy1992 most recently fullyear continuing resolution was enacted for fy2007 fullyear continuing resolutions may provide appropriations in different ways including 1 by formulaic provisions eg at rate for operations not in excess of the current rate or the rate provided in the budget estimate whichever is lower in which the amounts available for individual projects and activities must be determined by comparing two or more alternatives 2 by incorporating the full text of the applicable regular appropriations acts including incorporation by crossreference to other measures thereby obviating the need to make any funding determinations or 3 by combination of the two from functional perspective fullyear continuing resolutions that do not include any formulaic provisions but instead provide appropriations using the full text of acts including by crossreference may be regarded by some as omnibus appropriations acts rather than continuing resolutions even if they are entitled an act making continuing appropriations or making further continuing appropriations table 1 identifies the 13 fullyear continuing resolutions enacted for the period covering fy1977fy2007 seven of the measures included at least one formulaic funding provision while the remaining six did not nine of the 13 fullyear continuing resolutions during this period were enacted in the first quarter of the fiscal year three in october two in november and four in december the four remaining measures however were enacted during the following session between february 15 and june 5 as table 1 shows fullyear continuing resolutions enacted during the first five years of this period were relatively short measures ranging in length from one to four pages in the statutesatlarge beginning with fy1983 and extending through fy1988 however the measures became much lengthier ranging in length from 19 to 451 pages averaging 244 pages the greater page length of fullyear continuing resolutions enacted for the period covering fy1983fy1988 may be explained by two factors first fullyear continuing resolutions enacted prior to fy1983 generally established funding levels by formulaic reference to pending regular appropriations acts with regard to specific appropriations act for example funding levels may have been keyed to the lesser of the amounts provided in the housepassed or senatepassed versions of the act beginning with fy1983 however congress largely abandoned the use of formulaic references to establish funding levels instead the full text of some or all of the covered regular appropriations acts usually was incorporated into the fullyear continuing resolution thereby increasing its length considerably secondly the number of regular appropriations acts covered by fullyear continuing resolutions increased significantly during the fy1983fy1988 period for the period covering fy1978fy1982 the number of regular appropriations acts covered by continuing resolutions for the full fiscal year ranged from one to five crs6 averaging 24 beginning with fy1983 and extending through fy1988 the number of covered acts ranged from four to 13 averaging 87 table 1 fullyear continuing resolutions

resolutions were an important element of the annual appropriations process during the last 11 fiscal years covering fy1998fy2008 fy1997 was the most recent year for which continuing resolutions were needed as shown in table 2 total of 75 continuing resolutions were enacted into law during the period while the average number of such measures enacted per year was about 7 68 the actual number

measured from the expiration date of the preceding continuing resolution as of the date of this writing action on appropriations acts for fy2008 is not complete b the fifth continuing resolution for fy2004 did not change the expiration date of january 31 2004 established in the preceding continuing resolution crs8 during these last 11 years congress provided funding by such means for an average each year of about three and onehalf months 110 days taking into account all of the continuing resolutions enacted for each year the period for which continuing appropriations were provided ranged from 21 days to 365 days on average each of the 75 continuing resolutions enacted lasted for 16 days9 one full year continuing resolution was used during this period covering fy2007 in the first four instances the expiration date in the final continuing resolution was set in the first quarter of the fiscal year on date occurring between october 21 and december 21 the expiration date in the final continuing resolution for the next three fiscal years however was set in the following session on date occurring between january 10 and february 20 the expiration dates for the next two fiscal years shown in the table fy2005 and fy2006 and for the final fiscal year fy2008 were in the first quarter of the fiscal year between december 8 and december 31 finally the final continuing resolution for fy2007 provided funding through the remainder of the fiscal year with an expiration date of september 30 2007 figure 1 presents representation of both the number and duration of continuing resolutions for fy1998fy2008 as the figure shows there is significant correlation between these two variables six continuing resolutions were enacted for both fy1998 and fy1999 but the same number of measures lasted for period of 57 days for fy1998 and only 21 days for fy1999 the largest number of continuing resolutions enacted for single fiscal year during this period 21 for fy2001 covered period lasting 82 days at an average duration of 39 days per act the smallest number enacted three for fy2005 and for fy2006 covered 69 days and 92 days respectively but at average durations of 230 for fy2005 and 307 for fy2006 days per act figure 1 also shows considerable mix in the use of shorterterm and longerterm continuing resolutions for single fiscal year for fy2001 for example 21 continuing resolutions covered the first 82 days of the fiscal year the first 25 days were covered by series of four continuing resolutions lasting between five and eight days each the next 10 days period of intense legislative negotiations leading up to the national elections on november 7 2000 were covered by series of 10 one day continuing resolutions the next 31 days were covered by only two continuing resolutions the first lasting 10 days and the second lasting 21 days the first of these two continuing resolutions was enacted into law on november 4 the saturday before the election and extended through november 14 the second day of lameduck session the second continuing resolution was enacted into law on november 15 it expired on december 5 10 days before the lameduck session ended the remaining five continuing resolutions which ranged in duration from one to six days covered the remainder of the lameduck session and several days beyond 9 the fifth continuing resolution enacted for fy2004 pl 108185 did not change the expiration date of january 31 2004 set in the preceding continuing resolution crs9 as the final appropriations legislation passed by congress was processed for the
