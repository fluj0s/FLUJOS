report identifies major c onstitutional change that the founding fathers could not foresee the direct election of senators on july 16 1787 the 55 founding fathers at the constitutional convention in philadelphia reached what is commonly called the great compromise1 t h compromise emerged after struggle between the large and small states over the system of representation for the house and senate the framers readily accepted the principle of bicameralism twohouse na tional legislature after ll the british parliament was bicameral as were most state legislatures however the framers encountered sharp divisions in grappling with these two stions should representation the number of members in both chambers be apportioned according to each states population or instead should representation in the house be determined by popula tion and in the senate on state equality under the first approach the large states would dominate both chambers under the second plan the large stat would be advantaged in the house while all states regardless of their population woul d be represented equa lly in the senate this clash between proportional versus equal representa tion pr ovoked the most contentious debate at the constitutional conve ntion and nearly led to its end delegate luther martin of maryland wrote that differences over the issue nearly terminated in dissolution of the convention george washington wrote to alexander hamilton that he almost despaired that the small and large states would ever resolve their differences2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22972crs2 2 continued

chamber where their interests could be prot ected and guaranteed house seats would be apportioned among the states based on population with each state guaranteed at least one member representatives would be directly elected by the people by contrast the senate would be composed of two senators per state regardless of population indirectly elected by the state legislatures as james madison wrote in federalist 39 the house of representatives will derive its powers from the people of america the senate on the other hand will derive its powers from the states as political and coequal societies and these will be represented on the principle of equality in the senate3 the principle of two senators from each state was further guaranteed by article v of the constitution state without its consent shall be deprived of equal ffrage in the senate decisions made at the constitutional c onvention bout the senate still shape its organization and operation today and make it one of the most distinctive legislative institutions in the world as william gladstone fourtime british prime minister during the 19th century said about the american nate it is remarkable body the most remarkable of all the inventions of modern politics4 plainly the framers did not want the senate to be another house of representatives the institutional uniqueness of the senate flows directly from many of the decisions made at the constitutional convention seve ral of these features merit discussion because they highlight important and endurin g features of the senate these features include constituency size term of office and special prerogatives5 the one modification to the plan not foreseen by the framer s was the direct election of senators constituency the one statetwo senator formula means that most senators represent constituencies that are more hete rogeneous than the districts represented by most house members one result is that senators must accommodate larger diversity of interests and voices in their representational roles for example house member might represent district that is overwhelmingly agriculture in character the senators from that state focus on agricultu re too but they must also be responsive to wider arrayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22972crs3 6 see gary c jacobson the politics of congressi onal elections 7th ed new york pearson education inc 2009 p 16 7 quoted in

washington gpo 1992 p 1311and diversity of interests the bottom line is that senators represent an entire state not part of it because the votes of senators are equal balloting power in the senate is not apportioned by population as va rious scholars have pointed ou t the nine largest states are home to 51 percent of the population but elect only 18 percent of the senate the twentysix smallest states control 52 percent of the senate but hold only 18 percent of the population6 the disparity in the voting strength of senators from lightly versus heavily populated states prompted the late senator daniel moynihan dny to predict that sometime in the twentyfirst century the united states is going to have to address the question of apportionm ent in the senate7 size of the senate from the outset the senates membership was relatively small compared to the house when the senate first convened in 1789 there were twentytwo senators north carolina and rhode isla nd soon entered the union to increase the number to twentysix as new states entered the union the senates size expanded to the 100 that it is today the senates size significantly shapes how it works for example it operates in generally informal manner of ten relying on the unanimous c onsent of all 100 senators to function there is large deference to minority views either those of the minority party small group of lawmakers or single senator the senate s formal rules and precedents are less comprehensive than the many deta iled rules and voluminous precedents of the larger house of representatives viewed as ambassadors from the several states the seed was planted early that senators s hould have few restraints placed on their parliamentary rights for example in 1789 the senate informally adopted policy of keeping formal rules to minimum agreeing to twenty short rules further in framing its rules the senate quite naturally put great premium on ease and dignity of speech8 the senate grants every member two parliamentary freedoms that so far as is known other lawmaker worldwide posse sses these two freedoms are unlimited debate and an unlimited opport unity to offer amendments including nonrelevant amendments both prerogatives are of course subject to certain constraints as two senate parliamentarians wrote whereas senate rules permit virtually unlimited debate and very few restrictions on the right to offer amendments these unanimous consent agreements usually limit debate and the ri ght of senators to offer amendments9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22972crs4 10 see for example sarah binder and steven s smith politics or principle filibustering in the united states senate washington brookings institution press 1990 11 gouverneur morris of pennsylvania delega to the constitutional convention stated the senate ought to be composed of men of grea t and established property an aristocracy such an aristocratic body will keep down the turbulency of democracy quoted in robert dahl pluralist democracy in the united states conflict and consent chicago rand mcnally 1967 p 35 wary of unchecked popular rule the framers wanted the senate to provide sober second look at legislation sent to it by the popularly elected house 12 from strategic viewpoint ection by state legislatures i ncreased the likelihood that the continuedunanimous consent agreements establish tailormade procedure for considering virtually any kind of business that the senate takes up they are co mmonly drafted by the parties floor leaders and managers and to be implemented must be ag reed to by the entire senate membership that is not objected to by an senator two fundamental objectives of these accords are to limit debate and to structure the amendment process it was the smaller size of the senate that doubt enc ouraged these parliamentary traditions to emerge and flourish not until 1917 did the senate even adopt method for ending extended debate called filibuster if employed for dilatory purposes it was called cloture closure of deba and its procedural requireme nts are spelled out in senate rule xxii so from 1789 to 1917 there was way for the senate to terminate extended debates except by unanimous cons ent compromise or exhaustion10 term of office qualifi cations and selection key goal of the framers as noted earlier was to create senate differently constituted from the other chamber so that it could check the popular passions that might overly influence legislation emanating from the directly elected house to foster va lues such as deliberation reflection and continuity the framers made three important decisions first they set the senatorial term of office at six years even though the duration of congress is two years the senate is continuing body with only onethird of its membership up for election at any one time as article i section 3 states immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes consequently the electorate th at chooses the onethird up in november 2008 is different in various ways in regard to the array of salient issues that may influence peoples choices for example from the voters who sel ected the other twothirds of the senate these lawmakers were influenced respectively by the public mood of the voters in november 2004 and 2006 thus some of them might act collectivel as brake and block or slow down floor c onsideration of issues bated during the 2008 campaigns second to be senator individuals must meet certain constitu tional qualifications for example to hold office senators must be 30 years of age and nine years citizen house members are to be 25 years of age and seven years citizen the framers expected senators to be more seasoned nd experienced than house members11 whether this expectation has been met is problematic even in congresss earliest years when the likes of james madison and albert gallatin served in the house unlike house members the selection of senators was done by the state legislatures which bolstered the states role as counterweight to the national govern ment and insulated th senate from popular pressures12 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22972crs5 12 continued constitution would be accepted when submitted to the state ratifying conventions robert c byrd the senate 17891989 addresses on the

was prepared by the congressional research service for the senate committee on foreign relationsspecial prerogatives the house and senate shar lawmaking authority but the framers assigned special advice and consent prerogatives exclusively to the senate under article ii section 2 th senate functions as unicam eral body when it considers 1 the ratification of treaties which requi re approval by twothirds vote or 2 presidential nominations for high governme ntal positions such as federal judges ambassadors or cabinet officers all of whom require senate consent by majority vote the framers assigned the advice and consent responsibilities to the nate but not the house because of certain characteristics em bedded in that institution such as stability longer time perspective and its smaller size as one of the framers pierce butler of south carolina noted treaty negotiations always required the greatest secrecy which could not be expected in large body like the house13 the senates role in the appointments process wrote hamilton in federalist 65 would serve as an excellent check upon the spirit of favoritism in the presid ent and would tend greatly to preventing the appointment of unfit char acters from state prejudice the constitution article i section 3 also grants the senate the sole power to try all impeachments the house possesses th constitutional authority to decide by majority vote whether to impeach or indict executive or judicial officials while the senate by twothirds vote determines whether to convict the indicted public officials which could even include the president where else wrote hamilton in federalist 65 than in the senate could have been found tribunal sufficiently dignified or sufficiently independent what ot her body would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation to preserve unawed and uninfluenced the necessary impartiality between an individual accused and the representatives of the people his accusers italics in the original the senate like any legislative institution constantly changes in big and little ways if the framers returned today to visit the senate they would surely recognize that it remains the preeminent legislative forum for protecting minority rights and for debating and refining the great issues of the day th ey would continue to find that many of their fundamental principles two senators from each state the advice and consent role or the impeachment prerogative continue to g overn the senates composition and activity to be sure they would likely be awestru ck by the countrys many changes the demographic diversity among the 50 states the size and reach of the federal establishment the rise of presidential power the cost of campaigns the role of political parties the extent of the nations internati onal obligations and numerous other societal technological or medical deve lopments they would soon discover significant change to their handiwork however todays senators longer are elected by state legislatures the direct election of senators in 1913 the seventeenth amendment to the constitution was ratified providing for the di rect election of senators the

tributes to the honor able robert c byrd washington gpo 1988 p xxiwould probably view this as the most si gnificant constitutional change affecting the senate the election of senators by state legislatures lasted for more than 125 years until the two institutions that were vested politically in the procedure the us senate and the state legislatures opted for the popular election of senators why two words epitomize the fundamental drivers of th change democracy and deadlock the direct election of senators was trigge red by the progressive movement of the 1890s and early 1900s which advocated an ag enda of democratic reform such as womens suffrage the direct primary and th direct election of senators progressive leaders wanted to end the influence of powerfu l special interests especially corporations over state legislatures block the purchase of senate seats blunt the influence of party bosses in determining who state lawmakers should select and make senators directly answerable to the people for their actions or in actions for example the spread of direct primaries in many states led to voters expressing their choice for senator on the primary ballot although not legally binding on the legislatures the popular choice was likely to be accepted14 the second major s timulus for the seventeenth amendment involved the often contentious state legislative deadlocks in ecting senators various factors provoked the deadlocks such as different party contro l of the two chambers and lengthy contests among as many as 80 or more senatorial ca ndidates with balloting extending over several weeks as scholar of the senate reported the record of senatorial elections for the fifteen years 1891 to 1905 shows fortyfive such deadlocks from one to seven in each of twenty states15 the combination of these two forces the democratic impulse and disgruntlement with deadlocks led to congressional passage of direct election constitutional amendment in may 1912 ratification by thr eefourths of the state legislatures occurred year later to close as british prime minister gladstone said the senate is remarkable body many senators throug hout history have shared his view as senator claude pepper dfl said in 1939 on the occasion of the senates 150th anniversary the varied and extraordinary functions nd powers of the senate make it according to ones view hydraheaded monster or the citadel of constitutional and democratic liberties like democracy itself the senate is inefficient unwieldy inconsistent it has its foibles its vanities its members who are great the near great and those who think they are great but like democracy also it is strong it is sound at the core it has survived many changes it has saved the country from many catastrophes it is safeguard against any form of tyranny which might tend to remove the course of government from persistent public scrutiny in the last analysis it is probably the price we in america have to pay for liberty16
