the difference in addition fo r the past few years congress has provided additional funding in order to enable the program to serve more airports the eas program continues to enjoy si gnificant support in congress federal aviation administration faa httpwwwfaagov the bush administration request for fy2006 was 139 billion slightly more than the fy2005 enacted level of 138 billion the proposal was essentially devoid of major new initiatives but contained some program adjustments and significantly reduced funding for the airport improveme nt program aip the proposed cut to the aip program would have put its fy2006 appropriation below the level guaranteed in the century of avia tion reauthorization act vision 100 pl 108176 both the formula provisions nd the guarantee provisions of that act would have caused significant disruption to the aip program at the proposed funding level the house committee on appropr iations recommended 144 billion for the faa and provided the authorized fy2006 leve l of funding for the aip the house passed bill provided 146 billion after 500 million rescission of contract authority the senate committee on appropriations r ecommended 136 billion after 12 billion rescission of contract au thority which the nate approved the conference agreement provided 138 billi on after 10 billion rescission of contract authority this was 266 million more than the fy2005 enacted level and 11 billion more than the administration request the vast majority of faa funding is provided from the airport and airway trust fund only om funding uses mix of trust fund and treasury general fund monies over the past ten years fy 1996fy2005 the general fund has contributed an average of 21 of faas budget4 in fy2002 treasury general fund contribution of 11 billion was provided fo r om funding while the general fund contribution for fy2002 was on the low side historically 8 of faas total budget the fy2003 amount returned to higher contribution level of 32 billion 24 of faas total funding however the gene ral fund contribution has been declining since then to 30 billion 22 of faa s total budget in fy2004 to an estimated 28 billion 20 in fy2005 and to an estimated 16 billion 11 in the administrations fy2006 request5 historically the trus t fundgeneral fund split has been an important part of the annual f aa budget debate the rationale behind thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32945crs8 6 general fund appropriations have varied substantially both in dollar terms and as percentage of faa appropriations as whole from year to year over the last 12 years the share has ranged from 0 to 47 see table 1 in crs report rs20177 airport and airway trust fund issues in the 106th congress by john w fischergeneral fund contribution has been that the public at large realiz some benefit from aviation whether it uses the system or not6 trust fund revenues have been running below projections for several years with general fund contributions to faas budget also declining from their historical average the difference between faas budg et level and these two funding sources has been made up by tapping the trus t funds uncommitted bala nce which is now quite low by historical standards 24 billion operations and ma intenance om for fy2006 the administration proposed 82 billion in total spending 500 million 6 increase over the 77 billion enacted for fy 2005 the house co mmittee on appropriations recommended 82 billion virtually identical to the admin istration request th housepassed bill provided 84 billion the senate co mmittee on appropriations recommended 82 billion which the senate pproved the conference agreement provided 82 billion the majority of funding in this category is for the salaries of faa personnel engaged in air traffic control certification and safe tyrelated activities much of the increased funding called for in the fy2006 request is for increased air traffic control system costs and safetyrelated activities one issue is the increasingly urgent need to hire additional air traffic controllers there is concern that many of the current controllers who were hired after the air traffic controllers strike of 1981 are now rapidly approaching retirement age controller union representatives contend that the faa is not taking sufficient action to mitigate against potential future staff s hortages the request funding included 25 million to hire 1249 controllers in fy2006 this is expected to result in net gain of around 604 controllers since around 645 contro llers are expected to leave through attrition during fy2006 facilities and equipment fe the administration request for fe was 24 billion slightly down from 25 billion in fy2005 and below the fy2006 authorized level of 31 billion the house

12 billion below their combined authorized level of 665 billion in add ition the proposed aip funding level of 3 billion is below the 32 billion threshold set under aip distribution formulas in vision 100 due to provision in the author izing legislation th is shortfall could result in cutting most aip formula distributions in half the administration defended its proposed reduction with three arguments it noted that the aip funding level has incr eased significantly from its 19 billion level in fy2000 it asserted that airport cap ital development needs as measured by requests for issuances of airport reve nue bonds and in faas national plan of integrated airport systems have declined by 15 in recent years and it asserted that airports could compensate for the reducti on in aip funding by increasing their use of passenger facility charges7 the administration estimated that airports could raise an additional 350 million annually by increas ing passenger fac ility fees to the maximum allowed by law some member s of congress questioned the wisdom of imposing fee increases on an unprofitable airline industry struggling unsuccessfully with the impact of high fuel costs the house

amtraks funding problem its important to appreciate that while they are highly subsidized and often inefficient their total limination will not come close to making ends meet savings ultimately would be in th neighborhood of around 300 million and the savings would not be immediate due to the need for labor severance payments13 amtraks thenpresident david gunn asserting that amtrak would owe its employees 14 billion over three years in verance payments if the longdistance trains were eliminated14 said the committees recomme nded funding would lead to an amtrak shut down because the company could not meet debt service pay its obligations to the railroad retirement f und and make required payments to the workers it would have to lay off 15 in an additional views section of the committees report on the bill the ranking members of the committee and the transportation subcommittee argued that the bill would make it impossible for amtrak to operate even limited number of routes after mandatory debt service payments of 275 million to 287 million and mandatory labor payments of 300 million or more severance payments to amtrak workers laid off as result of terminating the long distance routes are made funds would available to operate even few routes and funds would be ava ilable to invest in sorely needed capital upgrades16 during consideration of the bill on the house floor the chair of the house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on railroads representative latourette and the ranking member of the transportation and infrastructure committee

ga005657t may 4 2005the recent economic difficulties of the aviation i ndustry have had negative effect on trust fund revenues historically the trust fund has ended each year with an uncommitted balance since 2001 the uncommitted balance has been decreasing according to gao the trust funds uncommitted balance decreased from 73 billion in 2001 to 48 billion in 2002 and has continue d to fall at rate of 1 billion year since20 gao found this occurred because re venues started tre nding downward in 1999 while expenditures have exceeded revenues since fy2001 the increase in expenditures from the trust fund reflected in creased spending under two authorization bills the wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century air21 pl 106181 which covered fy1999fy2003 significantly increased faa spending especially capital spendi ng and vision 100 century of aviation reauthorization act vision 100 p l 10876 covering fy2004fy2007 which authorized continued increases in spendi ng although at more modest rate gao has warned that revenue declines as sma ll as 510 below projected levels could eliminate the trust funds unc ommitted balances under current authorization levels air21 created budgetary regime for avia tion programs that was closely linked to the availability of funds in the trust fund the act requires appropriators to use aviation trust funds only for aviation pur poses and to fully fund faas capital programs the airport improvement program and the facilities and equipment program at authorized levels using h ouse and senate pointoforder rules for enforcement one provision in the act made it out of order to consider legislation that spends aviation trust fund reve nues for nonaviation purposes another provision made it out of order to consider legislation f unding faas operations and maintenance and research engineering and development budgets if the airport improvement program and f acilities and equipment progra m are funded at less than their authorized levels vision 100 conti nued this arrangement this budgetary regime was created at time when revenues to the trust fund were sharply increasing should revenues decline significantly fundi ng beyond the guaranteed aip and fe components could be severe ly constrained unless suppor ted by the general fund the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 and the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act legacy for users safetealu during the 105th and 106th congresses major legislation changed the relationships between the largest transpor tation trust funds and the federal budget the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21pl 105178 linked annual spending for highway programs di rectly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund in addition core high way and mass transit program funding was given special status in the discretionary tion of the federal budget by virtue of the creation of two new budget categories the act thereby created virtual firewall around highway and transit spending progra ms the funding guarantees were set up in way that makes it difficult for funding vels to be altered as part of the

the hous and senate appropriations and budget committees in determining annua l spending levels for high way and transit programs the appropriations committees are precluded from their former role of setting an annual level of obliga tions these were established by tea21 and were adjusted by an annual raba computation tea21 also limited the discretion of the house and senate appropriations committees in exercising what some members view as their once traditional option of changing sp ending levels for specific core programs or projects though during the authoriz ation period appropriators increasingly returned to their customary use of this option on july 29 2005 congress adopted new surface transportation authorization legislation the safe account able flexible efficient transportation equity act legacy for users safetea lupl 109 59 this legisla tion maintains the general program structure of tea21 it c ontinued the practice of guaranteeing the authorized funding levels and further d iminished the discretion of the house and senate appropriators by converting several discretionary grant programs to formula programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32945crs28 appendix c transportation budget terminology transportation budgeting uses confusing lexicon for those unfamiliar with the process of budget authority and contract authority the latter form of budget authority contract authority provides obligational authority for the funding of trust fundfinanced programs such as the federa laid highway program prior to tea21 changes in spending in the annual tr ansportation budget component had been achieved in the appropriations process by combining changes in budgetcontract authority and placing limitations on obligations the principal function of the limitation on obligations is to control ou tlays in manner that corresponds to congressional budget agreements contract authority is tantamount to but does not actually involve entering into contract to pay for project at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc which tea21 amended authorized f unds are automatically made available to the states at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriations legisl ation appropriations are re quired to make outlays at some future date to cover these obligations tea21 greatly limited the role of the appropriations process in core highwa and transit programs because the act enumerated the limitation on obligations level for the period fy1999 through fy2003 in the statute 112 stat 107 highway and transit grant programs work on reimbursable basis states pay for projects up front and federal payments are made to them only when work is completed and vouchers are presented months or even years after the project has begun work in progress is represented in the trust fund as obligat ed funds and although they are considered used and remain as commitments against the trust fund balances they are not subtracted from balances trust fund balances therefore appear high in part because funds sufficient to cover actual and expected future commitments must remain available both the highway and transit accounts ve substantial shor t and longterm commitments these include payments that will be made in the current fiscal year as projects are completed and to much greater extent outstanding obligations to be made at some unspecified future date additionally there are unobligated amounts that are still dedicated to highway and transit projects but have not been committed to specific projects two terms are associated with the distribu tion of contract authority funds to the states and to particular prog rams the first of these apportionments refers to funds distributed to the states for formula driven programs for example all national highway system nhs funds are apportioned to the states allocated funds are funds distributed on an administrative ba sis typically to programs under direct federal control for example federal nds highway program monies are allocated the allocation can be to another federal agency to state to an indian tribe or to some other governmental entity these terms do not refer to the federal budget process but often provide frame of reference for high way program recipients who may assume albeit incorrectly that state apportionment is part of the federal budget per
