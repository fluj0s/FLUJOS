summary between 1990 and 2003 the percentage of 3 to 5yearolds in the united states enrolled in some kind of preprimary centerbased or kindergarten education increased from 59 to 65 at the same time data indicate that some children need more assistance to be ready to learn effectively when they enter kindergarten and that many schoolage children are having difficu lty becoming proficient readers these events have increased the focus on the role of preschool education and care research on the effects of quality ear ly childhood education and care programs indicates positive shortterm effects in terms of cognitive functioning school readiness and social behavi or and also supports positive longterm effects for children from model early intervention programs longterm results from more typical programs such as head start are less conclusive most researchers have found highqua lity early childhood programs to have several factors in common low teacherchild ratios welltrained and wellpaid teachers and low staff turnover rates the principal federal programs presen tly providing funding for early childhood education and care are head start title i part of the elementary and secondary education act esea the william f goodling even start family literacy programs the individuals with disabilities education act the early reading first program the child care and development block grant the social services block grant and the early learning fund the number of states that have provide d some funding for preschool programs has increased considerably over time fro m 7 in 1980 to 38 in 200203 although the benefits of preschool to society can be difficult to quantify more research has emerged examining the costs and benefits of governmental inves tments in preschool several of these studies have projected that the benefits of such investments will exceed the costs congress is considering what role is appropriate for the federal government in providing and setting standards for early childhood education and care and how to best enhance the supply of quality early childhood education and care at the same time issues have been ra ised about what form fe deral aid for early childhood education and care should take whether such aid should be targeted or universal how to coordinate new federal initiatives with existing federal programs and how to avoid supplanting or discouraging state in itiatives for early childhood education and care this report will be updated periodicallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31123contents c h i l d r n s r v d 2 research on

lunches ie from relatively lowincome families only 16 are at or above the proficient level in addition the scientific community s fueled interest in early childhood with research indicating that the early years are crucial for brain development and that there is connection between the stimu lation young children receive from their preschool teachers or care givers and success in later learning and intellectual growth this research has altered the way scientists see the development of the brain most now believe that the neural circuitry of th brain is not fixed at birth but develops partly in response to early experiences re search has shown that the first three years of life are the period of most rapid brain growth and that there are certain windows of opportunity for certain kinds of learning language for example scientists have discovered that beginning in early adoles cence brain development occurs through the pruning of unnecessary synaptic connec tions those synapses that receive the most use in childhood are the likeliest to become permanent those that are unused are the most likely to be eliminated2 however researchers also caution that early intervention should not be viewed as pa nacea people continue to learn and the human brain continues to incorpor ate new information throughout life this report examines what we curre ntly know about preprimary programs

research council eager to learn educating our preschoolers washington national academy press 2000 p 2 4 in this report the terms preschool preki ndergarten and preprimary care and education programs are used interchangeably because existing national data are based on parental responses and an academic program may call itself day care center preschool or prekindergarten parental responses on whether their childs care includes an academic component often simply reflect the title of the program their child attends state data which are available for prekindergarten including head start programs programs are discussed in the text of the report belowchildren served in examining the number and growth of preprimary education programs we immediately confront the question of how to conceptually and empirically separate education from child care in programs for young children while the focus of this report is on early childhood education it is difficult to empirically differentiate between early education and child care b ecause in early childhood settings the two are often intertwined many experts believe that both are required for quality environment for young children care and education cannot be thought of as separate entities in dealing with young children adequate care involves providing quality cognitive stimulation rich language environment and the facilitation of social emotional and motor development likewise adequate education for young children can occur only in the context of good physical care and of warm affective relationships3 available national level data on early childhood education does not delineate time spent in education activities versus child care existing data do differentiate between centerbased versus other settings relative care and family day care centers for child care and early childhood education this discussion of na tional data focuses on centerbased programs broadly defined because program names day care center versus preschool for exampl do not necessarily correla with whether program has an academic component or not4 some day care centers may contain an academic component while so preschools for exampl may not centerbased programs include day care centers nurse ry schools prekindergarten programs preschools and head start programs for these reasons the data on childrens participation in early ch ildhood education are based on centerbased preprimary programs broadly defined because federal and state preschool policies focus largely on children between the ages of 3 and 5 da ta for this age

discussed below in december 2000 study titled eager to learn was released by the committee on early childhood pedagogy6 the committee was established by the national research council in 1997 to review and synt hesize the theory and research on early childhood pedagogy and to make recomme ndations based on the present state of knowledge for early childhood educati on programs and public policy eager to learn included 19 specific recommendations in four major areas 1 teacher training 2 teaching materials 3 public policies to support qua lity preschools and 4 dissemination of informa tion on preschool development the committee made recommendations in all four of these areas that it argued would significantly improve the us system of preschool education and care the committee agreed that the case for substantial investment in highquality system of child care and preschool on the basis of what is already known is pe rsuasive7 one of the strongest recommendations made in eager to learn was regarding teacher training the committee recommended that all children in early care programs be provided with teacher who has bachel ors degree and specialized education in early childhood the committee on early childhood pedagogy stated the professional development of teachers is related to the quality of early childhood programs and program quality predicts developmental outcomes for children formal early childhood education and training have been linked consistently to positive caregiver behaviors the strongest relationship is found between the number of years of educati on and training and the appropriateness of teachers classroom behavior8 the importance of teacher education and training runs throughout the literature on early childhood education another major study the

children according to karoly et are those exposed to one or more stressors in the arenas of cognitive emotional or resources deficiencies 13 ibid p 9early elementary years this study considered two broad measures of quality classroom practices and teacher child relationships9 based on four years of data tracking individual children from preschool through second grade the researchers found that the quality of care provided is key children who attended quality child care programs those programs ranking in the 75th percentile or better when they were 3 to 4 years old were reported to have subsequently scored better on math language and social skills in early elementary school than children who ttended poor quality child care programs those programs ranking in the 25th percentile or less furthermore better classroom behavior and social skills were reported in children who had closer relationships with their child care teachers these positive effects in math skills thinkingattention skills and problem behaviors remained through sec ond grade but the differential diminished over time in addition the researchers f ound that the positive effects of quality child care and the negative effects of poor qua lity child care are most pronounced for children at risk of not doing well in school10 furthermore the researchers found teacher pay and qualifications to be linked with quality programs our research indicated that the quality of child care was related to both the formal education levels and the specialized early childhood training of the classroom teachers similarly teache r compensation was closely linked to the quality of services in child care the findings reported here further underline the need to raise quality indicating that th child care experiences continue to influence childrens development through the early elementary years11 1998 rand study investing in our children authored by lynn karoly and seven colleagues examined the costs and benefits of early childhood interventions specifically those promoting th development of at risk12 children including head start individuals with disabilities education act idea programs

15 for more information on head start see crs report rl30952 head start background and issues by melinda gishthe question of how best to target participants to obtain the highest benefit to cost ratios is uncertain they state that existing scientific research is insufficient to discern why some programs succeed and others do not or whether some program designs work best ie by focusing on children or parents infancy or preschool years one or multiple independent programs or individually tailored programs that serve smaller pool in comparison to larg er programs that serve more children survey conducted by janet currie titled early childhood intervention programs what do we know examined four studies of model programs that used random assignment had low rates of particip ant attrition and followed childrens progress at least through middle school14 in addition currie looked at large scale publicly funded programs primarily head start programs the model programs generally spent more per pupil than the h ead start programs currie found that well funded welldesigned programs can have long term impact on childrens outcomes especially for disadvantaged children the four studies currie examined were the early training project the carolina abecedarian project the perry preschool pr oject and the milwaukee project currie found only one of the four had long rm impact on iq the milwaukee project although all four showed positive effect on long term scholastic ccess sixty eight percent of the children who participated in the early training project graduated from high school compared to 52 of the control group at age 21 the children who participated in the carolina abecedarian pr oject were twice as likely to still be in school or to have ttended fouryear college positiv effects were twice as large for the most disadvantaged children in this study the perry preschool project found that as of age 27 children who participated in the project expe rienced positive effects on achievement test scores grades high school graduation rate s and earnings in addition to lower rates of crime and welfare use children in the milwaukee project were found to have higher iqs in 8th grade than children in the control group but they did not have positive gains in other measured areas however these four programs were all model programs with low pupilteacher ratios and highly qualified staff currie did not find the same conclusive evidence of long term benefits when she examined the head start program currie and her colleagues examined head start by using siblings who did not attend head start of par ticipants as control group head start is currently the largest publicly supported preschool progra m for disadvantaged children with funded enrollment of 909608 in fy200315 currie et found that initial test score improvements for black head start participants faded in elementary school but not for white students they surmised that this fading might be due to subsequent school deficiencies since th black head start particip ants subsequently attended schools of lower quality than other black ch ildren but this was not true for the white head start students currie stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31123crs9 16 ibid p 20 17 us general accounting office early education and care overlap indicates need to assess crosscutting programs hehs0078 apr 2000the evidence reviewed above suggests that model early intervention programs can have positive longterm effects on children but there is large gap between these programs and the largescale publiclyfunded interventions that are currently in place point that is of ten lost in the controversy over whether there are longterm benefits of head star t is that there are many welldocumented shortterm benefits depending on prec isely which benefits are counted and on how we value them it can be shown that the short and mediumterm benefits of head start already pay back much of the cost of the program16 finally the measurement of more typical programs is usually linked to evaluations of head start the largest federal program with education and care as its primary mission available studies on h ead start based on head startfunded family and child care experience survey do provide data on program outcomes but do not permit definitive conclusion regarding program impact ie whether observed outcomes are due to ch ilds participation in head start or are due to other factors recent data collected on program outcome s show that children participating in head start exhibit many of the skills thoug ht to indicate readiness to learn in school hhs the us dept of health and human services is now undertaking efforts to determine the exte nt to which such outcomes are directly attributable to childrens participation in the program rather than to other factors17 in sum study data do support positive shortterm effects of highquality early childhood programs in terms of cognitive skills school readiness and social behavior and positive longterm effects in terms of greater high school completion rates higher earnings less criminal activity and welfare use for model early intervention programs longterm effects from more typical programs such as head start are less conclusive in part this is due to the difficulty of separating the influence of early intervention on childrens later success from all the other factors that are significant in influencing longterm success federal programs federal programs for young children cu rrently provide funding for education and care services

available to all families who want their four year old children to participate most states do not limit these programs to the public schools although the majority of these pr ograms are in public schools many permit programs to be located in private child care centers and head start centers as well most commonly these programs are halfday programs that operate during the school year although 10 state initiatives ffer programs that are for the fullschool day or longer in many cases hour s of operation are cally determined26 according to the nieer study the quality of these state funded programs also varies across states it f ound that states differ in the following areas whether they require teachers to have bachelors degree whethe r specialized early childhood training is required allowable student to child ratios family services provided such as health referrals and parent teacher conferences and program standards policy issues research indicates that the quality of early childhood education and care is significant for childrens later academic success particularly for disadvantaged youngsters yet the us system of pr eschool education and care presently varies enormously not only in quality however defined and content but also in organization sponsorship source of f unding and the extent of government regulation an economic argument can be made for federal role in providing aid for early childhood education and care due to extern alities and informati on imperfections in the market for early childhood care and education27 this intervention might take the form of provision of care subsidies or tax credits for families tuition credits for early childhood educators to provide an incentive for educators to pursue more education licensing requirements or simply the pr ovision of information externalities exist because the benefits of quality early ch ildhood education programs accrue not only to the families who purchase these services but to society at large through lower taxes for welfare and crime through high er productivity of we lleducated citizens etc however when the costs of these rvices are borne only by parents the price paid for these services will be artificially low28 in addition because of imperfect information and geographic limitations parents may not be able to locate the best providers of early childhood education and car or know how best to evaluate the costs quality and services of different providershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31123crs13 29 crs report rl30952 head start background and issues by melinda gish 30

of poverty for children under sixhowever even if federal aid is determined to be appropriate there is consensus on how much federal aid should be provided and what form of aid would be most effective there is also disagr eement on whether such aid should be targeted to disadvantaged youngsters or should be uni versal others express concern that such aid may supplant current state programs there are also questions regarding the potential role for the federal government in setting standards for earlychildhood education and care and for encouraging the coordination of any new initiatives with existing federal and state programs most researchers have found high qua lity early childhood programs to have several factors in common low teacherchild ratios well trained and well paid teachers and low staff turnover rates yet well trained better paid staff and low teacherchild ratios translate into more expensive programs presently many middle class families pay privately for their child or childrens early education and care many children from lowincome families participate in h ead start although in 2002 only an estimated 59 of eligible four year olds were able to participate29 weighing costs and benefits of universal preschool the non governmental national institu for early education res earch estimates the annual cost per child of universal quality preschool at approximately 870030 it bases this estimate on eds projection of 2002 k12 costs per pupil of 8800 arguing this is good proxy for full school day preschool the 8700 per child preschool cost estimate is derived by applying eds 8800 figure to the following assumptions onethird of three and four year olds would attend half da preschool onethird would attend full school day and onet hird would attend full day year round this works out on average to cost of 8700 per child the 8700 figure is then multiplied by the census bureaus 2000 data on the population of three and four year olds to obtain an estimate for the total cost of providing quality preschool for every three and four year old of approximate ly 70 billion this assumes all costs are provided from public funds annually31 nieer further breaks down these estimates to take into account alternative scenar ios such as making universal preschool available only for four year olds or only for children in poverty it timates the annual cost of universal care for foury ear olds only would be 338 billion it estimates the nnual cost to serve only poor 3 and 4yearolds would be 116 billion32 nieer estimates that the annual benefit from univers ally available preschool for 3 and 4yearolds would be pproximately 25000 per year for each child served substantially more than the estimated cost of 8700 per child for thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31123crs14 33

1990 sixtyfive percent of preschool cost s are attributable to personnel costs see crs report rl31118 the child care workforce by linda levineestimate it draws on results from the chicago child parent study and the perry preschool project33 the economic policy institute has recen tly published report that finds similar costs and benefits of quality preschool finding the bene fit to cost ratio of providing highquality preschool to all poor 3 and 4yearolds would be at least 3 to 1 ie 3 return for every 1 invested in preschool using the perry preschool costbenefit ratios the epi study translates the potential benefits of establishing government finan ced universal preschool for all poor 3 and 4yearolds beginning in 2005 into projected future be nefits to federal state and local governments in terms of government finance the economy and crime34 the study finds that for the first 16 years the program costs would exceed program benefits thereafter program benefits would be greater than costs this would be due to higher tax revenues lower welfare expe nditures and lower judicial costs as these children successfully enter the workforce the study projects there would be higher productivity and higher fu ture earnings leading to higher gross domestic product and improved social security solvency additionally it projects substantial benefits to indi viduals in terms of reduced financial loss and pain and suffering from projected reductions in crime presently much of the costs of preschool are borne by familie s costs of quality preschool can be difficult it not impo ssible for many parents to afford average costs without assessing quality for 4yearold in child care center in 2000 were 4000 to 6000 per year according to the childrens defense fund35 in all states but one vermont the annual costs of child care in an urban area are greater than the costs of public college tuition the cost s of preprimary care are particularly burdensome for lowincome families acco rding to the

be left several thousand dollars short of whathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31123crs15 36 costs are for 2000 and are based on data co llected from local child care resource and referral agencies karen schulman the high cost of child care puts quality care out of the reach for many families childrens defense fund 2000they needed to afford averagepriced childcare much less the higher prices charged by many better quality centers and family childcare homes36 nevertheless although many preschool advocates and researchers acknowledge the burden of preschool co st on families particularly low and middle income families the prospect of procuring large sums of federal money for universal preschool is quite daunting particularly since many of the potential bene fits lie well in the future universal vs targeted preschool given the costs of early childhood education and care in the c ontext of limited resources s hould federal aid be targeted to disadvantaged children such as those w ho are presently not being served by head start research data indicate that disadvantaged children especially benefit from quality early childhood education and care this research as well as equity considerations might suppor t directing federal aid if limited to disadvantaged children proponents of targeting aid argu that universal car would provide care to children whose families already are paying for care privately and can afford to do so however proponents of universal care ar gue that targeted programs miss many disadvantaged children who w ould benefit and that if early childhood education and care programs become universally available there will also be much larger number of families to advocate for the continue d existence of these programs and to advocate for high quality programs finally there is clear demarcation between children who need publically funded progra ms and those who do not many working poor and middle class families not eligible for publically funded preschool struggle to provide quality preschool for their children sponsorship another important issue is how best to ensure quality in early childhood education and care programs in some european countries where universal early childhood care and education ar more prevalent these programs are usually part of the public education system some argue that us early childhood education and care programs shoul d be run by public schools b ecause that would ensure quality standards and an education component to programs proponents argue that having local educational agencies in charge of these programs would help provide qualified we llpaid staff and would be be st for focusing efforts on preparing young children for entering elem entary school others argue that the public school system has fa iled lowincome children and should not serve as the model and they argue in order to enc ourage continuing state and private efforts to provide quality early childhood edu cation and care programs flexibility in programs sponsorship including privat providers and head start programs organization and funding sources should be encouraged congress is also concerned with how to increase the supply

indicates need to assess crosscutting programs hehs0078 apr 2000 p 7childhood education and care opponents of increased federal involvement argue that this aid will supplant existing private and state initiatives nd that more federal regulation of early childhood education and car services may effectively increase the costs of care to families furthermore opponents of more federal aid for early childhood education and care argue that as matter of principle such initiatives unduly interfere with the primary role of families in raising young children additionally some argue it would be most efficient and politically feasible to build on existing programs because existing stat initiatives vary enormously in terms of funding structure the entities providing car and level of pa rticipation concerns have also been raised about whether increased federal aid in the form of specific new programs might duplicate or discourage thes efforts on the other hand if new federal aid is provided in form intended to complement existing state efforts block grant for example it may risk lack of focus finally some argue that more coor dination of new and existing federal programs in early childhood education and care is needed in gao report issued in 2000 the agency concluded that ther is presently mission fragmentation and overlap in federal early chil dhood care and education programs both occur when more than one federal agency or more than one bureau within an agency is involved in the same broad area of need fragmentation can create inefficient service delivery and administrative complexity because various agencies are administering similar programs serving similar groups of children in addition mission fragmentation ma kes coordination among agencies administering these programs necessary program overlap creates the potential for duplication which occurs when programs have the same goals the same activities or strategies to achieve them or same targeted recipients however certain amount of redundancy among programs may be necessary to improve service delivery or it may indicate that certain program is related to number of areas37 thus some argue that the federal governme nt needs to focus its efforts not only on expanding aid for early childhood educa tion and care but also on developing more effective coordinati on among existing programs for early childhood education and care
