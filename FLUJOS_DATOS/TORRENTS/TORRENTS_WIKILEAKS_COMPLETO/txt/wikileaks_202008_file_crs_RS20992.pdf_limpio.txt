outofpocket by recipi ents of longterm care and their families steady expansion will be required simply to meet the needs of the growing elderly population expected to double by 2030 while most care is provided by fa mily members most public funding is for ins titutional care home and communitybased services which can help heavily burdened families are unevenly available the us supreme court decision in olmstead v lc focused federal and state attention on development of policies that would expa nd home and communitybased care for people with disabilities most bills introduced in the 107th

health services for persons who have diminished capacity for selfcare is expected to grow substantially in the future about twothirds of the people receiving longt erm care are over age 65 group expected to double in size by 2030 even faster growth rates are anticipated for people over age 85 the age group most likely to need care between 2030 and 2050httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20992crs2 1 arno

fy2001 over 151 billion was spent on longt erm care services for persons of all ages about 122 of total pe rsonal health care expenditure s 124 trillion of total longterm care spending medicaid provided 731 b illion over 48 largely for institutional care longterm care recipien ts and their families paid 332 billion 22 from their own income and assets medicar accounted for slightly more than 14 private health insurance accounted for almost 13 with the balance from other programs the over 151 billion does not include informal caregiving provided by families and other caregivers one study estimated that the econo mic value of these services may range from 140 billion to as high as 389 billion in 20001 while expenditures for longterm care will surely increase in the future whether they will climb commensurately with the number of elderly is less certain research has shown that the prevalence of disability among the elderly has declined over the last 20 years2 if this trend continues the elderly of the future may be healthier than today which may reduce some of their need for care on the other hand increased longevity particularly past age 85 when frailty beco mes common will result in higher demand for services increased demand for care may dr ive up prices though it might also result in more efficient ways of providing services while future need is difficult to predict total public and private spending for longterm care for the elderly alone could double from 2000 to 20253 these two trends growing need and ri sing expenditures present policy makers with difficult choices options may be limite d because the ratio of people age 1864 to those 65 and over is projected to fall from 46 in 2000 to 27 in 2030 indicating that there will be far fewer workers to support the retir ed population this will make it difficult to maintain medicare and social security at cu rrent levels let alone expand other programs to meet longterm care needs4 in attempting to balance needs and costs congress might consider one of the follo wing general approaches5 assistance to family caregivers help families to pay for their own care through incentives for private longterm care insurance andor enhanced lifetime savings andor expand existing grant programs that assist family caregivers ie the older americans act caregiver program home and communitybased services develop social and health services that allow people to receive more care outside of institutions social insurance expand public financing fo r broad range of long term care options either by ex tending medicare andor medicaidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20992crs3 6 see crs report rs20588 olmstead v lc implicati ons and subsequent judicial administrative and gislative actionscoverage or by establishing ne w prepaid public insurance program andor joint publicprivate strategies integrate various components of the previous three approaches in manner that strikes balance between private responsibility and shared public concern many analysts see problems with the current system that need attention most long term care is provided by fa milies but most public funding is for institutional care medicaid the largest public payor spen t 753 billion on longterm care in fy2001 with 71 of that for institutional care nursing homes provide care to very disabled population the average age of residents is 85 and over 80 have limitations in three or more activities of daily living however elderly persons are more likely to receive long term care from family members without reim bursement many be lieve that families should receive more assistance in their efforts to maintain their disabled family members at home and that federal policy should be ch anged to provide more home and community based services which most people prefer however striking the balance between encouraging families to provide needed assistance and relieving personal costs and sacrifices is difficult additional pressures for expanded home and communitybased care may occur as result of the us supreme court opinion in olmstead v lc in its 1999 decision the court held that the americans with disab ilities act ada requires states to transfer individuals with mental disabilities from institutions to less confining community settings when state treatment prof essional has determined the latter are appropriate the community setting is not opposed by the individual with disability and the placement can be reasonably accommodated by the state6 january 2000 health care financing administration now centers for medicare and medicaid notice to state medicaid directors indicated that the decision was applicable to all individuals with disabilities not just those with mental disabilities in recent years congress has followed an incremental strategy for longterm care making numerous small changes in programs and tax benefits in 1996 it clarified the tax treatment of longterm care insurance and expenses the health insurance portability and accountability act pl 104191 in 2000 it established longterm care insurance program for federal workers and retirees pl 106265 and new state grant program to support caregivers the national family caregiver support prog ram under the older americans act pl 106501 through hear ings and other oversight congress has also been concerned about the quality of care provi ded by nursing homes and assisted living facilities nursing and paraprofessional staff shortages consumer protection for longterm care insurance and affordable housing options 107th congress legislation tax benefits for long term care insurance under current law premiums for longterm care insurance may be claimed as an itemized deduction to the extent the sum of the premiums and other unreimbur sed medical and longterm care expenseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20992crs4 exceeds 7½ of adjusted gross income agi the deductible amount is limited by age in 2002 the limit ranges from 240 for persons age 40 or less to 2990 for persons over age 70 these age limitations do not apply to employerpaid insurance which is tax exempt to the worker relatively few peopl can take advantage of this deduction since their standard deduction is larger as part of the fy 2003 budget the presiden t proposed an abovetheline deduction phased in over 4 years for longterm care in surance premiums up to the current allowed age limits an abovethelin deduction is not limited to taxpayers who itemize their deductions and generally benefits all taxpayers who have tax liability on july 25 2002 the house approved more limited abovetheline deduc tion an amended version of hr 4946 which would have been pha sed in by 20 12 under the proposal the deduction would have been reduced for taxpay ers with modified adjusted gross incomes in excess of 20000 40000 for married couples filing jointly and eliminated for those with incomes in excess of 40000 6 0000 for married couples hr 4946 also included an additional personal exemption for families providing longterm care described below and additi onal consumer protections for longterm care insurance further action on the bill was taken before the end

alterna tive tax benefit tax credit would have been authorized by s 24 specter expanded tax benefits for longterm care insurance would reduce its effective cost and result in more people purchasing it proponents see the benefits as way of encouraging families to assume greater fina ncial responsibility for longterm care and helping them pay expenses largely by themse lves greater use of insurance would offset medicaid and other direct public costs in th future opponents question how large role private insurance could play and whether public funds should be used to subsidize insurance which is purchased primarily by middle income families some of whom would buy it anyway in order to pass on larger estate s to heirs they also have concerns about whether there is adequate cons umer protection for this insurance given its complexity and the possibility that future premiums may change unexpectedly in other action on insurance on december 27 2001 the president signed hr 2559 pl 107104 which exempts premiums for the longterm care insurance program for federal employees and retirees from state and local taxes open season for the federal program which is administered by the offi ce of

needs the dependent care tax credit is available for expe nses incurred so taxpayers can go to work the head of household filing status may be us ed by single taxpayers caring for dependent relative
