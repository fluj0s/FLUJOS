responsibility for cses an auditor who receives case supervisor direction cs of what to audit on pc is not discharged of his responsibility as an auditor the auditor has series of responsibilities that are part of every cs he gets to audit accepting the pc auditor is required to accept specific pc just because the pc is assigned to him if an auditor does not believe he can help that particular pc or if he dislikes auditing that particular pc the auditor has right to refuse to audit that pc the auditor must state why the case supervisor director of processing or director of review nor any of their seniors may not discipline the auditor for refusing to audit particular pc an auditor who refuses to audit his quota of hours or sessions is of course subject to action thus refusing to audit particular pc so long as one is not refusing to audit other pcs is not actionable i do not wish to audit this pc because______ i am willing to audit other pcs is the legal auditor statement in the matter some pcs get bad name with some auditors some dont appreciate the auditing some conflict with particular auditors own personality there are such instances it does not mean certain pcs cannot be helped by others it is also true that an auditor who dislikes pc may not do good job so the rule also has practical side to it one auditor disliked young men and did bad job on them another disliked old ladies and chopped them up in session one pc had messed up several scientologists and couldnt find anyone to audit him at all we are not auditing people to make amends to the world thus an auditor has right to reject or accept the pcs he is given 1accepting cs when the auditor gets cs to do on case and if he thinks it is not the correct thing to do he has the right to reject the cs for that pc and require another one he can agree to the auditor does not have the right to start doing cs and change it during the session except as noted below the auditor may not cs in the auditing chair while auditing the pc if he has case supervisor at all the auditor still audits from cs he writes the cs before session and adheres to it in session to do something else and not follow the cs is called csing in the chair and is very poor form as it leads to q and stale dated cs cs that is week or two old or repair progress pgm that is month or two old is dynamite this is called stale dated pgm or stale dated cs meaning it is too old to be valid it should have been done sooner the pc of last week when the cs was written may have been well and happily employed but week later may have headaches and reprimand from the boss it is dangerous to accept repair progress pgm if it is old the auditor who sees his cs is old and sees the pc has bad indicators is justified in demanding fresh cs giving his reasons why program written in january may be completely out of date in june who knows what may have happened in between use fresh cses and fresh pgms stale dates only occur in poorly run backlogged divisions anyway the real remedy is reorganize and hire more and better auditors ending the session when the cs he has is proving unworkable during the session the auditor has right to end the session and send the folder to the cs ending the session is totally up to the auditor if the auditor just doesnt complete an action that was producing ta and could be completed it is of course flunk such case is just not running basic engram the one more time through that would bring the ta down and give proper end phenomena this and similar actions would be an auditor error the judgement here is whether or not the auditors action is justified in ending the session even though he may have made an error the auditor cannot be blamed for the ending off of the session as that is totally up to him he can be given flunk for the error auditing over out ruds auditing pc on something else whose ruds are out is major auditing error 2even if the cs omits fly rud or fly ruds this does not justify the auditor auditing the pc over out ruds the auditor can do one of two things he can fly all ruds or he can return the folder and request ruds be flown the dianetic auditor is not excused from auditing over out ruds and in an hgc must be specially cautioned not to do so but return the folder for new cs better still he should learn to fly ruds inability to fly ruds if an auditor cannot get rud to fn cannot get any rud to fn he is justified in starting green form the auditor solution to fn on ruds is to do gf whether the cs said to or not this is an expected action it is understood the auditor would use suppress and false in trying to fly ruds sessions far apart when pc has not had session for some time or when pc gets sessions days apart ruds must be flown otherwise the pc will get audited over out ruds this can develop mental mass optimum session scheduling is series of sessions or whole program done in block of sessions close together this prevents the world from throwing the pcs ruds out between sessions giving sessions far apart barely keeps up with life the auditing time is absorbed in patching life up rapid gain gets above lifes annoyances and keeps the pc there unreading items when an item the auditor has been told to run doesnt read on the meter even when the auditor puts in suppress and invalidate on it the auditor must not do anything with the item matter what the cs said it is expected he will see if it reads and use suppress and invalidate on it and if it still doesnt read he will be expected not to run it lists when an auditor whose cs told him to list who or what______ or any list question finds that the list question does not read the auditor must not list it when doing list ordered by the cs it is assumed that the auditor will test it for read before listing and that he will not list an unreading question read is an actual fall not tick or stop list trouble when an auditor has trouble doing list and getting an item it is expected he will use prepared list like l4b to locate the trouble and handle it as it is very hard on pc to mess up list it is expected the auditor will handle the situation then and there with further cs directions 3high ta when the auditor sees the ta is high at session start yet the cs says to fly rud or run chain the auditor must not try to fly rud and he must not start on chain trying to bring ta down with arc brks or ruds is very hard on pc as arc breaks arent the reason tas go up seeing high ta at start the dianetic auditor or scn auditor up to class ii does not start the session but sends the folder back to the cs and for higher class auditor to do seeing high ta at start the scientology auditor class iii or above checks for exteriorization in recent session and if so the session is ended and the cs is asked for an interiorization rundown b if the pc has had an interiorization rundown the auditor asks the cs for permission to do cs series 53 or hilo ta assessment or whatever the cs indicates the int rd may have been usually is overrun and needs rehab or correction and it is usual to check itit is included in cs 53 and hilo ta these actions are expected of the auditor even when not stated in the cs going on hoping when case is running badly session to session the last thing you do is go on hoping either in auditing or csing lets try _____ then this then this is not going to solve the case you get data you can get data by white form pc assessment form you can get data from gf fully assessed method 5 you can get data by 2way comm on various subjects you can have the d of p interview and get answers you can even ask his mother you look for case errors you study the folder back to where the pc ran well and then come forward and youll find the error every time do not just go on session after failed session hoping thats pure idiocy you get data from prepared lists from life from the pc from the folder find the bug ah good lord he is pinkerton agent sworn to secrecy he does yoga exercises after every session he was tried for murder when he was 16 and nobody has run the engram of it various auditors ran the same engram chain four times an auditor ran int rd twice after power she had her baby and nobody ran the delivery he doesnt like to talk but is grade zero dozen dozen reasons can exist an auditor does not let cs cs hopefully he refuses the cses until folder error summary is done and the bug found 4things done twice by carelessness the same rundowns can be called for twice and done twice or even more folder summary inside the front cover must exist and must be kept up over it there must be program on which the case is being audited but just because its covered never neglect entering session and what was run on the folder summary fs if hold it still is ordered see if it was run before dont let major rundowns be done twice dianetic items must never be run twice dianetic lists must not be scattered through folder bring them together and keep them together and being brought forward copy dont copy dianetic lists or worksheets from notes or items from lists keep all admin neat and in the original form copying makes errors possible ruds going out when the ruds go out during the session the auditor recognizes the following pc critical wh from auditor pc antagonistic bpc in session ta problem tired failed purpose or sleep sad arc break soaring ta overrun or protest dope off bypassed fn or not enough sleep interest out ruds or interest in the first place an auditor who isnt sure what it is but runs into trouble with the pc except on lists which he handles at once always is smart to end off the session quickly write down the full observation and get it to the cs the auditor who is an old hand and knows what he is looking at as per above scale and the cs the cs would give handles it promptly pc critical wh pull the wh pc antagonistic bpc assess proper list such as l1 c and handle ta or case gain problem locate the problem tired sleep or failed purpose check which it is and handle sad arc brk locate and handle itsa earlier itsa soaring ta or or protest find which and handle such an or is usually by rehab dope off lack of sleep or bp fn check on sleep or rehab fn 5no interest interest in first place or out ruds check for interest or put in ruds list goes wrong bpc handle or do l4b or any l4 at once ruds wont fly some other error assess gf and handle the auditor has business trying to do the cs given when it collides with and isnt designed to handle any of the above if the previous session disclosed such an error and this session cs was designed to handle and doesnt the auditor should end off and the next cs should be 2way comm for data case not handled when the auditor or the examiner collides with pc who is asserting his case has not been handled there should not be new set of actions based on little data but the auditor should end off and the cs should order way comm on what hasnt been handled the auditor should not at once take this up as part of any other cs in other words an auditor doesnt change the cs to 2way comm on something not called for by cs major actions an auditor should never begin major action on case that is not set up for it as this can occur during session it is vital to understand the rule and follow it otherwise case can be bogged right down and will be hard to salvage as now new action to repair has been added to an unrepaired action now if the auditor starts major action on case not set up we get 2 things to repair where we only had i as the major action wont work either repair patching up past auditing or recent life errors this is done by prepared lists or completing the chain or correcting lists or even 2way comm or prepchecks on auditors sessions etc rudiments setting the case up for the session action this includes arc brks ptps whs gf or or listing or any prepared list such as l1c etc set up getting an fn showing and vgis before starting any major action it means just thatan fn and vgis before starting any major action such may require repair action and rudiments as well major action anybut anyaction designed to change case or general considerations or handle continual illness or improve ability this means process or even series of processes like 3 flows it doesnt mean grade it is any process the case hasnt had grade series of processes culminating in an exact ability attained examined and attested to by the pc program any series of actions designed by cs to bring about definite results in pc program usually includes several sessions the vast bulk of auditing errors come about because cses and auditors seek to use major action to repair case it is responsibility of an auditor to reject cs which seeks to use one or more major actions to repair case that isnt running well 6the auditor must understand this completely he can be made to accept wrong cs for the pc and even more importantly can in his own session make the error and mess up the case example pc has not been running well real ta or had grumpy exam report auditor sees cs has ordered major action not repair by prepared lists ruds etc the auditor must reject the cs as he will be made to fail in session by it example auditor gets cs 1 fly rud 2 assess lx3 3 run 3way recall 3way secondaries 3way engrams on all x items the auditor cant get rud to fly does the lx3 in other words he flunks by failing to set up the case it could also go this way auditor cant get rud to fly does gf gets fn he must not begin major action but must end off right there it is fatal to begin any new process on the case designed to change the case if the case is not fn vgis the pc who starts processing for the first time and is surely not fn vgis must be set up by repair actions simple rudiments life ruds or list on life even assessing prepared lists on life these are repair actions the pc will sooner or later begin to fly now at session start you put in rud get fn vgis and can start major actions so the auditor has responsibility not to be led up garden path by cs which orders major action on pc who isnt repaired or by not being able in session to get an fn vgis by repair the only exceptions are touch assist or life ruds or the dianetic assist all on temporarily sick pc but thats repair isnt it program violations when an auditor receives cs and sees that it violates the pcs program he should reject it the pc let us say is supposed to finish his dianetic triples but is suddenly being given group engram intensive that violates the program and also the grade if the pc is running badly repair should be ordered if not the program should be completed example an effort is being made to get the pc to go backtrack this is program containing several major actions which probably consists of several sessions before this program is complete and before the pc has gone backtrack the cs orders 1 fly rud 2 3 s ds the auditor should recognize in 3 s ds major action being run into the middle of program and reject it the correct action is of course the next backtrack process grade violations pc who is on grade and hasnt attained it yet must not be given major actions not part of that grade example pc is on grade i cs orders list having to do with drinking it is not process on that grade it could be done after grade i is attained and before grade ii is begun the cs is incorrect and should not be accepted ability attained now and then before the full major action is complete or before all the grade processes are run the pc will attain the ability of the grade or the end phenomena of the action 7this is particularly true of valence shifters or interiorization rundowns and can happen in grades the auditor should recognize it and with the fn vgis always present at such moments end off i know of one case who had huge cog about interiorization on flow i engrams and was pushed by both cs and auditor to do flows 2 and 3 who bogged so badly that it took long whileweeksto straighten the case out the ability itself gets invalidated by pushing on on the other hand this should never be taken as an excuse i think he cogged to himself so we ended off it must be real what do you know sort of outloud cog with big fn and vvgis and directly on the subject to end off major action or program or grade before its actions are all audited reviewing reviews an auditor who gets cs or an order to repair case that is running well should reject doing the action i have seen case ordered to repair who had ext full perception doing great the repair bogged the case the case then got running well again but second cs ordered new repair which of course bogged it then major actions were done the case was again repaired and rehabbed and became ok three times the auditor should have said false reports the vilest trick that can be played on pc is for an auditor to falsify an auditing report it may be thought to be good public relations good pr for the auditor with the cs actually it buries an error and puts the pc at risk integrity is hallmark of dianetics and scientology just because psychiatrists were dishonest is reason for auditors to be the results are there to be gotten false reports like false attests recoil and badly on both the auditor and pc overts on pcs when an auditor finds himself being nattery or critical of his pcs he should get his withholds on pcs pulled and overts on them off an auditor who goes sad is auditing pcs over his own arc break an auditor worried about his pc is working over problem getting ones ruds in on pcs or cses or the org can bring new zest to life auditors dont have cases in the chair auditor has case if breath shows on mirror held to his face he can audit 8faint afterwards if you must but see that the pc gets to the examiner with his fn then get yourself handled what he did wrong an auditor has right to know what he did wrong in the session that went wrong most often sour session occurs only when the rules and data in this hco b have been violated but an auditors trs can go out or his listing and nulling is in error after session that went wrong somebody else not the auditor should ask the pc what the auditor did this sometimes spots false auditing report but it also sometimes is false report by the pc in any event the auditor has right to know then he can either correct his auditing or his knowhow or he can advise the cs the pcs report is untrue and better repair can be done on the pc savage action against an auditor is almost never called for he was trying to help some people are hard to help not only does an auditor have the right to be told what was wrong but he must be given the exact hco b date and title that he violated never take verbal or written correction that is not in an hco b or tape dont be party to hidden data line that doesnt exist you ruined the pc is not valid statement you violated hco b page____ is the charge auditor may be disciplined for asking may i please have the tape or hco b that was violated so i can read it or go to cramming if it isnt on tape book or an hco b i t is not true and auditor has to accept any criticism that is not based on the actual source data if it isnt written it isnt true is the best defense and the best way to improve your tech these are the rights of the auditor with relation to cs they are all technical rights based on sound principles an auditor should know them and use them if an auditor stands on these rights and gets beaten down he should put all the facts before his nearest otl or so ship as something would

bulletin of 12 june 1970 remimeo cs series 2 cs series 1 is auditors rights hco b 24 may 1970 not so marked programming of cases every action taken on case by case supervisor or an auditor doing his own cs actions should be part of definite outlined program for that case program definitiona program is defined as the sequence of actions session by session to be undertaken on case by the cs in his directions to the auditor or auditors auditing the case the master program for every case is given on the classification and gradation chart issued from time to time the earliest of these charts was 1965 followed by 1st december 1966 followed by 1st january 1968 followed by 1st december 1969 the reissues of the chart are done to improve the communication of the data on the chart the program factor has not much changed since its earliest issue tapes about this chart were made for the shsbc at its first issue and of course remain valid the processes called for on the chart are all part of the shsbc or for upper levels part of the sh and ao confidential materials from time to time they are reissued but they remain standard and have been so since the first issue of the chart the chart and its materials have now and again been neglected or disregarded and the neglect has resulted in field flaps and down stats omitting this gradient of processes not only stalls cases but results in case manifesting outgrade phenomena pc must attain the full ability noted on the chart before going up to the next level of the chart telling the pc he has made it is of course evaluation the outnesses which have occurred surrounding this chart are hard to believe they consist of total abandonment of the chart degrading and losing all its lower grade processes feeding pc at dianetic level data at class vi and telling him who has not made dianetics yet he is now clear cutting down all processes from the chart bottom up to iv to be able to do them in 2l2 minutes neglecting all levels up to ot v and then trying to put in few lower grades and sending on to ot vi having the pc after one trivial session attest all abilities at once and many other errors this is crazy driving if bus were driven along road this way it would soon be wrecked and back where it started but in an ash heap genius in csing is normally required only when some former driver wrecked the thing instead of driving it right in the first place to case supervise one has to accept the following facts 1 dianetics and scientology work 2 the subjects are serious subjects not experimental toys 3 the basics and fundamentals are stated early in the period of development and have not changed 104 the newest and latest is usually recovery of basics and better statements of them 5 the purpose of the subject has not altered and continues to be the attainment of ability and freedom for the individual 6 that things which were true early in the subjects are still true 7 that the mind responds on gradient of improvement not suddenly like bomb explosion 8 that the classification and gradation chart and all its processes and steps is the basic program of any case 9 that all other programs are efforts to get the pc or preot back on the basic program 10 that there is hidden data line and that the materials and procedures are refined mainly to facilitate use and communication of them 11 that auditing is for the pc not the org or the auditor 12 that major processes are done to improve the case 13 that repair is undertaken to eradicate errors made in auditing or the environment which impede the use of major processes 14 that case has to be programmed by the cs to get it advancing as it should have been in the first place on the classification and gradation chart 15 that cs is not being called upon to develop new chart for the case but only to get the case back on the basic chart and get it done 3 programs there are then 3 types of programs 1 the program laid out in the classification and gradation chart called the basic program 2 repair programs to eradicate case mishandling by current life or auditing errors called setup program 3 major actions to be undertaken to get the case back on the class chart from wherever he has erroneously gotten to on it called return program it has been very common cs action to disperse away from program laid out this has been happening ever since the first issue of the class chart and has been principal source of trouble for cses this happens in several ways 1 not knowing the importance of the class chart 2 not knowing basics 3 falling for sp propaganda that we dont use that now the material is old its only background data etc that deteriorates what one does know and could use 4 failure of auditors to give good sessions and do the usual required in session 5 abandonment of the css own repair or return programusually because of false auditor reports or operating on insufficient data from the pc the correct way to go about all this is to 11a repair the case thoroughly with minor actions like gfs prepared lists ruds twoway comm b acquire adequate data on the pc c complete any cs return program begun d get the pc back on the class chart without any processes of the grade skipped run the case on the class chart f repair any departures or errors made in life or auditing g get the pc back on the class chart dispersal not following any program is complete exercise in nonsequitur means one step does not follow the last but is different and unrelated in giving pc process after process that are not related to each other and follow repair program or return program is nonsequitur in the extreme if processes were remarks one would get sequence of processes given the pc sounding like this the submarine just went by so we will order hundred tons of bread there wasnt any beer so birds are seldom seen the dance was very fast so we fixed the carburetor he has very long hair so we decorated his fathers tomb give pc scn triples then do his dianetics then fix up his hidden standard would be series of crazy nonsequitur cses nothing is connected to or proceeds from anything that would be dispersed program for sure it actually happens horribly enough study class chart and then look through some old folders at once the sequence of processes ordered sounds like the submarine just went by so order hundred tons of bread such csing has cause and effect in it person totally ignorant of basic cause and effect gets pc nattery run dianetics pcs case not advancing do grade 0 the cause of the pc condition is not understood nattery pc has withholds case not advancing has problems thats real actual basic tech see auditors rights hco b for the table this data is over 15 years old at this writing is part of proper academy courses and the shsbc and is even in class viii materials the reasons for the pcs behavior or trouble are not mysterious reasons never revealed they are all very well given in course materials here is an actual case folder i examined of pc who is now in trouble and needing repair and return program pc was an accident prone person who is apparently dedicated to having accidents very low aptitude score about 30 had been skipped over almost the entire class chart and given power to handle accident proneness was given cchs this cured it had exteriorized so was given interiorization rundown without 2way comm session pc subsequently developed bad somatics dianetics was never flattened or completed quarter of an inch of examiners reports wherein the pc was asking for help or medicine to get rid of somatics was then put one by one into the folder despite this the cs saw va on the pcs folder and ordered r6ew more examiners calls collected the pc ran one item making one mark on worksheet and attested r6ew 12more examiners reports collected pc reporting self ill cs seeing r6ew attested ordered pc to clearing course pc did one brief session attested clear more examiners reports into folder pc in pain and now in ethics trouble cs ordered pc to ot i pc spent 35 minutes on ot 1 in terror of it hastily attested had 5 accidents in 3 days folder sent to as baffling case so the correct actions now have to be taken 1 repair pc with every list known to man or beast to get off bpc collected in these overwhelming levels 2 repair pc in errors in current life 3 return program the pc by running simple things 2way comm to give pc some wins in actual case gain by maybe handling by 2way comm minor this life or childhood upsets with family maybe putting in ruds on some early subject that turns up 4 put pc back on the class chart to complete the incomplete grade dianetics to its full end phenomena as per class chart 5 bring the pc on up the class chart using all processes for each grade and honestly attesting each grade in turn its all shame because the pc had lose on status she wanted to be clear and ot was actually on it and never walked up the stairs to get to it program necessity one can see from all this the necessity of working by program on case even when one starts an honest program for the case one can get thrown off of it and begin to do something else if the pc goes exterior of course one has to handle by interiorization rundown before the case can be audited at all but thats reason to then skip all the grades pc can go exterior at any point thus it must be handled when it occurs but that does not mean anything happened to ones program or the class chart exterior or interior pc unflat on dianetics not attained the ability marked on the class chart is unflat on dianetics and pc who is unflat on dianetics will have out lower grades jumping processes on the class chart set the pc up to fall on his head later an ot vi with problems is really just an unflat grade i and until grade i is flattened to permanent ability attained on the class chart he remains an unflat grade i cs who gets wound up in this sort of skipped everything and made nothing of course has an awful mess on his hands he can feel as lost as hansel or gretel but waiting to get covered up by leaves is for the birds if one finds the pc off the road the thing to do is return the pc to the road at the point he didnt walk it and there are shortcuts for the mind the utter despair and insane barbarism psychiatry descended into was patient lost psychiatrist lost patient crazy psychiatrist into insane sadism so maybe the first lesson cs really has to learn is 13there is known road out there is shortcut it has to be walked every inch of it and therefore the greatest enemy of the cs is the sp who says thats all old we dont use that now thats just background data and thereby obscures the actual road and another enemy is the pc who screamingly demands to be put up to clear at once so he wont have this awful headache steady on thus the measures cs takes to hold steady course will profit him greatly in the end with good solid gains for the pc as the pc should longer be total humanoid by class iv the lower grade gains are the most important of all cs who puts class chart into every folder he handles is doing wise thing even if its big clumsy hard to handle it is at least thorough if on it he marks in red things the pc has gotten to falsely and if in green things the pc made from the bottom walking an honest road he knows where he is at seeing the whole training cycle half of the chart continue blank means that much more ignorance and trouble for the pc in making his gains stably if the cs put his repair program on red sheet in the folder and dated it out session by session to be audited until it was done and all flubs made in doing it also marked in and repaired the cs wouldnt lose his place in the book for red sheet stands out in amongst other folder papers red sheet with folder error summary on one side of it and the css repair pgm on the other keeps the pcs progress located when that red sheet is done it should be signed by the cs as done which retires all errors to that point bright blue sheet giving the cs return pgm properly dated also gives one chance to not get steered off new red repair pgm sheet fixing up errors occurring in doing the blue sheet can be pushed into the folder but the blue sheet can be resumed again the blue sheet completed should find the pc back on the class chart list of processes run tallied up by the auditor each session keeps the cs from repeating process and gives him the dn items used singly to be done triple while all this admin may seem time consuming lack of it mounts up into valuable auditor time being thrown away csing is road it has milestones when the pc didnt pass one honestly he got lost theres reason for pc auditor and cs to all get lost the cs has an exact road to hold to return to and repairs to get done so the pc can get moving on the return pgm and the class chart which is the road it took too many trillions to find this road for it to be neglected for if the cs neglects it people wont arrive anywhere but get lost as well the right idea is the road lrhkjmrd l ron hubbard copyright 1970 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 14hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 13 june 1970 remimeo cs series 3 session priorities repair pgms and their priority when pc has had an incorrectly run session one that did not wind up with fn cog vgis it is often harmful to delay the repair session most cases of pcs becoming ill or having accidents stem from major errors in programming the case b delay in repairing goofed session there have been several examples recently of pcs ending session with an unflat process after which the repair session was delayed for several days or even weeks and the pc came down with cold or had some minor accident or got in ethics trouble thus repair has priority program errors under major error in programming lays the case open to having goofed sessions and exposes the auditor to some risk of making errors the reason for this is that the pc gets overwhelmed or bogged simply by not coming up through all the processes of each level on the class chart let us say the pc is trying to make it on r6ew solo study but keeps having problems with it and cant get on with it the uninformed cs orders student rescue intensive this is all right as far as it goes but more searching look into the records is likely to find that this pc had exactly 10 minutes on the whole of grade i the outprogram is far more likely to play havoc with this pc than just problems he is possibly in doubt as to case gains and his reality is poor and yet he is being exposed to the highly restimulative materials of an upper level to which he has never climbed direct effort now to put in problems grade i also puts an auditor at risk instead of merely being able to run problems as he would have been able to earlier the pc is in some sort of overwhelm and is nervous or scared or believes he is at fault some way he will look everywhere but in the right direction the answer to an incorrectly programmed case is of course repair program and the sooner the better such repair programs must be very light prepared lists to find charge 2 way comm on various subjects take walk and such repair program must not let the pc dive into rough heavy charge or 15b be overdone to total boredom self auditing some pcs self audit which is different than solo auditing since it has meter or session and is just wandering about the bank some overwhelmed pcs self audit in solo wandering all over the place this is symptom of session or study or life overwhelm it requires repair program ep of repair the end phenomena of repair program is the pc feeling great and feeling he can get case gain good clever repair program produces what badly programmed cases would consider total recovery it is good idea to have the pc attest to i have had definite gains from the recent sessions and feel great or with hearty yes to does scientology really work for you oh you say how could that much gain come from just repair well repair is almost always being done on pc who was overwhelmed by life or auditing in the first place life we know has way of overwhelming people when person is overwhelmed by life an auditing error is more likely to occur when incorrect programming occurs then any auditing on it can add up to more overwhelm which adds up to more errors consistent complaint the pc whose examiner forms routinely have sour note in them should not be continued on the class chart or any return program he is repair pc and nothing else if you get the idea that any lower level can produce large changes in person you will see that lower level processes are being misprogrammed if they are producing only the gains of repair actions the sign of misprogramming is most often seen in examiner reports where the pcs comments or demands are for more auditing or got to have session or wasnt really handled or sour comments or cracks when you examine some folders you will see some pc has more than his share of this thats sign to lightly do it the wrong way to go is plunge 16i have seen cs order 2 major actions in one session after bad session on pc in desperate effort to reach the case the exact reverse is required repair the case by i patch the session goof ii use prepared lists for locating session charge in past sessions iii use prepared lists and two way comm on items found iv get ruds in on periods of the pcs life v get ruds in on parts of the pcs body that are ailing this is not model repair program but only sample of one it isnt model because the pcs have different things wrong with them but you could blindly do all of the above and still wind up with case gain and win for staggering pc then you would do return pgm to get the pc back on the class chart but not until then i have seen pc stagger along for years getting auditing of sort while still retaining set characteristic or somatic who when handled with very mild processes had case gain and then returned to the class chart have complete change of the characteristic effect scale cs can get into the lower end of the effect scale and feel that desperate that he begins to throw away every major process he can order on the pc even 2 or 3 per session but the direction of win was lighter not heavier action sort of like this sparrow keeps getting bowled out with rocks lets try real artillery on him if one is trying to make better sparrow he should lay off the rocks and lighten it up not step up the barrage some cotton tufts might do wonders might even make the sparrow reach the basic trouble with all past efforts at psychotherapy and religious uplift and self betterment and healing was the more desperate the situation the more desperate was the remedy used the right answer is the worse the condition the lighter the remedy required dealing with psychotics in an institution you would find that hello pleasantly said would do more for cases than all the drug firms and electric shock machines and brain icepicks have ever done in all their existence well if it applies to psychotics it applies surely to people that arent simple interest and listening can crack an awful lot of overwhelmed cases that would only bog further if not first repaired 17bpc the exact bpc of the last session handled is always the first action in repair programming this is the exact bpc an unfinished dianetic chain is bpc so get it handled the wrong list item is heavy bpc so get it handled and get this bpc off now now dont wait 2 days or week repair it on priority overwhelm dont always blame the auditor he may goof and he shouldnt but if his procedure and trs were reasonably correct how come the pc got tangled session if the auditor has usually good record and you get goofed session then realize the pc is bit troublesome and was not running standardly of course this doesnt excuse student goofs or plain lousy auditing but when the auditor does all right then the case must be in an overwhelm of some sort so we have 2 variables here for cs decision x1auditor fault or x2pc in an overwhelm there is decision here to be made by the cs its resolved by folder inspection and knowledge of the auditor all rightauditor usually okay that eliminates x1 so we have pc in overwhelm look over past record of pc runs okay that cancels x2 so we repair that one session and its goof and continue with the return pgm or the class pgm whichever the pc was on what if x1 showed lots of bad sessions by the auditor and x2 showed pc usually okay investigate auditors auditing and send to cramming for trs etc what if x 1 auditor okay and x2 pc has lots of trouble now we get to an overwhelmed pc you see how its sorted out by the cs from inspecting two things only the cs can decide whats to be done now if the decision isnt clearcut get the auditor looked into and the pc asked about the auditors actions and his own case if his case has lots of trouble skip worrying the auditor further unless that discloses other errors on other cases okay so the pc is running badly so hes in an overwhelm inspection will reveal one or more of three things 1 case didnt come up the class chart right 2 case being run in temporary life overwhelm 183 former errors not repaired 1 and 3 may both exist the correct cs action is repair program in any case if 3 is true you engage in that first if 2 is true you use repair actions on life as the second part of your repair program if 1 is true you will also have repair program to lay out first in any event and just include it in write it all up on red sheet and follow the sheet session by session as you cs you will now have handled the overwhelm if your repair pgm is good and fully done and not brushed off at the first sign of vgis in the pc at examiner if 1 is true you now do return pgm this of course is what processes youre going to get run to fill in the processes that havent been run to get the class chart all done and the pc back up to where he was he has run some after all ingenuity the genius and bright ideas of cs are not exerted with major processes ever only the interiorization rundown after the pc exteriorized or when it is discovered he has and possibly student rescue or sickness assist are the exceptions to this one doesnt repair with major processes thats like the engine wouldnt run so he hit it with sledge hammer ingenuity is required of cs only in the area of repair locating bpc is rather standard in repair action but fishing up the case by 2 way comm and little prepchecks and getting in ruds on things or times require certain flair in cs i recall one pc who was staggering on engrams couldnt talk to people and was general mess the wrong action would be to run major grade like comm on the pc the pc had to be handled with 2 way comm of some sort yet she couldnt talk auditing or anything else fluently enough about anything to clear anything up i asked her what would it be awful to say and she went scarlet hemmed and hawed and blurted out swearing so we 2 way commed about it what torrent recovered completely recovered so well she thought that was all there was to auditing and was immensely gratified another pc had lost his job and couldnt face any part of it i 2 way commed what his job had consisted of he promptly went out and got another sometimes it takes lot of sessions and lot of reading worksheets to find subjects but if you can persuade auditors to mark every fall and bd in 2 way comm sessions you will find exactly where the pc is hung up and ordering 2 way comm on that and related things does wonders but all repair isnt two way comm touching things is very good way to handle repairs cars typewriters airplanes or book pictures thereof or anything or any picture of anything also works 19the touch assist is little fragment of whole array of touch cases sometimes flinch at remembering anything at all the answer is touch things and reach and withdraw is part of this and is used in repair trs all of them 0 to ix are so good in repair action that they actually cure 50 or more drug addicts when run for weeks in groups such as on the has course it is even reported that when run on people still on drugs over periods of weeks they come off the drugs of their own volition trs are fine unlimited repair action prepared lists run on all sorts of things can repair whole life look at who am i is used in repair session when pc goes too wild to audit an exception is list errors when the only remedy is fast l4a mimicry is actually too high for repair repair is its own subject the only demand in programming it is to give priority to recent auditing errors or recent life catastrophes many cases obviously have to begin processing with repair life overwhelm is the reason and an s d can be far too steep next to skimping lower grades repair is too little used and it is needed and the urgency is to not let things go too long unrepaired l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 20hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 14 june 1970 remimeo cs series 4 the return program when case has been repaired there is always return program made up by the cs it is handwritten on blue sheet of paper that is easily spotted in folder when the repair pgm has been concluded the case is considered to be set up for return pgm the exact point where repair program is changed into return program is when the case has had some wins and is in far better shape than he was when he first began to be audited which means his first ever auditing the point is also identifiable as the point where the person feels more outflowing and less overwhelmed if at all this is obviously point of case change the common and incorrect practice of looking for case change as the only benefit from processing should be relegated to repair end phenomena processing is actually measured by the gradual increase in ability step by step these increases in ability walk up the class chart and ability is the measure of progress the cs who is looking for the solution to case the one shattering bang of total effect on the pc has set himself for continuous losses in csing for there is one action that totally changes case from bottom to top in one fell swoop the cs who thinks there is continually fiddles hopefully case has many things to be handled not one there is one single wrongness or outpoint in case case is collection of outpoints he hurts he cant talk he has problems he is arc broken he has service facs he is stuck in incidents etc to just mention few such outpoints radio receiver that has been many times broken and is heap of twisted parts is not going to get repaired much less improved by radio repairman finding one huge error in it and correcting that hell have to correct lot of minor errors in it before any major error even shows up the oneshot clear idea of the uninformed of 1950 is impossible when person goes onto the clearing course after missing the lower grades he just doesnt make it at all he often cant even get reads it takes many miles of road past many case changes to get up the gradient scale to top ability repair program takes the case from where it has falsely gotten to on the class chart and gets off the overwhelm with light processes the return program begins when the case is longer so overwhelmed and is getting wins from the repair program 21the return program consists simply of writing down in sequence every needful step and process missed on the class chart by the case which are now to be done example case has falsely gotten to r6ew solo and isnt making it well the cs writes up light process but extensive repair program first on auditing then on life the case achieves the ep of repair in case changes and less overwhelm the cs now examines the 2way comm sessions and examiners reports to establish what levels are out change level 1 lots of arc brks level 2 the cs lists all the level 1 and level 2 processes the pc did not get done and this is the return program when these are done and the pc has made it the cs has the pc honestly back at r6ew on the class chart and continues to follow the class chart needful repairs also sometimes have to be done in getting the return pgm done in each case new repair program is done the old return program looked over but probably just continued example of case at ot 1 now completely repaired case has somatics dn level unflat makes others guilty level iv unflat dramatizes r6ew unflat the return program consists of completing dn rehabbing comm all level iv processes redo r6ew rehab clear return to ot i that completes the return program in other words when the case found in trouble at level is fully repaired and winning the cs studies the current data on the case to establish the major levels that are out each level has an error and an ability and then gets these into program which then session by session is followed the program which can be completed in one session will never be written as there is such program program is the consecutive layout of what has to be done in the next many sessions the basic program is the class and grade chart the return program is the return to the false point reached by getting honestly done all the points missed on the road the pc who cant attest grade ability at any point has to have 1 repair pgm 2 return pgm 22it is truism that the grade he cant seem to make is not the grade an earlier grade is out if the processes of any one grade properly run do not achieve that grade the earliest error is of course failure to achieve the lowest grade there is what is out here is that the case needed to be started on repair pgm for life now that skipped one has to do repair on both auditing and life the return pgm is easy in this instance as it just puts the pc back on what he was on the first level but this is the only instance where pc is restored by the cs to the level he was on without an extensive return program so return pgm always follows the repair pgm and return program consists of putting the pc over road sections he missed on the road up return pgm is concluded and retired when the pc is back on the grade he falsely had reached before the repair and return were done and is now making that grade l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 23hubbard communications office saint hill manor east

hurts put in ruds on it pgm can be extended to be sure pc has had wins and is in better condition than was in before auditing and longer overwhelmed or can be cut if this occurs before then return pgm begins with trs 09 on up the class chart as needed to get his abilities and ends off with full repair of power rehabbing pr pr 4 and 5 and running 6 to ep and checking lists he will then be back on class chart properly this is not repair pgm to be copied particularly it is given as an extent of repair which would then be done session by session and ticked off by the cs as he ordered each new step the iv l4a prepared list would be wholly assessed for each specific list the v and vi are whole list of things not given here common to such step but containing dynamitetype things like sps or overwhelm or other things like the names of major processes note that everything from i to viii are strictly auditing repairs ix to xvii handle life areas this case should have been started in auditing with life repair pgm such as given from ix to xvii had he been on drugs as habit or just shaky about life trs to 9 could have begun his auditing followed by life repair ix to xvii new development these actions of repair before level auditing are new development as such but 2 way comm and these actions are all from the early 60s shsbc possible faults evaluation q and and an inability to listen resulting in the auditor chopping comm would be the chief reasons any errors would creep into the sessions given in the repair program as these might not show up in the auditing reports if the repair pgm sessions did not result in gain the cs would have the auditors auditing checked for these points of evaluation q and and comm chop the sessions are actually very easy to run and could be done by an academy class iii or better by class vi note on viii auditing viii auditing presumed when developed that lower grades were still being delivered viii auditing and training are fully valid they are as the class infers high level of auditing and remain so the sequence of recent development has been viii auditing to standard dianetic hdchdg auditing to standard dianetics csing for all levels csing below levels 25csing to handle the neglect of lower grades and shsbc data which are being gotten back in rapidly the cs is therefore confronted with cases without lower grades and the earliest and reissued class chart neglected the mania for quickie lower grades and the acts by few who fed upper cognitions and other evaluation to pcs wrecked for while part of the bridge and made it impassable much of the current cs work should take this into consideration the repair pgm given above is not as long as it could be and certainly would be shorter the ix to xvii are brief layout of how new cases could be handled before any actual level auditing as guarantee of real gains this is whole zone of action prelevel predianetics becoming increasingly necessary by the decline of the culture as visible in pcs now beginning processing as different from those even up to 1962 these ix to xvii steps would also work on institutional cases but one should take it even easier i repeat this repair pgm i to xvii is an example and its numbers are not useful as different repair pgms would be designed by the cs for the pc many other things could be done none of them heavy or desperate the cs should caution any registrar not to sell with the name repair pgm this is entirely technical and not pr or sales it is just auditing as far as the registrar is concerned had pc x been processed on all earlier grades in scramble before 1962 one would list and then rehab every process run as part of the return pgm such step would be done as the last step however of the return program as prelude to straightening out the highest grade falsely attained before repair the rehab would not be substitute for running all the processes of the levels not previously run rehab is part of repair tech action we have fallen into belief that any repair is done in review review is now the place the pc goes when the cs gives up repair is tech div action and counts as hours of auditing delivered auditing is auditing obviously 2 25 hour intensives could be consumed in life repair before new pc ever came near even an assessment of the minus scale of the first class chart much less level in academies students may get anxious to get their grades practiced and so may skip repair actions needful thus upper level students should audit lower level students dianetics pcs audited only on dianetics in franchises and centers will make some astonishing physical and even mental improvements the larger percentage will do so however cs will find some have had physical gains without finding out about it the reality factor has not increased to any degree such pcs of course get long repair program and are then given return program to dianetics their highest level 26the sample repair pgm above fits such pcs as well as one that attained higher levels before it was found that lower grades were out there are variables in what the pgms are 1 pc bogs or not gaining 2 repair pgm outlined and concluded 3 return pgm outlined and concluded what the cs puts in the repair pgm and what he puts in the return pgm can be very variable indeed cs q and the only fault ive seen in cs trying to outline 2 way comm could be called cs q and the pc has big win about frogs huge cog fn vgis changes his life the q and cs is to order frogs two way commed the system one uses is not to use pc wins as items to further handle that stifles overruns the win its an ability gained one should be able to write off win items as gains and let the pc have them and use items pc mentions that read shows he has reality on them to push up to new wins the cs in looking into 2 way comm for things to handle finds his prizes in subjects that read but havent fned the cycle is find an item that reads push it to fn cog gis leave that find another that reads push it to fn cog vgis leave that find another etc 2 way comm with the auditor marking f lf llf bds etc gives the cs worksheets to pick new items out of the cs looks to see if any of these were the subject of any fn if so he crosses them off he orders prepchecks or two way comm on the items that read and havent fned thats the way the cs gets his instructions to auditor for the exact actions of the repair pgm steps he has already outlined l ron hubbard founder lrhntkjmrd copyright 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 27hubbard

type style cs series 6 what the cs is doing in dianetics the modern science of mental health considerable stress is placed on the words and phrases in engrams this is still functional however as i did further research i found that many pcs were unable to get the words in the engram and b the apparent force of the words was derived wholly from the pain emotion effort contained in the engram in standard dianetics the words in an engram play major role in the auditing the use of the words to deaberrate and concentration on phrases in engrams is valid but junior in force to the pain misemotion etc in the engram thus if you run out the force the words drop into insignificance this is often how the pc gets cognitions the words and meaning concealed in the engram are changing value and devaluating the pc can then think clearly again on subject previously pinned down by the force get the force out and the words take care of themselves and need special handling the meaning of things plays secondary role in processing to forces thetans find counterforces objectionable almost all chronic continual somatics have their root in force of one kind or another in that the handling of things with bodies involves force to greater or lesser degree incapability and derangement of mental values is proportional to the thetans objection to force this objection descends down to wish to stop things it goes below that into overwhelmedness in which propitiation and obsessive agreement manifest themselves low tas the low ta is symptom of an overwhelmed being when pcs ta goes low he is being overwhelmed by too heavy process too steep gradient in applying processes or by rough trs or invalidative auditing or auditing errors low ta means that the thetan has gone past desire to stop things and is likely to behave in life as though unable to resist real or imaginary forces high ta chronically high tas mean the person can still stop things and is trying to do so however all one has to do is restimulate and leave unflat an engram chain to have high ta high ta is reflecting the force contained in the chain an overrun means doing something too long that has engrams connected with it which means an engram chain with too many engrams on it being restimulated by life or auditing hence overrun 28if this overrun persisted unhandled eventually the pc would be overwhelmed and one in theory would have low ta mental masses mental masses forces energy are the items being handled by the cs on any pc if the cs loses sight of this he can wander off the road and go into the thickets of significance engrams secondaries locks all add up to mental masses forces energies time which express themselves in countless different ways such as pain misemotion feelings old perceptions and billion billion thought combinations buried in the masses as significances thetan can postulate or say or reason anything thus there is an infinity of significances thetan is natively capable of logical thought this becomes muddied by out points held in by mental forces such as pictures of heavy experiences as the masses and forces accumulated and copied from living build up the logic potential becomes reduced and illogical results occur pc search the pc is continually searching for the significance of mass or forcewhat is it why is it the cs is easily led astray by this all forces in the bank contain significances all forces can be unburdened and lightened up by the various procedures of auditing the search of the pc is for significance the action of the cs is reduction of forces the emeter the emeter records what force is being discharged in every slash fall and blowdown the amount of ta per session is the css index of gain note that discharged process longer gives ta and gives case gain the amount of significance recovered or realized by the pc only shows up as cognitions as the ta works off the case then one has two indicators 1 there is needle and ta action 2 the pc cognites one shows that force is coming off two shows that thought is releasing from force backwards csing if cs processes toward significance only he will get cases that do not progress 29the needle action detects not so much significance as where the force is diving toward significance the cs winds up shortening grades looking for magic oneshot buttons and overwhelming cases by shooting them on up the grades while levels remain loaded with force reliable indicators when pc gets more ta action on level i he will have made level i and will know it he will therefore attest to problems the reliable indicators are ta action and cognitions while level is still charged diminished ta action and cognitions mean the purpose of the level has been reached feeling of freedom and expansion on subject is expressed in normal ta and loose needle the pc will now attest to an ability regained fn abuse to process only to fn and even chop off the cognitions on process abuses the indicator of the fn you can find many pcs who bitterly resent fn indications they have been not run on all the processes of level b still have force on the subject c were chopped off before they could cognite the arc break in this is unfinished cycle of action the proper end phenomena for process is fn cognition vgis now look at that carefully that is the proper end phenomena of process it is not the end phenomena of level or even of type of process let us say there are 15 possible scientology processes for orienting pc in his present location to run one of these 15 and say fn thats it youre complete is quickie impatient action that rebounds on the pc eventually if there are 15 run 15 possibly the pc on 12 will cognite hes really right where he is only then could you cease to work at it an fn cog vgis tells you process is finished not whole class of actions thus 2l2 minutes from 0 to iv is not only impossible it is murderous it will result in an overwhelm low ta or high ta eventually level i says amongst other things problems processes there are certainly half dozen each would be run to fn cog vgis when these and the other processes of the level are run the pc will come to have further reaction to problems and will be able to handle them cognition in lower levels is not necessarily an ability regained thirty or forty cognitions on one lower level might add up to and probably would the realization that one is free of the whole subject of the level 30it is safe to run more processes it is unsafe to run too few pc abilities it is not enough for the pc to have only negative gains of deleting force sooner or later he will have to begin to confront force this comes along naturally and is sometimes aided by processes directly aimed at further confront what problem could you have sooner or later is needed in one form or another what force can the pc now handle all auditing in bodyand any living in bodymakes being vulnerable bodies break suffer intensify pain sooner or later pc will go exterior the interiorization rundown must be ordered as the next action or you will have pc with high ta 2way comm extint must be given in following session not the same one so the full cognitions will occur after this the pc is less subject to the body and his ability to confront force will improve do not be too worried or surprised if after this the pc has some minor accident with the body exterior he forgets its frailty however such things are minor he is learning how to walk new way and will run into chairs he gets this figured out after while pcs sometimes improve their ability to handle force while interior so as to have mysterious headaches or new body pressures inevitably they have been exterior and need interiorization run they were just using too much force while still inside thus force is the thing significance very secondary force of course is made up of time matter energy flows particles masses solids liquids gasses space and locations all this gets inherently handled in processes published long since the pc tends to dive for the thought imbedded in the force he will tell you hes being processed to find out who his parents were or why he is sterile or who did him in etc etc the cs who chases after this is deerhound illegally chasing mice cs purpose the cs is there to make certain that the pc makes gains and attains the actual abilities of the level the cs is for the pc cs auditor control exists only to keep the auditing standard the trs good the processes ordered done and to end phenomena each one other reasons for csing exist l ron

7 cs q and just as an auditor can q and so can cs as you know q and is the incorrect 2way comm action of wandering off the question by feeding the pc what the pc said as question the answer is taken as the next auditors question many various outlines of what q and is already exist and this is just to refresh the subject example student auditor is ordered 2way comm on cities by the cs which is okay but it can be q and aed like this student tell what you think about cities pc theyre cold student what about cold pc i dont like it student what else dont you like pc well old men student what about old men pc theyre obnoxious student what else is obnoxious pc well you remember all about that its maddening and shows auditor control and certainly doesnt handle the original cs subject of cities there are three main ways in which cs can q and in csing pc cs pc goes to examiner on own volition and says i am ill i need my ruds flown cs q and would be fly ruds pc on his own goes to examiner and says i am upset about my job cs writes l1b on job you get the idea the first one is therefore q and aing with exam statement of pc this is varied by taking pcs note or letter or report and accepting what the pc says is wrong like im pts to my husband and then csing 2way comm on husband naturally the ancient law applies here if the pc knew what it was it would not be wrong and would asis pc coming up to exam saying its my husband with fn cog vgis would be what would happen if it was the husband and that would be great but of real value to cs except pc has had win and not to now use husband give you an actual example pc in solo ruds found she hated george it fned next audited session pc was saying she hated george wrote note about george cs did not notice the outness ordered lib on george and in 2way comm got little or ta continued to be ill the fact is it wasnt george at all and not even terminal pc had gone up one grade too many hit an overwhelm the earlier 6 grades were out correct action was to have done general repair the moment pc suddenly and mysteriously caved in and got ill on new level the pc never should have been going on up grades for the last 6 grades the tendency to toss it all off with q and not only didnt handle but obscured the real situation 32csing win the second q and is to cs pc win pc in 2way comm mentions cats and more cats and cats and finally at the end of session has big fn cog vgis on cats the cs sees all this cat mention and orders prepcheck cats that is very cruel sort of q and another version of it of course is to see pc reach full end phenomena on series of processes like an unmistakable pcvolunteered valence shift and keep on going into an inval correction is to rehab of course yet another version is to pull wh and then keep pulling it so the pc doesnt think its gone correction is to rehab of course the ta often goes high or low on these q and actions and invaleval actions are ordered and the release point rehabbed next grade please the third q and cs can pull is to agree to the pcs demands for the next grade despite all contrary indicators im ready for clear now says the pc full of somatics whose r6ew wasnt really done and who cant talk the registrar execs and others push on this also the d of p and cs have total authority on this they should be diplomatic he can have the grade of course but i will have to prepare him for it is the best answer please make arrangements for clear preparation25 hours if the cs doesnt hold the fort on this the pc put into the next grade who isnt ready will fall on his head if this pressure from the pc in any version continues have him sign waiver i will not hold the org or any principals responsible and waive any refund if i am put on next grade that either gets home or he says okay and signs so put him on the grade and hope he doesnt fall on his headand if he does now demand he get the hours needed to get fixed up so he can really make it d of p or cs often have other pressures exerted on them that are not technical in nature such as economics ambition status symbols of having high grade regardless of headache and have to cope with these diplomatically but any but tech considerations are dangerous to entertain summation of these 3 2 are concerned with letting someone else cs like an engineer letting someone else plan the railroad and the third is also slightly in that nature consisting of not noticing the pcs wins and using them with which to cs caution this doesnt mean the pc is always wrong he is generally right when he says hes overwhelmed or upset hes almost always wrong when he says what 33overwhelmed him or what bpc was out when simply saying it does not correct the case or produce fn vgis you always use the pcs data one way or another in that you are paralleling what the mind does thats reads not what the pc says remember that whats really wrong lies in the field of mass energy space time form and location as these are eased up by standard dianetics and 18 years of scientology actions and processes thoughts come to view so if you q and with thoughts already in full view you never really ease up the bank thats why q and with significance is not done l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 34hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 19 june 1970 issue ii remimeo cs series 8 chart of human evaluation science of survivals chart of human evaluation is study for cses and is of great use when you find the pc on one of its columns you can see if the pc stays there or falls back there standard dianetics opened this chart to full use for cses 18 years of scientology processes and knowhow are to large degree evolved from this chart if pc is staying at level of the chart or falls on it you know he is running above his level processing changes conditions if it doesnt improve them or the pcs behavior then the pcs reality is not being reached it can be plus or minus above or below it is seldom that the pcs reality is higher than the processes used and really only occurs when grade honestly run is rerun then you get pc protest as hes made that pcs who get sick suddenly are being run far too high on the class chart pcs who dont change are also being run too high behavior mannerisms are the index do these change if they do the pc is improving if they drop lower on the human evaluation chart the pc is in overwhelm picking thoughts out of forces in the bank brings change in other words you can park pc by continuing nothing but think processes which address only significance self auditing self auditing is the manifestation of being overwhelmed by masses etc and pulling only think out of the bank pulling out think then pulls in more force which gives more self audit not all self audit is bad the pc eventually realizes its forces after few tens of thousands of hours if he knows all the answers good push against wall is worth hundred hours of self auditing and its force human evaluation this famous chart in use by the way by an airline and several other areas and which had to be printed as desk blotters for personnel people at one time could easily be expanded in numbers of vertical columns to include all behavior 35the cs is at disadvantage as he doesnt see pcs but he can have mannerism item filled in on summary report mannerisms______ mannerism changes _____ this serves it also serves to look at the psychosomatic column of the chart and pcs health form changing the pc the pc will change in ideas when he changes his relationship to forces tons of processes do this objective processes have to be run in on pc now and then somatics passing through in session are definite clue to force change the somatic pc is either high as an angel or being run too high you dont have to run directly at force for forces to change in the pc one 2 way comm i did with pc released his hold on huge bundle of forces the body responds badly to forces the conflict between protecting or using body and being as thetan able to withstand large forces gets so mixed up in pc he can wind up as forceshy thetan standard processes standard processes such as those in use for 18 years handle this when fitted into their levels what the cs has to realize is that he is producing an optimum rate of change in the pc if he is csing well and b changing the pcs position upward on the chart of human evaluation l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved

late 1960s was not its workability it was growing cultural disinclination to do things thoroughly fast quick results was interpreted as seconds or minutes in old psychotherapy as practiced in the 19th century it required one year of weekly consultation to see if anything could be done about case and four more years to produce meager superficial result compared to that two or three hundred hours of processing was nothing as we began to dominate this field in terms of persons handled and results obtained psychiatry invented instant psychiatry by which result was gotten in time speed became the primary consideration of the culture jet planes fast cars saved time but an old chinese when told by driver that he had saved 4 minutes in speeding back from town asked what are you going to do with the 4 minutes time itself is basis of aberration dropping time out is the consideration of factory managers of production lines as the faster something can be made the more you have of it but look at this again something can be done so fast it isnt done at all the difference between very fine camera and cheap one is speed of manufacture cheap cameras dont get their parts carefully machined or matchedthey dont fit togetherthey break cease to work fine gun can be told by the lack of tool marks on the hidden places cheap guns inner bolt is mess of scars it isnt smooth in operation it didnt take much time to make but it also jams and freezes up when you try to use it maybe youve heard of hotter than 2 dollar pistol 2 dollar pistol is hot because its so quickie made it usually blows up and blows off hand there is point where speed is simply cover for cheap worthless product let us take filthy room lazy housekeeper comes in and sweeps few bits of dust under the carpet leaves soot all over the windows and garbage on the mantle and says its clean somebody else not afraid of work spends an hour at it and leaves really clean room short pgms short pc program is economically and efficiently for the birds in the first place cs has to know the extent of his tech well to be able to think up light processes in quantity if one heard cs say but i dont have time to spend an hour doing long program for the pc one is listening to something peculiar if one spent an hour or two doing up real long 20 action program to repair the pc then for the next 20 cses it takes only few minutes to look over the session and order the next action on the list if one had program one would have to study the folder each time one actually saves cs time by doing long programs both to repair and to get the pc back on the class chart where hed gotten to 37further auditing is sold by the hour and it wastes money and income and pcs to short program them yes but we sell result if we can get 200 pcs done in 100 auditing minutes we would make 18233 clear profit well the cruel answer to that was when orgs began to do that on lower grades they didnt attain the result on the pc and stats went down power was once priced against the fact of 50 to 100 hours of auditing it retained the price and by cutting out all end phenomena or real gain it was at last being given in 20 minutes and after just so many years of this economic dishonesty shs crashed they had sold out the real value of the product for quick buck the field became arc broken and few takers came to an sh it is very long hard road back and it is very costly one quickie grades instead of making fortunes for one and all crashed the whole scientology network because quickie results are lazy and dishonest lets just face up to the facts of life selling out the integrity of the subject for buck wrecks the subject success the real stat of an org is success stories honest grades and time spent in csing and in auditing to obtain them add up to success for the individual the org its field the country and the planet the time it takes to process somebody is how long it takes to get each single result available it is not how slowly or quickly it is done book is not good book if it takes 7 years to write and bad book isnt always written in 2 weeks it takes as long to write good book as you get good book the result is the result and time is just an entered arbitrary person who overwhelms at grade iv is an easily overwhelmed person it might take 50 hours just to repair the case and the persons life that might be 20 or 30 steps on the program if the cs cant dream up 8 or 9 ways to repair past auditing and 15 or 20 ways to repair life then its time to go back and read the original thesis evolution of science dmsmh 880 88008 and listen to hundred or so shsbc tapes yes but i have time to well thats also saying it cant be done well but there is time if anyone looked over his area he would be able to throw out the timewasting actions if it comes to that look im the cs the d of p and have to audit 3 thats statement that the job has already been done so badly that persons show up to take over the extra hats and the noresult programs cripple the economics and that becomes help i have seen mary sue take over an hgc that had tons of unsolved cases and too few auditors and have watched her solve one case at time and within 2 weeks have 35 auditors and backlogs and in six weeks unsolved cases she was using the old historical background we dont use them anymore processes 38so it not only can be done it is the thing to do that orgs stats soared it became solvent it ran at high run and was happy org sick pcs when there are sick people on list one doesnt just give dianetic assist and send to doctor and write them off if one knows his tech there was reason the person got sick one also knows sick person goes into overwhelm easily one can do touch assist contact assist twoway comm ruds on the accident ruds

in but lighter actions should be the earlier and in program auditing repair comes before life repair expectancy now if cs or an auditor has magical complex he expects one process to run person from wog to ot vi and in one minute the missing knowledge is gradient scales stairs and ladders have steps and rungs it takes time to climb tower the magical complex thinks of processes as incantations or charms person csing would always be trying to find the process the pc should be run on the think is that the process once discovered would take time at all and the pc would magically become well pardon but thats pure goofiness and it would set the cs up for constant failure one sees such person scrambling through processes trying to guess which one which one which one oh theres one now we run it for 3 minutes on the pc oh dear it didnt work he isnt well lets see whats here still scramble scramble oh heres one this green paper is probably the right color auditor run this on the pc oh dear it didnt work he isnt well yet so we will take these 5 major processes and run them all in one session and add six grades do that do it its desperate situation oh dear the pc blew well i guess the subject doesnt work or im failure that is not how one should cs if workman was supposed to cure an ox hide and was told salt would do it and he had magical complex what would he do well he might take small salt shaker and sprinkle the corner of the hide thinking the right thought and find that the hide rotted in few days he could then conclude salt didnt cure ox hides if someone kept hammering at him to cure ox hides with salt and he kept sprinkling the corner knowing it wouldnt work hed get very odd idea about his orders but who would suspect that this workman thought it was magic an honest rubbing of salt all over and into the ox hide is the meaning of salt will cure ox hides 39but that would take work it would take time it would have to be honestly and thoroughly done but one would have cured ox hides and gotten shoes and profit and pay and everything for one had product magical thought in auditing isnt likely to give anyone product of really able people shortcutting processes processes can be shortcut as well as programs take an early means basic useful usable version of rising scale there are 18 pairs each pair should be run to fn cog vgis an auditor told to run rising scale can run along the 18 pairs until one fns and leave it the process has been shortcut and with that shortcut went its ability to restore fertility so one hears rising scale will sometimes restore fertility or change eyesight orders it done it is done to 1 fn real result occurs or take dianetics dianetics can be chopped to save time first feeble flutter of an fn cog vgis auditor barking did it erase did it erase final result real gain there goes the subject half an hour to run the chain extra 30 seconds for the real fn the cog the vgis so one wastes result for the sake of saved time the age it is symptom of the age that there is time but in the data series pls one finds that omitted time is basic insanity that body lives only about 70 years puts an awful limit on man mans empires endure at most only about 300 years if that 70 years is not enough time to make real career and 300 years is not enough time to even groove in civil service man pays for it with poor lives and rotten governments but it doesnt take 70 years or 300 years to process pc year maybe up to homo novis few years to ot even traveling it casually slow 25 hours to repair someones life and 50 to 100 hours to get him up to somatics with dianetics is pretty satisfactorily fast whats this take week to repair 2 to 4 weeks for full dianetics at 25 hours week thats very little and its enough to tell him to get trained so he can have all he wants speed liability when speed is the consideration not results you get very cheap camera or car and you can expect it to fall apart very soon you also get cheap reputation we are in the leica and cadillac and rolls royce product class without trying 40why settle for quickie grades you get students that way and thats the heavy org income you get expanding field and you wont ever get cleared planet weve learned all this the hard way so lets not let it go unheeded the place to handle the situation is with csing and to gain the cooperation of cses to make results real results by insisting that speed is the fast road to poverty in the long run if the cs burden is too heavy start pushing training then youll get help honest csing gives an honest result it takes as long to correct case as it takes it takes as long to make person well as it takes it takes as long to get real lasting grade result as it takes and thats lot longer than the time spent on it in the late 60s all pcs have to be ot tomorrow why let them cs their case by demanding it only take 2 minutes self csing is more effective than self auditing registrars as well as pcs try to grab the cs hat i will sell you marital intensive because you have such bad cold and execs run this staff member on money well css hat is the css and he should wear it for honest results and damn others trying

overwhelm and it was goofed on process type which was already what you would use for repair so now what do you do the answer of course is to sort out the real error if you cant find it readily in the worksheet have the examiner ask the pc what the auditor did then having found the actual goof you have it repaired by rehab of the bp fn or an l1b using method 3 in assessing the prepared list the goofs are fortunately few in type there has to have been basic goof for repair session to have gone wrong so when one goes wrong you really search the worksheet until you find it and if it isnt visible get the pc asked these goofs are pretty elementary the auditor possibly doesnt know that ta can go down by overwhelming by overrun or way up by overrun so usual goof in repair is overrun of an fn or an item that fned or list that fned example in repair pgm gf is called for auditor clears couple items suddenly hits hot one pc gets fn cog vgis auditor told to get all the charge off the gf overlooks senior datalet pc have win gfs often raise hob with the ta if run further than the item goes on down the gf list past the fn vgis hunting for new charge pcs ta goes to 16 pc cogs he has stuck picture ta 16 end of sess now what do we do well new factor now enters in cs wander the pc was on precise repair pgm is only at vi out of xviii steps but the pc is rough rough running diverges critical boggy and now he is stuck into goofed session and we have to repair repair cs at this point can wander he can q and the whole repair pgm can get departed from and the pc really bogged when faced with repairing repair pgm session watch it dont wander the cs procedure is this 1 find in the ws or from the pc the exact goof 2 repair that goof by rehab indicating bpc or two way comm depending on the error 3 do not order new different nonpgm action 4 continue the pgm 42it is here cs can go adrift new actions crossing the original program can soon have cs pc and auditor chasing over hill and dale it is fatal pursuit about the only time you change repair pgm once outlined is to extend it or lighten it but in that case do whole new pgm you will find 2 way comm is lighter than prepcheck let us say pc was doing great on 2 way comm gets into prepcheck session and goes out the bottom in such case the prepcheck is repaired of any goof noted in it and 2 way comm that sessionand it comes out all right if goof can be located 2 way comm it and it will be okay an auditor can throw list not ordered into repair pgm by finding the ta high at session start and doing an or list and goofing the list it would already be dicey to list pc who is on repair pgm to then goof ordinary laws of listing and nulling can get grim the first cs action to repair the repair is of course to get the list corrected with an l4a you can often spot the listing goof as cs its usually an or of an or list or an incomplete list or an unnecessary list its poison to list pc on repair pgm however 2 way comm it if check for exteriorization reveals it you have choice but to do an interiorization rundown thats common reason but if the pc is already flinching at engrams limit the interiorization to 3 way recall and note it clearly that hes only 3 way recall of int auditor flubs student or new auditors produce the most flubs it is therefore good to keep them off repair actions or repair pgms the commonest flubs are failing to trim the meter and ignoring the fn at 31 yet sitting right there running the pc up to 40 without ever asking have we bypassed release point poor trs not having 2 way comm down neglecting pc origin or chopping comm are probably next in order of frequency repair pcs remember that pcs who need lots of repair are delicate cases feather touch is the watchword they are not all that easy to audit they can cause auditors and cses to disperse such pcs are afraid of force and easily get engulfed if pushed hard into the bank so lightly lightly and exact repair of any flub and get back to the program mid program is time to become inventive l ron hubbard founder lrh sb rd copyright 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 43hubbard communications office saint hill

are always written case supervisor always writes his cs instructions on separate sheet of paper for the pc folder repair programs now called progress programs are on red sheets return programs now called advance programs are on bright blue sheets all cses are written in duplicate carbon copy is made the cs keeps the carbon copy for reference in case the original ever gets lost high crime it is high crime for case supervisor not to write in preclears folder what the case supervised instructions are and high crime for an auditor to accept verbal cs instructions to commit this crime causes 1 extreme difficulty when doing folder error summary as there is background of what was ordered and why 2 gives the auditor leave to do anything he likes as not in writing 3 is open to misduplication and can cause squirrel processes to be run and so mess up preclear with nonstandard tech any csupervisor found guilty of this from this date is to be removed as this could only be considered deliberate attempt to mess up preclears points on case supervision 1 check your orders to find out if auditor did them 442 check to see if commands correct and if pcs reaction was expected reaction for those commands 3 check any list and find out if there was mislisting 4 advise against background of standard tech 5 order any errors corrected or get the case on further up the grades 6 beware of overcorrection 7 beware of false pessimistic or overenthusiastic auditor reports they are detected by whether the case responded to usual actions as they all do 8 beware of talking to the auditor or the pc 9 have implicit confidence in standard tech if it is reported not working the auditors report is false or the application terrible but not reported 10 above all else hold standard and never listen to or use unusual solutions double folder danger when preot has solo and an auditing folder both there is great danger if the case supervisor does not look at both before csing there has been an instance of preot running strange cses on himself another ran cses out of other folders on himself in both cases the consequences were hard to repair when finally found in another case in the solo folder the preot had gone exterior with full perception but the nonsolo auditing folder was being csed the ta shot up for 2 months without any cs except myself calling for all folders preots unfortunately run on solo folder and an audited folder unless both are to hand when csing wild errors can be made by the cs there is also the case of person having two audited folders being csed at the same time this is an admin error the firm rule is cs only with all folders to hand the embarrassing situation where one cant get folder from another org or field auditor or where the old folder is lost has to be made up for somehow it mustnt halt auditing totally case supervisorfolder handling analyzing folders go back in the folder to the session where the preclear was running well and come forward from it doing folder error summary reviewing folders in reviewing folder the first thing to do is to look at the cs to see if it was done use the summary sheet to get the auditors attitude and pc mannerism changes use the auditors report form to get the time of processes 45read and take all your data from worksheets and compare it to and see that cs was complied with and ensure standard tech was applied if you cant read the reports send it back to have the auditor overprint illegible words never try to case supervise cs an illegible worksheet as youll only run into headaches the after session examiners report gives you the first clue of how suspicious you should be in examining the folder and whether or not auditing reports contain falsities standard tech youre never led by anything into departing from standard tech the only reason it doesnt work is that it hasnt been applied the main question of case supervisor is was it applied if you follow this exactly youll never miss case supervisor data case supervisor should watch for ethics record of pcs who have been csed if they fall on their head get into low conditions the folder should be reviewed most probably the auditor did not do what was ordered and if folder looks okay chances are the auditing report is false as something is wrong or pc would not be in trouble auditing and ethics cases undergoing ethics actions comm evs amends projects or low conditions should not be audited until the ethics matter is cleared up and complete it only louses up their cases to audit them when under such stress admin auditors must always put the pcs grade or ot level very prominently on the auditing report case supervisor cannot properly cs case without having this data to not do this is out admin out adminliability much has been said about the importance of admin in auditing but auditors just arent getting itso it now becomes liability to have out admin in pcs folders folders are to be submitted with the latest session on top auditors report form is stapled to worksheets which are dated numbered and in order latest on top summary report is then attached to the auditing report and wss with paper clip this of course is as well as the usual admin such as legible writing rewriting illegible words marking reads and fns and all end phenomena etc 46the cs instructions for that session go under that session so you get cs 4668 auditing session 4668 cs 5668 auditing session 5668 cs 7668 etc etc as the whole purpose of class viii is to minimize the time in auditing by doing perfect standard tech this cannot be done if it takes 15 minutes to put the folder in order so it can then be case supervised so it can then be audited gross case supervision errors 1 failing to use progress and advance programs when needed 2 ordering unnecessary repairs 3 trying to use repair processes to get case gain instead of getting the pc onto the next grade 4 not writing down cs instructions but giving them to an auditor verbally 5 talking to the auditor re the case 6 talking to pc re his case 7 failing to send pc to examiner if youre unsure why his folder has been sent up for cs 8 being reasonable 9 not having enough ethics presence to get his orders followed 10 issuing involved repair orders 11 biggest gross case supervision error for cs is not to read through the pc folder l ron

series hcob just being issued is renamed progress program it has been found that case gain which has not been earlier achieved can be consolidated by progress program it takes 25 hours can be done by class i or above as long as it is csed by an viii who has starrated on the new cs series this is quite technical development in itself it is the answer to pc who had quickie grades and didnt actually reach full abilities in earlier scientology auditing it is followed by an advance program which follows below advance program this is what was called return program in the cs series the name is being changed from return to advance as more appropriate it gets the pc really up to where he should be it may take 50 hours or more expanded lower grades pcs wont like being told they have to have their lower grades rerun actually thats not factual statement anyway the lower grades harmonic into the ot levels they can be run again with full 19501960 to 1970 processes as given on the sh courses all through the 1960s these are now regrouped and sorted out and are called expanded lower grades only this route will now be sold there are dianetic or scientology singletriple or quickie lower grades any more dianetic clear there is such state it is not however attained by feeding people scientology cognitions as was done in only about 25 go actually clear on dianetics dianetic clear or any other dianetic pc now goes on up through the grades of scientology and onto the proper clearing course the dianetic clear of book i was clear of somatics the book i definition is correct this is the end phenomena of dianetics as per the class chart and book 1 25 more make dianetic clear 48accidentally they still need expanded lower grades to make scientology clear becoming dianetic clear does not stop them from getting power processing modern power is to its total end phenomena classification chart this chart classification and gradation chart has been reissued many times all issues are more or less valid to save print the processes run column appears in processes taught on the auditor side of the chart a11 these processes and more are used in expanded lower grades the chart is valid quickie grades persons were too demanding to be done quickly on many cases these grades as given were valid but large number of cases needed expanded lower grades 20 minutes from grade 0 to iv and 5 minutes power was far more than many could stand up to these need progress pgm and an advance pgm this is true of persons at va or r6ew or on cc or ot levels a11 these who havent fully made it need progress pgm and an advance pgm to pick up all the latent gain they missed dianetic pcs dianetic pcs should be audited on dianetics until somatics then go up through expanded lower grades to power r6ew clearing course and ot levels training any pc who has trouble needs training and the amount of time required in expanded lower grades and so on makes it cheaper to be trained l ron hubbard founder lrh sb rd copyright 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 49hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 30 june 1970r revised 6 march 73 changes on following three pages in this type style remimeo cs series 13r viii actions gf 40 iv rundown viii case supervision inevitably when any new approach or process is released some will instantly assume that all older actually more basic data has been cancelled there is statement to that effect it is not guessed that this will be assumed and so we could lose an entire subject we did in fact lose dianetics for decade and all but lost scientology in the following ten years subject can be reorganized and made more workable that was done in 1969 for dianetics but it had never been unworkable the 1969 dianetics reorganization refined the 196263 discoveries of r3r better communication was made to the user and the preclear amazingly the reissue of dianetics as standard dianetics caused about dozen people even in high places unfortunately to at once assume that dianetics wiped out any need for power scientology clearing or anything else even an unauthorized policy letter not signed by and an hco b also not signed by gave this impression they were of course cancelled the instant they were discovered to have been sent out this idea that the old is always cancelled by anything new has its root in the idea that later order cancels earlier orders which is true but orders are one thing and tech basics another what if in the science of physics book by professor glumph came out omitting the three laws of motion and gravity it is assumed then that newtons laws are longer valid because they are old newton lived between 1642 and 1727 so some young student engineer is baffled because bridges have weight and cant work out gravity or motion and he and his fellows begin to build without knowing these laws and there goes the whole of engineering and the culture itself this is fantasy as college student in upper math i was utterly baffled by calculus i couldnt find out what it was for then i discovered it had been developed by sir isaac newton examined the basics and got the idea my college text omitted all the basic explanations and even the authorship of the subject calculus today is really not enough used because it isnt understood anyway heres the main surprise until 1970 the whole of scientology was never in use in processing students had ridden along with the research line up into the ot sections discarding the ladder behind them for nearly 3 years an increasing proportion of preclears were not actually making it the gradient to get them onto the bridge had been neglected as old when in fact they were not old but basic the amazement of auditors and their delight when the hco b on auditors rights cs series 1 was released indicated that they had become process oriented with all the why gone 50viii auditing the 1968 viii standardization aimed actually at good trs auditing presence and basics in auditor performance viii auditing was developed to handle the ot band it is entirely valid its only omission was detailed actions now developed as to how to handle pc or pre ot who had been pulled up the line and had fallen on his head out grades was spotted and discussed in detail in viii auditing giving lower grades fast was the only error it was not realized in 1968 that end phenomena of lower grades was not being required the rerelease of the entire band of academy and saint hill materials in 1970 is reemphasis on the validity and necessity of using it all on pcs and in understanding the mind and life and all this is quite welcome and very successful not noticed is that this whole band was never before presented for full use on all pcs as i say 1950 1969 auditors had been riding with the newest and latest because it was popular only few wise oldtimers continued to use the most basic actions but just as viii auditing was an unauthorized signal to suppress all that had been known before so now with the full release for use of expanded lower grades few began to say that viii auditing was now old one assumes then that some like to be able to say that something is now old has superior sort of ring to it i guess anyway wed better disregard this tendency to retire basics it is more amusing than otherwise so lets get on with the job resistive cases the resistive case rundown is an viii development to handle those who cannot make the grades it was put into the green form as gf 40 so as to preserve it to it could now be added overwhelmed this would indicate need of repair progress and return advance programs but many other indicators exist already so when do you use gf 40 let us say the pc has been run on grade zero and at the examiner cannot or does not attest one would first look for simple auditing errors in recent sessions these would get reviewed and corrected one would then look for lower actions than grade zero that had been missed if it still seemed hard to figure out one would use gf 40 resistive cases in essence if one adds overwhelm to the gf 40 list you have on it all the reasons pc wont advance if he has been run on all processes up to that point overwhelm would indicate need of repair and return grade i problems is the usual ordinary reason for case advance problems shows up as an outrud in gf 40 and is simply put in as rud not as grade but if grade ii or above has problem that means grade i is out 51gf 40 remains even more plainly as when all else fails it is used that way when pc doesnt attest and all has been done for him otherwise you use gf 40 this was its proper use in the first place all such materials except rapid or quickie grades are valid and joke these remarks on gf 40 resistive cases do not wipe out repair and return programs iv rundown the socalled iv rundown as taught on the viii course is of course quite valid originally developed to catch cases that had somehow gotten up to ot iii and were falling on their heads it is collection of actions it salvaged many cases the missing datum was that in recent times these cases were falsely reported to have had their lower grades they the cases themselves said they had had lower grades this made mystery the fact is with multiple declare declaring 0 to iv to the examiner all at one time mostly without any mention of end phenomena of the grade these cases were out grade in the extreme the iv rundown was an effort to catch it all up to make real ot out grades didnt read as it didnt mean anything to the pc and besides theyd all been rehabbed dozen times anyway but nobody mentioned never having attained any end phenomena and the class chart was never really gotten in in in in the first place you will find many pcs have had various parts of the iv rundown run earlier for while it was the fashion to use the iv rundown or part of it on any balky case at any level at ot iv which was an audited step and none of it really confidential the cs simply ordered run whatever was left of it not already run somewhere on the case all of the iv rundown still should be run but of course that would now be on return advance program and well up the line if repairreturn doesnt get grade made this is the time to do iv rundown on 3 valence shifterlx1 lx2 lx3 lists can be done in triple recall secondary engram earlier practices former therapy can also be triple recall secondary engram this is on page 28 not 23 of the original viii case supervisor manual and part of it is also now gf 40 if case really needs this he wont be making lower grade really so the gf 40 or its slightly wider ot iv rundown can be used to both overwhelmed by auditing should be added in any future issue to indicate needed repair action case supervisor actions hco b 10 dec 1968 case supervisor actions confidential viiis only is still valid it remains confidential as it mentions some ot phenomena that would spin 52grade va however some viii cs is going to be told that expanded lower grades changes all that it doesnt listen in the next to last paragraph of the cover page of this manual hco b 10 dec 68 it says standard grades are not part of this setup as it is understood that the auditor knows these directions to do standard grades are written on blank sheet i have added the block letters for emphasis here at the time this was written i had not discovered that lower grades were gone out of use and i let be published triple grades which seemed to condense all lower grades the major process or major grade process is definitely not enough to make pc make lower grade i am sorry i gave any support at all to such an idea by not examining the whole scene when it began to show up did find it and did correct it however when auditing statistics over the world showed the fault 28 hours was the total weekly delivery of orgs if you add the dozens and dozens of lower grade processes as given in expanded lower grades to the viii cs hco b of 10 dec 68 and included this cs series and its new development of repair progress and return advance programs you would have the whole package of csing so the viii actions are all valid auditor classes below viii have this cs series the ao cs course adds in the viii actions as well any cs who does not know well the original thesis dianetics the evolution of science dianetics the modern science of mental health scientology 880 and scientology 88008 will go badly astray it is vital to know these books and others in this area to know what one is trying to handle class vi shsbc tapes and bulletins are all valid and vital to lower grade auditing and csing i trust this gives the cs some idea of what is still in it all is l ron hubbard founder lrh dzntrd

2 way comm as of senior importance to pcs text which is also made note of in the ws d the questions asked in 2 way comm can be very incorrect just as rote processes can be an auditor must be trained as 2 way comm auditor class ii otherwise he will evaluate q and and commit other faults f if an arc break occurs early in 2 way comm session and is not handled as such the rest of the session is audited over an arc break and can put pc into sad effect g pc with pt problem not being handled in the 2 way comm will get gain h pc with wh in 2 way comm session will become critical nattery andor

the same as asking for ptp who arent you talking to is asking for whs l the subject of major processes should be kept out of 2 way comm cses auditors questions and 2 way comm assessment lists arc brks

two way comm session must be put in by the auditor 2 way comm session should end in an fn p auditors whose 2 way comm sessions do not end in fn must be taught to check the subject for read before using not to q and not to evaluate and given refresher on 2 way comm tapes and hco bs q in 2 way comm session that flubs the cs must be careful to isolate the errors just as in any other auditing session that flubs and put them right r 2 way comm subject that reads on test and doesnt fn on 2 way comm must be checked for or if ta went up and rehabbed by the 1965 rehab method or prepchecked or just continued the whole point to all of this is that 2 way comm session is auditing it is delivered by the auditor csed and remedied like any other session also it is usually being run on delicate pc

end the pcs ta goes up as at the examiners in an org the pc is afflicted with unflat engram chains all high tas depend on unflat or restimulated engram chains tas go high on overrun because the overrun restimulates engram chains not yet run engram or secondary or lock chains can be keyed out this does not mean they stay out in few minutes or hours or days or years they can key back in pc will also destimulate in from 3 to 10 days usually this means he settles out thus pc can be overrun into new engram chains by life or an auditor ta goes up 3 to 10 days later the ta comes down when pc is audited to fn vgis and then few minutes later has high ta the usual reasons are 1 has had his comm chopped or full dianetic or scientology end phenomena not reached or 2 has been run on an unreading item or subject or 3 is overwhelmed or 4 has lot of engrams keying in or 5 has been run in the past without full erasure of engrams or attaining end phenomena 6 lists badly done or other misauditing cause pc to feel bad and key in chains also 7 pc can be audited when too tired or too late at night the solution to any of these is easyon l always see that the pc attains full ep particularly on engram chains on 2 make auditors check for read even in twoway comm subjects list questions or dianetic items before running them on 3 see also 2 and get the pc proper progress repair program on 4 repair or isolate pc so his pt isnt so ferocious looking meaning repair progress pgm him well or let him change his environment and then audit him or 5 look into his folder to see who audited him on so many chains when with real erasure or ep 6 you use repair lists like l4a lib etc and other usual action on 7 you make the pc get some rest and if he cant make him go for walk away until he is tired and then walk back and get some sleep all these really add up to keyed in or unflat engram chains whether the pc can handle them depends on repair and the usual 56of all these the past auditing without attaining ep on engram chains whether done in dianetics or scientology is usual reason for much audited pc to have high ta the answers to any high ta that wont come down and to any pc who continually arrives at examiner after an fn vgi session end with his ta up are faulty auditing not letting pc go to full dn ep when running engrams b false auditing report pr type report meaning promoting instead of auditing c too many engram chains in past restim by life or auditing any correct standard dianetic auditing will eventually handle but it is usual to do picture remedy see

vi if the dianetic auditing is standard and to dianetic ep fn cog vgis you will see this pattern at the examiner or few minutes after session first few sessions ta 40 or more at exam doubtful gis next few ta 375 and blowing down to 325 at exam gis next few ta 375 bd to fn at exam gis to vgis next two or three ta 35 bd to fn at exams vgis finally ta 25 fn vgis at the examiner another pass at the hf finds it fn and pc can and will attest dianetics thats what you would expect to see if the auditing was standard if the case was straightened out of past flubs in the repair step errors such as running unreading items or firefights caused by out trs or false auditing reports or dn ep not reached at session end or pc needing ruds put in at session starts would prevent this pattern from happening at the examiners so if the pattern doesnt happen you know the auditing is goofy or something is out which had better be found one pc for instance had huge wh of having disease and was audited over it for 2 years auditing over wh and ptp case gain silly pc but also very dull cs not to alert to some outness there and find it another pc had high ta and the fault was just that she never got any auditing at all so they kept operating on her somebody didnt know dianetics and auditing was for use 57high ta and illness pcs with high tas feel ill and get ill use to elaborate on that its just fact and is the fact about pcs who get ill so maybe you see why this hcob is important low ta at exam pcs with low tas are more or less in apathy if it fn vgis at session end and is low at exam like l9 or if it went low in session and didnt fn then the pc is overwhelmed and needs auditing and life repair b can have been run on flat or unreading item that invalidated his former win example pc listed on an unreading list few sessions later worrying about it and coming to exam with low ta repair is the answer low ta pcs need life repair also note the new hubbard consultant

series 16 dn checksheet session grading well done definition of well done to an auditor requires precise meaning it is not given by the cs because an auditor is friend or because he would be offended if he didnt get one well done given by the cs for session means the pc had fn vgis at the examiner immediately after the session this then presupposes that session lines include an examiner even if its receptionist and it includes the use and understanding of exam reports see hco pl 26 jan 70 issue iii or any rewrite and exam tech it presupposes the examiner has meter to hand and that the pc makes statement thus if there are exam reports there cant be well done given eh true enough cs who cses without exam reports done by different person than the auditor is asking to fly blind and to get auditor pr public relations or brag and false auditing reports fn at exam well done this is harsh as early on pcs often get fn at examiner but in every case there are current earlier tech errors on the case when the fn doesnt get from the session to the examiner it is also harsh because the failure to get the fn to the examiner could be cs error but see hco b 24 may 70 auditors rights cs series

invalidative remarks should not be made by cs experience has shown they do good and also do harm but there are 2 methods of invalidating an auditors auditing 1 let him go on flubbing and getting results 2 direct invalidation of his intentions or future or potential in 1 nearly all auditors who stop auditing never really knew how to audit in the first place or have gross misunderstoods or have accumulated intentional or unintentional overts on pcs or have been too harshly invalidated when they dont really grasp the ease and simplicity of auditing they get into other troubles really well trained smooth auditor never gets any real charge on his case on the subject of auditing when you let an auditor flub the whole subject gets invalidated and he loses his value because he goes into doubt this can be said with complete confidence today as the whole of dianetics and scientology is there and it works very very well indeed if it is used and if the csing and auditing is correct and flubless 60auditor handling the cs is really not just the case supervisor he is also the auditors handler like boxers trainer or stars director the cs handles his guys they are all bit different auditors there are prima donnas and meek mousey ones and steadyon ones and all kinds they get the credit for the sessions from the pcs most often they really dont like not to be csed and they value the well dones and the very well dones and they flinch at the flunks and the honest ones know all about it before they turn it in and some dont mention the flub but think youre fool if you miss it so its important to have constant in assigning what the auditor is given for the session well done auditing hours are all thats valid for stat so cs must be very exact and correct in his determination of well done very well done mention and forlornly flunk this should remove argument from the matter and bring certainty l ron hubbard founder lrhrrrd copyright 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved

undershooting are two very defeating errors in csing overshooting would be defined as going beyond completion or completing completion in such circumstance the pc for instance reaches an fn vgi point in review and then the cs decides to handle the case in review example 2 or 3 sessions have been goofed review patches them all up to fn vgis all okay then cs cses to review the case to repair the errors the case feels invalidated caves in needs further repair i have seen more than one folder where this cycle has been done three times in one of these an action had to be taken to patch up goof so the pc could go back onto grade the goof was patched up to fn vgis the correct action would have been to put the pc back on the incomplete grade but new review cycle was laid out audited pc caved in new cycle to repair this was entered in upon it was successful the pc got fn vgis at exam the cs ordered new review of the case the case caved in was then patched up and finally got an fn vgis and was ordered to be reviewed studying what was wrong with the cases i found the above i ordered an assessment of list got unnecessary actions and got the cases back onto the incomplete cycle of the grade and they did fine this can be done with grade it was the fault of early power undershooting would be to leave cycle incomplete and go off to something else example case sent to review or given review session to repair goofs one goof is handled but there are three to handle case returned to the grade before being set up this can be so bad that the case never made any grade at all the modern repair progress pgm as outlined in this cs series takes care of this quickie grades and actions quickie grades left us with totality of incomplete cases you look over folder and you see the pc at ot iv the folder is thick he has had lots of auditing he has aches and pains problems makes people wrong 62probably he could be audited for another thousand hours without ever coming right unless there was an orderly program to complete his case level by level on the class and grade chart it would take repair progress pgm and then an advance pgm that included each grade to completion he would have to have his ruds put in any flubs at once handled session to session just to complete dianetics finally his chronic somatics gone he would fn on the health form and that would complete his dianetics with his attestation and so on right on up the grades each one done fully to the voluntary declare for that grade as per the grade and class chart in doing dianetics grades etc you still have to get in ruds and handle the case so it is set up for each major action and repair the flubs at once when they occur while completing an action you have to keep the case running not audit over arc brks ptps whs and flubs the best answer is flubs but when they occur they must be repaired in 24 hours when repaired and not rerepaired and rererepaired with overshoots you get the case back on the same cycle that was incomplete complete cases case is not complete unless the lowest incomplete grade chart action is complete and then each completed in turn on up as you look over current folders who have had years of auditing some of them you generally dont find any completed actions and you do find overshoots on reviews it is not the least bit hard to handle these cases this cs series shows you how auditing and life repairs progress advance pgm completing fully each incomplete grade the cs is blessed who follows these two rules recognize completion of an action and end it off recognize an incomplete action and complete it dont overshoot dont undershoot follow the rules l ron hubbard founder lrhrrrd copyright 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 63hubbard communications office

an interne well taught learning his practical tech or by an auditor especially hired to do fess it requires many hours to put folder in sequence and then to list all errors in it it should never be done by working cs who is responsible for an orgs delivery flow cost it is costly to do an fes and where possible the cost duly consulting the pc should be borne by the pc as special service it can be directly paid for or simply deducted from auditing hours purchased necessity good cs looking over folder usually goes back to the last time the pc was doing really well and notes actions necessary from that point programs of lengthily audited case fat folder usually cover lib l3a l4a lists and usually take up 2way comm on earliest sessions and earliest auditing ever given for auditors thus an fes is not vital in all cases i like to have an fes done so i can compare areas covered by the pc in 2way comm and be sure they come up in subsequent repair sessions also where i can see lot of bad lists existed i want to be able to assure they get handled thus an fes is useful on flag an fes is carefully done so as to detect areas of out tech in the world this is called the flub catch system auditors and cses so detected are sent to cramming in their areas to smooth out their tech knowledge or trs all to improve delivery of tech flub catch makes an fes vital on flag higher orgs have similar interest in an fes halting delivery to halt delivery because of missing folder or to do long timeconsuming fes is of course contrary to the need to deliver auditing and can result in noauditing situation worse than blind repair 65blind repair when fes is done one is doing blind repair the progress pgm and advance pgm may have holes in them however there are only five areas of danger 1 flubbed lists 2 bad series of evaluative sessions should be detected and directly handled 3 flubbed power 4 extended or flubbed interiorization 5 missed grades if cs doesnt know about these it may be that the case will not properly repair and he also does not know what advance program to do but as these are specific areas they can be done on blind repair by making them into list and getting them meter checked example pc has lost his folder has been audited for several years on and off one can clear the idea of lists someone written down items you say to question and see if it gets read and if so do l4a method three on lists one can ask if any auditor ever told the pc what to think and if that reads 2way comm or prepcheck those sessions by that auditor power can be checked by rehab unless the person has gone clear on the clearing course since at which time power will not need repair the commands of interiorization rundown can be checked with 2way comm or rehabbed what wont rehab you run missed grades can be checked rehabbed or run including any expanded grades the pc usually recognizes the process if it has been run thus one can wander through blind repair without fouling up the case and add to it the inevitable actions common to all progress pgms summary an fes has value it is valuable to the pc to get one done it is long and extensive action it can be sold directly or removed from hours bought it is of vast interest in training auditors and should be done by already trained internes or specially hired auditors it is not done by cs and it is not used to halt all delivery of auditing and jam up the cs lines lost or delayed folder is not barrier to very well trained cs who has starrated cs course an fes is very useful and tends to eradicate any mystery

big win the auditor would clear the next process command he would see an fn he would clear the next process command and see an fn but it was the same fn result was that processes 2 and 3 were never run on the case this is really what is meant by quickie grades in 1958 we got real releases you could not kill the fn for days weeks several processes had this effect todays real clear also goes this way you couldnt kill the fn with an axe by running lot of level zero processes for instance you can get real swinging unkillable fn it not only gets to the examiner it comes in at the start of the next days session now if in one session you ran all of level zero and went on up to level one you would just be auditing persistent fn the pc would get benefit at all from level one hes still going wow on level zero if you ran level zero with one process that got big wide floating fn and then ran level i ii iii and iv you would have just level zero release the pcs bank was nowhere to be found so next week he has problems level i or service fac level iv and he is only grade zero yet it says right there in certs and awards log hes grade iv so now we have grade iv who has level i ii iii and iv troubles session that tries to go beyond big dialwide drifting floating fn only distracts the pc from his win big win any big win fn dialwide cog vgis gives you this kind of persistent fn you at least have to let it go until tomorrow and let the pc have his win that is what is meant by letting the pc have his win when you get one of these dialwide fns cog vgis wow you may as well pack it up for the day 67gradual widening in running dianetic chain to basic in triple you will sometimes see in one session half dial on flow 1 34 of dial on flow 2 full dial on flow 3 or you may have 4 subjects to twoway comm or prepcheck in one session first action 13 dial fn then fn ta up second action l2 dial fn then fn third action 34 dial fn fourth action full dialwide floating swinging idling fn you will also notice in the same sessionlong time for 1st action shorter shorter shorter for the next three actions now you have an fn that anything you try to clear and run will just fn without affecting the case at all if you audit past that you are wasting your time and processes you have hit an unkillable fn properly called persistent fn its persistent at least for that day do any more and its wasted if an auditor has never seen this he had better get his tr0 bullbait flat for 2 hours at one unflunked go and his other trs in and drill out his flubs for thats whats supposed to happen fns on pcs audited up to for that session persistent fn always get to the examiner if you only have small fn it wont get to the examiner however on some pcs maybe thats good enough may take him several sessions each one getting final session fn bit wider then he gets an fn that gets to the examiner after that well audited on continuing basis the fn lasts longer and longer one day the pc comes into session with dialwide floating swinging fn and anything you say or do does nothing whatever to disturb that fn its real release man it may last weeks months years tell him to come back when he feels he needs some auditing and chalk up the remaining hours if sold by the hour as undelivered or if sold by result chalk up the result if the fn is truly persistent he will have objections if it isnt he will object so have him come back tomorrow and carry on whatever you were doing summary the technical bug back of quickie grades or quickie power was the persistent fn this is not to be confused with stage

this has been true for 20 years but it gets neglected this neglect gives us flubby auditing b fad tech if auditing is flubby it is the cs who is responsible in the first place he permitted bad course training without screaming in the second place he does not persuade or force auditors to correct their tech in cramming after flubs since flubby auditing is the primary reason for results an area where tech is bad tends to ride fads or grab the newest and latest and hope it will crack cases whereas doing the usual without flubs is what cracks the cases if i find an auditor whose sessions i am csing has failed to flatten chain i assume not that the pc is difficult but that the auditor does not know about 1 only running items that read 2 multiple somatics 3 narrative chains and that his trs are bad i spot what it is from the session worksheet and say what it is and order the auditor to cramming or to be crammed if there is cramming on the materials and on trs always i cannot cs with flubby auditors the pile of cs folders grows any review has to be reviewed and my cses just arent getting done if auditors i am csing for are green i can count on 4 times increase in my csing time if my auditors are flubby csing that should require 112 hours takes 612 hours this is by actual timing i have objection to working with green or newly trained auditors but if i do i retrain them the cs who accepts an auditor from any course as trained auditor is an optimist there are three training stages course study theory and practical b student auditing c professional auditing the cs has to do with c when and b are very poor the job at c is much harder so the cs should call it forcefully to attention of course supervisors and then get fast retrain going under himself retraining is an inevitable part of css job matter how good the course may have been the actual practice of auditing gives the new auditor different importance values also his hat has changed from student hat to real auditors hat 69as cs works with an auditor he trains him he also may order the new auditor audited essentially the cs has to shift the new auditors hat from whats it say to now i do with whole green crew of auditors i give as cs daily auditors conference i make sure my tech services is on the ball so auditors get in 5 or 6 hours in 5 or 6 hours not in 10 or 12 hours while they wait for pcs or go find them that gives them auditor admin and study time then i can have conference this conference does not violate any ivory tower as i dont cs on their data of pcs i find their questions and get them answered and i give them the reasons behind certain cses then daily daily daily i meet any flub with an order to cramming on the material flubbed and on trs and i keep their overts pulled green auditor with as cs has very arduous time of it there is invalidation quite the contrary the message is you can audit you can get results get wised up and get on with it one flub one retrain in cramming lot of auditors are around who learned to audit with as cs after their training in the majority of cases they became fantastic auditors in some few cases they went elsewhere before they could be fully trained the magic of it all is simply 1 flub 1 retrain in cramming on that point mostly i didnt even pull them off the pc the fuzzy muzzy state of most graduated students needs handling it is handled by the cs the object of cs is to handle and improve cases he cant do that with flubby auditors so he has to make auditors out of students if he does he can then achieve his object if the cs wears this part of his hat he really wins he seldom has to unravel anything tough he just cses and the auditors audit eventually but every new auditor he gets is certain to lengthen the css working day and lessen his results unless the cs realizes that there is on the job training and gets it done training includes the auditors staff hat and his knowledge of tech and qual divisions this would be true even in franchise or the field they might not have the divisions but they have all the functions recently cs had to get about 60 people audited fast she had seven auditors assigned she did not assure that these auditors were knowledgeable on the courses they had had and she did not wear the training hat of cs she wound up with herself and one auditor doing the whole 60 the excuse was the other auditors couldnt audit it would have been far faster in terms of audited pchours to have rapidly crash programmed the seven auditors through refresher cleaned up their misunderstoods and overts in coaudit and then using them to shove them into cramming on the materials of any flub and trs for each goof she would have made seven auditors into stars and she would have gotten the 60 pcs fully audited completely and rapidly with minimal flubs she would have had 60 dianetic and expanded grade completions 60 terrific beings and in less time morale goes to pot only when auditors do not get results 70her basic error was assuming auditors should be able to audit this isnt true of any auditor who has not served an apprenticeship under competent cs an auditor who has been auditing 10 years when he starts to audit for the first time i put on my cs training hat and matter how good or how poor he was when he began i make him better auditor cs who doesnt do this is letting the team down and badly cs who doesnt do this will spend hours daily trying to puzzle out the solution to messes made cs who doesnt do this fills up field with flubbed cases regardless of his own skill in csing he is liable to sink into doubt then treason and blow the cs who wears his training hat and does do this leads smooth life is respected by his auditors and is valuable beyond gold to do this cs must himself be able to audit and to know his materials well enough to state which ones have to be crammed and never introduce strange ideas such cs will never have revolt and will never have to dream something up

procedure on certain preclears i have been able to view the underlying motives and mechanisms of psychosis very possibly this is the first time the mechanisms which bring about insanity have been fully viewed i must say that it requires bit of confronting the alleviation of the condition of insanity has also been accomplished now and the footnote in dianetics the modern science of mental health concerning future research into this field can be considered fulfilled the things cs should know about insanity are as follows higher percent about 15 to 20 of the human race apparently is insane or certainly much higher percent than was estimated the truly insane do not necessarily act insane visibly they are not the psychiatric obvious cases who go rigid for years or scream for days this is observed only in the last stages or during temporary stress under apparent social behavior the continual crimes knowingly committed by the insane are much more vicious than ever has been catalogued in psychiatric texts the actions of the insane are not unconscious they are completely aware of what they are doing all insane actions are entirely justified and seem wholly rational to them as they have reality on the harmful and irrational nature of their conduct it does not often register on an emeter the product of their post duties is destructive but is excused as ignorance or errors as cases in normal processing they roller coaster continually they nearly always have fixed emotional tone it does not vary in nearly all insane people in very few it is cyclic high then low all characteristics classified as those of the suppressive person are in fact those of an insane person the easiest ways for cs to detect the insane are 1 pretending to do post or duties the real consistent result is destructive to the group in terms of breakage lost items injured business etc 2 the case is case gain or roller coaster and is covered under pts symptoms 723 they are usually chronically physically ill 4 they have deep but carefully masked hatred of anyone who seeks to help them 5 the result of their help is actually injurious 6 they often seek transfers or wish to leave 7 they are involved in warfare with conflicts around them which are invisible to others one wonders how they can be so involved or get so involved in so much hostility types the german psychiatric 1500 or so different types of insanity are just different symptoms of the same cause there is only one insanity and from it springs different manifestations psychiatry erred in calling these different types and trying to invent different treatments definition insanity can now be precisely defined the definition is insanity is the overt or covert but always complex and continuous determination to harm or destroy possibly the only frightening thing about it is the cleverness with which it can be hidden whereas sane person can become angry or upset and bit destructive for short periods he or she recovers the insane mask it are misemotional continuously and do not recover except by modern processing the nature of man man is basically good this is obvious for when he begins to do evil he seeks to destroy his memory in order to change and seeks to destroy his body he seeks to check his evil impulses by inhibiting his own skill and strength he can act in very evil fashion but his basic nature then makes it mandatory that he lessens himself in many ways the towering strength of madman is rarity and is compensated by efforts at selfdestruction mans mortality his one life fixation all stem from his efforts to check himself obliterate his memory in fruitless effort to change his conduct and his selfdestructive habits and impulses and losses of skills and abilities as this rationale proves out completely in processing and fits all cases observed we have for the first time proof of his actual nature as only around 20 are insane and as those who previously worked in the mental field were themselves mainly insane man as whole has been assigned an evil repute govemments where such personalities exist listen to the opinion of the insane and apply the characteristic of 20 to the entire hundred percent this gives an 80 wrong diagnosis which is why mental science itself was destructive when used by states 73techniques the only technique available at this writing which will benefit the insane is contained in all the overtmotivator sequences and grade ii technology at flag at this writing new improvement on this exists but it is so powerful that slight errors in use can cause psychotic break in the insane it therefore will only be exported for use by specially trained persons and this programming will require quite while meanwhile it helps the cs to know and use these firm rules always run dianetic triples never run singles the overt side flow 2 is vital if you only run flow 1 motivators the pc will not recover fully further running flow 1 motivator only any psychotic being processed will not recover but may even trigger into psychotic break if one never ran anything but motivators psychotic manifestations would not erase depend on expanded grade ii technology to ease off or handle the insane dont keep asking whats been done to him as hell trigger new discovery on this is that when you run out the motivator the person gets higher reality on his overts if you ran out all his motivators he would have reason for his overts if these are not then run out he might cave himself in pattern of behavior the apparent pattern of insane behavior is to come in ask for processing go on staff etc with the advertised intention of being helped or helping then mess up either as pc or on post then state how bad it all is and leave it looks obvious enough he came found it bad left that is only the apparent behavior apparent reasons based on numerous cases this is the real cycle hearing of something good that might help these hateful awful rotten nasty people the psycho comes in wrecks this upsets that caves in this one chops up that one and when somebody says the psychotic either caves himself in physically or b runs away the psychotic is motivated by intent to harm if he realizes he is harming things he shouldnt he caves himself in if he is afraid he will be found out he runs in the psychotic the impulse is quite conscious conclusion none of this is very nice it is hard to confront even i find it so freud thought all men had hidden monster in them for he dealt mainly with the psychotic and their behavior was what he saw all men are not like this the percentage that are is greater than i supposed but is long way from all men 74sometimes one only becomes aware of these when things are getting worked on and improved they stay on as long as it can be made bad or there is hope it can be destroyed then when attention is given to improvement they blow artists writers often have these types hanging around them as there is someone or something there to be destroyed when success or failure to destroy or possible detection appears on the scene they blow often as destructively as possible orgs are subjected to lot of this psychotic sometimes succeeds in blowing off good staff and then sooner or later realizes how evil he is acting and sickens or leaves the society is not geared to any of this at all the insane walk around wrecking the place and decent people think its human nature or inevitable or bad childhood as of this writing the insane can be handled the proof of any pudding is the processing and this is successful it is also rather swift but as i say it is so swift the special technique has to be done by the specially trained flubless auditor for long while ive realized that we would have to be able to handle insane people as the psychiatrist is fading i have had opportunity to work on the problem and have it handled until it is fully released the cs will benefit greatly from knowing the above as these come on his lines far more often than he has suspected the insane can be helped they are not hopeless i trust this data will be of use l ron hubbard founder lrh rrrd copyright 1970 by l ron

scientology actions that brings about exteriorization when the pc goes or is found to be exterior one then orders the interiorization rundown otherwise the ta will misbehave the rundown is remedy used after exteriorization has occurred by reason of general auditing anxiety to get exterior will prompt pc to buy and registrar to sell an interiorization rundown it is in effect just more auditing as far as the registrar is concerned when pc has gone exterior the registrar can insist on his buying enough hours for the remedy the int rundown stabilizes the exteriorization and makes it possible to audit the pc further disability if an auditor cant smoothly audit rundown as simple as an int rundown then he is exposed as being unable to run standard dianetics and should be cleared of his misunderstoods and overts and retrained the only real trouble one gets into on an int rundown stems from the inability of the auditor to run smooth good tred r3r session pcs are not hard to run on it cs wins cs cannot win at all if he is continually having to make up for flubby auditing by the auditor therefore the cs must be very sure his auditors are fully checked out on things they are to run before running them if there is qual staff training officer or cramming cs can fully afford to do the training and cramming himself otherwise he will lose far more than that time in csing for auditors not checked out by the skill of his auditors you know the cs not by his unusual solutions after flubs the int rundown is too easy to do to have any troublethe trouble comes when the auditors are not

observation i have recently done while handling cs line has resulted in necessary clarification of the subject of reading item or question which improves older definitions and saves some cases it can occasionally happen that an auditor misses read on an item or question and does not run it as it has not read this can hang up pc badly if the item was in fact reading item or question it does not get handled and exists in records as read when in fact it did read therefore all dianetic auditors whose items occasionally dont read and all scientology auditors who get list questions that dont read must be checked out on this hco b in qual or by the cs or supervisor these errors come under the heading of gross auditing errors as they affect metering 1 an item or question is said to read when the needle falls not when it stops or slows on rise tick is always noted and in some cases becomes wide read 2 the read is taken when the pc first says it or when the question is cleared this is the valid time of read it is duly marked plus any blow down this reading defines what is reading item or question calling it back to see if it read is not valid test as the surface charge may be gone but the item or question will still run or list 3 regardless of any earlier statements or material on reading items an item does not have to read when the auditor calls it to be valid item for running engrams or listing the test is did it read when the pc first said it on originating it or in clearing it 4 that an item or question is marked as having read is sufficient reason to run it or use it or list it pc interest in dianetics is also necessary to run it but that it did not read again is reason to not use it 5 when listing items the auditor must have an eye on the meter not necessarily the pc and must note on the list he is making the extent of read and any bd and how much this is enough to make it reading item or reading question 6 in clearing listing question the auditor watches the meter not necessarily the pc and notes any read while clearing the question 7 an additional calling of the item or question to see if it read is unnecessary and not valid action if the item or question read on origination or clearing 8 that an item is marked as having read on an earlier dianetic list is enough also checking interest to run it with further read test 9 to miss seeing read on an origin or clearing is gross auditing error 7910 failing to mark on the list or worksheet the read and any bd seen during pc origination or clearing the question is gross auditing error eyesight auditors who miss reads or have poor eyesight should be tested and should wear the proper glasses while auditing glasses the rims of some glasses could obstruct seeing the meter while the auditor is looking at the worksheet or pc if this is the case the glasses should be changed to another type with broader vision wide vision good auditor is expected to see his meter pc and worksheet all at one time matter what he is doing he should always notice any meter movement if the meter needle moves if he cannot do this he should use an azimuth meter and not put paper over its glass but should do his worksheet looking through the glass at his pen and the paper the original design purpose of the azimuth meter then even while writing he sees the meter needle move as it is in his line of vision confusions any and all confusions as to what is reading item or reading question should be fully cleaned up on any auditor as such omissions or confusions can be responsible for case hangups and needless repairs read any comment that an item or question did not read should be at once suspected by cs and checked with this hco b on the auditor actually nonreads nonreading item or question means one that did not read when originated or cleared and also did not read when called one can still call an item or question to get read that it now reads is fine but if it has never read at all the item will not run and such list will produce item on it it is not forbidden to call an item or question to test it for read but it is useless action if the item or question read on origination by the pc or clearing it with him important the data in this hco b if not known can cost case failures thus it must be checked out on auditors l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1971 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved

in for hgcs in the new cs line the auditor in his admin time at the end of the day or when he has preclears does folder error summaries or progress and advance programs for his pcs and does the cs form for the tech cs as well as adds the days process and the length of the session and amount of admin time on that folder to the inside front cover of the folder with the process run and result if his programs and cses are acceptable to the tech cs the auditor gets full well done auditing hour credit on his stat the auditor logs his sessions for the day in the general hgc auditors log and his admin time is also logged this admin time is subtracted from the bought hours of the pc where auditing is sold by the hour where auditors are so engaged and the new folder routing line is in use this cs form is used full blank page pcs name red date auditors name red class of auditor required next sess session grade left blank auditors comment red or think about the case if he wishes the next cs 1 blue 2 blue 3 blue 4 blue auditor signature red the auditor does not grade his own session he leaves this blank the correctly admined folder is then given to tech services which routes it usually with the auditors other folders for the day to the cs the cs looks it over it is his final responsibility for the case being run right the cs looks to see if the examiner form taken by the examiner at session end fned if it did not he leaves the grade line blank as it is grade session see fn 81and well done hours as the auditor gets hour credit for the session if the cs and other admin is ok he writes ok with his initial in the session grade space if none of it is okay he leaves it blank and does the cs form or programs completely new in this last case he enters subtract figure in his log for the auditing time for the week against that auditors name if the exam form fned but the admin is not okay and the session actions were not okay the cs writes well done by exam on his own new cs in its proper place and ignores the form and subtracts the admin time in his book to subtract the admin from the auditors weeks stat if the session was not okay with fn at exams yet the admin and next cs are ok the auditor loses the session time in the cs but gets the admin time credited to his weeks stat the cs subtracts the session time in his book not the admin time of course as we hope is usually the case if the auditor did the cs did correct session got an fn at exam and did the admin and next cs is correct then the cs marks very well done in the blank space for session grade with his initial after inspection this would be the sole action of the cs regarding that folder by the cs writing in the session grade very well done well done okay flunk to cramming the auditor is receiving acknowledgement for his work and is not just acking himself the new line the ideal foldercs line can shift the number of well done hours from ceiling of 250300 to 600800 with one cs matter how many auditors an org has older lines put 250300 top ceiling on the orgs well done hours when hours could go above 600 due to the available auditors 20 or 30 new parallel line has to be manned by new cs new d of p and another examiner and more tech services personnel despite how hard the cs and anyone else in tech works line not so run will ceiling at about 250 hours matter how many auditors are hired cs using the old lines can cs for about 5 working auditors only with the line running any old way and even so will work himself half to death in trying to get pcs handled auditors will be added the cs will not be able to handle his job the line being faulty gets pegged at about 250 hours matter how hard the cs and admin people work with the same cs and tech services people and correct new line 24 to 30 auditors will be kept busy at their 5 hours day given auditing rooms and the stat will be able to rise to 600 to 800 new sequence 1 auditor picks up his pc folders and his pc schedule list at tech services at the start of his day from the leaving rack 2 tech services having duplicate list begins sending pcs to him using tech pages 3 the auditor gives the session 4 the auditor leaves the folder in the auditing room at session end and takes the pc to the examiner 5 the examiner simply does the exam form on meter with folder he sends the exam form hand route to tech services 826 the auditor returns at once to his auditing room and tech page has pc there waiting for him 7 having done all his pcs for the day the auditor carries his folders to the auditor admin room 8 tech services has placed the exam forms in the auditor admin room and sees they get into the auditors basket and the folder 9 the auditor does the complete admin of the session 10 the auditor does any program needed for future sessions 11 the auditor cses the folder for the next session 12 the auditor marks in box 2 columns on sheet stapled to the inside front cover the process the exam result the session time and the admin time he has just put in 13 the auditor hands his completed folders in to tech services 14 tech services gets the folders to the cs using folder page who comes on late and works the css hours 15 fed the folders rapidly by the folder page who is standing in the cs area the cs does his cs work if the folder page is fast removing folders and putting the new one in chasing up data and other bits for the cs the time of csing even when done very carefully will be found to average 3 to 5 minutes folder even when some require full programming but not fesing this makes ceiling of about 100 folders sessions day for the cs an output of 30 auditors needless to say the cs and the auditors have to know their business and qual cramming is used extensively both for new material and for flubs both in auditing and csing by auditors 16 the folder page gets the folders over to the d of p office preserving the piles per auditor as much as possible the cs posts the data he wants auditors to know or do on the auditors board of the auditors admin room he turns in his cramming orders into the d of p basket this finishes his actions where there is senior review cs there is hot spur line from the cs to the senior cs and back to the cs this is not necessarily an instant line it can be 12 hour lag line in orgs where co or exec dir or product officer or org officer is also very skilled cs this hot line would probably be in new tech in use fantastic completions and utter dog cases nobody can make anything out of go on this senior cs hot spur line there are very few of these only two or three day in very busy org the senior cs does these and sends them back to the cs they are then sent on as usual to the d of p 17 the director of processing comes on duty very early the csed folders will all be there the d of p has assignment master sheets that are kept up by the d of p the d of p does the days schedules list for each auditor the lists preferably have few too many pcs on them the d of p can tell what class of auditor is required for the next session because the auditor has marked it in in the upper righthand corner of the cs for the next session when the d of p has the lists done the folders are placed in the leaving rack of tech services and tech services now up and about is given the lists and gets to work on the scheduling board moving the names about to agree with the lists tech services does any room shifts or handlings at this time 18 the d of p now goes to the auditor admin room and begins to muster auditors from her muster list as they come in and gets them over to tech services 8319 cramming personnel will be in there trying to get any crammings scheduled 20 tech services hands out folders which are in neat piles for each auditor and schedules to the auditors as they turn up and handles any arguments or shifts in sequence 21 tech pages are on phones or running to round up pcs and get them going to sessions which work continues all day 22 the d of p interviews any hungup or curious pcs or as requested by the cs or gets new auditors or keeps up admin this goes on until the cs comes in when the dofp is off 23 the auditor picking up his folders begins the cycle all over again at 1 above above 600 when the well done hours go above 600 week whole new hgc is put in duplicating the first with its own cs d of p ts auditing rooms and auditor admin room it would be hgc section two or hgc2 with the original being hgc1 special second cramming would have to be provided in qual for it at first they would share new hours and build up independently more hgcs are added to the department at each multiple 600 wd hours seniors the two chief seniors in the area are the cs for tech and the d of p for auditors and bodies it is the d of p who must see that auditors exist and are on post it is tech services who sees pcs are rounded up and audited the d of ts is actually in charge of pcs and all folder files and all board keepup work the d of p should have some tech training the d of ts need not have any the cs of course is the tech expert and should be an hsst if there are auditors it is the d of ps neck if there are cses it is the css neck if there are folders it is the d of tss neck and if there are auditing rooms it is the d of tss neck if signedup scheduled pcs dont get to session it is the d of tss neck if there are new pcs it is the d of ps neck who should begin to shoot dissem secs and registrars and procure new pcs on bypass for the org from this table of seniors and duties can be made cramming you will notice pcs are sent to review on this new line review actions are done in tech as patchup in tech the qual sec is responsible for overall tech quality but does it by cramming cses or auditors thus cramming is busy street cramming must be good checkouts excellent if an auditor doesnt grasp cs he has received he gets help from cramming 84auditors new to the hgc are given fast hard grooving in in cramming or qual interne course new auditors never audit until grooved in tech will be as good as the cramming officer can cram this line is grooved in by the has and kept in by qual or if there is qual it is kept in by the has who will find qual very embarrassing dummy run the line should be dummy run by folders pcs and auditors until they understand it people are often totally unaware of lines and get very sloppy thus this line has to be drilled hard on old and new tech personnel all must know this exact line it is good line fully in it raises the well done hours stat from 250 per week maximum at total overload to an easy 600 to 800 auditors must audit five hours day 25 minimum per week of well done hours for any bonus to be paid at all in the so they get pay at all much less bonuses if short on their 25 tech services and an unenergetic d of p or bad dissem sec and registrar setup can cause pc situation and often do unless pushed but counting feses and admin in on an auditors wd time helps slack periods to even out and one auditor can fes and program folders for others or from files if he is left adrift and shorttimed by the d of p or d of ts or until the tech division forces the dissem div and distribution div to really get on the ball and wear their hats on pc flow procurement the d of p has always had new pc procurement responsibility when all else failed or even when it didnt old folders for example are marvelous source of new auditing repairs and intensives an fes done on an old folder and letter to come in and get audited before you fall apart is excellent pc procurement usually neglected by registrars any procurement by d of p is legitimate auditors who have pcs can write procurement letters and have for 20 years summary this is beautiful line it has been piloted hard it will serve as well as it is checked out drilled in and used this line is the key to affluence from pcs alone but if the org isnt training auditors heavily youll soon have auditors to be on it and the org will not gain its high income low cost cushion from training this line is the answer to really getting auditing done in an area lrhntrd l ron hubbard copyright 1971 founder by l ron

comes into its own with new method of use lot of cases have been cracked lately using the gf in new way designed as the qual tool in 1965 it came into disrepute by getting assessed item by item to an fn this made it fn on rud thus the whole battery of tricks in the gf never get used on pc there is another assessment method method 5 it is once through marking the length and bd of all reads one can then cs assess gf once through actually one usually says gf 40 method 5 this means the auditor usually on case that is messy or just as routine part of progress program just ratatattat assesses the lot marks the reads length and bds the cs action that followsthe handle consists of putting red half swirl around each that read and then doing the cs for it list outness is always handled first then ruds like arc brks whs and ptps then more or less by the longest reads it makes long long cs in cases that are boggy one uses engram running on it whenever he gets chance as in drugs hidden standards are listed on whowhat would have______the symptom and ow on the item found lot of old processes get chance on these gf reads it isnt all 2way comm on_______ foreign language cases who do not have english as native tongue and people who dont understand lot have to have the gf items cleared one takes the reads while clearing the question of course designed as case cracker this new use of the

3i4 to dial wide and looks like it will persist the pc has win long cs also permits an auditor to adjust his own length of session if the cs isnt complete on that day one simply adds 1 fly rud and 2 continue cs of yesterday by having whole progress program repair laid out on red sheet and clipped with its green advance pgm grade chart inside the front cover over the session summary the guidance for the case is right there this gets checked off as done the cs could consist of half the program or even in shorter programs all of it handling one speeds line by taking repeated handlings out of it less sessions mean less handling thus the session is more economical if long getting the pc and folder rounded up 5 times when it means the same number of hours to do it 2 times saves wear and tear this is the benefit of very long cses dianetic cses dianetic sessions often go 5 or even 8 hours one tries to do all the flows of an item in one session length of pgms when auditing the public not staff you long program in progress repair program you try to throw the whole bag of tricks at them these are not only repairs when you do progress program you throw in lot of other bits like 2way comms on bd items 87you now have hilo ta list to assess and an expanded green form advance programs all advance gradesheet programs start lower than the pc was if the pc got in trouble where he was often grade is obviously out below where he is graded let us say he is bogged grade iv well he couldnt be grade iv so the advance program green paper that you do picks him up at grade 0 or even dianetics bogged ot i the other day began to win when given long long progress program and b shoved back to grade iii on the advance program and brought on up all the way including ot i before going on to ot ii thorough cses thus you can have long cses only when you have long programs already done and pinned to the inside of the front cover pink one for progress non grade and green one for advance back up the grades dont try to save auditing time save instead repeated handlings this does not go into overrepair progress pgm contains all sorts of bits like 2wc on what do you feel you owe your family as the pc is always getting off about his family in ruds the advance of case is the amount of charge you get off it long cses ease your admin lines greatly they also give less chance of having ruds go out between sessions short sessioning has its usessmall children sick people psychos but long sessions save time in the long run and get the job done l ron hubbard founder lrhmesrd

appear incomprehensible thus it is up to cs to suspect and find these where case isnt responding normally in auditing 1 life knocking ruds out faster than they can be audited in schedule sessions closer together and give very long sessions so life hasnt chance to interfere can go as far as requiring person via the d of p to stay in hotel away from the area of enturbulation or not associate

ext the next day 2 pc physically ill before next session and auditing of major action being done on sick pc who should have another cs entirely happens when delayed or late new exam reports dont get

illness may show up as case gain answer is to get full medical exam 3 selfauditing detected by lasting gain hilo ta assessment will show it up two way comm on when they began to self audit usually auditor scarcity or some introverting shock 4 coffee shop auditing meterless fool around often by students stirring up cases forbid it in an area 5 touch and contact assists interrupting general

in the middle of general auditing program require that cs okay is required get such done at the start of courses and before major auditing cycle is begun enforce this hard as the other answer that will be taken will be to do it at the end of the cycle and wreck major auditing program results 7 illegal patchups sometimes all through an intensive there is another auditor unknown to the cs who 2 wcs the pc or audits the pc who is complaining to him or her shows up in the hilo ta assessment forbid it 8 people talking about their cases past life reality is often badly hurt by people who talk about being napoleon caesar and god this makes past lives an unreal subject by bad comparison restimulative material is sometimes used to push someones buttons bullbait that uses actual processes or implants should be stamped out hard 9 advanced course material insecurity i have seen several cases wrecked by careless storage of ad course materials where lower levels could get at them one notable case was suppressive who got hold of ad course materials and chanted them at his wife to drive her insane she recovered eventually he didnt when cs gets whiff of upper level materials on lower level

the cs series normally cs handles his post on the fantastic new hgc line hco b 5 mar 71 cs series 25 on fast flow basis but he is looking for dog casespcs not running well b auditor errors c auditor program errors d auditor cs errors those that are fning vgis at examiner he lets go through fast verifying the exam report and the next cs the moment he sees contrary exam report fn with natter or bis high ta or low ta with any statement or statement he has to decide dog case b auditor error c program error d auditor cs error in any of the above the org cs takes over and handles what he finds he must also require cramming action on any b auditor error c program error or d auditor cs error the org cs then does it right himself in any event it is the org cs who is fully responsible for all the cases that the org cs finds program or cs wrong does not then cause the auditor asacs to cease to cs quite the contrary even if every program or cs he writes is wrong and has to be rewritten he still takes all the actions of the auditorasacs 96dog cases category is the case who just isnt running well the wrong answer to dog case is to go on auditing and wasting hours hopefully the right answer is to study the case carefully the folder error summary the folder session summary the sessions all have to be studied the standard cs action of going back to when the pc was running well and coming forward for the error is very much in use such case is the result of flub always example high ta case on power run on and on with ta in the sky careful fes and study of folders revealed that 2 years before power had been completed every current action was brutal overrun yet the same cs and ten separate auditors failed to see it indicating it and 2wc on the earlier power handled the or example case rd not running well at all ta going high careful study of the folder session summary at length discovered that the pc had not fned on 2 way comm intext 2wc on this point discovered total mess of command clearing on the int rd this opened the door pc thereafter ran beautifully example pc total nattery mess every session careful study found tiny remark on the white form about going to psychiatrist 2wc on it and the antagonism toward auditing and the withhold of having once gone crazy vanished case ran well careful study is the clue the auditor as cs may not put in the time needed to really sort the case out current fes of recent auditing can also be ordered this often reveals lot of oddball goofs which when handled make the case run well the org cs is supposed to be the old master on solving these dog cases by careful study heavy laurels to the auditorasacs who spots the knot that is tangling the case up auditor errors the errors of auditors can be so various one only looks to see if the actions of the auditor are standard when the org cs has to intervene then the outnesses show up example pcs ta shooting up at session end examine the previous cs calls for l1b

pattern of bank why earlier and how to fly ruds always find and handle auditor goofs by cramming youll never have an hgc unless you do program errors when an auditorasacs program is poor the org cs redoes it sends the auditor to cramming on the relevant parts of the cs series or tech materials 97cs errors when an auditorasacs is found to have written bad cs that got by but didnt work or when the next cs is wrong the org cs sends the auditorasacs to cramming to do the relevant part of the cs series or the tech that applies cramming an org that has sharp hot cramming section in the qual divwell god help it that orgs tech will always be shaky if not outright criminal students need cramming or they never really learn not to goof where theres insistence they do not learn hgc auditors need cramming they go stale new hco bs arent understood unless energetically checked out the cs in the tech div is at total risk where he is not backed up by cramming the new hco b 5 mar 71 cs series 25 the new line demands cramming as auditor is likely to learn to cs you cant risk fast flow with cramming to fall back on and an orgs tech will never improve unless it has cramming for hgc auditors and course students qual has to have library of hco bs and course packs and books to really stay on the ball then its cramming is hot on the point specializing mainly in finding what the auditor has neglected or misunderstood and getting it done cramming and use of it is the key to fully satisfied field and an expanding org the big plus points of the new hgc line are huge increases in delivery volume very cocky neverblow auditors who get wins an enthusiastic field and last but not least newly trained and competent cses who guard tech by knowing correct cs the new line increases speed at the same time it requires greater technical safeguards the new hgc line wont work unless you have competent qual cramming and an org cs who knows his business and detects and pitchforks all flubs in auditing and csing into the fast hands of hot nononsense cramming officer the new line of hco b 5 mar 71 is great success it greatly increases delivery quality as well as volume if this hco b is

get programming quality up to do it in any other sequence is to organize before producing or to inhibit production auditing quality is raised by getting in cramming and getting cramming done cs quality is raised by cs study of cases and the qual sec cramming the cs programming quality is raised by getting feses done so that the action does not block production and cramming or programming and then studying the case to make the programming more real and effective misprogramming 1 programming case without data is risky dropping out the fes step not getting white forms done etc shortcutting on data in general can cost tremendous amounts of lost auditing 2 doing vague general hopeful program of repair progress trusting something will come up is ineffective with data on the persons life even on pc never before audited one can hit the key points even if only with 2way comm on them cases that have been audited and are boggy are so for reason programming without finding that reason can be very ineffective and result in few wins 3 running new major program into an incomplete major program can be as deadly as failing to flatten process before starting another process only more so 4 failing to end off program when its end phenomena is achieved is another gross error 5 being too ignorant of the basic bank and the tech theory as different than processes is another barrier to

occurs getting in all flows when doing additional flows on earlier items or processes one must also check or rehab those flows marked as run to fn in worksheets this again will leave unflat flows and

whole case anew and find the bug or bugs that keep it from running and get them handled recently i took over whole series of these non fn vgi at examiner cases and very very carefully studied each one in every examiner non fn case i found flagrant out tech in the programming b the csing and c the auditing all three outnesses existed these cases were taken as all the non fn exam reports on line containing hundreds of folders and over 600 wd hours week so you can see that these errors had been missed by expert cses and auditors the errors were missed because hope was being used instead of study there was hope that just routine cses and auditing would work it out eventually the fact of non fn at examiner was not given sufficient importance the fact is that many who fned at the examiner had small flaws in them yet still got by the exam non fn indicates flagrant out tech in the programming and the csing and the auditing thats what it takes after bug is found and corrected the case still may not fn at the examiner for while but after that while is passed the failure to give the examiner an fn means another bug and more study one case i found had had major grade done twice two years apart this was pointed out and rehabbed but after 2 or 3 sessions the ta remained high restudy now found recall flow 2 of the exteriorization rundown had been run months ago to fin and then continued for dozens of commands with the ta rising to 45 this was then repaired the case then began to fn at the examiner it now runs like an ordinary case there is always bug not necessarily current often very old in these exam non fn cases there are sometimes two or three bugs the answer is not go on csing and hope the answer is study and find the bug cases run on triples after long list of singles is type of bug cases exteriorizing and then getting ext rd is another bug 112cases given false reads or already run whs cases who dont tell their cogs cases who were on drugs but drugs were never run cases that rockslammed but crime found any of the gf 40 or gf reading items cases with lists out cases that are always sad or tired well these types of cases are the usual bugged cases but even they sometimes fn if only to roller coaster the general rule of going back to where the case was running well and coming forward still holds but an audit past exteriorization can be before that and only eventually catch up general repair is harmful when big bug exists every case i examined had big bug flagrant godawful overruns messed up exteriorization rundown three major programs begun each incomplete engram after engram botched and run to high ta then walked off from the errors were real they had been sitting there for some time unnoticed session after session mounting up into piles of wasted auditing sick pcs are another indicator pc fns at exam then reports sick look behind it you find some wild program cs and auditing error so the answer is to study the case get total fes done if one has never been done get current fes done or do it yourself then examine the programs and the feses and folder summaries and suddenly youll find it fortunately there arent many things that can really foul case up 1 overruns concealed within work sheets major grades twice 2 auditing past exterior or flubbed ext rds 3 earlier unrun flows restimulated by later runs on those flows 4 gf 40 items 5 never handled out lists 6 undetected drugs or drugs never handled by dianetics 7 false reads called as in whs that wont blow 8 hidden standards 9 long duration arc brks 10 impractical or inapplicable programs 11 major actions started never completed 12 overrepair there can be combinations of these so there arent many its really knowing what is right so well that the wrong shows up like skywriting sometimes the errors are silly bogged dianetic case had gotten tons of vi repair 113the cs an viii had never realized dianetic csing is its own brand of csing he didnt shift gears to dianetic csing when csing dianetics sessions the auditor way back had not known that when the pc originates its erased and the ta remains high his correct action is one more b c d this cs had then tried class vi remedies instead of telling the auditor flatten or rehab the last chain when the chains left unflat were rehabbed all was suddenly well another case was interrupted for year on major action and when returned to auditing was begun on long long repair program inches of folder later the interrupted program was found and resumed and the case did great all that hopeful repair was lost

in this type style interiorization errors references hco b 11 apr 71 ra l3rd hco b 27 mar 71 dianetic erasure almost all the errors in an interiorization rundown are dianetic errors most are very ordinary even corny it is vital to correct an int rd error as first action there is one int rd error that is not purely dianetic error and that is the error doing anything else at all before an int rd is done properly or an int rd error is fully corrected the int rd error may be simply that went in and go in did not read on the meter yet int was run this classifies as running an unreading item or the int rd could have been overrun it goes flat on secondary f2 let us say the auditor keeps on going past the win this will hang up the rundown one of the ways an overrun occurs is the pc goes exterior during it yet the auditor keeps on another way is pc has big cog big win auditor keeps going on with the rd when pc is exteriorized by auditing and is then audited further without being given an interiorization rundown his ta will go high or low and he may be very upset heavy masses may come in and he may also get ill int rd errors also may go back to earlier dianetic errors number of unflat incidents invite the overrun of these if they also occur on dianetic chain to clean up balledup int rd chain or incident one may have to find and clean up the dianetic error it is sitting on during the cleanup of the int rd error int rd errors goofs etc are handled by using an int rd correction list revised hco b 29 oct 71r auditors who cant run ordinary r3r with great success should not be let near an interiorization rd as their lack of smoothness in handling dianetics will wreck the int rd class iv hdc auditors an excellent class iv hdc auditor can easily repair messedup interiorization rundown after folder study and by use of an int rd correction list revised hco b 29 oct 71r class iv hdc auditor with an excellent dianetic record of wins can be given an int rd to do or to correct if he is starrated on the int pack and the twoway comm pack 115repair wherever you see ta high and pc in trouble your first suspicions should be 1 audited past ext in auditing without an int rd being done 2 int rd botched by being unnecessary went in didnt read or overrun or auditor goofs in the session 3 previously messedup dianetic action has gotten fouled up with the int rd 4 the int command was improperly cleared such as means go in and out again means trapped meant leaving etc 5 firefights and worries over the high or low ta have ensued after an int ballup has occurred 6 some major action like grades or items of power have been run twice 7 cs has hopefully kept on getting the pc audited without detecting the real reason as flubbed int rd percentages the percent of misrun int rds is high many being unnecessary or overrun the liability of leaving them unrepaired is high reasons for high ta are averaging out close to 100 as an unrun or flubbed and unrepaired int rd ext in session when pc exteriorizes in session it is the end phenomena for that process or action one gently ends off in any case then if after the fact of going exterior in auditing pcs ta goes high then you do the int rd you test int for read test went in and go in per hco b 24 sept 71 interiorization rundown and if it reads you do an int rd you just dont do one because pc goes exterior maybe it wasnt needed so if it wasnt needed it will eventually have to be repaired if even years after an int rd the pc has high ta or low ta then int trouble is at once suspected and the original int rd and any repair of it is suspect and must be handled the int rd correction list revised hco b 29 oct 71r has been designed to straighten out int rds l3rd handles the dianetic errors where int rd correction lists have been done and the pc still has headaches the cs handles with aesps listed separately that would make him interiorize there is real trick to either running correct int rd or repairing flubbed one the whole clue is whether or not the auditor can audit plain ordinary garden variety r3r so when any auditor audits pc past exterior and the pcs ta goes high he should be checked out fully on the int rd checksheet so he wont continue to commit the error 116and when anyone is going to run an int rd he must be an expert dianetic auditor and class iv b be starrated on all the int rd pack and when any cs is confronted with high tas or low tas and doesnt handle at once by getting an int rd properly run or properly repaired he must be rechecked on the dianetics pack and the int rd pack dn cs 1 very careful dianetic cs 1 must be done on previously unindoctrinated pc before he is run on an int rd otherwise its all too new cs 1 isnt auditing the pc who cant do what the auditor says or cant correct an erroneous action is lost fully safe pc would be one who when he goes ext in auditing is made to do an hdc at once before he even gets any ruds put in and not audited again until he is an hdc hed be pc who was relatively safe pc who does what an inexpert auditor says without question can really get fouled up uneducated pcs require really flawless topnotch auditors the auditor who can audit an uneducated pc is jewel he really has to know his business because the pc does whatever he says and if he says wrongly then there goes the session ever notice pc corrections in worksheet i think you bypassed an fn this feels overrun i had grade i last year such auditors are not fully enough trained to handle wholly green pcs simplicity honest fellows its as easy to run an int rd as it is to run an ear pain it isnt even mysterious or tough it is only very important to detect when it needs to be done or repaired there are mysteries some auditors have got feeling like im

you often find that the same or similar have been run in the past sometimes you find that previous attempt to run the item second or third time has resulted in an arc break the reason for which was never detected 119the right action is to note the session date it was first run and just tell the pc feeling surprised was run three times on first date it was erased it was erased when later run it was an overrun this tends to blow the later charge laid in by trying to run the same item again it sounds so strange that erased chains can be overrun but it is true what happens is that pcs try to cooperate and put something there firefights the action of quarrel between an auditor and pc is called firefight restimulating earlier unrun engrams or overrunning chains upsets pc the best action as soon as pc is disturbed is to do an l3rd fast and handle what reads the way it should be handled according to the l3rd the wrong way is to argue or try to go on the pc does not know what it is he just

are not for use they are replaced by this hcob cs series 37r must be checked out rate and in clay before use high and low ta breakthrough high and low tas have been longtime puzzle and stumbling block to auditors the usual definition of overrun is gone on too long or happened too often this causes high tas to occur in examining few failures on using overrun i have found that underlying this there is more basic principle when thetan believes something is overrun or has gone on too long or was done too often he is expressing only symptom of another mechanism the truth is thetan can do anything forever to audit overruns is auditing toward an untruth thus if carried on as process it is really an out of arc process that which makes thetan believe something can be overrun is the effort to stop or the effort to stop him the effort to stop something when generalized becomes stop everything and is the entrance point of insanity this has been known since 1967 but i did not earlier connect it with the overrun phenomenon when thetan has long chain of efforts to stop or chain of efforts to stop him mixed up with protest of course and shame blame and regret and other human emotion and reaction he accumulates ridges these make mass this mass makes the high ta in truth it is not possible to kill thetan so therefore any effort to stop thetan would only have partial success so the chain is also full of incompletes an incomplete cycle of action causes arc breaks thus an overrun is full of mass and arc breaks as you possibly recall from the material of about 1955 the one process you must not run on pc is look out of here and find something you can go out of arc with this sends him into dwindling spiral 127the common denominators of bank are out of arc and stop thus if too long list of what has been overrun is required to obtain the first bd fn item the listing action may very well restimulate much more bank than can easily be handled on some pcs as these are also the pcs with very high ta if one lists for overrun and runs much too long list to get his first bd fn item the pc can be heavily restimulated listing errors or upsets can make this then too uncomfortable proceeding for pc and should not now be done and if it doesnt work on some pcs in the hands of some auditors it must therefore be cancelled any recommendation on viii course to do it is cancelled the theory is correct as given on the viii course there few items were intended but now some very long lists have come up on some pcs which made the pc uncomfortable and were hard for the auditor to handle thus the bd fn item overrun list must not be done continue is then the reverse action to overrun continue equals survival the reverse to overrun therefore can be run as process to wit what would you be permitted to continue or what could be continued this however would not be very successful thus the listing action is recommended as the process to use lists seven lists can be done on overrun itself by using the inarc approach assessa self to another b another to self c others to others d others to self self to self f another to others g others to another ordinarily the biggest read or any read has located flow that will run and will be most real to the pc but this is not true in handling overruns the most stopped or rising read is where hes really hung to get ta down list the most stopped read or the rise of the read or the item that raised the ta when called this is only true of overruns the list questions for the above are if stopped what could you continue to do to another if b stopped what could another continue to do to you if c stopped what could others continue to do to others if d stopped what could others continue to do to you 128if stopped what could you continue to do to yourself if f stopped list what could another continue to do to others if g stopped list what could others continue to do to another the most stopped read would be one that really froze the needle or caused it to rise or caused the ta to rise such as 35 to 36 the lists would be listed to bd fn item cog vgis actually the list could be listed forever but the pc will get an item he likes and that fns he is then given his item one does not null such lists unless one has really goofed all the lists b c d f and g can be listed to get ta down you list the flow that sends the ta up then reassess for the next that sends the ta up etc low ta the same exact thing causes low tas the flow could be said to have overwhelmed the pc exactly how you read the list for low ta will be given in another hcob after further tests are made in theory it would go lower on assessment please note that out trs on the part of auditors is the most frequent cause of low tas tr 1 that drives the pc out through the back of his head can cause low below 20 ta on lot of pcs end phenomena the end phenomena the ep of ta handling rundown would be all lists assessed or listed to fn and the pcs needle doing persistent continual fn for days this means an fn wide that nothing can kill dept 10 the department of special cases should have auditors who can do this rundown by the book and with perfect results it is really dept 10 technique flows note there are about seven flow directions that can be used or listed 1 self to another 2 another to self 3 others to others 4 self to others 5 others to self 6 another to others 7 others to another flow is an electronic flow in direction in phoenix arizona in 1952 an oscilloscope has face like radar shows wave patterns and directions was once hooked up to an emeter movement and showed that mental flow will flow just so long in one direction by reversing the repetitive commands when the leftright directional flow slowed the flow turned around and flowed rightleft then slowed etc so actual electrical flow occurs in response to the directional command like self to another also it jams up when run too long on an average human because his mind has overruns in it already ridges and masses come about from conflict of flows opposing or being pulled back as in withholds high tas are caused by two or more flows opposing thus making mass or ridge low tas are caused by overwhelm by flows 129the thetan thinks of them as overruns and so quits on subject or wishes he could this is why the ta behaves as it does on life and certain subjects there is real reason why flow cant go on forever in one direction unless thetan tries to stop it then it ridges and makes mass which then reads on ta auditor qualifications an auditor must be master at listing and nulling in order to touch such actions as these lists to foul up on listing on an already fouledup pc is quite outtech an auditors trs should have been passed the hard way his metering must be excellent and flawless his command and use of the auditors code must be complete he should himself have had case gain he must have full checkout on this hco b and be able to do it in clay and as i say he must know the subject of listing and nulling so well he can always list smoothly to bd fn item with never quiver interiorization rundown this hco b does not change the interiorization rundown in theory or in practice it does however give this procedure 1 on high or low ta pc check for exteriorization in auditing 2 if pc has gone ext in auditing make sure he has not had an extint rd earlier before giving him another 3 if an earlier int rd exists repair complete or rehab it often an int rd is itself overrun an l3b on it will show what is wrong with the earlier one some poor high ta pcs have had 2 or 3 extint rds all run past the ep some extint rds went totally flat on the secondaries or on the recalls all else was overrun 4 if earlier extint rd was done then do one 5 if the check of

and list until the entire list widely fns there can be more than seven lists taken from the seven flows one finds rise or blow up item does list on it then reassesses all seven flows finds the next most rising item lists then and assesses all seven flows and finds the next most stopped or rising item and lists that one just keeps this up eventually on assessing the seven flows you can only get stopped needle then slowed or killed fn one uses these for lists sometimes toward the last they blow on indication and cog the end of it all is the auditor assessing the seven flows without being able to disturb wide wide persistent fn that is the ep of the 37r process there is other ep if not done to that ep the 37r process is incomplete clearing flows the idea of flows should be cleared with the pc before assessment is done one can do this by getting the pc to draw them dont confuse the pc with this clearing and make sure he is not confused before assessing the seven flows repeated assmt one can take sheet of paper lengthwise and write the seven flows along the left edge with lines to the right by putting in dividing vertical lines one then has 10 or 12 assessments laid out ready to do low ta unless one does thorough job to the 37r end phenomena on low ta case the ta will continue to go low in future sessions low ta takes more times through the assessments and listing than high ta cramming auditors who cant do this well must be fully crammed on reading needle and ta on stops rises and blow ups the result if properly done is invariably good lrhntrd l ron hubbard copyright 1971

communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 26 june 1971 remimeo cs series 37r addition 3 37r is very beefy process it has been combined into l9s hco b 17 june 71 and is best done as part of this full rundown 37r works on anyone regardless of ta or state of case neither it nor l9s are used only on bad off cases they work on both the worst and the best in doing 37r the items are sometimes very heavy and it takes the pc bit to accept them therefore when one gets bd fn item one asks is_____your item if he says yes indicate it to him by saying _____is your item the meter should give fall and the fn will widen if the pc says it is not his item ask the question again and continue to list the pc will put the item back on the list usually for it was his item but he has to list further to realize it he can also fail to put it back on the list and if so and he is getting restless in listing give him the bd fn item again and hell buy it very big item that alters the pcs whole concept of things with big cogs and 2 wc is good place to stop session 37r doesnt all have to be done in one session when you begin new list before the last item is discharged the pc can get bit overwhelmed this is nice point not vital one also the big item will often cause the next assessment to be bit hard as the pcs attention remains tied up in it for while if after 37r the pcs ta later goes up or down again out of normal 20 to 30 range the action to do is an l4b in general on 37r it usually picks up the cognitions and confirms rather than corrects l4b reads on wrong item auditor says which one pc gives it quite usually its right item pc hasnt cogged on after the l4b one can again run 37r however better action is to fly all ruds continue with l9s ruds when ruds are out during 37r pc can feel strange of course with high or low ta you cant get the ruds in so you can do list of 37r and as this will fn the meter you can get in all ruds flows the pc may have idea of flows so before assessing the first time one must clear flows the pc must understand that these words self to another mean flow from himself to any another etc if while clearing the word flow and flows you watch your meter also you will get your first blow up of the ta 133assess slowly by reading flow and waiting moment you give the ta time to rise you can assess too rapidly and find that the ta has gone up but which of the last items did it go up on by proceeding little more slowly you will be sure additional flow there is another flow h another to another this should be added to your assessment sheet assessment form an assessment form can be printed the flows to h adding the new one above are put in on the lefthand edge of the paper held the long way they can be repeated ah and ah lines and boxes lead out for repeated assessments this makes it easier for the auditor steps 37r 1 clear the word flow 2 clear the idea of flow watch meter for each flow to h so you have misunderstoods 3 assess the listing sheet take the biggest blow up or speeded rise if big blow up 4 mark it on the assmt form and ws 5 fit it into the q on separate listing sheet what could _____continue to do to_____ 6 ask the question of the pc 7 get the pc to give you items 8 write the items down while watching the meter mark needle reads or bds put down ta reads regularly on the list 9 get the first item that blows down or up and fns 10 ask pc if_____is his item 11 if pc says yes say _____is your item circle it on listing sheet and mark the fn and ind for indicated to pc if pc says continue to list pc will put item back on the list at which time do 10 and 11 above pc will accept it if he goes on and begins to protest give him the first bd fn item and do 11 and 12 he will accept it 12 mark item and ta and any 2 wc on the item or cogs on the ws donts dont do this process without checking out on cs series 37r with additions 1 2 and this one 3 134b do i hrs confront and i

auditing in an ao or sh this reads while working on trs and until they are passed do not accept auditing or do solo the reason for these rules lies in the major cs rules do not begin new programs to end old do not start new action before completing the existing one and the auditor rule obtain an fn before starting the next cs action if unable to do so never begin the next cs action but end session and return the folder to the cs the surest way in the world to bog case is to 1 begin new process without obtaining an fn on the one just run 2 begin major action without completing the old one 1363 begin major action without setting up case with ruds and fns 4 begin new program without completing the old one 5 start several programs without finishing any 6 enter new major action into case already in progress on another incomplete major action i have seen case on as many as five major actions with none complete and when i see this the first thing i take up is the first unflat incomplete program and get it finished then the next then the next the case comes out all smooth example case is on but not complete on dianetic auditing switched to grades incomplete on grades gets prog pgm incomplete on prog pgm shifted to power the only apparent exception is repair case can be repaired if bogged providing the original action is rehabbed if or or completed to ep progress pgm may reach ep before the written up program is completed thus process completion is defined as the end phenomena of the process program is complete when the end phenomena of the program is attained trs any course or program containing trs 04 69 or admin trs is major program in itself it produces case gainif run rightand has an end phenomenon further by actual experience when person is on real not pattycake and weak tr course and is also being audited at the same time the cs and auditor if they dont know the person is also on trs can be utterly baffled and worried as the case does not run right what did i do what cs was wrong look his ta is high now its low last session he____ and the cs and auditor engage in efforts to handle the odd case behavior but the person unknown to them was also on real tr course and his case was changing interjected pgms you can also run into this same oddity with mystic who does bathe the body in light every night or wife whose husband audits her between hgc sessions or self auditor the principle is the same the cs and auditor are going down wellbeing street and hidden trucks keep dashing out of alleys and running into the pc life the reason auditing should be done in intensive packages not l hour week or session month lies in the fact that life can run new action in on pc its great way to waste auditing to let pc have session once week you cant even keep his ruds in if he lives in any confusions so nothing is done for the case all the auditing goes to handle the life interjections cross programming case runs on cycles of actions this is true in the auditing comm cycle it is true in process cycle it is true in program cycle 137new things being crossed into old incomplete things make sort of arc break situation like cut comm cycle one could do everything with process or program or course that you find on an l1c it would not be very wise case gain can be created by lack of comm cycle in an auditor lack of an action cycle in processes or messing up program cycle if you dont believe it run an l1c on pc with processes and programs and courses as prefix youd be amazed further the fellow who doesnt reach the ep of course is likely never to use that material or be faulty with the subject usual study courses like admin or tech give case gain one can carry on with auditing parallel to them but still expect case to change bit by study and baffle cs once in while but real tr course produces changes up and down and up that are not possible to also audit around so they dont mix visual idea to get visual idea of this optimum start

lists always cs to correct lists first when lists are out or suspected to be out dont do arc brks first in case of out lists as an out list can make an arc break that cant be handled by arc brk but only an l4b on gf when lists show up or overlists you should handle that first action in handling the gf but also you must order an l4b method 5 and handle method 5 is the once through for assessment read auditors when auditors can get reads on things you get their trs checked to see if they can even be heard b their metering checked for meter position on auditing table can they see meter pc and write without shifting eyes and can they see pcs hands on the cans and was the meter turned on and charged and can an auditor work the tone arm smoothly with his thumb c does the auditor discount reads gotten on clearing commands they are the reads d can the auditor read out list and see the meter reads as coordinated action cramming send auditors to cramming on all flubs insist they go to cramming insist cramming calls them in and crams them and insist on carbon copy of the fact that cramming has been done all the hard work of csing comes in when auditors are flubby it takes weeks to make an auditor after he has had course and its only done by cramcramcram r factors never order an r factor that takes pc into future or past as he then wont be in session example cses r factor we are setting you up for dianetics promptly the pc is up ahead not in this session 142mixing starts there are many ways to start session dont mix them its 2 wc what do you have your attention on fly rud if fn fly all ruds 2 wc the ta down fly rud or gf 40 method 5 and handle its not mixture of frantic efforts to get ta down if the auditor cant on what the cs says the auditor ends off interiorization is undone or out there may be list errors there may be overruns but for sure its case for folder study not for an auditor csing in the chair high ta arc brks train your auditors never try to get ta down from 35 or above on arc breaks low ta quits some auditors see ta sink below 20 and then wont continue the 2 wc or process to get the ta back up the ta sank so i quit is common auditor note compare this the ta rose above 30 so i quit see doesnt make sense if ta sinks below 20and the auditors trs are goodthe same action will usually bring it up to 20 and fn come down hard on auditors who do this get their trs checked make them continue exam fns after flubs pcs whose tas are high in session or low in session and get fn at the exams put the finger on the auditor they are protesting or being overwhelmed always cs examiner ask pc what auditor did in session then you know its the auditor or the case the pc will say the auditor was okay so its case but usually when cases are puzzles theres weird things going on with trs also the auditor may be noisy or laugh hard or is boisterous and being interesting cs via the cs is handling cases on the via of an auditor 143if the auditor is perfect the cs can handle the work out of the case if the auditor is not perfect in trs metering code reports and doing the cs then the cs is solving factor unknown to him not the pcs case so be perfect cs demand perfect auditing cases fly higher levels cs who assesses pc to higher levels to solve lower ones is really asking for wreck its always the earlier actions that are out trying to cheat case up to grade 2 when he wont run on grade i is like trying to run the whole grade chart to cure cold pc can always be solved in or below where he is oh well put him up grade and cure his high ta is like he cant pass kindergarten so well enroll him in college cs expertise cs has to know his auditing materials hco bs and texts much better than an auditor if cs is not being successful get retread on vi and viii materials cs also must be confident he could crack the case as an auditor when cs is shaky on his materials then the world of auditing looks very unstable the tech is very exact very effective if any errors existed in it theyve been corrected so the variables are the knowledge of the cs his discipline and demands of auditors and the actions of the auditor if these are stable then the cases that come along are easy as can be the successful cs knows his materials if he wants to be even more successful he keeps his study up then he is steady and calm for he is totally certain l ron hubbard

rules complete cycles dont leave cycles incomplete on case if cs starts 37r and the auditor goofs correct the auditor and then get the 37r completed dont disperse and do something new if you have program going and its goofed repair the auditor and the goofed pc and continue the program you began on the case repair progress programs are ended when the pc is flying nicely when repair hits that dont rerepair on advance programs take each step to its ep dont suddenly start something new sure way to solve case is go back and find the earliest incomplete program complete it and so on up to pt keep your finger in the book on case dont lose your place thats done by having the current pgm on the inside front cover paper clipped on and checked off with each step done when its done put new pgm on top of it insist that auditors keep up the inside front cover folder summary each session with their auditing time and admin time in the box this fs is 2 column set of boxes date whats run fn or bogged and time by seeing admin is in you can keep your place in the book or study back rapidly to find whats been done double actions the deadliest faults on cases are running the same action or grade twice this drives tas up through the roof example power done in 65 done again in 69 example grade iv done in 69 done in 70 you find the case isnt doing well or find the error in doubles rehab by date of the first time it was done ive seen interiorization done three times on one pc power twice and the same dianetic chains run over and over and people wondered why is the ta high so when you order major action always check to see if its ever been done before save you grief and if major action wont run suspect it may have been done before 145setups always set up case fully for the next major action dont overrepair but be sure the case is not sick has had good exam forms and does well then cs the next major action blaming the pc never blame the pc many it is true are dog cases but even dog cases can be handled when you find auditors or feel yourself blaming the pc get the overts and withholds run out once i got the most splendid sessions out of an hgc i had the auditors overts and withholds checked on each auditor before he went into session it was just research but my it worked those were the smoothest sessions pcs began to fly too many times one blames the pc only to find later that the auditors trs were ghastly and that major action had been run twice such discoveries make cs out of cs l ron hubbard founder lrhsbrd copyright 1971 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved

break into winning program harshly it gives the pc loss the pc who isnt running well is the one you repair dont keep pc going on and on running badly with case study study the case folder find the right why by going back to where the pc was running consistently well and then come forward for the error it will be in the exact next session if the pc wasnt ever audited before you go into his life of course with gf 40 method 5 and handle and other life repairs overrepair any repair or progress action has reached its end phenomena when the pc is running well again this is peculiar to the repair or progress program wrong example pc was on grade iii fell on his head cs studied case found out lists wrote an extensive repair pgm and cs half way through repair the pc again was flying cs continued the repair pc bogged cs csed the pc to flying again cs continued the repair pc bogged right example pc falls on his head on grade iii cs writes repair pgm and cs auditor finds the out list corrects it pc flies cs puts pc at once back on grade iii to complete auditor inval an auditor can be invalidated by cs by having lot of questionable tech points thrown at him the auditors data gets shaky if decision was ever madeis not in hco bs and tapesis not to hand and cant be referred to by hco b and tape then cs should not be making the point example auditor extends list three more items beyond an fn cs chops him there is such rule the pc maybe wouldnt accept the item until he listed few more result is firefight between cs and auditor simply because it isnt valid point 147hco bs and tapes are the stable data that form the agreement between the auditor and the cs if it isnt written or spoken on tape it isnt true dont wander off known tech points in csing never shake an auditors data by advancing data not on hco bs and tapes always know your data your hco bs and tapes and refer the auditor to them in cramming cramming must have library of all materials hidden data line can build up in csauditor lines or course lines or cramming lines that can unstabilize all tech and deny further results the decay of tech in areas begins with hidden data lines that are not true so use and refer to hco bs and tapes and leave all other points alone your auditors will become confident and certain and tech will improve its enough just to insist on the usual then auditors and cases will fly l ron

series 44r cs rules programming from prepared lists there are many vital prepared lists king of these is the green form the additional 40 items are the original seven resistive cases the best way to do gf 40 is method 5 once through lengths of reads and bds marked and cs to then write cs for it hilo ta is also such list also done method 5 any such prepared list can be done method 5 and the cs to then write cs but l4b lists correction l3b dianetic errors and l1c arc brks and bypassed charge are usually done method 3 auditor assesses to read gets the action done andor earlier similar to an fn not going on until his action has resulted in an fn and then going on to complete handling and fning each read he gets when the cs has list assessed method 5 he expects usually to get it back with the reads and then write the cs for it sometimes he asks for gf 40 and hilo ta both to be done method 5 now the question comes up which reads does the cs write up to be handled first and second and third etc in other words how does he arrange the cs the auditor is to do now what sequence are the items handled in these rules apply handle an out int rd first handle anything connected with lists meaning listing and nulling lists first if int isnt out like listed past right item reads the cs would get that handled first always handle list errors first and usually do an l4b additionally auditor to handle pc can get sick after listing error and you cant get auditing done when lists are out doesnt want auditing why is then handled if it read next cs to handle anything to do with rudiments arc brks ptps and whs take precedence in that order listing errors are first before arc brks because an apparent arc break after listing error can only be handled by getting the charge off the list anything that looks like withhold comes next after that one just takes the lengths or bd of reads take the biggest reads before you take the smaller ones once you have csed for lists doesnt want auditing and ruds and evident other withholds 149the only confusion that one can get into is very high ta but list errors can cause high tas next in frequency is withholds never cs to take ta down with an arc brk rud or an l1c never you can cs to talk ta down only when there are list errors or withholds reading on gf of course an interiorization rundown error is primary target but you dont have that once its handled you will get soaring ta if int is out l3b is potent tool to order for int outnesses the auditor handling as he goes method 3 so the above gives you the rules by which you cs from assessed prepared lists basicallywhen int is out auditing will drive the ta up when lists are out nothing will handle but lists and l1c wont nor will ruds when ruds are out nothing else will straighten up and you mustnt order auditors to audit with out ruds doesnt want auditing can come from bad l n list or out int or out ruds previous bad auditing can be cured by l1c on previous bad auditing the craziest out auditing i ever ran into was an auditor using reads and fns when there were none and failing to take up or flatten reads he did get so there can be variations on bad auditing and there can be to our shame false auditing reports the best cs is to find what auditor and find out what the error was bad trs on poor tr course where the pc was student false passes and invalidated wins can also cause doesnt want auditing protest is frequent reason for high ta and is cousin to doesnt want auditing and is handled by checking lists for read and doing an l4b if it reads or finding the out ruds or other bpc as in l1 c as there are so many combinations of reading items from prepared lists you have to cs according to these general principles these rules serve as steadying guide

of 19 june 1971 issue ii remimeo cs series 46 declares it is the css responsibility that pc or pre ot is sent to declare this is not an admin point im making it is technical point every so often pc is found hung up in not having declared and attested the state attained declare completes his cycle of action and is vital part of the action one never forces or feeds one to the pc i recall one org where the entire tech and income structure crashed the co and several personnel had to be removed because they were forcing clear cogs on their dianetic pcs who hadnt had them and then telling them they couldnt be audited further on scientology connie broadbent asho march 70 so this goes 2 ways the pc or pre ot who knows he made it must be sent to exams and c to attest the pc or pre ot who hasnt made it must never be sent to exams to declare and attest this gives us third pcs and pre ots who havent made it must be handled until they have made that specific declare even though it means signing up for more auditing truth is the keynote the essence the point here all the pr slang for promotional talk in the world will not supplant truth the pc knows he made something therefore he must be sent to declare it whether its standard grade or not the pc who hasnt made it knows he hasnt and so when forced to declare or ordered to attest tends to cave in his concept of the validity of the org and honesty of scientology depends on this and really on this alone the correct declare or not declare decision of the cs is vital cs action lrhnt rd l ron hubbard copyright 1971 founder by l ron hubbard

class viii dn class vi one cses or audits rundown as itself not as botch of several actions run into it so this brings to view that some can run the process or program for to b and some worse luck go from to g to q to and wonder why they dont arrive at the b of result b some go from to b all right but when at b go right on past it both actually are type of nonconfront the agqa cant confront and disperses off arriving at b the beyond b hasnt confronted b and so doesnt recognize b the ability to confront the pc and the session and parts of the session permits one to accurately go from to b proving this perception reduces in ratio to overts accept that fact as its true if you run ow on an auditor regarding the pc he is to audit the auditor will give perfect session to that pc why he can confront because he can see programming is simply an to b action the road is all laid out auditing process is simple to b action what if you had an auditor who half way through level zero with completion found picture did dianetics on it didnt flatten the r3r because pc cogged it was like his mother and the auditor did ow on mother in the middle of the engram the pc would be mess b was run away from same way with programming that isnt handled what if you had an auditor who got an fn cog vgis and continued the same process to ta 56 he got to b and kept right on going 154you should look into some folders where the cs or auditor dispersed off b or where b was reached with halt the most recent examples ive seen have been taking processes out of one rundown and using them in another rundown all in an effort to achieve maximum effect when the error that was present came from failure to complete 2 earlier programs the correct action would have been to complete the earliest program left incomplete and then complete the next incomplete program not scramble parts of two new programs to b is cycle of action clean one it is best to keep it so the supreme test of an auditor or cs is

coastersgoes up and down drugs since 1962 have been in very widespread use before then they were rare worldwide spread of drugs occurred large percentage of people became and are drug takers by drugs to mention few are meanttranquilizers opium cocaine marijuana peyote amphetamine and the psychiatrists gift to man lsd which is the worst any medical drugs are included drugs are drugs there are thousands of trade names and slang terms for these drugs alcohol is included as drug and receives the same treatment in auditing they are supposed to do wonderful things but all they really do is ruin the person even someone off drugs for years still has blank periods the abilities to concentrate or to balance are injured the moral part of it has nothing to do with auditing the facts are that people who have been on drugs can be liability until the condition is handled in auditing b former drug user is resistive case that does not make stable gains until the condition is handled c auditing is the only successful means ever developed for handling drug damage 156those on drugs on persons who are currently on drugs it is necessary to take them through special tr course while they are still on them they gradually come off of them voluntarily in most cases without painful withdrawal symptoms which is the term for the agony and convulsions caused particularly in the case of heroin takers by just stopping the drug alcoholics are of course included drug engrams people who have been on drugs are sometimes afraid of running engrams in fact it is almost way to detect druggie the drugs particularly lsd and even sometimes antibiotics or other medicines to which the person has an allergy can turn on whole track pictures violently these tend to overwhelm the person and make him feel crazy some of these people are afraid to confront the bank again the tr and other steps of the special tr course improve their confront if person doesnt like dianetics and doesnt want to be run on engrams it is necessary to put them on the special course if dianetics has been run but poorly it should of course be repaired fully with an l3b list used to correct dianetic errors but if the person still flinches the special course successfully completed will handle it contains recall steps giving the pc chance to confront the bank more easily and get used to it full auditing rundown full

auditor pains emotions sensations attitudes connected with drugs or alcohol r3r triple 5 prior assessment to drugs triple r3r dianetic auditor this can be followed by routine triple dianetics to ep for the grade done first drugs are done first they are not done after the health form and regular dianetics why because drugs make resistive case regular dianetics will get loses any current dianetic case failures are from flubby dianetic auditing or the person has been on drugs or alcohol which were not handled by dianetics it hasnt harmed anyone to omit drugs but it made it hard or impossible to get stable case gain thus any dianetic pc who has had drug handling omitted must be run on drugs as soon as possible before more auditing is given i repeat drugs or alcohol in most instances make resistive case so the point must be handled before the case will attain and hold case gain any pc who is not making it in auditing should be checked for drug or alcohol history 157discovery in investigating series of cases who were not making it i found in each one that the person had been on drugs or alcohol and that drugs or the alcohol had not been run out drug data was not covered fully enough in the dianetics pack only prior assessment to drugs was given thus i find several dianetic pcs were only run on the prior assessment to drugs this is not good enough dianetics only where dianetic auditing only is available and the rest of the rundown given above is not drugs can still be handled by dianetic auditor in this way with this dianetic pgm 1 pc assessment form 2 full cs 1

however when only dianetic auditors are available at least the above dianetic program must be done this repairs an omission in the dianetic pack and unblocks the case gain of great many pcs on whom

valence oca graph on oca graphs the plotted test score of pc you find sometimes case that read high on the graph will drop and read lower after auditing this is caused by the fact that the person was out of valence in the first place social machinery was what the first registered now after auditing the graph expresses something closer to the actual being even though it dropped we have known about this since 57 or 58 but i do not think it was fully written up further we now know more about it if you look into suppressive person tech you will find an sp has to be out of valence to be sp he does not know that he is because he is himself in nonself valence he is somebody else and is denying that he himself exists which is to say denying himself as self now this doesnt mean all persons whose graphs dropped were active sps but it does mean they werent being themselves after some auditing they became themselves somewhat and this self isnt the social cheery self the first graph said but the dropped graph is nearer truth now how to get the graph up again the person with the dropped graph is closer to being himself but is not yet fully restored not yet fully into his own valence while class xi would handle this bit differently class viii rundown already has an answer the class viii out of valence lists lx1 lx2 and lx3 and the recall secondary and engram triples for each assessed item from these lists is way to handle completing any cycle the pc is on is of course fundamental and even if the pc goes on to next grade the graph will improve the fact is that the pc is emerging more and more and becoming himself and then he himself begins to gain the graph that dives will come back up if general processing is done the pc will keep saying he is more there and it is true l ron

internes the word intern or interne means an advanced graduate or recent graduate in professional field who is getting practical experience under the supervision of an experienced worker an interneship then is serving period as an interne or an activity offered by an org by which experience can be gained interneships have been arranged this long while for every auditing class the apprenticeship of an auditor is done as an org interne cses very often have internes on their lines and sometimes have trouble with getting them to audit the why of this is that the interne seldom knows the definition of the word interne which is as above they sometimes think they are still students they do not know this fact course graduate becomes an auditor by auditing that means lots of auditing the failure of auditors is that they go from one level to the next hdc to iv to viii without ever becoming an auditor for that class thus you can get silly situation where class ix cant audit or cs well thus you get tech going out an hdc graduate who doesnt then audit under an experienced case supervisor who knows and demands the standard actions rarely gets to be an hdc auditor it takes tons of hours to make real dianetic auditor who can toss off standard sessions and get his routine miracles so if an hdc doesnt interne but simply goes on to the academy courses or shsbc he has skipped his apprenticeship as dianetic auditor if he gets his class vi and never internes but goes on to viii well we now have somebody who has long since lost touch with the reality of why he is studying therefore you cant take class vi graduate who was never dianetic auditor and interne him as vi hell goofgoofgoof so you have to interne him as an hdc when he can turn out flawless dianetic sessions on all kinds of pcs you can interne him as iv etc in other words you have to catch up all neglected apprenticeships i dont care if the guy is an viii if he wasnt ever dianetic auditor and class vi auditor and isnt interning as an viii then he is only provisional flubby auditors are the biggest time wasters cs has if auditors on his lines arent good hell take forever to get his cs work done and he wont get results the answer is regardless of class as course graduate cs must interne his auditors for each interneship missed on the way up the ok to audit system is used one takes any graduate and internes him on the lowest interneship he has missed he reviews his material gets his drills checked gets his misunderstood words cleared 163 and gets an ok to audit for that level if he goofs he is crammed and sometimes wholly retreaded the ok to audit dianetics would be his first okay this suspends if he has to retread when he then has turned out pcs pcs pcs pcs 5 6 8 10 hours day for weeks and weeks and is total success as dianetic auditor he can go on up at first as dianetic interne he is part time studying dianetics then as he gets flawless and while he is getting experience and practice on dianetics he can gradually phase over into restudying his next interneship usually iv or vi then one day he is word cleared checked out on his drills and he qualifies for ok to audit for iv or vi now it begins all over again flubscramming midnight oil audit audit cramming audit audit new word clear new drill work audit audit audit audit 5 6 8 10 hours day now he is iv or vi auditor his next real step is vi or vii interne at an sh if he has been good iv interne auditor his vi interneship after his shsbc will be vii interneship vii is an interne activity when hes an auditor that can do vi and power he is ready for viii and ix if he is going to be good viiiix auditor he will interne in an ao or sh under an experienced cs now when he goes to his own org you have real honest to goodness cs and as cs he must know how you use interneships to make auditors wherever this function is neglected you dont get auditors you get doubtful students and out tech on flag cses have to catch up every missed interneship to make high volume high quality auditor the world renowned superiority of flag auditors is built just like i am telling you here there is reason just that same quality cant be built in any org one does it by the interne method by using this method you get in tech and high volume any auditor in any org that is limping and fumbling simply has never been properly interned the way to remedy it is to set up good cramming that uses only hco bs and has them available and verbal tradition good word clearer and qual okay to audit interne system the internes are section in qual they have course supervisor they study and audit cram audit cram study audit audit audit audit and one day you have in tech and high volume high class auditing all over the place otherwise you just have bunch of students in doubt chewing on their misunderstood words and failed tech there is right way to go about it it is by interneship l ron hubbard founder lrh nt rd

from the practical experience that in csing thousands of cases the only few mistakes i made and repaired were when i listened to the opinion of the auditor or saw the pc this can be quite fatal to cases progress the fantastic results i achieve as cs mainly stem from not permitting what i know of tech and cases to be clouded by human emotion and reaction scn public relations term by others part of css duty is to get the case through it despite auditor opinions and flubs or the opinions of others cs has political or personnel opinions he can of course have his own opinions of the pcs case but he is the friend of the pc even when being harsh often the cs unseen by the pc is sometimes never suspected but quite often adored by those for whom he cses one often sees this in success stories

of it the pc is justified in trusting us when we keep up to date on our tech know our job take every care that good job is done and do our duty auditor opinion some auditors develop overts and withholds on pc and color their auditing reports with critical remarks about pc more withholds cs who pays much attention to these opinions is foolish when they get too bad on too many pcs get the auditors overts and withholds pulled as hell begin to flub the worksheet and what the pc said or did is important the opinions arent an auditor has right to refuse to audit certain pcs as long as he audits others thats as it should be but lot of dog cases are just unsolved cases that can be solved some are very difficult true but the difficulty is finding the bug some pcs are rather wild in conduct but they solve too so an auditors opinion is not study of the case talking to an auditor about case he is auditing is not of any technical value to cs again case does not know what is wrong with it or it would asis and wouldnt be wrong so talking to case about his case is waste of time for cs some write huge notes to cs the only value in all this is to analyze whether its hidden standard or an arc brk or wh or pts matter technical considerations are all that enter in looking over such executive opinion is the worlds worst source of data on pc cs should ever take what seniors say about junior its all human emotion and reaction its not tech family husbands wives fathers mothers brothers and sisters aunts and uncles are of little value to listen to about case the most they could give you would be list of accidents or illness or time in home but beware they may be worse off than the pc the cs is the pcs safest friend the pc trusts the cs and the auditor or he wouldnt sit still at

auditor starts out as an individual he goes one of two directions he overworks and squirrels himself into failure or he builds up teammay only be receptionist and an apprentice auditor but he is still building up team i have never seen individual auditors succeed over long period failing to form or become part of team they eventually fade out or squirrel the reason is simple enough these rules apply to improve tech results you must improve administration and i dont mean just writing better in folders definition administration consists of the formation and handling of the lines and terminals involved in production unless an auditor understands this fully he will never insist on tech sec tech establishment officer d of p cs examiner pages folder admin and himself will begin to omit keeping folder summary and then omit the session actions and then with big loses retire from it all if i were an auditor and saw some of these things missing id be liable to say are you guys kidding i thought we were here to audit pcs without the correct pattern of lines and terminals you dont get results you get headaches mad neighbors and refunds auditing on lines an auditor should regard himself as highly skilled expert technical specialist whose work requires respect and service and case supervising on lines case supervisor should consider himself sort of czar whose word is so law even the exec director thinks several times before he approachesduly servile of course and bowing the prescribed three times as he exits 172a class xii on flag is listened to by others with hush even if he is only commenting on the weather these are the stars of the team their worldwide reputation for smooth flubless auditing is an administrative result short of space overloaded short of admin personnel turning out the highest well done hours in the world flags div iv produces because of an admin system the highest of these cses and auditors goes to cramming if he misplaces comma or drops tr 1 if the sessions exams at examiner drop from 90 fn the whole place gets overhauled folders are folder error summaried by an fes section the folder summary is kept up each session or cramming the folder is studied and csed the d of p assigns the sessions the cs is done correctly or cramming the folder travels on its lines the tests are done in short it is complex but constantly flowing pattern of moving pcs folders and examinations interspersed with testing and interviews and reregistration there is right way to do it results if an org has only 65 of its sessions fn vgis at examiner the right answer is to organize the place why well the first answer is that the third dynamic is stronger than the first dynamic an auditor auditing alone is first dynamic the pc is first dynamic as it is the auditor plus pc that must be greater than the reactive mind one can easily work the rest out if the auditor is part of functioning third dynamic not just an individual the auditor plus pc versus the bank is lot more than the bank another answer is that an auditor knows the pc if only because of sessions and personal opinion enters into it that is not pure technical view as css must be another answer is that an auditor in group gets more auditing done individually practicing auditors often fail because nobody is taking care of the auditor as person further they get loses one sends them to cramming when they get loses they often start squirreling then they really get loses that ends them as auditors an auditor working in good on policy organization is given service he does get sent to cramming he does keep his tech updated he gets wins when he doesnt hes put back on standard tech so he happily keeps going and makes lots of happy people so if i were auditing in group i would insist as condition of work that div iv and div v be good on policy divisions fully organized with nonsense i know whereof i speak as parttime duty i work as consulting cs with good iv and good v sometimes i have had to take over the whole cs line when the organization bogs in any way i know the whole thing is heading toward 173singlehanding the lot so i get the lines back in and get people to cramming and get the fn at examiner ratio approaching 100 again thus the advice you get about csing is livelivelive not canned theory org wins being on administrative lines to all orgs i can tell you pointblank that their stats depend on their volume and quality of service that isnt propaganda its pure fact the fnno fn at examiner ratio tells you at once if divs iv and v are organized and operating or if they are just fooling about at 50 to 75 fn at examiner the administrative functions of divs iv and v are stinking bad cs series 25 is out cramming is out hidden data lines exist hco bs books and tapes are not used the public at that of fn will stay away in droves registrars will go batty and adopt hot prospect systems the staff will go low pay and the execs will be perpetual dark shade of purple from yelling the cashbills ratio will be the subject of finance missions and the neighbors will be phoning the police why because an org is itself technical delivery organization and 50 to 75 fn at examiner is an overt product the academy has already failed to apply student study tech and word clearing qual is joke there is library of tech available and if available isnt read the org as tech service delivery unit is treating its public to noauditing situation and will get in trouble remedy the way to remedy is to get on policy with tech organization put in qual with word clearing and library and cramming put in the cs series 25 tech lines tolerate outtech or outadmin in folders dummy run the lines until theyre in cram cram cram cs and auditor and tech personnel flubs whenever they occur get the organization functioning your fn at examiner ratio will climb straight up to 90 95 98 by actual test pcs will flood in reg lines will get easy success stats soar more auditors more cses more organization second third hgc 174and the more thoroughly the admin lines are manned the better the tech lines work this conclusion came from actual inspections of orgs and studies of their stats orgs should be selling more training than processing but why train if you cant interne them in good qual and hgc theyll never amount to anything as auditors unless they work in an organization that is on tech and on policy so you need an hgc tech done in proper administrative framework works some orgs really dont believe they could ever attain the flubless auditing quality of flag but they can it is even easy it is even easier to attain flubless quality of auditing than any other kind you put in real on policy admin pattern in iv and v you begin with qual interne course you send to cramming for any cs or auditing error matter how minute the results come up the errors cease youre success if you do it l ron hubbard founder lrh nt rd copyright 1971 1972 by l ron hubbard

auditing it is wholly and entirely up to the cs whether or not his auditors ever come to be flubless auditors auditing flubs are the main things that make css job long and hard and the main thing that denies his pcs high results for examplewith competent auditors i can cs the days folders in 212 hours with green flubby auditors the same number of folders takes 612 hours the answer plainly is to groove the auditors in until they are flubless and this is what competent cs does because he has internes on his lines and because any group of auditors can be bettered the training officer part of the cs hat is one which is always worn also if the techqual administrative setup is nonextant or confused mess the errors in folders and various upsets react suppressively both on the cs and auditors and theyboth cs and auditorsmake mistakes so the administrative lines and terminals must be there thus cs out of selfdefense is not merely training officer of auditors but of other techqual personnel as well officially this hat belongs with the other terminals but to coordinate the operation the cs has to have large amount of knowhow about the lines and terminals of tech and qual as it is the cs who is directing the running of cases and as the lines and terminals exist only to obtain auditing results in volume with high quality cs can afford to neglect his duties as training officer otherwise he will promptly drown the folder flow must be smooth with flaps the auditorpc assignments must be smooth with lost auditing time the sessions must occur the auditors who flub must be promptly handled the cramming officer in qual must know his business the cs depends on him to get the kinks out of the auditors tech and its application the processing must be paid for adequately or there will be funds to hire enough terminals and indeed there would be hgc at all the cs is trying to obtain volume quality and viability by experience volume comes from the whole org working and the auditors auditing correctly without lost hours spent in fumbles and repairs quality comes from smooth techqual lines and hatted terminals and the auditors auditing flublessly it is not that the cs is in charge of the whole org but every point where cs is having trouble is where an org terminal has broken down therefore cs has every right to insist upon hatted functioning terminals the cs has definite effect upon the efficiency of an orgs personnel he can ensure the staff gets audited either on his lines or from dept 13 and he can insist on quality staff staff auditing for it will help keep his own post going 176tech works it works splendidly the materials are there read understood and applied flubless auditing occurs it is so easy to cs just for cases using standard actions all puzzles come from flubs the sequence of actions cs should take to attain flubless auditing could be listed more or less in this order 1 make sure his own tech is up to date and do parttime study or retread where needed 2 make sure he has misunderstood words the length and breadth of the subject get word clearing method 2 on every major tech writing each hco b or pl if it comes to that then get word clearing method 1 to full ep 3 practice locating the bugs in failed cases or dog cases long in auditing until the cs knows it was an application failure an auditor failure or former cs failure 4 study out the terminals and lines necessary in your org physically going over them to get pc in b get an auditor employed c get pc assigned to an auditor d get auditor and pc together in an auditing room get the pc examined f get the folder turned in for csing g get an auditor to cramming and back h get pc to ethics and handled i get d of p to interview pcs muster auditors do assignments and other d of p duties l get pc to attest k get pc to success i get folders fesed m get folders stored and found n get folders made up or neatly covered get supplies for auditors p get an area for auditor admin q get an area for pcs to wait r get the various boards made and kept up s get stats kept and reported t get bonuses paid u get pcs handled when adrift on lines v get qual in w do his own job x how to get and keep all this and any more points going all at once rapidly 177he will now know the scene and can achieve more ideal scene by insisting the org officer emergency or the has permanently handle now it all gets less confusing as one understands what is out when it is out 5 set up close fast line with the cramming officer so that auditors who flub are in actual fact rapidly straightened out and gotten back to auditing without great time loss 6 fend off and refuse to give tech advice as such know word clearing series 16 thoroughly and get great reality on it and insist that the qual sec and cramming officer know it use it and hammer away with it otherwise such weird tech confusions will be floating about that even the cs gets confused and begins to wonder if the material is in the books and bulletins 7 gather up tech and admin library for fast reference for personal use 8 get in system whereby every flub by an auditor d of p div iv or v admin personnel page anyone that flubs as it affects the cs in any way gets cramming chit with the exact reference to be crammed on keep carbon of the chit send the original to cramming get the chit back when done and marked off on the carbon keep the admin of it simple but the execution of it totally effective 9 the qual sec cramming officer and interne supervisor are the close technical links with the cs in technical matters the cs is senior sometimes the cs is sent to cramming by the qual sec and should accept and do it gracefully sometimes there is senior cs in the org the assistant guardian ed or some other senior exec may be an hsst or even class x in such case he has the right to cram or send any of these terminals or any other terminal to cramming including any senior cs and including any cs for another department or for crew or in the guardians office these terminals constitute the tech hierarchy of the org senior cs cses qual sec cramming officer and the interne supervisor and they have to hold hard technical line the tech sec is mainly concerned with production and administration and tech establishment officer is concerned with establishing it can happen that tech sec or teo are also very well trained technically and if so are part of this technical hierarchy but they are not necessarily so therefore there is sort of exofficio technical committee on the subject of technical matters composed generally of the senior cs cses qual sec cramming officer and interne supervisor that monitors the quality of hgc and dept 10 auditing the director of training can be advised concerning the results of his students after graduation in order to remedy his training and as such is part of the committee as can be the tech sec most narrowly and most continually tech quality is between the cs and the cramming officer more widely the senior cs qual sec and interne supervisor enter in and in the widest sense the tech sec tech establishment officer and director of training enter in it is an error to suppose the cs and auditors are the technical monitors of the org they are the main technical personnel but cs can waste tons of time by talking to or with auditors beyond an auditors conference and can really get whizzing if he spends the same time with the cramming officer who then crams auditors and with the interne super who then persuades internes to function knowing who is as important in organization as knowing how so hold some meetings small and large and thresh out the bugs 10 missing materials is cs point of upset what is course policy letter can be out on tech courses to degree that you wouldnt believe not only routing form or roll book but materials 178the books hco bs tapes must be available they exist it is suppressive to run course without them pubs org clos have them financial planning cant deny this necessity as theyre what their income comes from qual must have complete and safeguarded library for use in cramming actions under omitted materials would be omitted meters and at this writing there is restriction on these and supply is abundant the materials gag is the last straw for cs future auditors wont have clue and current auditors will have way to find out so the cs must not permit economy or plain laziness or we sent despatch three months ago to get in the road of materials it is cheaper to put somebody on plane with cheque to bring them back than to do without materials so cs should definitely defend himself against materials blockage and handle it 11 study when one has materials and particularly when one is getting new materials breakdown can occur when the materials especially new ones arent read technical person must keep up with the advances in technology that is true of any profession primary failure of new technology is you wont believe it but it is true the materials arent read before the process is tried i have even caught class ixs out on this believe it or not so dont think it cant happen process g is received auditors audit it process fails why auditors never read the bulletin first so be sure your auditors read the materials and check out before they do the process write cses like this auditor to cramming to check out on hco b when attested do the following 1 do this on new materials and on new auditors on any materials you believe he may goof why have the first 12 pcs on process g go sour just because the auditor only glanced at the commands and missed the tech interiorization rundowns are still in this category in some areas the auditor doesnt study and clay demo the pack before doing them so they fail now and then power hits the same snag so simple as it seems get new materials read and checked out in cramming as the first part of cs on them and get new materials read and keep up on them yourself 17912 hidden data line trouble can wreck an hgc and the org and field hidden data line is pretense that certain data exists outside of hco bs books and tapes it can include data in hco bs is conflicting and nowhere does it say how to ______ this is deadly and cs should work hard to stamp it out the causes of hidden data line or imagined conflicts is failure to use word clearing methods two and three on courses and failure to use and only use method two in cramming cs can go straight up the wall trying to grapple with these omissions and eventually begin to believe that it takes 500 cramming chits to make an auditor who still isnt made and that flubless auditing cant be done from hco bs books and tapes as soon as cs finds his cramming orders getting too thick he should check is method 2 meter word clearing used hard in cramming as first action b are methods 2 and 3 word clearing in use constantly on tech courses c is method 1 word clearing full rundown available and faultlessly done on every auditor get these points in poof the hidden data line vanishes see word clearing series 16 word clearing has been around for years but people sometimes are themselves so fogged by misunderstood words that they dont hear you at all when you say use word clearing 13 invalidation kills auditors so dont chew on them any harder than is necessary to get the job done get to cramming to mean normal procedure even for class xiis we had one student who every evening gasped with relief that he hadnt been sent to cramming we finally found out that he was really terrified he would be found out for false study stats only when an auditor refuses to go to cramming do you begin to push the auditor sent to cramming to do an action must not do the action on another pc until he has been to cramming on it this can hold up production in somebodys mind but how an auditor can produce anything while flubbing is someone elses misunderstood not mine he cant better five hours in cramming and one good session than cramming and five goofed sessions the real invalidation of an auditor is failing at tech so dont let them fail johnny your trs are too hard to hear get over to cramming and get hearable is perfectly acceptable if it is correct so invalidation could be defined as letting an auditor lose b correcting things he does right thats about the extent of invalidation 14 auditor morale depends not on pr public relations or phoney stats it depends on actual honest completions 180a well trained auditor allowed to get completions will have high morale thus cs must push an auditor toward flubless tech b completions you keep pushing and hell make it you dont push or push on the wrong things and he wont as to completions try to get auditors to do the whole program so something is completed this is for the auditor not the pc the auditors code on frequent change of auditors was written for pcs but it also applies to auditors let them complete programs even if they spend half the day in cramming dont yank them off cases and dont let your d of p assign auditors to different cases or hell soon have downtone apathetic auditors who never see what their auditing finally does for one particular pc auditor morale has little to do with anything but the above two things also if you have those two things in as cs you will see something new happen pcs will be around slapping auditors on the back and cheering the org and the place becomes very happy place so work for auditor morale with pushing them relentlessly toward flubless tech and toward completions ____________ the above actions are numbered if cs were to work to get these in one by one and if he then went over them again and again he would wind up about the most complimented upstat cs anywhere around these are the giant points to get in while plugging along each day csing the usual and handling the noise the way to get out of cope is to organize and these fourteen points give sequence of organizational steps that lift one out of cope and into smooth productive time of it the org would become very prosperous the staff would be very happy the field would be delighted just remember that when you reach an average 700 well done auditing hours you better have new cs in training and persuade him to follow himself these 14 points in new and necessary additional hgc l ron hubbard founder lrhsbntrd

required from cs point of view all these things are under the css control data in the class viii materials the 7 resistive cases are described the full lot of them are now found in gf 40x there are numerous other lists for assessment if cs really doesnt know his lists he can order them all method 5 and take his choice of symptoms also cs can have the pc simply asked questions from this data cs knows why the case is not running well and can order the actions to remedy it if nothing is wrong complete the earliest incomplete grade on the grade chart knowledge cs who is well word cleared on his materials and has studied on the courses knows what things hang case up more than what other things this gives one the knowledge necessary to choose what lists case case gain then its gf 40x and to

what does the cs do there is fortunately different degree of upset in these three things int rd trouble is worse than list trouble is worse than out ruds therefore the correct cs would be to 1 repair

are three firm rules in handling auditors which make the difference between good auditors and poor auditors or even having auditors or auditors at all 1 never fail to find and point out an actual goof and send the auditor to cramming 2 never invalidate or harass an auditor for correct action or when technical goof has occurred 3 always recognize and acknowledge technically perfect session by reversing these three things cs can wreck and blow every auditor in the place by always doing these three things correctly the cs winds up with splendid auditors an auditor who knows he goofed and yet gets well done doesnt think the cs is good fellow he holds the cs in contempt and his auditing worsens an auditor who didnt goof and yet is told he did becomes bitter or hopeless and begins to hate the cs the test of cs in the auditors eyes is is he spot on meaning is the cs accurate in giving the right program the right cs spotting the goof and ordering cramming and being well enough trained to see and commend well done you never get bad indicators in an auditor or student when you state the truth you only get bad indicators when your statement is not true pr public relations cheery falsehoods has nothing to do with getting good indicators good indicators in auditors are made with truth you goofed go to cramming do trs 101 to 104 until you cease to alter commands well done by exams practice handwriting so i dont take so long reading your worksheets this fn vgis at session end and the bad exam report do not agree is there any way this report was falsified is there any goof

program cs auditors grade or censure of auditor and to cramming auditors like businesslike accurate cs good fellow cs who lets it slide and says nothing becomes very bad fellow indeed in auditors eyes

hunches or intuition and does not bother to confirm or make wider effort he can miss the case entirely example cs says to himselfi know whats wrong with joe his wife so ill cs ow on your wife some of the time the cs will be right this gives him win and confirms him in sloppy csing he does not bother to know before he cses cs who gets low percentage of cracked cases and low percent of fn vgis at examiner usually fails to know before he goes he just goes which is to say he just writes programs and cses without finding out enough about the case skilled cs may very well be able to figure out exactly whats wrong with the case thats his job but how does he find out anything about the case at all the answer is very simple so simple it gets missed the cs gets data on the case how does he do this the broadest most used answer to how to know is prepared lists these have all sorts of questions on them that read or dont read there are lots of these lists beginning with the famous pc assessment form there are all sorts of lists an end product of any list is data on the pc one uses to program and cs the case the next answer to how to get data is lists prepared by the cs himself and which are assessed by the auditor another answer is 2way comm on questions written by the cs what do you consider hasnt been handled on your case is jewel which gives you the hidden standard to list and null and run who or what would have to bd fn item and ow on the item found but there are dozens more how do you feel about your family r factor the cs is concerned about your saying your case sags after wins in auditing could you tell exactly what happens and what your history has been on this there is limit to such questions and if taken from what the pc says to examiner or from auditors comments on worksheets they will usually fn but mainly they give data when regular actions fail there is always the d of p d of p to interview richard roe and find out what hes trying to do in session also how he looks mannerisms etc data data data now you have picture of this case 188combined action usually by prepared lists issued or from cs prepared lists the cs finds and gets handled by the auditor in the same session much of what is wrong this combines finding out with handling any prepared list carried to fn on each read method 3 or the indicated action done will give case gain maybe its all the case gain one could ask for but such reads even if fned and the text in the worksheet give the cs new data about this case broad shooting even if he now knows the cs does not narrowly shoot at one target he gives alternatives as well in his cs example cs knows pc is concerned about fns he does not necessarily just write prepcheck fns instead the cs writes assess auditors auditing dianetics scientology fns processing false reads prepcheck each reading item taking largest read first this gives broader band more chance of hitting the button needed there are many ways to do this example you know it is misdefined word you dont cs find the misdefined word you write assess method 3 and handle the word clearing correction list for you see the session might also have been run over an out rud evaluation to abruptly cs everything the pc has just said is q and but worse it can lead to evaluation little flags pc remarks are like little flags that may signal much deeper deposit of aberration only the little flag shows i dont like women can uncover whole background i keep getting this pain in my side opens the door to whole chain of operations and one to be done next week but by the broad rule the cs doesnt dive at it he says pc has pain in side i cs 54 not list the somatics in his side but whole coverage of accidents illnesses one will also have side pain as result appendicitis operation is enough to give anyone pain in the side if never audited out tagging cases cs who sees case is thick foldered and not well tags the case resistive there are 7 resistive cases listed in the class viii material for this the cs has gf40 expanded method 3 and then handles the lists and engrams indicated in it in his next cs if this doesnt handle the case is in an out ethics situation that should be looked into the cs mentally tags the easy ones and the tough ones the tough ones he plays on the resistive cases side the cs can also find an auditor considers fast case bad case when it is just fast case 189primary record the primary record is the pcs folder when the case does not run well it can be assumed that the case is resistive b errors have been made in auditing these two assumptions are valid in all cases which do not easily resolve they are both valid because the case being resistive was running poorly was hard to audit and cs earlier from the folder from prepared lists from css own additions to prepared lists from css own prepared lists from 2wc on questions and from d of p interviews one can get enough data to intelligently program and cs case all this may seem very obvious but in word clearing the most common cs error has been to fail to order word clearing correction list done instead one reads correct the last word found this misses that the whole thing may be being done over withhold or arc break it might be another word entirely so cs who does this risks the wrong target he is not csing broadly enough also one sees repair or life program consisting of two or three special processes and without any lists at all one also sees program which seeks to handle several things the cs knew were wrong followed by 8 cs 53 9 gf 40x 10 cs 54 having gone this program then seeks to find out its quite backwards thus the cs who goes before he knows is going to have an awful lot of fns at the examiner the watchword is know before you go l

63 csing for new auditors or veterans there is considerable difference between csing for internes and new auditors and csing for veterans this shows up mainly in csing prepared lists for an interne or new auditor or one who is not very experienced or expert the rule is that cs gives as little thinking to do as possible in the session it is enough for such an auditor to do the actions it is too much to also ask him to use judgment or work something out while auditing veteran on the other hand knows the tools so well that he can also figure out what to do example cs for nonveteran 1 assess gf method 5 and return to cs cs for veteran 1 assess gf method 5 and handle it is quite trick to assess whole list then take the biggest reads and handle it is quite beyond an auditor who is still worrying about his trs or how you run meter in an effort to speed up lines or escape work cs can err badly in this it becomes mysterious why word clearing correction list ceases to work why fns are few at the examiner giving an inexperienced auditor the responsibility for assessing list and also handling it is in fact asking him to audit and to faint degree cs in the chair it is quite beyond green auditor given that he knows his tech most of css troubles come from asking green auditors to follow cses for which they have not studied the hco bs or on which they have not been crammed b csing for green auditors to decide something in session or combine actions such as assessing and handling without new cs in between c not sending the auditor green or veteran to cramming for every goof d having cramming it takes while to make an auditor 191the cs is responsible for all actions in the session he has only himself to blame if he is asking someone to cs for him in the chair it is easier to plan out and write up the needed gf actions or any other list from the method 5 reads than it is to correct messedup handling it does not save any time at all but more than likely makes new problems for the cs it is very easy to have even green auditor assess some prepared list one can even now say take the list just assessed and do 2wc on each item i have marked carry each to an fn before leaving it the cs simply puts dash ahead of each item that read in the assessment the cs can also number the items in different order than the list because of better programming or bigger reads and have each one handled to fn an l3b can be ordered method 5 and then the cs can get it back and precisely order whats to be done with its reads and in what sequence this is true of any prepared list the only small hitch is that cs has to be there and available so as not to stall the session even so in the long run it is faster because less mistakes are made assess send to cshandle instead of assess and handle this even applies to cs 53 or cs 54 or white form or gf 40x any prepared list perhaps this will greatly improve your fn vgi ratio l ron hubbard founder lrhmesrd copyright 1971 by l

the cs and cramming cycles fast way for any cs to go into doubt about the skills of his auditors is to send them to cramming and get only done back cramming is there to find the real cause of any error so if the real why is not made known to the cs he has something is wrong with joes trs which hangs up in time and never is resolved response from cramming to an order from the cs to check his trspcs ta went low in session which states i checked his trs and they are good but he audited the pc in room that was overhot and the cans were too big he has been drilled on auditors code and session environment handling and hco bs on ta errors and now has this down pat it wont happen again leaves the cs in doubt as to what really happened whats more he can order this repaired on the pc by 2wc on times he felt worried about his ta or fns taken esim to fn which will clear it up furthermore the auditor now knows that the cs knows what the real error was doesnt get hung with withhold or false idea about his trs from the cs in essence one is putting the exact truth on the line so the following rule is now mandatory in all hgcs and quals the cramming officer is always on any cramming order to report the exact outnesses found or the exact session goofs with any additional data in detail to the cs cs receiving cramming order back giving why or an unreal why that does not make sense when compared with the session and its results must return the cramming slip to the cramming officer requiring the why be found or the wrong why abandoned and the real why found and corrected good cs should know his data series down cold and be able to spot such outpoints at once he would go over the session with the cramming officer and point out what it is he wants handled this data is not

earlier lrh hco bs that are always done by cs whenever he cses any folder all the csing data in the world would be of little use if these mandatory actions were omitted 1 inspect the examiners report to see if the pc thought the session was okay and if the examiners notation of ta needle and indicators shows it was fn gis 2 inspect the presession cs to see what was previously ordered done 3 inspect the last session to see if the cs was done check that each separate part of the cs was done 4 inspect in the worksheet that each step of each process or action was correctly done including correct commands used and expected pc response for those commands for dianetics this would be the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 sequence and b c d etc to see if it was standard other processes and actions have their own stepswhich the cs must know in order to be in compliance with the high crime pls 5 inspect carefully that all listing actions have been correctly done find out if there was mislisting 6 inspect that fn cog and vgis occurred at the end of each process and action each chain in dianetics and at session end text is seldom read unless the session did not go well if you cant read the reports send them back to have the auditor overprint illegible words never try to cs an illegible worksheet 7 have the examiner ask the pc what the auditor did if the auditing reports dont show the error and seem false ie auditors account of session doesnt match pcs statement and indicators at examiner 8 give the session grading of very well done well done well done by exam mention or flunk depending on what was found in above points 200very well done if all the above points are okay and the session is exactly by the book well done for fn vgis at session end and at examinerno major tech errors but not exactly by the book well done by exam for fn vgis at session end and at examiner but admin and session actions not ok session grade mention if the session end was fn vgis but the fn wasnt present at the examinerprovided there were major tech errors in the session flunk for any of the following fn did not get to examiner and was not present at session end major errors or flubs occurred like ep multiple somatic run unflown ruds mislisting etc cs not followed or completed auditors rights errors occurred fn and bis at examiner etc 9 write out in triplicate on any out tech and auditor goofs indicate the right outnesses and cramming cycles for them one copy goes to d of p to auditor one copy goes to cramming officer and one copy is kept as check to see that the order is done 10 now inspectis the case running well and is it correctly programmed do we just continue do we repair recent goofs and continue do we need full fes or lists to find the bug in the case and then repair that including previous incomplete cycles 11 now check the auditors cs for the next sessiondoes it follow the program for the case in the front of the folder or does it q and and go off in another direction does it recommend to continue with the next action on the case program if the case is doing well and the last session went okay b does it recommend the necessary brief repair action and then continue the program actions if the case has been running well but there has now been an error on the case c does it recommend program to debug and handle the case if it is not running well or has started to do poorly in life ethics conditions accidents etc including use of lists to get data or an fes etc it is the cs responsibility to ensure that all ethics medical and other relevant reports are included in the pc folders and that pcs are not audited while under heavy ethics actions 12 approve the existing cs if i t is okay in line with the above other wise correct it or write up an entirely new cs 20113 write up cramming order on the csing action if the auditor was way off on his cs or add this to the existing cramming order for that session 14 if the case is not running well and generally the cs goes back to the point where the case was running well good wins and comes forward the largest bug on the case often will be in the session later than the last good one the cs should correct the bad session where this does not resolve the case study for incomplete programs and other outnesses should be made with program to complete and handle lrh important keep the three golden rules of csing always in the above actions they are 1 never fail to find and point out an actual goof and send the auditor to cramming 2 never invalidate or harass an auditor for correct action or when technical goof has occurred 3 always recognize and acknowledge technically perfect session __________ the cs must drill on this bulletin until he knows each point by number just the way dianetics auditor is required to know points 1 to 9 and to d he can also keep copy of this bulletin on the wall over his desk to refer to until he knows the sequence cold even then he should refer to

did any good in science this is known as holding constant we dont give hoot in hell if the pc understands the test or not the next time he takes it hell probably have the same misunderstoods but hell

pass to even be asked for if the meter tone arm is high or low or not fning if an instant read is gotten on the first question above the examiner does not ask the second question and sends the folder back to the cs g require meter check at success with the ta position and needle behavior noted on the success form those with high or low ta andor not fning are not valid success stories the success person makes the meter check after the story is written notes it without pc seeing it and smiles and acks he does not refuse the story as it will arc break the pc but he must call it to the attention

reason will be found to be drugs all pcs who cannot run engrams can run drug engrams they are afraid because they get into the bank heavily when on drugs only drugs can be run so pc who has done r6 and clearing course but hasnt made it will be found to be rabbiting frightened and running away druggie he can and will run drug engrams thus the right action is to do full drug rundown then start the pc all over again at r6 it is an exception only because he hasnt done his solo anyway repairs where pre ot hasnt made the grade of solo level or gets sick afterwards full repair must be done and the failed grade must be completed before he goes on up it is possible to repair pre ot between r6 and ot iii so long as you are not trying to handle his whole case but only repairing the grade he missed trs never order trs after solo materials study or before ot iii is attested trs should be done before or during solo auditing study but not after materials are issued and the tr course may not be done

it usually means word clearing on the tr materials and rehab major actions it is very losing game to throw major rundown in between r6 and ot iii such as l10 after clearing and before ot i the result is mess the way to recover such blunder is to get the pc rehabbed or to rest point and then finish up the solo grades to ot iii attest and then complete the rundown set up it is therefore very important that pc be fully set up including dianetics before he is let onto r6 solo materials study auditing skill none of this states that you cannot improve pcs auditing skill between r6 and ot iii excepting only trs big wins are to be had by doing so the major cause of failure on solo grades is the inability to audit you can take pre ot who didnt really make clear or ot i and move him back to r6 study and retread him as an auditor and then let him move back up the line and hell win the sources of failure on solo are 1 drug rd 2 dianetics incomplete 3 case not set up 4 inability to audit summary realize that from r6 to ot iii you have closed band for other major actions so dont let people onto r6 auditing who have points 14 out if it has happened patch it up as you can and let the pre

designate rundowns that were not completely and fully done it is not slang word in the dictionary you will find quickie also quicky something done or made in hurry also hurriedly planned and executed program as of studies what happens in auditing for instance is grade zero expanded is done by just doing single flow to its first fn that is obviously quickie more subtle one is to do pts rundown with ethics action to begin and check for stability holding gain and not ill week or two after the rd only if both these actions were done would one have complete pts rundown as it would give product pc longer pts so what makes quickie completion quickie is it length of time not necessarily is it fewness of processes not necessarily as power can be done quickie simply by not hanging on for the ep and only going to fn to define complete gives us the reverse of quickie complete to make whole entire or perfect end after satisfying all demands or requirements completion is the act or action of completing becoming complete or making complete so completing something is not loose term it means an exact thing end after satisfying all demands or requirements does not mean doing as little as possible or doing what one can call complete without being detected anything that does not fully satisfy all requirements is quickie so quickie really means omitting actions for whatever reason that would satisfy all demands or requirements and doing something less than could be achieved in short quickie is not doing all the steps and actions that could be done to make perfect whole standard auditing actions required for ages that auditors cleared each word of each command yet when they went quickie they dropped this when this was dropped gains on 75 of all pcs lessened or vanished we are right 218now achieving spectacular wins on pcs just by clearing up commands and words on all lists we are finding that these pcs did not recover and never before had been in session even though previously audited hundreds of hours by omitting an essential action of clearing commands processing did not work because the pc never understood the auditing commands so quickie action did not save any time did it it wasted hundreds of hours quickie programs are those which omit essential steps like vital lists or 2wcs to get data fess for past errors are often omitted to slow down the torrent of quickie actions on clearing commands hco pl 4 apr 72 issue iii ethics and study tech has clause 4 an auditor failing to clear each and every word of every command or list used may be summoned

reconstruct the list and either confirm the item or locate the real item may have been invalidated and suppressed or extend the list and get the real item the real item will bd fn one can establish

dianetic list can produce wrong list reactions ask the pc for his somatics and he blows up or goes into apathy or blows or attacks the auditor all of the more violent or bad reactions on the part of the pc come from out lists nothing else produces such sharp deterioration in case or even illness out lists therefore when one gets sharp change in case like lowered tone violence blows determination to go on in spite of the supervisor long notes from pcs self csing etc etc the cs suspects an out list this outness can occur in regular sessions even when the item was said to bd fn it can occur in coffee shop out of session auditing of someone or by est or poorly trained or untrained staff members or even in life pts when such actions as finding items by nonauditors are done on pts people the situation can be bad so one also suspects the person to be pts to someone or something pts does not communicate well in an assessment question so one says someone or something is hostile to you and you are connected to someone or something that doesnt agree with dianetics or scientology repairs the main things to know when doing such repairs are that such situations as wrong lists or upset people can occur in an org where untrained people are also using meters and b that it is up to the cs to suspect detect and get them handled in regular session do not ignore the possible bad influence as the good outweighs the bad in such cases it is not correct answer to forbid such actions it is correct answer to require all such actions and worksheets become part of the folder one can also persuade the d of t or qual to gen in the people doing such actions and do not ignore the effect such actions can have on cases and do not neglect to include them in cses before going on with the

interest nothing bad will happen if the item is run cs responsibility the cs must keep telling his auditors on drugs or expanded dianetics omit asking for interest on r3r on these drug intentions run them if they read on the meter repair in repairing cases it is good sense to check this point on drugs and intentions to see if they were neglected in r3r due to interest if so then have them run and

list to use and when to use it this is particularly true of auditors in session who can and must use the l1c l4br l3rd or wccl in session when trouble occurs in order to quickly remedy the action and complete the session successfully without having to end off prematurely for cs instructions for this purpose the auditing tools drill has been developed by lrh in this drill the coach has pile of the various correction lists holds each up in any order and asks when do you use this how do you use it auditor must answer correctly without comm lag when the auditor can do this without error coach then varies the drill by giving session situations and auditor must state the appropriate corrective action to be taken flunk is always handled by having the student restudy the relevant hco b never by coach interpretation any disagreement or confusion is handled by appropriate word clearing on the materials concerned repairing the pc instead of the auditor excessive use of repair lists and having to redo correction lists already done results from flubby auditing dont just carry on repairing the pc get the auditor crammed especially on basic auditing especially trs and metering then you can get the pc rapidly and effectively repaired and back onto the gradation chart do not let an auditor touch such lists on pc until he has been crammed on trs metering and assessinglrh handling trouble before it occurs to use correction list in session every time the ta starts to go up or pc gets misemotional is qa and will slow up auditing tremendously the correct action is to be an expert in basic auditing 231to know the action you are running and run the process to its ep tas do go high and low during processes pcs do sometimes get misemotional when running certain actions this doesnt call for correction list as there is nothing to correct one simply completes the process gradation chart the ep of repair program is stated in cs series 3 as the pc feeling great and feeling he can get case gain it does not say every correction list or every repair action ever devised having been run on the pc if one goes past the ep of repair you then will have to repair the pc the case gain available to the pc is contained in the processes of the gradation chart which is the basic auditing program of each pc failure to repair pc who does need repair denies that pc the gains obtainable from processes repairing pc who is doing well or continuing to repair pc beyond the ep of repair also denies the gains of auditing the solution is to be an expert in basic auditing know the processes down cold know uses of correction lists and use them only when required and then use them correctly and get the pc back onto the gradation chart with minimum of delay training services aide revised

standard handling of auditors 1 error of any kindinstruct by reference to hco b b second error of any kindsend to cramming and get the auditor crammed at once without any loss of auditing time but before the auditor is allowed to audit further this is 2 hours not 2 days c third error of any kindretread wherein the auditors weak areas are located and the auditor has to m7 m6 m4 and restudy the materials of that area this takes the auditor back to step retread under good super takes 4 or 5 days now if the auditor again errs he goes to step if he goes the route again he hits retrain and is retrained fully like any other student his prd is done or verified and he goes through the course starting with basic books this puts the auditor back to but if he now lands at retrain again he is given full and complete retrain from his earliest contacts with the subject it is highly unlikely he will flub further but if he does he should not be on auditing at all false reports falsified auditing report puts the auditor at once at retrain as he is not sufficiently aware of the potentials of the subject to know he can get results and does not have to be dishonest tr 0 ot zero and tr 0 are the keys to good auditing 2 cses were found in orgs who wouldnt let the auditors do tr 0 because of their cases both orgs had horrible stats and bad results and arc broken fields ot zero and tr 0 are routine action for auditors they do trs in spare time not because they are being crammed just to get professional every cramming order includes trs especially zero to also be done on the auditors own time this gets the auditor up to really confronting his errors come mainly from an inability to confront and from faulty metering or misunderstoods or out ethics ot zero and tr 0 are the keys to flubless auditing 233electronic attest auditors using lrh tapes and electronic attest and with ot zero tr 0 metering and us cleaned up and ethics in become very spectacular auditors in terms of results results bring pride auditors who get results are happy auditors and the above is how the standard how to get them to get results easy csing only if he spends some of his time training as above can cs ever get down to really csing cases and getting programmes done summary the above is the way i cs and handle auditors as cs i long since found that the flubby auditors were the ones who consumed the cs time the ratio is 212 hours to 612 hours wherein it only takes 212 hours to cs piles of folders when i have the auditors auditing honestly and flublessly and it takes 612 hours when i have some flubbers it is neither kind nor decent to let auditors lose only when i or msh have not been doing the csing has auditing gone wrong in any area where i was this is traced directly to the dropout of the above actions so it is the above actions which give standard results and any cs who omits them to be good fellow or these are my friends is an auditor killer auditors sometimes achieve high status and are above being crammed well watch it watch it because they will fall on their heads with crash an auditor is not unlike race horse he needs lot of care and handling and he needs his periodic drills and exercises or he goes sloppy like race horse good auditor is very very valuable and all good auditors are made by cses the proof is that even the best go bad when they longer have tight cs rein experience has taught that the exceptions are very very few and you dont have any of them it takes about 3 or 4 weeks to get an auditor through his course and doing good flubless job the majority of scientologists want to be auditors so you have auditor scarcity thats laugh its the cs the course super the cramming officer and its done just exactly as above given the materials there is other answer so stop dreaming of hiring or getting perfect auditors the ones you have are fine get more and do the above the auditors must not blame the pc nor must you the cs must not blame the

go sour or not recover one of these cases was unchanged after drug rundown he had pair of eyes that looked like blank discs check of folder showed all major drug items not run due to interest the

by qual page the exam form into the hands of the dts for immediate handling the dts notifies the d of p 3 if red tagged after session the auditor is expected to take the pc back into session for the appropriate correction list if this has been done yet the pc remains red tagged the auditor must immediately write up the session for the cs the dts in this case verifies that one or the other of these actions is occurring 2374 the d of p is responsible for seeing that an auditor is assigned to the pc 5 the dts is responsible for seeing that the folder gets to the cs and that all necessary arrangements are made to get the pc and auditor into session as rapidly as possible 6 the cs is responsible to see that the folder is immediately csed and the auditor corrected he puts the exam red

retrain or higher class auditor needed of his responsibility for seeing that his pc is rapidly handled and fning again as the hgc operates on intensive auditing bit and piece repair actions would be

student review etc in that case the dpe and qual page would substitute for d of p and dts in the line the hgc would handle its own red tags as part of their intensives in order to ensure red tagged pcs get lost on lines and not handled in 24 hours the following must be done pc examiner sends daily list at the end of each day of all red tags to the cramming officer and senior cs for the cs this provides confirmatory line against his own marked red tags for the day for the cramming officer this provides data on who should be sent for cramming if those persons do not report for cramming within 24 hours the cramming off must report to the dir correction or qual sec for investigation and handling the examiner must verify that any red tagged pc has been handled within 24 hours or report any not handled to the senior cs qual sec and dir i r for investigation and handling when handled he crosses off the red tag in his log aos and solo all the above applies to solo auditing also and red

on his pcs will find the most usual biggest improvement by getting the offending auditors assessing handled we used to say that the auditors trs were out as the most fundamental reason for results this is not specific enough the most common reason for failed sessions is the inability of the auditor to get reads on lists time after time i have checked this back as the real reason it became

drug items because of interest to even know grade 0 that other people are around or that grade i he is caved in with problems hes never cognited on and hes supposed to have enough responsibility to

up using well trained flag auditors and the most basic of lists every one of these cases was soon flying at another time lists which had been nulled by group of trainee auditors were then taken over on the same pcs same lists and renulled by class xs over half the reading items had been missed by the traineesthey simply couldnt make the list read on the pcs yet the lists were as alive as skyrockets the pcs under the trainee auditors had accumulated all manner of bypassed charge by having reading items ignored and in some cases having nonreading items given attention to trainee all this seems incredible and mysterious he does not realize how very bad his metering can be how faint and fainting his tr 1 he has numerous tricks which defeat himsuch as keeping his sensitivity on 32 for pc who only requires sensitivity 1 whereas the auditor misses all his fns as he cant keep the needle at set he doesnt put his meter so he can see pc paper and meter dial all in the same scope of vision and misses the reads his auditor presence is so poor and his attitude so unprofessional that the pc isnt really in session his own introversion prevents him from really observing the pcs tone or reaction all these faults can be cured and have to be before an auditor can call himself real auditor short of that he is just foolingabout dilettante and he has failed pcs it takes hard sweating work to get good enough to be real auditor it takes hours and hours and hours of trs the hard way it takes high degree of honesty that includes never faking and going by misunderstoods in his materials always being honest in his auditing reports constant practice with his metering drills with the tone scale and large degree of selfdiscipline it isnt talent that makes the good auditor it is practice and more practice until he himself knows first that he didnt know and then knows that he really knows the source of out tech is only laziness and dishonesty someone who is afraid of work thinks he can pr the cs and the pc fumble his way through and succeed out of fakery that route is failure and it ends in failed cases dont be psychologist or psychiatrist that was their route in the hands of thoroughly trained and drilled auditor scientology works and works splendidly there are dog cases ncgs failed cases but there are auditors who dont study and drill hard enough to become real auditors and there are cses who dont know their business and who dont keep up their study and are too lazy to fes or read sessions or cram their auditors 254there are an awful lot of excellent auditors and many very fine cses but in some local areas where verbal tech gets going and ethics is out the quality sags and there you have ncgs and slow pcs and failed cases want to know how lazy your cses and auditors are how many ncgs and failed cases do you have around if you have any at all tech in your area is out cs 53rj taken to fning list and gf40x taken to an fning list will cure any

its own series and now being reissued there are great solo lists for solo repair used on advance courses and from time to time when need for prepared list is found new ones will be issued on different subjects one can repair pc or student or staff member one can also forward case into new areas with other prepared lists mimeo some orgs backlog their mimeos the availability of lists to auditors is something which should not be neglected it is highly uneconomical as one loses resigns and students and staff when prepared lists are in nonexistence in an org or even short supply tech is the atomic fuel an org runs on keep prepared lists in supply for use translated issues in nonenglish speaking orgs lists must be very carefully translated and mimeoed for use in such orgs more than any others great care must be taken to have and use lists as they keep tech straight where it tends to go hearsay and verbal so thats quite an array of prepared lists isnt it if they are not in full use in your org dont wonder about your delivery stats why or your org and cf problems its lack of full use of this tech hidden in these prepared lists is wealth of tech that explodes into wins for your org your

auditing reports falsifying of probably the most covert and vicious crime in auditing is falsifying an auditing report at first glance to someone who is trying to pr himself as an auditor or to escape consequences of session goofs this might not seem to be the huge crime that it is when an auditing report is falsified means of repairing the pc are denied out tech and need for restudy or redrilling of materials is covered up out tech is spread about and the repute of the org and scientology are at risk there are many ways of falsifying an auditing report chief amongst them is omission of vital data in the report another is faking the things run or the pcs actions or reactions to the person doing this it may seem that he has covered up his incompetence but in actual fact it is eventually detected twice declared person recently messed up the cases of several vips by simply omitting some of their disagreements with what was being done three sps now declared some years ago had mutual understanding that they would not put down each others withholds these three also falsified auditing reports to the effect that they had run certain things on pcs and there was nothing on them when in fact they either had not run them or there was reaction which they did not put into the report they messed up about dozen people before they were caught and it took many many hours of careful csing and auditing to salvage those cases and it also took about two years they made several hundred serious enemies for themselves and today i doubt any scientologist would even speak to them and their names are remembered with scathing contempt it is not only easy to detect falsified auditing report it is also inevitable that it will be detected the person whose auditing reports have been falsified is easy to spot in folders and records the auditor marks vgis fn and the examiner notes bypassed charge and bad indicators an auditor seeking to prevent this being detected has been known to take the examiner report from the folder but that there is examiner report would be the first thing cs would notice examiner reports have been forged and exchanged with the actual one but this too is very visible 261lack of proper success story points directly to out tech and if it is not visible in the folder then that folder contains falsified auditing reports the pc in the midst of his auditing refuses to resign for more an inspection of folder either finds the out tech in the auditing reports or it doesnt if the folder error summary finds out tech the next thing that is looked for is falsified auditing reports and this is extended to looking at the other cases this auditor has handled to see if there is any similarity of reaction d of p interview with the pc will reveal falsified auditing reports it will contain data that does not appear in the auditing reports the first thing suspect is the auditing reports basically correct tech applied by competent auditor who has been trained and interned works and works every time when it doesnt work cs begins to look for the real scene there are many ways he can ascertain the actual scene amongst these are outsidethedoor session taping monitors interviews lack of success stories failures to declare failures to resign examiner reports at variance with the session reports personal check up into the case and many others the only thing which temporarily misleads cs is falsified auditing report but in all our experience with these the detection of such reports is inevitable even if it occurs long time afterwards the person who would falsify an auditing report is usually found to be suppressive with abundant rses and evil intentions who never should have been trained in the first place therefore the penalty for knowingly falsifying an auditing report in order to make oneself seem more competent than one is or to hide departures from the cs or to omit vital data necessary to csing resulting in upsets to case and time spent in investigation by seniors is actionable by committee of evidence and if the matter is proven beyond reasonable doubt cancellation of all certificates and awards declare and an expulsion order are mandatory should the person perpetrating the falsification of auditing reports run away blow before action can be taken the result is the same and is enforceable even if the person is not present green auditor may look upon the offense as slight if he is too untrained to realize that proper application of tech works every time and that improper application is gross overt act he may not realize the seriousness of his action this however cannot be pleaded as defense it is not light thing to end the hopes and close the door on pc just because one is trying to cover up his blunders the blundering auditor can be repaired by cramming and retraining but only if it is known how he has blundered that in itself is nowhere near as serious as hiding the fact honesty is the road to truth l

complete loss of folders is very serious matter case supervisor as well as folder error summary auditor and the auditor himself can be impeded greatly by folder omissions loss of folders entirely is much greater catastrophe while cases and even folders can be reconstructed and eventually handled at enormous trouble and time to the pc and technical people this does not minimize the offense usually folder pages are regarded too lightly as post and are subject to much transfer even when posted the director of tech services is often far too lax in posting folder archives ic even as double hat space restrictions often impede the careful preservation of folders in orgs but all these posts and spaces are vital to smooth delivery of auditing and should not be lightly looked upon the commonest and most senseless omissions from folders are 1 word clearing worksheets these are done in academies or training or interne areas as well as the hgc and it is often an omitted action to forward them to the persons pc folder often the lines to do so are unknown or completely missing yet every metered word clearing action should not only be the subject of worksheet but also must be included in the persons pc folder in date order word clearer can fail to fn chain or even fail to clear word as chain when it doesnt fn such goofs can mess up cases and leave cs perplexed as to how the pc was running well one day and badly the nextyet there is word clearing worksheet there so the fact of another auditor on the case is hidden 2 qual why finding actions as why finding also includes listing possibly the most vicious omission is the failure to include why finding worksheets in the persons folder or even do worksheet on it yet at least one org has been temporarily wrecked by indiscriminate why finding in qual that resulted in wrong items and wrong lists and messed up the cases of whole staffs this poor why finding has led at times to why finding becoming restricted or forbidden practice

the technical bulletins of dianetics and scientology several methods of locating desired material are available contents each volume has at the front contents which lists in chronological order each issue in that volume it is used where you know the date or approximate date of an issue periodicals by issue number following the contents in volumes i ii iii iv and vi there is list of periodicals by issue number use it to look up an issue when you know its type and issue number long contents at the front of each volume following the contents and list of periodicals by issue number there is long contents this is more detailed contents listing also arranged in chronological order which lists the series number where applicable the date the title pertinent subheadings and the major subjects of each issue in the order in which they appear it can be used to quickly locate major subjects covered in particular time period subject index the subject index is at the back of each volume immediately following the text pages it is arranged alphabetically with references under headings the reader is likely to seek it is used when you know the approximate year which volume of the data you are seeking alphabetical list of titles following the subject index there is an alphabetical list of titles for issues contained in that volume this is fast way to find the issue you are seeking when you know the title or approximate title chronological tape list although it is not immediately apparent there is also chronological tape list contained in these volumes to use it just look up the chronological volumes first eight volumes at or near the date you are seeking and you will find lectures given by lrh at the time you can also often find tape lectures covering subjects you are interested in by looking up one of the other reference lists locating key issues on the subject then by turning to these in the text pages locate tapes given on that subject as particularly in the shsbc period bulletins were issued which summarized data found more fully on tapes of same or similar date cumulative index the cumulative index will be found at the back of volume x the cs series volume following the subject index it is basically an alphabetical integration of the ten subject indexes 296purpose the purpose of the cumulative index and of its subindexes in each volume is to indicate the location of specific data about chosen subject to lead one to further data about subject data which might be unknown and thus not looked for to cross reference related subjects to clarify the use of terms and abbreviations by making them easily locatable in their context to give definitions and references to definitions of terms and to make it possible to do an embracive study of subject using the index as guide through the collected technical writings of l ron hubbard alphabetical order the alphabetical order takes account of each letter in turn through the full entry even if it consists of several words thus process levels comes after processing check definitions are placed in chronological order under the main heading and before the alphabetized subentries numerals entries beginning with figure are placed after the alphabet thus 8c 37r rundown etc are found after the letter z symbols x etc are put after the numerals arrangement of entries the word or phrase one first looks up is the main entry if there is section of entries usually two or more that would have the same main entry or relate to the same main entry then the section is indented so the main entry stands out eg certificates auditor purpose of i400 cancellation of auditors certificates reason for iv30 96 provisional certificates i52 requirements for permanent certificates i65 restoration of certificates iv34 suspension line for i66 why all begin with the word hubbard iii288 the page reference is given in the form volumepage number thus i400 means page 400 in volume i the main entry may have subentry that has further subentries these are indented further to let the subentry stand out eg learning by observing or experiencing i190 isnt memorizing iii424 lag and process lag iiii 8 process discipline of imagination essential i324 rate iii17 20 defn the rate one will permit ideas to inflow iii28 aberration and learning rate relationship bet ween iii15 consequences iii20

through rnimicry i31 willingness to iii79 297the sign called swung dash used particularly in the individual volume subject indexes to save space indicates that the main entry is understood to be read at that point cross references in addition to data being referenced under one main heading and then the same data being referenced under alternative headings there are two other forms of crossreferencing these are the see reference which is used when the information is provided under another heading elsewhere in the index the see also reference which leads the reader to material on closely related subjects or to other sources for material on the subject lrh books of the period are also referred to in cross references for abbreviations of titles used see the technical dictionary chronology as the first eight volumes are arranged chronologically the volumepage number code serves as guide to the time period of the references the lowest volumelowest page number being the earliest material square bracket with year eg 1955 following an entry indicates that the data is from that year this is used where it was necessary to more clearly indicate the time period of the reference the chronology of the material is important as it shows both the evolution of the subject and where there is any conflict the later material supersedes the earlier these volumes make having the correct technology easy knowing the technology should be greatly assisted by the index thus there should be stops to the first two points of keeping scientology working these technical volumes together with the third dynamic technology contained in the organization executive course books provide the tools with which to reach the goals of scientology and so give to earth culture of which we
