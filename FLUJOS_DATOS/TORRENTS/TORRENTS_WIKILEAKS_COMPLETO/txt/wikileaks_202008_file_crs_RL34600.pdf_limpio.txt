july 10 20 08 pl 110261 entitled the fisa amendments act of 2008 was signed into law although many of the changes enacted by the fisa amendments act were controve rsial one particularly c ontentious issue was whether to grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications providers that may have facilitated warrantless surveillance by the federal government under terrorist surveillance program between 2001 and 2007 proponents of retroactive immunity argued that it was necessary to assure private cooperation with critical intelligence investigations on the other hand opponents of retroactive immunity argued that its inclusion undermined the statutory penalties that were designed to deter unlawful intrusions into individual liberties this report discusses the various retroactive immunity mechanisms that were proposed to be included in the fisa amendments act one of which was ultima tely adopted and their likel effect on lawsuits facing telecommunications providers retroactive immunity is more than simply protection from liability it can also act as protection from the cost of litiga tion without retroactive immunity many legal issues would need to be addressed possibly at great ex pense in order to resolve these lawsuits the plaintiffs would need to show that the actions of the defendants were not lawful under either title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act or the foreign intelligence surveillance act the bush administrations theory of inherent wiretapping ability might need to be litigated additionally the applicability of the state secrets privilege to these cases might be the subject of litigation as enacted the fisa amendments act lays out procedure for the attorney general to bring about the dis missal of lawsuits alleging unlawful participation in the terrorist surveillance program tsp in order for suit to be dismissed by court the attorney general must certify that the defendant provided assistance in connection with the tsp and was given written assurances that the program was authorized by the president and determined to be lawful the attorney general could also certify that the alleged assistance was not in fact provided by the

terrorist surveillance program in late 2005 the new york times reported that the fe deral government had monitored the internationa l telephone calls and intern ational email messages of hundreds perhaps thousands of people in the united states without warrants2 subsequently president bush acknowledged that after the attacks of september 11 2001 he had authorized the national security agency to intercept international communications into and out of the united st ates by persons linked to qaeda or related terrorist organiza tions based upon his constitu tional authority to conduct warrantless wartime electronic surveillance of the enemy3 the revelation of the existence of the tsp aroused controversy because it appeared to run afoul of the general rule4 that electronic

military force aumf enacted by congress in 20017 on jan 17 2007 letter from the attorney general to congress indicated that any electronic surveillance that was occurring as part of the terrorist surveillance program would be conducted subject to the approval of the foreign intelligence surveillance court now discontinued the tsp appears to have been active from shortly after september 11 2001 to sometime in january of 20078 dozens of lawsuits have been filed by private citizens and interest groups alleging various statutory and constitutional violations by the telecommunications companies that participated in the tsp9 the debate over retroactive immunity is of central importance to these cases as it would likely render any litigation of the underlying legal issues moot10 on august 2 2007 the director of national intelligence dni stated that those who assist the government in protecting us from harm must be protected from liability specifically those who are alleged to have assisted the government after septembe r 11 2001 and have helped keep the country safe11 proponents of retroactive immunity also argued that without the telecommunications provide rs voluntary cooperation it foreign intelligence gathering is much harder and we get much less information12 on the other hand opponents of retroactive immunity pointed out that retroactive immunity strips

examine how covered lawsuit might proceed in the absence of retroactive immunity without retroactive immunity many legal issues would need to be addressed possibly at great expense in order to resolve these cases the plainti ffs would need to show that the actions of the defendants were not lawful under the ws in effect when the tsp was active the bush administrations theory of inherent wiretapping ability might be litigated additionally the applicability of the state secrets privilege could also be the subject of litigation each of these issues is discussed below lawfulness under the fisa and title iii as general principle if electronic surveillance is likely to result in the acquisition of communications to or fro m someone in the united states such surveillance may not be conducted unless sanctioned by court order15 federal law provides two statutory frameworks for obt aining warrants to conduct electronic surveillance title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act and fisa title iii authorizes electronic surve illance in the context of law enforcement while fisa authorizes electronic surveillance in the context of gathering foreign intelligence both title iii and fisa also provide prospective civil immunity for individuals that assist or conduct electronic surveillance under the auspices of either statutory framework16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34600crs4 16

for these propositions is beyond the scope of this report21 however one should note th at the question would require reconciling the assertions of the bush admin istration with the legislative history and statutory text of fisa and title iii which identify those statutes as the exclusive means of conducting electronic surveillance22 here it is sufficient to note that it is an issue that would likely require extensive litigation in order to be resolved the state secrets privilege in some cases the confidential subject matter of suit may prevent court from hearing it under the judicially created state secrets privilege public policy forbids the maintenance of any suit the trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential23 insofar as many of the details of the tsp remain classified it is likely that the state secrets privilege would be central to the disposition of th suits against teleco mmunications providers discussed above the state secrets privilege is held by the government meaning that only the government can assert it to preclude litigation24 if claimed by the federal government the effect of the state secrets privilege can range from the exclusion of certain information from discovery or admission at trial to the complete dismissal of civil action25 for example in totten v united states former spy brought suit to enforce secret contract with the federal government for espionage services ultimately in that case the supreme court held that the subject of litigation namely the contract for espionage was itself secret and any litigation on that subject was barred26 in other circumstances the state secrets privilege applies only to certain items of evidence rather than to the subject of litigation at large in halkin v helms the dc circuit was confronted with claim of privilege regarding the nsas alleged interception of international communica tions to and from persons who had been targeted by the cia27 after deciding that the claim of privilege was valid the court of appeals affirmed the protection of that information from discovery whilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34600crs6 28

privileged information the plaintiffs w ould not be able to make prima facie case similar result may occur if the state secrets privilege requires the exclusion of evidence central to defendants case in molerio v federal bureau of investigation job seeker alleged that the fb i had disqualified him based upon his fathers political ties to socialist organizations in violation of his fathers first amendment rights29 in response the fbi asserted that it had lawful reason to disqualify the plaintiff but claimed that its reason was protected by the state secrets privilege after reviewing the fbis claim in camera the dc circuit agreed that the evidence of nondiscriminatory reason was protected and that its exclusion would deprive the fbi of valid defense therefore the dismissal of that action was required30 although it is not possible to accurately determine whether the state secrets privilege would necessitate dismissal of the telecommunications cases discussed above several courts pres ented with lawsuits rega rding the tsp have issued preliminary rulings regarding the applicability of the state secrets privilege in hepting v att the district court was presen ted with an assertion of the state secrets privilege31 the court first examined whether the information requested was actually secret given the amount of media publicity regarding the tsp and public statements made by the bush administration and the defendant32 while the specifics of the tsp may remain classified the court noted that the general subject of the litigation specifically that such prog ram existed at all was longer secret given the admissions made by the governme nt and the defendant therefore this case was distinguishable from totten and dismissal of the case at the outset of litigation was inappropriate33 while the privilege may limit the plaintiffs discovery efforts or the defendants asse rtion of defense at late r date the court declined to rule on whether that would u ltimately necessita dismissal34 fisa may preempt the state secrets privilege in in re national security agency telecommunications records litigation the court considered 50 usc 1806f which mandates

constitutional origin37 the court did not preclude assertion of the privile ge where fisa did not apply38 in the case before it the plaintiffs had yet to show sta nding as aggrieved persons under fisa therefore the court continued to bar th privileged information but only until the plaintiffs had the opportunity to show th rough other evidence whether they are aggrieved persons39 retroactive immunity under the fisa amendments act of 2008 title ii of the fisa amendments act lays out procedure for the attorney general to seek the dismissal of lawsuits alleging unlawful participation in the tsp by telecommunications providers the pro cess begins when the attorney general certifies to the court where the lawsuit is pending two fundamental facts regarding the defendants alleged assistance first the assistance must have been given in connection with the tsp between ptember 11 2001 and january 17 2007 second the defendant must have been gi ven written assurances that the tsp was authorized by the president and determined to be lawful alternatively the attorney general can certify that the alleged assistance was not in fact provided by the defendant all parties are permitted to submit documents and arguments which the court may consider and dismissal is required if the cour t finds based upon its review that the certification was suppor ted by substantial evidence what constitutes substantial evidence is discussed in the section below regarding standards of review alternative retroactive immunity proposals before the passage of hr 6304 by the senate that body had previously included retroactive immunity for telecomm unications providers in its amendment to hr 3773 additionally three amendments were proposed to hr 6304 that would have modified the retroactive

immunity in that bill and the proposed amendments senate amendment to hr 3773 in february of 2008 the nate passed an amendment in the nature of substitute to hr 3773 like hr 6304 this senate amendment would have required courts to dismiss lawsuits against telecommunications providers if sufficient grounds for dismissal were certified to the court by the attorney general40 with respect to the lawsuits alleging assist ance provided under the tsp the grounds for dismissal were identical to those requi red under hr 6304 but hr 3773 did not provide means for others to submit arguments or documents in opposition to dismissal and certifications would only be subject to review for an abuse of discretion41 what qualifies as an abuse of di scretion is discussed in the section below regarding standards of review proposed amendments to hr 6304 three amendments offering variations on the retroactive immunity mechanism were introduced in the senate during the debate over hr 6304 but were not adopted samdt 5059 introduced by senator specter samdt 5059 would have added second component to courts re view of certification by the attorney general under this amendment dismissa l would not be appropr iate if the court determined that the underl ying intelligence activity that the defendant had participated in was uncons titutional because this would have been legal determination the court w ould have been permitted to address this question novo without relying upon or giving deference to any interpretations of the constitution made by the attorney general in the certification or elsewhere samdt 5060 introduced by senator whitehouse samdt 5060 would have required that the attorney general add itionally certify that the defendant had provided assistance based on good faith and reasonable belief that its conduct was lawful like the rest of the certifica tion this finding would have needed to be supported by substantial evidence in order to result in dismissal samdt 5066 introduced by senator bingaman samdt 5066 would have left the certification mechanism of hr 6304 in place but would have delayed certification by the attorney general in cases involving the tsp until 90 days after the inspectors general of various intelligence and national security agencies had reviewed the tsp and submitted comprehensive report to congress detailing their findings additionally all tsp lawsuits would have been stayed during this time the review and report are still mandated by separate provision of hr 6304 301httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34600crs9 and are required to be comple ted within one year of the date of enactment but does not require any tsp lawsuits to be stayed comparison of retroactive immunity provisions timing of certifications although alternative proposals to re troactive immunity followed the same general procedure as the fisa am endments act with respect to how and by whom certification is made the question of when certification is made may vary substantially generally the certification woul d appear to be permissible at any stage of litigation before final judgment note however that the act requires certifications to be made to the court in which the action is pending that clause could possibly be read to disallow certifications in antic ipation of any litigation in contrast the senate amendment to hr 3773 did not ppear to contain such language the import of this difference may be magnified as change in administration is imminent this may create the possibility that under the law as passed potential plaintiff could forestall filing suit in th hope that new administration opposed to retroactive immunity would take office if anticipatory certifications are not permitted because action is pending suits filed after the administration changes could still be dismissed but only at the discretion of newly appointed attorney general similarly the delay proposed by samdt 5066 also raised the possibility that change in administration could have affected the certification of lawsuit alleging that participation in the tsp was unlaw ful samdt 5066 would have disallowed certifications until 90 days after report detailing the specifics of the tsp is received by congress depending upon how long it actually took for that report to be completed certifications might not have been permissible until some time after the current administration had left office standards of review the senate amendment to hr 3773 would have instructed the court to review certifications using an abuse of discretion standard in contrast the enacted fisa amendments act requires certif ications to be supported by substantial evidence two important characteristics of any standard of review are the level of scrutiny given and the scope of the universe in which such review takes place an analysis of each standard of review and its potentia l effect on the pending litigation at issue is discussed below abuse of discretion in the judicial context appellate courts commonly review discretionary rulings of lower cour ts under an abuse of discretion standard for example federal trial judges decision to exclude evidence because it is unfairly prejudicial is reversible error only if the tr ial court made an erro r of law or acted inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34600crs10 42 see eg republic of the phil v pimentel 128 s ct 2180

1977 46 id at 416an unprincipled arbitrar or irrational manner42 in the words of the supreme court it is deference that is the hallmark of abuse of discretion review43 but the senate amendment to hr 3773 deals with judicial review of the actions of an executive branch official name ly the attorney general therefore an examination of the standards for judicial review of administrative action under the administrative procedure act apa may be more illustrative than comparisons to review of actions by lower courts unless specifically excluded from review by statute the apa authorizes courts to set aside agency actions that are arbitrary capricious or an abuse of discretion 44 the supreme court of the united states had the opportunity to expound upon the meaning of this standard in citizens to preserve overton park inc v volpe case involving challenge to the construction of highway through public park45 the court held that this standard of review required the reviewing court to consider whether the decision was based upon consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been cl ear error of judgment although this inquiry into the facts is to be search ing and careful the ultimate standard of review is narrow one the court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency46 therefore in the case of certifications by the attorney general court reviewing for an abuse of discretion w ould have likely examined the attorney generals consideration of the assistance provi ded by the defendants the types of representations made by intelligence officials concurrently with requests for assistance and the facts surrounding any ot her findings required by the certification note that the senate amendment to h r 3773 did not indicate what record if any the court would be able to review in gauging the propriety of the attorney generals certification th only documentation the atto rney general would have been required to present is the certifica tion itself and other provision would have allowed opposing parties to pr esent contradictory eviden ce or arguments because of these limitations it is not clear on what ba sis if any cour t could have found certification under hr 3773 to be an abuse of discretion substantial evidence in contrast substantial evidence is standard of review frequently used by courts to review formal findings of fact by federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34600crs11 47 in overton park the supreme court remarked that substantial evidence review was not appropriate because the agency had not taken undertaken formal

ssenting asserting that substantial evidence is more stringent but is ultimately deferential standard 51 universal camera v nlrb 340 us 474 1951 emphasis addedagencies47 it is less stringent than novo review which would allow court to look at the evidence anew and come to its own conclusions nevertheless the supreme court has described substantial evidence as requiring more than mere scintilla of support and comparable to the sta ndard trial judge must meet to sustain jurys verdict48 in the federal courts jury verdict will not be disturbed if reasonable and fairminded persons in ex ercise of impartial judgment might have come to the same conclusion as the jury49 therefore under the substantial evidence test if court reviewing an attorney generals certification under the fisa amendments act found that an objectively reasonable person could conclude that the facts in the certification were true the court would be required to dismiss the suit in the administrative context substantial evidence review and abuse of discretion review occur in factually distinct circumstances substantial evidence is required when an agency engages in either formal rulemaking or an adjudicatory hearing in contrast abuse of discretion pplies in cases of informal rulemaking and decisions therefore it may be difficult to directly compare the two standards in terms of stringency although some courts appear to consider substantial evidence more demanding standard than abuse of discretion the consistent theme of both standards is that the court is not free to substitute its judgment in place of the agencys50 however any apparent similarity between the level of deference afforded by reviewing court under either st andard should not overshadow important differences in the scope of the record available to the court the scope of the record viewed by the court is critical factor affecting the search for substan tial evidence in universal camera v national labor relations board the supreme court interpreted the tafthartley acts use of the phrase substantial evidence on the record considered as whole 51 previous version of the act stated only that findings by the national labor relations board be supported by evidence and had been read by some courts to mean that if any evidence exists to support the agencys findings then they are valid regardless of what contradictory evidence also exists but in universal camera the supreme court found that the addition of the phrase on the record considered as whole indicated that congress intended courts to review agency findings of fact based

certifications briefs and arguments submitted by all pa rties when determining if substantial evidence supports the certification one could reasonably concl ude that the availab ility of contradictory evidence would indicate the intent to apply the more stringent universal camera definition of substantial evidence on the other hand the text of the act may not require the court to consider extraneous material53 therefore as compared with the nate amendment to hr 3773 the fisa amendments act provides the possibility of broader factual record in which to conduct judicial review of certification by the attorney general but may leave much of the discretion to view that record to the court itself under the fisa amendments act it seems possible that court could lawfully dismiss case upon certification by the attorney general if the court finds the substantial evidence standard is satisfied after looking only at the information provided by the attorney general
