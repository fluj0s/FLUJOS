wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30719 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rl30719 broadband internet access and the digital divide federal assistance programs lennard g kruger specialist in science and technology policy angele gilroy specialist in telecommunications policy january 15 2009 abstract it is expected that the obama administration will ultimately develop national broadband policy or strategy that will seek to reduce or eliminate the digital divide with respect to broadband it is likely that elements of national broadband policy in tandem with broadband investment measures in the american recovery and reinvestment stimulus package will signiﬁcantly shape and possibly expand federal policies and programs to promote broadband deployment and adoption key issue is how to strike balance between providing federal assistance for unserved and underserved areas where the private sector may not be providing acceptable levels of broadband service while at the same time minimizing any deleterious eﬀects that government intervention in the marketplace may have on competition and private sector investmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30719g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

characterize gap between information haves and havenots or in other words between those americans who use or have access to telecommunications technologies eg telephones computers the internet and those who do not one important subset of the digital divide debate concerns highspeed internet access and advanced telecommunications services also known as broadband broadband is provided by series of technologies eg cable telephone wire fiber satellite wireless that give users the ability to send and receive data at volumes and speeds far greater than traditional dialup internet access over telephone lines broadband technologies are currently being deployed primarily by the private sector throughout the united states while the numbers of new broadband subscribers continue to grow studies and data suggest that the rate of broadband deployment in urban and high income areas are outpacing deployment in rural and lowincome areas some policymakers believing that disparities in broadband access across american society could have adverse economic and social consequences on those left behind assert that the federal government should play more active role to avoid digital divide in broadband access one approa ch is for the federal government to provide financial assistance to support broadband deploy ment in unserved and underserved areas legislation introduced in the 110 th congress sought to provide federal financial assistance for broadband deployment in the form of grants loans subsidies and tax credits of particular note was the reauthorization and reform of the rural utilities service broadband loan program which was enacted as part of the 2008 farm bill pl 110234 also enacted was the broadband data improvement act pl 110385 which requires the department of commerce to provide grants supporting state broadband initiatives on january 21 2009 the house appropriations committee approved legislative language for the spending portion of the economic stimulus pack age american recovery and reinvestment bill of 2009 the legislation would provide 6 bi llion to support deployment of broadband and wireless services in rural unserved and underserved areas of the nation of the total 2825 billion would be provided to the rural utilities service rus of the department of agriculture and 3175 billion to the national telecommunications and information administration of the department of commerce meanwhile it is expected that the obama administration will ultimately develop national broadband policy or strategy that will seek to reduce or eliminate the digital divide with respect to broadband it is likely that elements of national broadband policy in tandem with broadband investment measures in the american recove ry and reinvestment stimulus package will significantly shape and possibly expand federal policies and programs to promote broadband deployment and adoption key issue is how to strike balance between providing federal assistance

telephones computers the internet and those who do not1 whether or not individuals or communities fall into the information haves category depends on number of factors ranging from the presence of computers in the home to training and education to the availability of affordable internet access broadband technologies are currently being deployed primarily by the private sector throughout the

g21g157g138g157g142g156g561 prior to the late 1990s american homes accessed the internet at maximum speeds of 56 kilobits per second by dialing up an internet service provider such as aol over the same copper telephone line used for traditional voice service relatively small number of businesses and institutions used broadband or high speed c onnections through the installation of special dedicated lines typically provided by their local telephone company starting in the late 1990s cable television companies began offering cable modem broadband service to homes and businesses this was accompanied by telephone companies beginning to offer dsl service broadband over existing copper telephone wireline growth has been steep rising from 28 million high speed lines reported as of december 1999 to 1212 million lines as of december 31 2007 of the 1212 million high speed lines reported by the fcc 740 million serve residential users 2 since the deployment of residential broadband in the united states the primary residential broadband technologies deployed continue to be cable modem and dsl distinction is often made between current generation and next generation broadband commonly referred to as next generation networks or ngn current generation typically refers to currently deployed cable dsl and many wireless systems while next generation refers to dramatically faster download and upload speeds offered by fiber technologies and also potentially by future generations of cable dsl and wireless technologies 3 in general the greater the download and 1 the term digital divide can also refer to internationa l disparities in access to information technology this report focuses on domestic issues only 2 fcc highspeed services for internet access status as of

lines as over 200 kilobits per second kbps in at least one direction which was roughly four times the speed of conventional dialup internet access in recent years the 200 kbps threshold was considered too low and on march 19 2008 the fcc adopted report and order fcc 0889 establishing new categories of broadband speed tiers for data collection continued

and potentially valuable the application that is enabled december 2008 survey data from the pew internet and american life project found that 57 of americans have broadband at home4 it is estimated that less than 10 of us households have access to any broadband provider whatsoever not including satellite5 while the broadband adoption or penetration rate stands at close to 60 of us households broadband availability is much higher at more than 90 of households thus approximately 30 of households have access to some type of terrestrial nonsatellite broadband service but do not choose to subscribe according to the fcc possible reasons for the gap between broadband availability and subscribership include the lack of computers in some homes price of broadband service lack of content and the availability of broadband at work6 according to pew nonbroadband users tend to be older have lower incomes have trouble using technology and may not see the relevance of using the internet to their lives between 2007 and 2008 low income americans under 20000 annual income and african americans showed significant growth in home broadband adoption after strong growth in previous years7 pew also found that about onethird of adults without broadband cite price and availability as the reasons why they dont have broadband in their homes while twothirds cite reasons such as usability and relevance8 g4g155g152g138g141g139g138g151g141g561g146g151g561g20g158g155g138g149g561g138g151g141g561g23g151g141g142g155g156g142g155g159g142g141g561g3g155g142g138g156g351g561 while the number of new broadband subscribers continues to grow the rate of broadband deployment in urban and high income areas appear s to be outpacing deployment in rural and low income areas while there are many examples of rural communities with state of the art telecommunications facilities 10 recent surveys and studies have indicated that in general rural areas tend to lag behind urban and suburban area s in broadband deployment data 2008 from the pew internet american life project indicate that while broadband adoption is growing in urban suburban and rural areas broadband users make up larger percentages of urban and continued purposes specifically 200 kbps to 768 kbps will be considered first generation 768 kbps to 15 mbps as basic broadband tier 1 and increasingly higher speed tiers as broadband tiers 2 through 7 tier seven is greater than or equal to 100 mbps in any one direction tiers can change as technology advances 4 horrigan john pew internet american life project barriers to

all us adults with broadband at home is 60 for suburban areas 57 for urban areas and 38 for rural areas11 similarly according to the latest fcc data on the deployment of highspeed internet connections released january 2009 highspeed subscribers were reported in 99 of the most densely populated zip codes as opposed to 90 of zip codes with the lowest population densities for zip codes ranked by median family income highspeed subscribers were reported present in 99 of the top onetenth of zip codes as compared to 92 of the bottom onetenth of zip codes 12 the comparatively lower population density of rural areas is likely the major reason why broadband is less deployed than in more highly populated suburban and urban areas particularly for wireline broadband technologiessuch as cable modem and dslthe greater the geographical distances among customers the larger the cost to serve those customers thus there is often less incentive for companies to invest in broadband in rural areas than for example in an urban area where there is more demand more customers with perhaps higher incomes and less cost to wire the market area 13 some policymakers believe that disparities in broadband access across american society could have adverse consequences on those left behind and that advanced internet applications critical for businesses and consumers to engage in ecommerce are increasingly dependent on high speed broadband connections to the internet thus some say communities and individuals without access to broadband could be at risk to the extent that ecommerce becomes critical factor in determining future economic development and prosperity february 2006 study done by the massachusetts institute of technology for the economic development administration of the department of commerce marked the first attempt to quantitatively measure the impact of broadband on economic growth the study found that between 1998 and 2002 communities in which massmarket broadband was available by december 1999 experienced more rapid growth in employment the number of businesses overall and businesses in itintensive sectors relative to comparable communities without broadband at that time 14 subsequently june 2007 report from the brookings institution found that for every one percentage point increase in broadband penetration in state employment is projected to increase by 02 to 03 per year for the entire us private nonfarm economy the study projected an increase of about 300000 jobs 15 some also argue that broadband is an important contributor to us future economic strength with respect to the rest of the world according to the international telecommunications union the 11 horrigan john b pew internet american life project home broadband adoption 2008

hindrance to broadband deployment because it is more expensive to deploy broadband technologies in mountainous or heavily forested area an additional added cost factor for remote areas can be the expense of backhaul eg the middle mile which refers to the installation of dedicated line which transmits signal to and from an internet backbone which is typically located in or near an urban area 14

100 inhabitants in 200716 data from the organization for economic coope ration and development oecd found the us ranking 15th among oecd nations in broadband access per 100 inhabitants as of december 200717 by contrast in 2001 an oecd study found the us ranking 4th in broadband subscribership per 100 inhabitants after korea sweden and canada18 while many argue that the us declining performance in international broadband rankings is cause for concern19 others maintain that the oecd and itu da ta undercount us broadband deployment20 and that crosscountry broadband deployment comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and inherently problematic21 finally an issue related to international broadband rankings is the extent to which broadband speeds and prices differ between the us and the rest of the world22 g11g156g561g4g155g152g138g141g139g138g151g141g561g6g142g153g149g152g162g150g142g151g157g561g6g138g157g138g561g3g141g142g154g158g138g157g142g501g561 obtaining an accurate snapshot of the status of broadband deployment is problematic anecdotes abound of rural and lowincome areas which do not have adequate internet access as well as those which are receiving access to highspeed

underserved markets by requiring broadband providers to provide more information on the speed and nature of their service and by establishing broadbandoverpower line as separate category in order to track its development and deployment the fcc form 477 data gathering program was extended for five years beyond its march 2005 expiration date 24 the government accountability office gao has cited concerns about the fccs zipcode level data of particular concern is that the fcc will report broadband service in zip code even if company reports service to only one subscriber which in turn can lead to some observers overstating broadband deployment according to gao the data may not provide highly accurate depiction of local deployment of broadband infrastructures for residential service especially in rural areas the fcc has acknowledged the limitations in its zip code level data 25 on april 16 2007 the fcc announced notice of proposed rulemaking which sought comment on number of

federal government should intervene to prevent digital divide in broadband access section 706 requires the fcc to determine whether advanced telecommunications capability ie broadband or highspeed access is being deployed to all americans in reasonable and timely fashion if this is not the case the act directs the fcc to take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market since 1999 the fcc has issued and adopted five reports pursuant to section 706 all five reports formally concluded that the deployment of advanced telecommunications capability to all americans is reasonable and timely the fifth and most recent 706 report was adopted on march 19 2008 and released on june 12 2008 29 two fcc commissioners michael copps and jonathan adelstein have repeatedly dissented from the reports conclusions that broadband deployment is reasonable and timely arguing that the relatively poor world ranking of united states broadband penetration indicates that deploy ment is insufficient that the fccs definition of broadband as 200 kilobits per second was outda ted and not comparable to the much higher speeds available to consumers in other countries that the use of zip code data measuring the presence of at least one broadband subscriber within zip code area did not sufficiently characterize the availability of broadband across geographic areas and that broadband deployment is impeded by the lack of comprehensive national broadband policy30 28 testimony

marketplace and general tax policies intended to foster overall economic growth on march 26 2004 president bush endorsed goal of universal broadband access by 2007 and on april 26 2004 announced broadband initiative which included promoting legislation which would permanently prohibit all broadband taxes making spectrum available for wireless broadband and creating technical standards for broadband over power lines and simplifying rightsofway processes on federal lands for broadband providers 31 subsequently on january 31 2008 ntia released report entitled networked nation broadband in america 2007 which characterized the bush administrations broadband initiative as follows from its first days the administration has implemented comprehensive and integrated package of technology regulatory and fiscal policies designed to lower barriers and create an environment in which broadband innovation and competition can flourish 32 the bush administration broadband policy embraced the view that minimum of government intervention would create an economic climate favorable to private sector investment in the broadband market according to ntia the report showed that the administrations technology regulatory and fiscal policies have stimulated innovation and competition and encouraged investment in the us broadband market contributing to significantly increased accessibility of broadband services33 during the 110th congress some policymakers disagreed with the bush administrations assessment and asserted that the federal government should play more active role to avoid digital divide in broadband access bills were introduced seeking to provide federal financial assistance for broadband deployment in the form of grants loans subsidies andor tax credits

innovation that includes policy proposals intended to result in full broadband penetration and deployment of next generation broadband specifically policy proposals include redefining broadband at speeds demanded by 21st century business and communications reforming universal service to support affordable broadband specifically focusing on unserved communities creating incentives for more efficient use of government spectrum and new standards for commercial spectrum to bring affordable broadband to rural communities ensuring that schools libraries and hospitals have access to nextgeneration networks and that adequate training and resources are available to enable these institutions to take full advantage of broadband connectivity and encouraging publicprivate partnerships at the local level that result in broadband to unserved communities35 it is likely that these and other potential elements of national broadband policy in tandem with broadband investment measures in the american recovery and reinvestment stimulus package will significantly shape and possibly expand federal policies and programs to promote broadband deployment and adoption

community connect broadband grants both at the rural utilities service of the us department of agriculture are currently the only federal programs exclusively dedicated to deploying broadband infrastructure however there exist other federal programs that provide financial assistance for various aspects of telecommunications development the major vehicle for funding telecommunications development particularly in rural and lowinco areas is the universal service fund usf while the usfs high cost program does not explicitly fund broadband infrastructure subsidies are used in many cases to upgrade existing telephone networks so that they are capable of delivering highspeed services additionally subsidies provided by usfs schools and libraries program and rural health care

as originally designed called for the establishment of policies to ensure that telecommunications services are available to all americans including those in rural insular and high cost areas by ensuring that rates remain affordable over the years this concept fostered the development of various fcc policies and programs to meet this goal the fcc offers 36 the section on universal service was

target both providers of and subscribers to telecommunications services38 the development of the federal universal service high cost fund is an example of provider targeted support under the high cost fund eligible telecommunications carriers usually those serving rural insular and high cost areas are able to obtain funds to help offset the higher than average costs of providing telephone service39 this mechanism has been particularly important to rural america where the lack of subscriber density leads to significant costs fcc universal service policies have also been expanded to target individual users such federal programs include two incomebased programs link up and lifeline established in the mid1980s to assist economically needy individuals the link up program assists lowincome subscribers pay the costs associated with the initiation of telephone service and the lifeline program assists lowincome subscribers pay the recurring monthly service charges funding to assist carriers providing service to individuals with speech andor hearing disabilities is also provided through the telecommunications relay service fund effective january 1 1998 schools libraries and rural health care providers also qualified for universal service support

whether access to advanced telecommunications services ie broadband should be incorporated into universal service objectives the term universal service when applied to telecommunications refers to the ability to make available basket of telecommunications services to the public across the nation at reasonable price as directed in the 1996 telecommunications act section 254c federalstate joint board was tasked with defining the services which should be included in the basket of services to be eligible for federal universal service support in effect using and defining the term universal service for the first time the joint boards recommendation which was subsequently adopted by the fcc in may 1997 included the following in its universal service package voice grade access to and some usage of the public switched network single line service dual tone signaling access to directory assistance emergency service such as 911 operator services access and interexchange long distance service some policy makers expressed concern that the fccadopted definition is too limited and does not take into consideration the importance and growing acceptance of advanced services such as broadband and internet access they point to number of provisions contained in the universal service section of the 1996 act to support their claim universal service principles contained in section 254b2 state that access to advanced telecommunications services should be provided to all regions of the nation the subsequent principle b3 calls for consumers in all regions of the nation including lowincome and those in rural insular and high cost areas to have access to telecommunications and information services including advanced services at comparable level and comparable rate charged for similar services in urban areas such provisions they state dictate that the fcc expand its universal service definition others caution that more modest approach is appropriate given the universal mandate associated with this definition and the uncertainty and costs associated with mandating nationwide deployment of such advanced services as universal service policy goal furthermore they state the 1996 act does take into consideration the changing nature of the telecommunications sector and allows for the universal service definition to be modified if future conditions warrant section 254cof the act states that universal service is an evolving level of telecommunications services and the fcc is tasked with periodically reevaluating this definition taking into account advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services furthermore the joint board is given specific authority to recommend from time to time to the fcc modification in the definition of the services to be included for federal universal service support the joint board on november 19 2007 concluded such an inquiry and recommended that the fcc change the mix of services eligible for universal service support the joint board recommended among other things that the universal availability of broadband internet services be included in the nations communications goals and hence be supported by federal universal service funds 43 in response to the joint board recommendation the fcc on january 29 2008 released three notices of proposed rulemaking dealing with specific aspects of universal service including an examination of the scope of the definition the fcc is still 43 the joint board recommended that the definition of those services that qualify for universal service support be expanded and that the nations communications goals includ the universal availability of mobility services ie wireless voice broadband internet services and voice services at affordable and comparable rates for all rural and nonrural areas for copy of this recommendation see httphraunfossfccgovedocs_publicattachmatchfcc07j 4a1pdf

balance between providing federal assistance for unserved and underserved areas where the private sector may not be providing acceptable levels of broadband service while at the same time minimizing any deleterious effects that government intervention in the marketplace may have on competition and private sector investment in addition to loans loan guarantees and grants for broadband infrastructure deployment wide array of policy instruments are available to policymakers including tax incentives to encourage private sector deployment broadband bonds demandside incentives such as assistance to low income families for purchasing computers regulatory and deregulatory measures and spectrum policy to spur rollout of wireless broadband services in assessing federal incentives for broadband deployment congress will likely consider the appropriate mix of broadband deployment incentives to create jobs in the short and long term the extent to which incen tives should target nextgeneration broadband technologies the extent to which underserved areas with existing broadband providers should receive federal assistance and how broadband stimulus measures might fit into the context of overall goals for national broadband policy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30719 g561 g5g20g21g556g344g345g561t able 1 selected f ederal domestic assistance pr ograms related to t
