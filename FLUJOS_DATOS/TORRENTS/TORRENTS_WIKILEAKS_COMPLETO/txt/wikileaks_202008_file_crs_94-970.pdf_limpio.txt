federal agencies updated june 20 2008 henry cohen legislative attorney american law divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970awards of attorneys fees by federal courts and federal agencies summary in the united states the general rule which derives from common law is that each side in legal proceeding pays for its own attorney there are many exceptions however in which federal courts and occas ionally federal agencies may order the losing party to pay the attorneys fees of the prevailing party the major common law exception authorizes federal courts not agencies to order losing party that acts in bad faith to pay the prevailing partys fees there are also roughly two hundred stat utory exceptions which were generally enacted to encourage private litigation to implement public policy awards of attorneys fees are often designed to help to equalize contests between private individual plaintiffs and cor porate or governmental defenda nts thus attorneys fees provisions are most often found in civ il rights environmental protection and consumer protection statutes in addition the equal access to justi ce act eaja makes the united states liable for attorneys fees of up to 125 per hour in many court cases and administrative proceedings that it loses and some that it wins and fails to prove that its position was substantially justified eaja does not apply in tax cases but similar

federal agencies i introduction the american rule and its exceptions in the united states the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect reasonable attorneys fee from the loser alyeska pipeline service co v wilderness society 421 us 240 247 1975 this is known as the american rule as opposed to the eng lish rule which routinely permits feeshifting and derives from courtmade law it s however numerous statutor exceptions listed at the back of this report some if not most of which congress enacted in order to encourage private litigation to implement public policy id at 263 under these exceptions federal court and sometimes federal agency may order the losing party to lawsuit to pay the winning part ys attorneys fees although attorneys fees generally are not recoverable cost of litigation absent explicit congressional authorization the absence of speci fic reference to attorneys fees is not dispositive if the statute otherwise evinces an intent to provide for such fees1 feeshifting has been proposed not only to encourage lawsuits but to discourage them especially tort suits the english loser pays rule was included in tort reform legislation proposed by the bush administration in 1992 and in the common sense legal reforms act which is part of the contract with america proposed by the republican house members in 19942 the american rule has two major common law exceptions instances when federal courts may award attorneys fees without statutory authorization the common benefit doctrine nd the bad faith doctrine3 these derive from the historichttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs2 3 continued sanction for the willful disobedience of court order chambers v nasco inc 501 us 32 45 1991 however this may be viewed as falling within the bad

chambers supra note 3 that the exercise of the inherent power of lower federal courts can be limited by statute or rule for these courts were cr eated by act of congress 501 us at 47 the supreme court was created by the constitution art iii 1 the court of appeals in horn wrote it is not yet settled whether some residuum of the courts supervisory power is so integral to the judicial function that it may not be regulated by congress or alternatively may only be regulated up to certain point 29 f3d at 760 n5 authority of the courts to do quity in particular situation4 this authority has been called the supervisory or inhe rent power of the federal courts5 federal courts may use this inherent pow er even in diversity cases which are cases arising under state law that are broug ht in federal court pursuant to 28 usc 1332 when the parties are citizens of differe nt states and the amount in controversy exceeds 50000 chambers v nasco inc 501 us 32 1991 in alyeska the court had written that in the ordinary diversity case where the state law does not run counter to valid federal statute or rule of court nd usually it will not state law denying the right to attorneys fees or giving right thereto which reflects substantial policy of the state should be followed 421 us at 259 n31 in chambers the court explained that this limitation applie s only to feeshifting rules that embody substantive policy such as statute which permits prevailing party in certain classes of litigation to recove r fees 501 us at 52 substantive policy of the state is not implicated by the assessment of attorneys fees as sanction for bad faith conduct before the cour t which involved disobedience of the courts orders and the attempt to defraud the court itself id at 5253 ii common law exceptions to the american rule common law exceptions to the american rule are unquestionably assertions of inherent power in the courts to allow atto rneys fees in particular situations unless forbidden by congress alyeska 421 us at 259 the two major exceptions are cases in which party at its own expens creates fund or achieves substantial benefit in which others shar and cases in which party acts in bad faith former third exception cases in which plaintiff acts as private attorney general in effectuating important public policy was eliminated by the supreme court in alyeska httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs3 common benefit doctrine in the absence of statutory prohibiti on the federal courts have authority to award attorneys fees from fund to party who having common interest with other persons maintains suit for the common benefit and at his own expense resulting in the creation or preservation of fund in which all those having the common interest share annotation 8 led2d 894 905 1963 this exception to the american rule does not shift the cost of attorneys fees to the losing party but rather to those who benefit from the suit the doctrine was originally conceived in trustees v greenough 105 us 527 1881 case against trustees of ten or eleven million acres of land who had collusively so ld hundreds of thousands of those acres at nominal prices one beneficiary after eleven years of litigation at his own expense recaptured the assets and presente d claim for reimbursement of attorneys fees the supreme court approved the award writing that if the complainant is not trustee he has at least acted the part of trustee in relation to the common interest id at 532 in mills v electric autolite co 396 us 375 392 1970 the supreme court held that under the common benefit doctrin there is requirement that the suit actually bring money into the court as pr erequisite to the c ourts power to order reimbursement of expenses mills was stockholders derivative suit type of case which the court noted may bring s ubstantial nonpec uniary benefits boeing co v van gemert 444 us 472 1980 was successful class action in which over 3 million in damages were awarded some class members collected their shares of the damages but others did not the district court invoking the common benefit doctrine ordere d that the plaintiffs attorneys be awarded their fees from the total amount of the judgment concl uding that it was equitable for all class members claiming and noncl aiming alike to bear pro rata share of the costs of producing the judgment in their favor the defendant objected to use of the unclaimed money for this purpose arguing that the ultimate disposition of the unclaimed money had not been decided bu t the supreme court affirmed the award of attorneys fees holding the commonfund doctrine as applied in this case is entirely consistent with the american rule against taxing the sing party with the victors attorneys fees boeing presently has interest in any part of the fund any right that boeing may establish to the return of th money eventually claimed is contingent on the failure of the absentee class memb ers to exercise their present rights of possession although boeing itself cannot be obliged to pay fees awarded to the class lawyers its latent claim against unclaimed money in the judgment fund may not defeat each class members equitable obligation to share the expenses of litigation id at 481482httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs4 6 nepera chemical inc v sealand service 794 f2d 688 701 dc cir 1986 7 see eg sanchez v rowe 870 f2d 291 295 5th cir 1989 we hold that the requisite bad faith may be found in partys c onduct in res ponse to substantive claim whether before or after the action is filed but it may not be based on partys conduct forming the basis for that substantive claim emphasis in original in shimman v international union of operating engineers 744 f2d 1226 1231 6th cir 1984 banc cert denied 469 us 1215 1985 the court wrote to allow an award of attorneys fees based on bad faith in the act underlying the substantive claim woul d not be consistent with the rationale behind the american rule regarding attorneys fees attorneys fees incurred while curing the original wrong are not compensable because they represent the cost of maintaining open access to an equitable system of justice atto rneys fees incurred as the result of bad faith in the conduct of the litigation however are co mpensable because such bad faith constitutes new wrong imposed upon the aggrieved partybad faith exception in hall v cole 412 us 1 5 1973 the supreme court wrote it is unquestioned that federal court may award counsel fees to successful party when his opponent has acted in ba d faith vexatiously wantonly or for oppressive reasons in this class of cases the underlying rationale of fee shifting is of course punitive and the ssential element in triggering the award of fees is therefore the existence of bad faith on the part of the unsuccessful litigant fee award under the bad faith excep tion requires subjective bad faith some proof of malice entirely apart from inferences arising from the possible frivolous character of particular claim copeland v martinez 603 f2d 981 991 dc cir 1979 cert denied 444 us 1044 1980 in hall v cole the supreme court wrote it is clear that bad faith may be found not only in the actions that led to the lawsuit but in the conduct of the litigation 412 us at 15 subsequently as another court wrot federal courts have applied the bad faith exception both when ba d faith occurred in connection with the litigation and when it was an aspect of the conduct that gave rise to the lawsuit6 however some courts have refused to apply th bad faith exception to partys underlying claim noting that the supreme courts statement in hall v cole had concerned the common benefit ex ception not the bad faith exception7 an attorney as well as party who acts in bad faith may be ordered to pay the attorneys fees of the opposing party in roadway express inc v piper 447 us 752 765767 1980 the supreme court held in narrowly defined circumstances federa l courts have inherent power to assess attorneys fees against counsel the power of court over members of its bar is at least as great as its authority over litigants if court may tax counsel fees against party who litigated in bad faith it certainly may assess those expenses against counsel who willfully abuse judici processes like other sanctions attorneys fees certainly should not be ssessed lightly or without fair notice and an opportunity for hearing on the record but in proper case such sanctions are within courts powershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs5 8 cases under 28 usc 1927 are discussed at 12 alr fed 910 other

durrett v jenkins brickyard inc 678 f2d 911 919 11th cir 1982 the court held that the court in roadway express intended to authorize the assessment of attorneys fees against counsel who ither willfully disobe yed court order or acted in bad faith vexatiously wa ntonly or for oppressive reasons in roadway express the supreme court also noted that under federal rule of civil procedure 37b bot h parties and counsel may be held personally liable for expenses including attorney s fees caused by the failure to comply with discovery orders 447 us at 763 the court also found that only excess costs not attorneys fees could be assessed under 28 usc 1927 which pr ovided that any attorney who so multiplies the proceedings in any case so as to increase costs unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the c ourts to satisfy personally such excess costs however the section soon after was amended by pl 96349 3 to permit awards of attorneys fees as we ll as excess costs against counsel8 private attorney general doctrine the private attorney general doctrin provides that plaintiff should be awarded attorneys fees when he has eff ectuated strong cong ressional policy which has benefited large class of people and where further the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award essential9 many of the statutory exceptions to the american rule are based on this concept in newman v piggie park enterprises inc 390 us 400 402 1968 the supreme court discussing one such exception wrote if successful plaintiffs were routinely fo rced to bear their own attorneys fees few aggrieved parties would be in position to advance the public interest by invoking the injunctive power of the fe deral courts congress therefore enacted the provision for counsel fees to courage individuals injured by racial discrimination to seek judicial relief under title ii 42 usc 2000a3b prior to the supreme courts decision in alyeska some lower fede ral courts had awarded attorneys fees under the private attorney general doctrine in suits brought under statutes that had feeshiftin g provisions thereby creating another courtmade exception to the american rule alyeska at 270 n 46 in alyeska however the court held congressional utilization of the private attorney general concept can in sense be construed as grant of authority to the judiciary to jettison the traditional rule against nonstatutory allowances to the prevailing party and to award attorneys fees whenever the c ourt deems the public policy furthered by particular statute important enough to warrant the award 421 us at 263httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs6 10 when enacted in 1976 this statute was codifi ed as the last sentence of 42 usc 1988 in 1991 pl 102166 113a made it separate

benefit exception gibson v davis 587 f2d 280 6th cir 1978 cert denied 441 us 905 1979 bad faith exceptionthe primary reasons the court gave for its decision were the difficulty for the courts without legislative guidance to c onsider some statutes important and some unimportant and the fact that the rational application of the privateattorneygeneral rule would immediately collide with th express provision of 28 usc 2412 which at the time prohibited fee awards against the united states except when specifically permitted by statute id at 263266 congress immediate response to alyeska was enactment of the civil rights attorneys fees awards act of 1976 42 u sc 1988b which is discussed at page 3310 congress has since enacted many more statutes that authorize awards of attorneys fees in specific situ ations but it has not reversed alyeska to grant courts the power to award attorneys fees to priv ate attorneys general in cases brought under statutes that do not provide for feeshifting iii the equal access to justice act awards of attorneys fees against the united states were barred at common law not only because of the american rule but also because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity under which the united states ma not be sued nor its funds expended without its consent congress alone has the power to waive or qualify that immunity11 and it did so with respect to awards of attorneys fees with the equal access to justice act eaja in 1980 prio r to enactment of eaja the common law exceptions to the american rule were inapplicable against the united states12 even statutory exceptions to the american rule were inapplicable against the united states unless they specifically authorized fee awards against the united states eaja allows awards of attorneys fees against the united states in two broad situations the first codified at 28 u sc 2412b makes th united states liable for the prevailing partys attorneys fees to the same extent that any other party would be under the common law and statutory excep tions to the american rule including the statutory exceptions that do not specifically authorize fee awards against the united states this provision unlike the re st of eaja contains limitations on the assets or number of employees of parties eligible to recover fees and maximum hourly rate for fee awards the second broad situation in which eaja authorizes fee awards against the united states is codified at 5 usc 504 and 28 usc 2412d these sectionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs7 13 the type of agency adjudication in which fees may be awarded is an adversary adjudication which is defined at 5 usc 504b1c in ardestani v immigration and naturalization service 502 us 129 1991 the supreme c ourt held that administrative deportation proceedings are not adversary adjudications in sullivan v hudson 490 us 877 891 1989 the supreme court held that fo r purposes of the eaja social security benefit proceedings are not adversarial within the meaning of 504b1c either initially or on remand from court however where court orders remand to the secretary of health and human services in benefits litigation and retains continuing jurisdiction over the case pending decision from the secretary which will determine the claimants entitlement to benefits the procee dings on remand are an integral part of the civil action for judicial review and thus ttorneys fees for representation on remand are available under 28 usc 2412d1a subj ect to the other limitations in the eaja id at 892 see 96 alr fed 336 social security cases also raise complications in applying eajas requirement that the prevailing party submit fee application within thirty days of the final judgment in the action 28 usc 2412d1b or within thirty days of final disposition in the adversary adjudication 5 usc 504a2 see melkonyan v sullivan 501 us 89 1991 shalala v scha efer 509 us 292 1993 14 eaja applies in all article iii courts see 28 usc 2412c and explicitly applies in two article i courts the court of federal claims and the united states court of veterans appeals 28 usc 2412d2f as for ot her article i courts it does not apply in tax court bowen v commissioner 706 f2d 1087 11th cir 1983 as for tax cases see ch viii of this report in add ition the circuits are divided about whether bankruptcy courts are courts of the united states and therefor have authority under eaja or 26 usc section 7430 in re cascade roads inc 34 f3d 756 767 n12 9th cir 1994 see charles r haywood the power of bankruptcy courts to shift fees under the equal access to justice act 61 university of chicago law review 985 1994 tort cases against the united states are brought under the federal to rt claims act ftca 28 usc 1346b 26712680 the ftca requires that prior to filin g suit claimant must first present his claim to the federal agency out of whose activities his claim arose if the claim is settled before suit is filed the claimants attorney may receive up to 20 percent of the settlement if it is not the claimants attorney may receive up to 25 percent of court award or settlement 28 usc 2678 see 86 alr fed 866 fee awards against the united states are not authorized by the ftca or by 28 usc 2412d they presumably may be awarded under the common law bad faith doctrine made applicable against the united states by 28 usc 2412b in sanchez v rowe 870 f2d 291 295 5th cir 1989 the court found lack of the requisite bad faith and th erefore did not reach the issue whether an award of attorneys fees would be barred by the ftca prohibition against punitive damages 28 usc 2674 subsequently however in molzof v united states 502 us 301 312 1992 the supreme court in differe nt context held that 2674 bars the recovery only of what are legally considered punitive damages under traditional common law principles emphasis in original 15 eaja does not specify which party has the burden of proof as to whether the position of the united states was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust continuedprovide that in specified agency adjudications13 and in all civil actions except tort actions and tax cases14 brought by or against the united states the united states shall be liable for the attorneys fees of prevailing parties unless it proves that its position was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs8 15 continued however the conference report to the original eaja states after prevailing party has submitted an application for an award the burde n of proving that fee award should not be made rests with the government hrept 961434 at 22 in addition in scarborough v principi 541 us 401 405 2004 the supreme cour t noted that the government may defeat this entitlement to fee award by showing that its position in the underlying litigation was substantially justified the position of the united states that the government must prove to have been substantially justified in order to avoid fee award includes both the conduct of the government in the proceeding itself and the action of the government that gave rise to the proc eeding 5 usc 504b1e 28 usc 2412d2d 16 these limitations are incorporated into p l 105119 1997 which authorizes awards of attorneys fees to prevailing criminal defendant s and is discussed in ch xvii of this report 17 the two exceptions are taxexempt organiza tions and agricultural cooperatives they may recover fees regardless of their net worth but apparently may not recover fees if they have more than 500 employees see 5 usc 504b1b 28 usc 2412d2b unification church v immigration natu ralization service 762 f2d 1077 dc cir 1985 this second portion of eaja contains two limitations on fee awards that are not found in 2412b16 first it prescribes fee cap unless the court or agency determines that special factor justifies higher fee most fee statutes authorize awards of reasonable fees with the cour t determining the amount the cap was originally 75 per hour but pl 104 121 231233 increased it to 125 per hour for cases commenced on or after the date of its enactment which was march 29 1996 second this portion of eaja does not allow with two exceptions fees to be awarded to individuals whose net wo rth exceeds 2 million or to businesses or organizations including units of local government with net worth exceeding 7 million or more than 500 employees17 this portion of eaja sunset by the terms of the original act on october 1 1984 in 1985 eaja was reenacted retroactive to october 1 1984 and made permanent pl 104121 in addition to raising th cap under eaja to 125 per hour added the following provision to 28 usc 2412d and corresponding one to 5 usc 504 applicable to adversary adjudications if in civil action brought by the ited states or proceeding for judicial review of an adversary adjudication described in section 504a4 of title 5 the demand by the united states other than recitation of the maximum statutory penalty is substantially in excess of the judgment finally obtained by the united states and is unreasonable when compared with such judgment under the facts and circumstances of the case the court shall award to the party the fees and other expenses related to defending against the excessive demand unless the party has committed willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad faith or special circumstances make an award unj ust fees and expenses awarded under this paragraph shall be paid only as consequence of appropriations provided in advance this provision thus authorizes fee awards in favor of losing parties and in that respect is unique in the law of attorneys feeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs9 18 hrept 99120 99th

three issues concerning eaja 1 the applicable standard of appella review 2 the meaning of substantially justified and 3 the special factors that allow court to award more than 75 per hour 1 standard of review pierce v underwood addressed the standard that federal court of appeals applies in review ing decision of fe deral district court under eaja either party may appeal district courts decision under eaja and as the supreme court explained for purposes of standard of review deci sions by judges are traditionally divided into three categories denominated questions of law reviewable novo questions of fact reviewable for clear error and matters of discretion reviewable for abuse of discretion 487 us at 558 the supreme court found that eaja did not provide clear prescription as to the appropriate standard of review unlike for example 42 usc 1988b which provides that the court in its disc retion may allow the prevailing party reasonable attorneys fee the court ther efore for variety of reasons held that the abuse of discretion sta ndard was most appr opriate for appeals of eaja court decisions awards of attorneys fees under eaja at the agency level may be appealed to court only by the prevailing party not by the united states the statute at 5 usc 504c2 provides the courts determination on any appeal heard under this paragraph shall be based solely on the factual record made before the agency the court may modify the determination of fees and ot her expenses only if the court finds that the failure to make an award of fees and other expenses or the calculation of the amount of the award was unsupported by substantial evidence prior to the 1985 amendments to eaja this provision stated that the court could modify an agency decision only if it found an abuse of discretion it was intended that the new standard uns upported by substantial evidence permit broader scope of review consistent with the normal sc ope of judicial review of agency actions18 2 substantially justified19 the united states may avoid liability for attorneys fees under eaja by proving that its position was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award

applied in civil rights action under 42 usc 1983 we can perceive reason for applying less stringent standard the plaintiffs action must be meritless in the sense that it is groundless or without

proceeding language as title vii the court held that 1988 b does not authorize awards of fees in 1983 administrative proceedings the basis for the different results in gaslight and webb was that under title vii administrativ proceedings are mandatory but under 1983 they are not and it is only mandatory proceedings that are brought to enforce federal civil rights statute because the plaintiff could have gone straight to court to assert hi s 1983 claim the court found that the school board proceedings in this case simply do not have the same integral function under 1983 that state administrative

this issue because it rejected fee award on different ground that an action solely to recover fee award is not an action to enforce title vi the court wrote the plain language of 1988 suggests the answer to the question of whether attorneys fees may be awarded in an independent action which is not to enforce any of the civil rights laws listed in 1988 the section states that in the action or proceeding to enforce the civil rights laws listed 42 usc 1981 1982 1983 1985 1986 title ix or title vi the court may award attorneys fees the case before us is not and was never an action to enforce any of these laws on its face 1988 does not authorize court to award attorneys fees except in an action to enforce the listed civil rights laws the legislative history of 1988 supports the plain import of the statutory language id at 12 this means that under all the statutes listed in 1988b party who prevails at the administrative level may not bring court action solely to recover fee award party who loses an administrative proceeding however and prevails on the merits in court may recover attorneys fees incurred at both the administrative and court levels he may recover fees incurred in an administrative proceeding in either of two situations if the proceeding was one to enforce the statute ie was mandatory or if discrete portion of the work product from the administrative proceedings was both useful and of type ordina rily necessary to advance the civil rights litigation id at 15 quoting webb 471 us at 243 the court in crest street acknowledged that in gaslight it had said that it would be anomalous to distinguish in this way between party who sues in court solely to recover fees after having prevailed at the administrative level and one who sues also on the merits in crest street however the court referred to this comment in gaslight as dicta id at 13 presumably because the plaintiff in gaslight had filed court action not solely to recover fees the court in crest street added moreover we now believe that the paradoxical nature of this result may have been exaggerated there are many types of behavior that may lead others to comply with civil rights laws for exam ple an employee after talking to his lawyer may choose to discuss hiring or promotion practices with an employer and as result of this discussion the employer may alter those practices to comply more fully with employment discrimination laws in some sense it mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs22 40 in slade for estate of slade v us postal service 952 f2d 357 361 10th cir 1991 the court wrote here plaintiffs claim for attorneys fees was brought pursuant to 2000e5k which provides for attorneys fees to the prevailing party in any action or proceeding under this subchapter 2000e the applicable statute here does not require that the federal court proceeding be brought to enforce emphasis supplied by the court the laws set forth in 2000e therefore crest street is not dispositive of the issue of jurisdiction in this case by jurisdiction the court meant subject ma tter jurisdiction to hear claim solely for attorneys feesbe considered anomalous that this employees initiative would not be awarded with attorneys fees but an award of attorneys fees under 1988 depends not only on the results obtained but also on wh at actions were needed to achieve those results it is entirely reasonable to limit the award of attorneys fees to those parties who in order to obtain relie f found it necessary to file complaint in court id at 14 the dissent in crest street apart from disagreeing with the majoritys interpretation of the language and the legislative history of 1988b argued that the effect of the decision would be to burden federal courts by cau sing parties who are not required to exhaust administrative remedies to immediately file suit in federal court to protect any possible claim for ttorneys fees should they subsequently prevail id at 21 in gaslight in fact the court had acknowledged that if fees were authorized only when the complain ant found an independent reason for suing in federal court under title vii such ground almost always could be found 447 us at 66 n6 thus crest street may have little practical import for title vii it may also be argued that the reasoning of crest street does not even apply to title vii although 1988b was modeled on the attorney s fees provision of title vii there is difference in their langua ge that may be rele vant section 1988b provides that court may award attorneys fees in any action or proceeding to enforce various civil rights statutes title vii by contrast says that court may award fees in any action or proceeding under this title as enacted or under this subchapter as codified in either case referring to title vii itself arguably suit solely to recover fees incurred in an ad ministrative proceeding under title vii is an action or proceeding under title vii even though suit solely to recover fees incurred in an administrative proceeding under title vi is not an action or proceeding to enforce title vi however this may be an overly literal reading in that when the attorneys fees provision in title vii refe rs to an action or proceeding under title vii it may not have been intended that it refer to itself but rather only to the rest of title vii40 the supreme court in gaslight of course has already interpreted this language and concluded that it encompasses suit solely to obtain an award of attorneys fees for legal work done in state and local proceedings yet in crest street the court labeled as dicta its statement in gaslight that to hold otherwise would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs23 41 in jones v american state bank 857 f2d 494 8th cir 1988 the court of appeals affirmed fee award under title vii in suit brought solely to recover fees incurred in state administrative proceeding 42 in situation in which party who prevails at the agency level may bring court action solely to recover fees the litigating arm of th agency of course may agree to settlement with respect to fee award thereby avoiding litigation of the issue and the incurring of additional fees the question raised here is whether the adjudicating arm of the agency may award fees over the objections of the litigating armanomalous it appears uncertain whether the court would reach the result it reached in gaslight in title vii case in which court action was never filed on the merits41 awards of attorneys fees by administrative agencies an issue that has never reached the supreme court is whether administrative agencies themselves may award attorneys f ees under any of the ci vil rights statutes title viis attorneys fees provision and the statutes modeled on it authorize only the court to award fees but to the extent that court may award fees incurred at the agency level the question has arisen whether an agency itself may do so in order to save the parties and federal court from litigation solely on fee claim42 of course only if court may award fees incurred at the administrative level will the question arise whether the agency itself may award such fees there are two circumstances in which court clearly may not award fees incurred at the administrative level the circumstances of crest street and of webb crest street prohibits courts from awarding fees in suits solely to recover fees at least in suits under 1988b so it seem s clear that agencies may not award fees under 1988 assuming that the reasoning of crest street does not apply to some statutes such as title vii webb still would preclude courts from awarding fees incurred in nonmandatory administrative pr oceedings under such statutes except to the extent that such fees cover any disc rete portion of the work product that was both useful and of type ordinarily nece ssary to advance the civil rights litigation however title vii provide s for mandatory administrative proceedings so the question arises under title vii whether an agency itself may award fees and thereby save the prevailing party from going to court the court of appeals in crest street had held that party who prevailed in an administrative proceeding under title vi could bring court action under 1988b solely to recover fees the court of appeals in crest street in addition citing the fact that 1988b on its face authorizes only the court to award fees said in dicta that it follows that plaintiffs must apply to court for thei r fees 769 f2d at 1033 emphasis in original however in smith v califano 446 f supp 530 ddc 1978 the court held that an agency could award fees in title vii proceeding it wrote title vii is statute in which congress already has specifically provided for an award of attorneys fees although th expression of that exception to the american rule is contained in the reme dial authority of the courts the rights protected by the courts are the very same rights the agencies are to protect

award counsel fees to one who prevails at the administrative level would not create farreaching exception to the rule rather it would make the existing exception applicable regardless of the stage at which that federal right is protected id at 532533 in addition the court noted although title vii does not expressl state that an agency may award attorneys fees it does state that in pr oceedings brought by federal employees the agency is to enforce the act through appropriate remedies as will effectuate the policies of this sec tion 42 usc 2000e16b supp v 1975 because the makewhole concept is one of those policies this provision can be read to permit the agency to award attorneys fees thereby making whole one who appears before it id at 533 this decision was followed in two other title vii cases43 however two other cases in the same district came to the contrary conclusi on holding that party who prevails at the agency level under title v ii must go to court to recover his fees44 in 1980 the eeoc issued regulation amended in 1987 providing that it or other federal agencies may award attorneys fees to federal employees under title vii 29 cfr 1613271d reported case app ears to have challenged the eeocs authority to promulgate this regulation an argument may be made howev er that if the reasoning of crest street applies to title vii then the legality of these regulations would be placed in doubt for if the reasoning of crest street applies which means that courts may not award attorneys fees incurred by parties who prev ail at the administrative level then the only basis for an agency to award fees would be the appr opriate remedies provision it is not clear however that smith v califano would have reached the same result in the absence of the statutes authorizing courts to award fees if under crest street courts cannot award fees to par ties who prevail in administrative proceedings under title vii then to allow agencies to award fees apparently would constitute farreaching exception to the american rule before an agency may order litigant to bear his adversarys expenses it must be granted clear statutory power by congress45 the power to employ appropriate

nonconstitutional claims but the supreme court held that the phrase and laws as used in 1983 means what it says id at 4 in other words according to this case suits may be brought under 1983 to enforce statutory as well as constitutional claims even statutory claims unrelated to civil rights and even claims arising unde r statutes that do not themselves contain an express or implied private right of

supreme court decided the same day as thiboutot the court left open the question whether the eleventh amendment prohibits fede ral courts from awarding fees in whollystatutory noncivil rights cases the impact of the eleventh amendment on fee awards against the states is considered in section ix of this report but brief mention of it will be made here in order to explain more fully the holdings of maine v thiboutot and maher v gagne httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs37 62 see text accompanying note 60 supra the eleventh amendment generally prohibits suits for damages in federal court against state notwithstanding the eleventh amendment however state may be sued for damages in federal court for viol ations of laws enacted to enforce the fourteenth amendment section 1983 and ci vil rights laws generally were enacted to enforce the fourteenth amendment maine v thiboutot however held that 1983 permits assertion of cl aims arising under both civil rights and noncivil rights laws this raises the question whether claims arisin g under nonci vil rights laws should be considered as having been br ought under law enacted to enforce the fourteenth amendment merely because the laws under which they arise may be enforced through the use of 1983 the cour t did not have to answer this question in maine v thiboutot because that case was brought in state court where the eleventh amendment does not apply maher v gagne the court also avoided the stion but for different reason this case was brought in federal court and like maine v thiboutot it charged state with having violated noncivil rights law however the plaintiff in maher v gagne also raised constitutional claim and that was decisive prior to trial the case was settled favorably for the plaintiff without the constitutional issues being reached the state argued that the eleventh amendment prohibited fee award because the case involved purel statutory noncivil rights claim the court held however that under 1988b federal court notwithstanding the eleventh amendment may award attorneys fees in case in which the plaintiff prevails on wholly statutory noncivil rights claim pendent to substan tial constitutional claim or in one in which both statutory and substantial constitutional claim are settled favorably to the plainti ff without adjudication id at 132 because of the constitutional claim which was held to be substantial the court found there is need to reach the question whether federal court could award attorneys fees against state based on statutory noncivilrights claim id at 13062 42 usc 1985 this

cases were first permitted by the civil rights attorneys fees awards act of 1976 42 us c 1988b which authorized federal courts to award attorneys fees to prevailing party other than the united states in any civil action or proceeding by or on behalf of the united states of america to enforce or charging violation of pr ovision of the united states internal revenue code this provision commonly known as the allen amendment had little effect because of its limitation to tax cases brought by or on behalf of the united states although in several circumstances the unite d states may bring suit

by the act to award attorneys fees are those defined in section 451 of title 28 and the tax court is not among them65 apart from this awards of attorneys fees in tax cases could be awarded under the same conditions as other awards against the united states under the eaja prevailing plaintiff whose net worth was within the prescribed limits was entitled to an award up to 75 per hour or more if special factor justified higher fee unless the united states proved that its position was substantially justified or that special circumstances made an award unjust next 292 of the tax equity and fi

administrative or court proceeding brought by or against the united states in connection with the dete rmination collection or refund of any tax interest or penalty under the internal revenue code the prevailing party other than the united states or creditor of the taxpayer may be awarded litigation costs including reasonable attorneys fees section 7430 contains the same limitations as the eaja on the net worth of eligible plaintiffs see 7430c4aii as renumbered by pl 104168 701a and it originally contained the same 75 cap on hourly rates however in 1996 pl 104121 raised eajas rate to 125 and pl

usc 6673a as amended by pl 101239 7731a allows the ta x court to impose upon taxpayer penalty of up to 25000 if it finds that proceedings before it have been in stituted or maintained by the taxpayer primarily for delay b the taxpayers position in such pro ceedings is frivolous or groundless or c the taxpayer unreasonably failed to pursue available administrative remedies section 6673a also allows the tax court to require any attorney who unreasonably and vexatiously multiplies the proceedings in any case to pay personally the excess costs expenses nd attorneys fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct if the attorney is appearing on behalf of the irs then the united states must pay the amount awarded section 6673b allows the court to im pose upon taxpayer penalty of up to 10000 whenever it appears to the c ourt that the taxpayers position in proceedings under section 7433 is frivolous or groundless section 7433 authorizes taxpayers to sue the united states in federal

be construed to extend to any suit against state by citizens of another state or of foreign state in hans v louisiana 134 us 1 1890 the supreme court construed the eleventh amendment to prohibit citizen from suing even his own state in federal court66 in alden v maine 527 us 706 1999 the supreme court held that the eleventh amendment prevents congress from authorizing private suits against state even in its own courts without the states consent notwithstanding the eleventh amendment state may consent to suit by its citizens or citizens of other states missouri v fiske 290 us 18 24 1933httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs42 67 in subsequent cases the court has indicated that federal courts may also enjoin state officials from enforcing state laws that violate federal laws or regulations see eg edelman v jordan discussed in the text below 68 attorneys fees and the eleventh amendment 88 harvard law review 1875 1879 1975 69 in pennhurst state school hospital v halderman 465 us 89 106 121 1984 the supreme court held that young and edelman are inapplicable in suit against state officials on the basis of state law this principle applies as well to statelaw claims brought into federal court under pendent juri sdiction in other words the eleventh amendment prohibits statelaw claim against state officials from being brought in federal court even if it is joined with federalla w claim this has caused some state courts to refuse to hear claims under 42 usc 1983 1982 that seek an award of attorneys fees under the civil rights attorneys fees awards act of 1976

123 1908 the supreme court held that federal courts may enjoin state officials as individuals from enforcing state laws that violate the united states constitution67 the court reasoned that an official who attempts such action comes into conflict with the s uperior authority of that constitution and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subject in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct id at 159160 one commentator noted the idea that the court restrained the i ndividual rather than the state was of course pure fiction since th state could not act other than through its officials but through this fiction the court appare ntly sought to guarantee the nations authority to limit state action68 in edelman v jordan 415 us 651 1974 the supreme court explicitly limited the types of relief that may be granted under the theory of ex parte young the plaintiffs in edelman had sued state officials alleging that the officials were administering welfare program in ma nner inconsistent w ith various federal regulations the district court found for the plaintiffs and ordere d the state officials to comply with federal regulations in the future and to disburse all benefits wrongfully withheld in the past the cour t of appeals affirme d the supreme court affirmed the prospective portion of the di strict courts order but reversed the retroactive portion of the order holding that because the award must inevitably come from the general revenues of the state of illinois it resembles far more closely the monetary award against the st ate itself than it does the prospective injunctive relief awarded in ex parte young id at 665 the court acknowledged that the difference between the type of relief barred by the eleventh amendment and that permitted under ex parte young will not in many instances be that between day and night id at 667 this is evidenced by the fact that the prospective portion of the district courts order as well as th retroactive portion n ecessarily required the payment of state funds but this the court termed permissible ancillary effect of the prospective order69 in fitzpatrick v bitzer 427 us 445 456

includes feeshif ting provision like the plaintiffs in edelman the plaintiffs in fitzpatrick had sought prospective injunctive relief and retroactive benefits in addition in fitzpatrick they had sought attorneys fees the district court awarded only the prospective relief holding that the other relief was barred by edelman the court of appeals agreed that edelman barred an award of retroactive benefits but held that an aw ard of attorneys fees was permissible ancillary benefit the supreme court did not decide whether an award of attorneys fees constituted an impermissible retroactive benefit or permissible ancillary benefit instead it reversed the denial of retroactive benefits holdi ng that neither they nor an award of attorneys fees were barred in s ituations in which congress under 5 of the fourteenth amendment had provided for suits against states or state officials the supreme court held in other words that the constitutional power of congress to enforce by appropriate

statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of federal financial assistance 42 usc 2000d770 in pennsylvania v union gas co 491 us 1 1989 the supreme court held that congress also has the

affirmed this award on the basis of the civil rights attorneys fees awards act of 1976 42 usc 1988b which had been enacted while the appeal was pending alt hough the court of appeals noted that the award would have been justified unde r the bad faith exception 548 f2d 740 742 n6 because 1988b is stat ute enacted pursuant to 5 of the fourteenth amendment and fitzpatrick held that the eleventh amendment does not apply to such statutes the supreme cour t apparently could have affirmed the district court fee award in hutto on the basis of 1988b merely by finding that 1988b permitted awards of attorneys fees against the stat the court chose however to affirm on the basis of the bad faith exception as th bad faith exception is common law rule not enacted pursuant to statute that abrogates eleventh amendment immunity the court had to address the eleventh amendment question it held that the district court award served the same purpose as remedial fine imposed for civil contempt and did not constitute retroactive monetary award and therefore was not barred by the eleventh amendment under edelman in missouri v jenkins 491 us 274 280 1989 the supreme court made clear that the holding of hutto was not just that c ongress had spoken sufficiently clearly to overcome eleventh amendmen t immunity in enacting 1988 but rather that the eleventh amendment did not apply to an award of attorneys fees ancillary to grant of prospective relief the holding of missouri was that the eleventh amendment also does not apply to the calcu lation of the amount of fee award and therefore does not prohibit enhancement of fee award against state to compensate for delay in payment the 2500 court of appeals award in hutto was made solely pursuant to 1988b and in affirming this award the court held that congress intended 1988b to permit awards of attorneys fees against the states the court based this conclusion on the legislative history of 1988b and on the fact that 1988b provides for fee awards as part of the costs and costs have traditionally been awarded without regard for the stat eleventh amendment immunity id at 695httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs45 72 although the supreme court has not explicitly decided the question the fact that it held in seminole tribe supra that congress may not override the eleventh amendment when legislating pursuant to the commerce clause suggests that 1988b does not apply to 1983 claims that do not arise under the fourteenth amendmentthe court also held that fees could be aw arded against the state even though the state had not been named as defendant congre ss recognized that suits brought against individual officers for injunctive relief are for all practical purposes suits against the state itself id at 700 thus in suit for injunctive relief the state not the state official may be held liable for fees under 1988b however in suit for injunctive relief state official may be assessed fees under the common law bad faith standard which was not affected by 1988b id at 692 n19 693 700 in addition in kentucky v graham 473 us 159 1985 the supreme court indicated that state officials who are not like judges discussed below immune from damages liability may be sued in thei r personal capacities fo r damages under 1983 and in such cases may be liable for fees ev in the absence of bad faith in such cases however the state will not be liable for fees the holding in hutto v finney that 1988b permits fee awards against the states took on added importance in 1980 when the supreme court expanded the reach of 1988b in maine v thiboutot and maher v gagne both of which were discussed in detail in section vi of this report briefly maine v thiboutot permitted state courts to award fees in any action against state for violation of any federal law although subsequent cases discussed above narrowed this holding and maher v gagne permitted federal courts to do the same provided there is substantial claim raised under the constitution or statut enacted under 5 of the fourteenth amendment the court left open the stion whether the eleventh amendment allows federal courts to award fees in wholly statutory noncivil rights cases72 awards of attorneys fees against state judges in supreme court of virginia v cons umers union of the united states 446 us 719 1980 and in pulliam v allen 466 us 522 1984 the issue arose whether state judges sued in their fficial capacities under 42 usc 1983 enjoy any immunity from awards of attorneys fees that other state officials lack the answer the court found depended upon whethe r the judges were sued for damages or injunctive relief and whether the conduc t concerning which they were sued had been performed in their legislative enfo rcement or adjudicative capacity in 1996 pl 104317 309 modified the law announced in pulliam in consumers union the virginia courts restrictions on lawyer advertising were found to violate the first amendment s guarantee of freedom of speech the supreme court held that in propounding the dvertising prohibitions the virginia court had acted in legislative capacity and that in such capacity it enjoys common law immunity from damages liability and from declaratory and injunctive relief and thus from awards of attorneys fees however the court noted although consumershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs46 73 see srept 104366 104th cong 2nd sess 37 1996union had alleged only that the virginia court had promulgate d the advertising prohibitions the virginia court in ddition to its legislative function has adjudicative and enforcement authority in attorney disciplinary cases in their adjudicative and enforcement capacities judges enjoy absolute immunity from damages liability however in both these capacities they are subject to suits for injunctive relie f and under 1988b to awards of attorneys fees consumers union held this with respect to courts enforcement authority and pulliam held it with respect to thei r adjudicatory authority in pulliam the court wrote petitioner insists that judicial immunity bars fee award because attorneys fees are the functional equivalent of monetary damages and monetary damages indisputably are prohibited by judicial immunity she reasons that the chilling effect of damages award is not less chilling when the award is denominated attorneys fees there is perhaps some logic to petitioners reasoning the weakness in it is that it is for congress not this court to determine whether and to what extent to abrogate the judiciarys commonlaw immunity see pierson v ray 386 us at 554 congress has made clear in 1988 its intent that attorneys fees be available in any action to enforce provision of 1983 466 us at 543 it should be emphasized that under pulliam the state and not the judge ordinarily will be liable for attorn eys fees as noted above in hutto the supreme court held that in injunctive suits the state must pay fees awarded under 1988b state officials may be held personally lia ble for fees only under the common law bad faith standard in 1996 pl 104317 309b amended 42 usc 1988b to make judicial officers immune from awards of costs including attorneys fees for any act or omission taken in such offi cers judicial capacity unl ess such action was clearly in excess of such officers jurisdiction section 309a prescribed the same rule for federal judicial officers who are

439 section 1821 the cited statute provides that witnesses in fe deral courts shall be paid an attendance fee of 40 per day for each days attendance thus if contract or expert witness feeshifting statute provides otherwise fee award to an expert witness may not exceed 40 per day the only exception is when th witness is cour tappointed id at 44274 the court based its opinion on its readin g of 28 usc 1821 together with 28 usc 1920 and federal rule of civil procedure 54d it rejected the view that 1920 does not preclude taxation of costs above and beyond the items listed and more particularly amounts in excess of the 1821 fee thus the discretion granted by rule 54d is separate sour ce of power to tax as costs expenses not enumerated in 1920 we think however that reasonable reading of these provisions together can lead to this conclusion for petitioners view renders 1920 superfluous if rule 54d grants c ourts discretion to tax whatever costs may seem appropriate then 1920 which enumerates the costs that may be taxed serves role whatsoever we think the better view is that 1920 defines the term costs as used in rule 54d section 1920 enumerates expenses that federal court may tax as cost under the discretionary authority found in rule 54d id at 441442 in west virginia university hospitals inc v casey 499 us 83 87 1991 the supreme court held that the term attorneys fee in

clean air delaware valley i 478 us 546 562566 1986 the suprem court explained the proper measure for determining the reasonableness of particular fee award one method first employed by the fifth circuit in johnson v georgia highway express inc 488 f2d 714 1974 involved consideration of 12 factors johnson was widely followed by other courts and was cited with approval by both the house and the senate when 42 usc 1988 was enacted78 setting attorneys fees by reference to series of sometimes subjective factors placed unlimited discretion in trial judges and produced disparate results for this reason the third circuit veloped another method of calculating reasonable attorneys fees this thod known as the lodestar approach involved two steps first the court wa s to calculate the lodestar determined by multiplying the hours spent on case by reasonable hourly rate of compensation for each attorney involved lindy bros builders inc v american radiator standard sanitary corp 487 f 2d 161 167 ca3 1973 lindy i second using the lodestar figure as starting point the court could then make adjustments to this figure in light of 1 the contingent nature of the case reflecting the likelihood that hours were invested and expenses incurred without assurance of compensation and 2 the quality of the work performed as evidenced by the work observed the complexity of the issues and the recovery obtained we first addressed the question of the proper manner in which to determine reasonable attorneys fee in hensley v eckerhart 461 us 424 1983 we there adopted hybrid approach th at shared elements of both the johnson and the lodestar method of calculation the most useful starting point for determininghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs50 79 upward adjustments are also called bonuse s the supreme court has stated that it thinks the characterization upward adjustments is fairer blum v stenson 465 us at 896 n12 upward adjustments may be made by way of multipliers or enhancement of the lodestar delaware valley i 478 us at 568 80 the dissent thought that the court had i mproperly heightened the showing required to the point where it may be virtually impossible for plaintiff to meet 478 us at 569the amount of reasonable fee is th number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by reasonable hourly rate to this extent the method endorsed in hensley follows the third circuits description of the first step of the lodestar approach moreov er we went on to st ate the product of reasonable hours times reasonable rate does not end the inquiry there remain other considerations that may lead the di strict court to adjust the fee upward or downward we then took more expansive view of what those other considerations might be however noting that the district court also may consider the factors identified in johnson v georgia highway express inc 488 f 2d 714 717719 ca5 1974 though it should note that many of these factors usually are subsumed within th initial calculation of hours reasonably expended at reasonable hourly rate id at 434 n 9 citation omitted we further refined our views in blum v stenson 465 us 886 1984 blum also limited the factors which district court may consider in determining whether to make adjustments to the l odestar amount expanding on our earlier finding in hensley that many of the johnson factors are subsumed within the initial calculation of the lodest ar we specifically held in blum that the novelty and complexity of the issues the special skill and experience of counsel the quality of representation and the results obtained from the litigation are presumably fully reflected in the lodestar amount and thus cannot serve as independent bases for increasing the basic fee award 465 us at 898900 although upward adjustments of the lode star figure are still permissible id at 901 such modifications are proper onl in certain rare and exceptional cases supported by both specific eviden ce on the record and detailed findings by the lower courts79 in short the lodestar figure includes mo st if not all of the relevant factors comprising reasonable attorneys fee and it is unnecessary to enhance the fee for superior performance in order to serve the statutory purpose of enabling plaintiffs to secure legal assistance80 in delaware valley i the court indicated that to be entitled to an upward adjustment prevailing party must show that it would have been unable to obtain counsel without any promise of reward for extraordinary performance it must present specific eviden ce as to what made the results it obtained so outstanding it must show that the lode star figure was far below awards made in similar cases where the court f ound equally superior qua lity of performance finally to adjust fee upward court must make detailed findings as to why the lodestar amount was unreasonable and in particular as to why the quality of representation was not reflected in th number of hours times the reasonable hourly rate 478 us at 567568 the court left open the question of upward adjustment based on the likelihood of success or to put it another way the risk of loss id at 568 by risk of loss the court apparently meant an attorneys risk of losing andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs51 81 in blum v stenson the court also contrasted calcul ation of fee awards under the common fund doctrine see ch ii of this report nd under 1988 under the former reasonable fee is based on percentage of the fund best owed on the class while reasonable fee under 1988 reflects the amount of attorney time reasonably expended on the litigation 465 us at 900 n16 risk multipliers are also more permissible in common fund cases see eg florin v nationsba nk of georgia 34 f3d 560 7th cir 1994 in

do so in this case 483 us at 728 subsequently however in burlington v dague 505 us 557 567 1992 the court adopting the position set forth in justice whites opinion in delaware valley ii held that enhancement for contin gency is not permitted under the fee shifting statutes at issue those statutes were 7002e of the solid waste disposal act 42 usc 6972e and 505d of the clean water act 33 usc 1365d however the court noted that the relevant language of these statutes is similar to that of many other federal feeshifting statutes our cas law construing what is reasonable fee applies unifo rmly to all of them id at 562 the courts primary reason for its decision in burlington was that an enhancement for contingency would likely duplicate in substantial part f actors already subsumed in the lodestar id in blum v stenson 465 us 886 895 1984 the supreme court held that reasonable fees are to be calculate d under 42 usc 1988 according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community regardless of whether the plaintiff is represented by priv ate or nonprofit counsel81 the court rejected the position that awards be calculated according to the cost of providing legal

litigants civil rights plaintiff seeks to vindicate important civil and constitutional rights th at cannot be valued solely in monetary terms and congress has determined that the public as whole has

court held in blanchard v bergeron 489 us 87 1989 the defendant must pay the higher fee if the contingent fee is higher then the supreme court held in venegas v mitchell 495 us 82 1990 the defendant is liabl only for the reasonable fee but the plaintiff must still pay his lawyer the higher contingent fee the court emphasized in venegas that section 1988 makes the prevailing party eligible for discretionary award of attorneys fees id at 87 emphasis supplied by the court it would seem to follow that in the blanchard situation where the reas onable fee is higher the prevailing party may keep the difference between the reasonable fee paid by the defendant and the amount owed under the tingent fee agreement this inference is supported by the courts statement in venegas that it rejected the argument that the entitlement to 1988 award belongs to th attorney rather than the plaintiff id at 89 yet in blanchard the court wrote respondent cautions us that refusing to limit recovery to the am ount of the contingency agreement will result in windfall to attorneys who accept 1983 actions yet the very nature of recovery under 1988 is designed to prevent any such windfall fee awards are to be

title vii cases against federal agency but that special caution must be shown by the trial court in scrutinizing the claims of attorneys for fees against federal agen cy in such litigation special caution is required because of the incentive which the defendants deep pocket offers to attorneys to inflate their billing charges and to claim far more as reimbursement than would be sought or could reasonabl be recovered from most private parties id at 250 to exercise that caution the court wrote the trial court should give considera tion to abandoning the traditional claimed hourlyfee starting point for its calculations in favor of principle of reimbursement to firm for its costs plus reasonable and controllable margin for profit id at 251 this costplus formula would have lowered fee awards in title vii cases against the federal governme nt and consequently had b een called serious blow to the whole public interest law movement ny times november 14 1978 at a25 the three judge panel however on june 29 1979 denied rehearing and issued an unreported opinion clarifying its decision the full court of appeals re versed writing that it did not think that the amount of the fee should depend on the identity of the losing party 641 f2d at 894 it noted that title vii provides that the united states shall be liable for costs the same as private person and that the incentiv supplied by fee awards to refrain from discrimination should not be less for the gove rnment than it is for private employers id at 895 furthermore the court feared that the proposed costplus method of calculating fees would indeed become the inquiry of massive proportions that we strive to avoid id at 896 in sum the court believe d that in title vii cases against the government or otherwise

include or exclude attorneys fees then plaintiff who accepts the offer may still file motion for attorneys fees see minnick v dollar financial group inc 2002 us dist lexis 9115 2002 wl 1023101 52

jordan v time inc 111 f3d 102 11th cir 1997and the offeree fails to accept the offer within 10 days then if the offeree wins the lawsuit but the judgment he obtains is not more favorable than the offer the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer85 in other words the plaintiff forfeits his right under rule 54d to recover costs incurred after such time in addition the plaintiff must pay the fendants costs incurred after such time86 in marek v chesny the supreme court addressed th interaction of rule 68 and the civil rights attorneys fees award s act of 1976 42 usc 1988b section 1988b authorizes the award of reasonable attorneys fee as part of the costs in suits brought under 42 usc 1983 and several other civil rights statutes the court held that if lawsuit is brought under statute such as 1988b that provides for awards of attorneys fees as part of the costs then the term costs in rule 68 includes attorneys fees the court viewed this as the plain meaning interpretation of the interpla between rule 68 and 1988 id at 987 though under marek v chesney prevailing civil rights plaintiff who has rejected settlement offer for as much as he won must pay the defendants postoffer costs he never has to pay the defendants postoffer attorneys fees this is because civil rights defendant may not be awarde d attorneys fees unless he prevails and unless the court determines that the pl aintiffs action was frivolous unreasonable or without foundation neither of these w ould be the case if the plaintiff prevailed88 this decision in marek v chesney means that rule 68 creates an exception not only to rule 54d but also to all statutes that authorize awards of attorneys fees to prevailing parties as part of the costs under marek v chesny prevailing plaintiff otherwise entitled to recover attorneys fees under one of these statutes is not entitledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs56 89 the civil rights act of 1990 s 2104 101st congress which was vetoed by president bush would have amended title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 42 usc 2000e 5k to authorize reasonable attorneys fe and costs instead of reasonable attorneys fee as part of the costs as it now readsto recover attorneys fees incurred after an offer to settle was made if the prevailing plaintiff rejected the offer and then won more than had been offered the dissent in marek v chesny pointed out that this means that rule 68 will operate to include the potential loss of otherwiserecoverable attorneys fees as an incentive to settlement in litigation under the following statutes of which the dissent listed 63 those that refer t the awarding of attorneys fees as part of the costs to costs including attorneys fees and to attorneys fees and other litigation costs id at 23 rule 68 will not include the potential loss of attorneys fees in statutes of which the dissent listed 49 that refer to the awarding of costs and reasonable attorneys fee of costs together with reasonable attorneys fee or simply of attorneys fees w ithout reference to costs id in addition as the dissent pointed out number of statutes author ize the award of costs and expenses including attorneys fees it is altogether uncertain how such statutes of which the dissent listed 7 should be categorized unde r the courts plain language approach to rule 68 id at 44 in short the dissent believed that marek v chesny sanctions senseless patchwork of f eeshifting that flies in the face of the fundamental purpose of the federal rules the provisi on of uniform and c onsistent procedure in federal courts id at 24 if congress wishes to restore uniformity with respect to the effect of rule 68 on awards of attorneys fees then it could am end rule 68 to define costs as used in rule 68 either to include or to exclude ttorneys fees in suits brought under statutes authorizing awards of attorneys fees if it defines costs to include attorneys fees then attorneys fees incurred after an offer would not be recoverabl by plaintiffs who reject settlement offer and then fail to win more than they had been offered if it defines costs to exclude attorneys f ees then such parties would lose their opportunity under rule 54d to be awarded costs incurred after an offer but would retain their entitlement to an award of attorneys fees alternatively congress could amend i ndividual attorneys fees statutes to provide that attorneys fees may be awarded either as part of the costs or in addition to costs it will also have to make this decision with respect to attorneys fees statutes it enacts in the future89 in the handicapped ch ildrens protection act of 1986 pl 99372 which was enacted after marek v chesny congress adopted compromise approach to settlement offers it included provision modeled on rule 68 that bars recovery of attorneys fees and costs of plaintiffs who reject settlement offers and applies to administrative proceed ings as well as to civil actions under the individuals with disabilities education act formerly the education of the handicapped act see ch vii of this report however it allows prevailing plaintiff who would otherwise forfeit cost s and attorneys fees to recover them

99th cong 2nd sess 6 1986 reprinted in 1986 usccan 1807 1809 91 the supreme court wrote it is argued that an attorney is required to evaluate settlement offer on the basis of his clients in terest without considering his own interest in obtaining fee upon r ecommending settlement he must abide by the clients decision whether or not to accept the offer id at 728 n14 the court stated that the plaintiffs lawyers decision in this case to recommend acceptance was consistent with the highest standards of our profession id at 728stated substantial justification for rejec tion would include rele vant pending court decisions which could have an impact on the case in question90 xiii negotiated fee waivers in evans v jeff d 475 us 717 1986 the supreme court upheld the legality of negotiated waivers of attorneys fees evans was class action brought under 42 usc 1983 seeking injunctive relief cerning the conditions of mentally and emotionally handicapped children institutiona lized by the state of idaho one week before trial the defendant offered the plaintiffs virtually all the injunctive relief they had sought on condition that the plainti ffs waive their claim to fees and costs under 42 usc 1988b the plaintiffs lawyer determined that his ethical obligation to his clients manda ted acceptance of the proposal id at 72291 but he requested the district court to approve the settlement except for the provision on costs and attorneys fees cla ss action settlements must be approved by the court under rule 23 of the federal rules of civil procedure the di strict court upheld the fee waiver but the court of appeals reve rsed on the ground that 1988b normally requires an award of fees to prevailing plaintiffs in civil rights actions including those who have prevailed through settlement the court added that when attor neys fees are negotiated as part of class action settlement conflict of interest frequently exists between the class lawyers interest in compensation and the class members interest in relief id at 725 if negotiated f ee waivers are permitted then defendant can exploit plain tiffs lawyers ethical obliga tion to his client to force him to waive fees that congress arguably intended him to recover the supreme court rejected this view holding that the statute and its legislative history nowhere suggest that congress intended to forbid all waivers of attorneys fees id at 731 the court added that there are many civil rights actions in which potential liability for attorneys fees may overshadow the potential cost of relief on the merits and darken prospects for settlement if fees cannot be negotiated id at 735 in response to these two points of the ma jority the dissent argued first that although there is evidence that congress intended to ban all f ee waivers there is evidence that congress gave the questi on of fee waivers any thought at all id at 743744 and second that judicial policy favoring settle ments cannot possibly take precedence over express congressional policy favoring incentives for lawyers to devote time to civil rights cases id at 760761 the dissent concludedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94970crs58 92 the majority and the dissent agreed that 1988b should not be in terpreted to prohibit simultaneous negotiations of defendants liability on the merits and his liab ility for his opponents attorneys fees id at 738 n30 the dissent however would have permitted the parties to negotiate reasonable fees not waivers id at 764765 93 this statute provides that the court may llow reasonable fee not in excess of 25 percent of the total of pastdue benefits in gisbrecht v barnhart 535 us 789 808 2002 the supreme court held that in soci security act cases court should not determine the reasonableness of fee by the l odestar method that is used in feeshifting statutes but should approach fee determinati ons by looking first to the contingentfee agreement then testing it for reasonableness see also note 82 supra 94 for

scheme congress estab lished for civil rights legislation i do not believe that it will bring about the to tal disappearance of private attorneys general it is to be hoped that congress will repair this courts mistake in the meantime other avenues of relief are available indeed several bar associations have already declared it une thical for defense counsel to seek fee waivers in addition it may be that civil rights attorneys can obtain agreements from their clients not to waive attorneys fees id at 76576692 xiv statutory limitations on attorneys fees some federal statutes and regulations limit the amount attorneys may charge their clients for representing them before various federal agenci these provisions have different types of limitations for example 42 usc 406a limits contingent fees in agency proceedings under title ii of the social security act to the lesser of 25 percent of pastdue oldage survivor or disability benefits that are awarded or 4000 and 42 usc 406b limits contingent fees in court proceedings under the same statute to 25 percent with dollar maximum93 contingent fees in cases before the department of veterans affairs are limited by 38 usc 5904d to 20 percen t of pastdue benefits aw arded 15 usc 79gd4 and 79jb2 provide that the amount of compensation paid under the public utility holding company act of 1935 is subject to approval of the securities and exchange commission and 42 usc 1383d2 provide s that the secretary of health and human services shall by rule and regulation prescribe maximum fees in supplemental security income cases94 some of these attorneys fees limitati ons are controversial because although they may protect claimants from having to pay to their attorneys large portion of any amount awarded they may also so limit fees as

reason walters v national association of radiation survivors 473 us 305 1985 the court noted congresss desire that the system should be as informal and non adversarial as possible id at 323324 the court did not however preclude the possibility that the 10 limitation could be unconstitutional as applied in particular case see id at 336 oconnor j concurring in united states department of labor v

928 these limitations prohibit an attorney from receiving fee unless approved by the appr opriate agency or court in addition the departments regulations invalidate all contractual arrangements for fees and the department will not approve fee if the cla imant is unsuccessful id at 718 the court concluded that there wa s evidence adequate to establish either that black lung claimants are ble to retain qualified counsel or that the cause of such inability is the attorneys fee system administered by the department id at 726 emphasis in original therefore th ere was basis for concluding that that system deprives claimants of prope rty without due process of law id the american bar associations special committee on federal limitations on attorneys fees recommended in august 1980 that congress enact legislation establishing uniform principles for the regulation of attorneys fees in proceedings conducted before federa l administrative agencies and that such legislation prohibit arbitrary maximum fees and provide for reasonable fees xv funding of participants in federal agency proceedings federal agencies like federal courts ma not absent statutory authority order one party

recover his doctors but not his lawyers bill judicial council of massachusetts first report 11 massachusetts law quarterly 1 64 1925 another line of arguments centers ar ound the question of whether keeping or abandoning the american rule will more effectively further the public policy of encouraging meritorious claims and terring nonmeritorious ones current practice tends to deter prosecution of even clearly meritorious claims by litigants who could at best recover less than the often high expenses of counsel and what is true for plaintiffs also holds true for defendants the cost of defending against an unjust small claim may easily exceed the cost of simply paying what is demanded the result is distasteful for it ranks legal rights by dollar value court awarded attorneys fees and equal access to the courts 122 university of pennsylvania law review 636 650 1974 requiring the loser to pay the winners attorneys fees might encourage litigation of some merito rious claims and discour age litigation of some non meritorious ones on the other hand the certainty of litigation might also lead to the opposite results the poor might be unjustly discouraged from instituting actions to vindicate their rights if the penalty for losing included the fees of their opponents counsel fleischmann supra in addition nonmeritorious claims might be encouraged by the prospect of voiding the expense of lawyer however it has also been argued in support of requi ring losers to pay winners lawyers fees that while conceding the uncertainty of litigation it should be assumed that courts will more often than not arrive at correct result otherwise courts might as well be dispensed with entirely as it would be cheaper and less time consuming simply to flip

355 1963 state casesin support of the american rule it has so been argued that the time expense and difficulties of proof inherent in litigating the question of what constitutes reasonable attorneys fees would pos substantial burdens for judicial administration fleischmann supra since this comment was made however congress has enacted many feeshifting statutes that require courts to determine what constitutes reasonable fee it has also been argued that abandonm ent of the american rule might have serious consequences for developing areas of the law since potential litigants might be loath to espouse novel legal theories for fear of incurring additional expenses if they do not prevail finally since the prospect of an award of attorneys fees might at times encourage suits and at other times deter them the crowding of court calendars has been cited as an argument both for and against the american rule xvii awards of attorneys fees to prevailing criminal defendants until the enactment of pl 105119 known as the hyde amendment in 1997 federal statutory or common law excep tions to the american rule authorized feeshifting from the losing to the winning party in federal

the position of th united states was vexatious frivolous or in bad faith determination that prosecution was vexatious for the purposes of the hyde amendment requires both showing that the criminal case was objectively deficient in that it lacked ither legal merit or factual foundation and showing that the governments conduct when viewed objectively manifests maliciousness or an inte nt to

final judgme nt under the hyde amendment then mr gardners only alternative would be to wait to request attorneys fees until the statute of limitations on each of the charges had expire d this result
