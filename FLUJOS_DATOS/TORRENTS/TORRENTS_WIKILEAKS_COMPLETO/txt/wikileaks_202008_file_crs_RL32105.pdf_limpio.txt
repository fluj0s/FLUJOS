overview securing foreign contributions to the military effort in iraq and the followon stabilization and reconstruction effort has been major priority for us policymakers since before the launch of operation iraqi freedom in march 2003 international participation has been s ought to support the initial major combat operations the followon stabilization operations the training and equipping of iraqi security forces and the provision of fina ncial support to recons truction efforts for many countries the passage of ited nations security council resolution 1511 on october 6 2003 marked an importa nt milestone in establishing the legitimacy of the postwar international pr esence in iraq resolution 1511 authorized multinational force under unified interpret ed as us command to assist iraqis in securing their country and in training th eir security forces security council resolution 1546 of june 8 2004 reaffirmed this authorization and established the current mandate under which the usl ed multinational force is responsible for contributing to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq that mandate has since been extended for twelve m onth periods by resolution 1637 november 11 2005 resolution 1723 november 28 2006 and resolution 1790 december 18 2007 on november 26 2007 iraqi prime minister nuri almaliki and president bush signed declaration of principles expr essing the decisions of both governments to work by july 2008 to codify l ongterm bilateral strategic framework agreement intended to replace the current mandate1 the roles of us and coalition forces in combat operations and the training of iraqi security forces are likely to be key topics in the strategic framework negotiations in particular most observers agree that training is one of th activities most likely to be continued under any continuing us or coalition presence in iraq the outcome of the usiraqi negotiations is likely to shape the size structure and focus of the us military presence in iraq any changes to the us mission and any new iraqi government positions concerning the roles of coalition forces could easily affect both the need for and the perceived legitimacy of foreign contributions to stabilization operations and training effortshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32105crs2 2 for more information see crs report rl31833 iraq reconstruction assistance by curt tarnoff 3

polands contingent from iraq in consultation with coalition partners by the end of 200815 ultimately foreign government decisions to send forces to iraq or to redeploy them may rest on number of factors incl uding the overall security situation the domestic political environment in donor c ountry legal restrictions these countries face in deploying troops in iraq the potential for foreign companies to invest in iraqs economy and bilateral arra ngements between the united states and possible donors number of coalition troops on the ground public discussions about the extent of the coalition force presence in iraq have been marked by some confusion ther are several reasons for the apparent discrepancies the actual number of troops on the ground is constantly in flux in several ways troopcontributing country may decide to ch ange the size of its contingent andor the kinds of units deployed the size of c ontingent may change slightly at regularly scheduled unit rotations and contingent size may vary to some degree based on individual situations such as injury or illness countries may deploy troops to iraq to one of several diffe rent organizations the multinational
