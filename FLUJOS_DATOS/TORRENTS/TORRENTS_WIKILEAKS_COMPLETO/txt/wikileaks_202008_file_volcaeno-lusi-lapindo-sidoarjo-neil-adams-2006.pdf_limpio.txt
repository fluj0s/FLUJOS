well as endangering the environment 23 specific findings findings developed from the following sections of the report are summarized here see the following sections for more detailed information section 30 forward recommendations drilling operations analyzed in this report have been based on opinion 35 years of experience academic training and various industrial publications specific publications of pertinent value for this investigation include those of the ameri can petroleum institute and the international association of drilling contractors need exists to itemize each specific reference and its cite location as they pertain to the findings presented in this report training courses should be developed and presented to medco drilling well planning and other personnel to 1 address this reports findings and 2 ensure competence in well planning abnormal pressure detection and ca sing setting depth selection spec ific topics in advanced kick control and other topics medco operating and safety manuals should be reviewed and where necessary enhanced to include the findings of this investigation 7 medco often employs contracts for drilling and related operations it is recommended that these types of contracts be reviewed with respect to the lessons learned from the banjar panji 1 blowout section 40 introduction none section 50 discussion of seismic analyses an analyses of the seismic data did not identify any direct causes for the blowout the analyses did find that drilling the banjar panji well in close proximity to numerous faults one of which was intersected may have been contributing cause for the blowout well sites should not be selected in close proximity to faults the faults near the banjar panji well were pr obably sealing prior to the well being drilled section 60 discussion of geological conditions the as drilled geology encountere d in the well was different th an the as planned conditions the operator should have conducted an extensive investigation into this matter as soon as the early signs of differing geologies were observed m odification of the well plan was likely warranted section 70 analyses of the banjar panji 1 well plan the well plan frequently used terms such as good practice or industry practice the oil industry does not have an accepted body of guidelines that falls into these categories operators often use these vague and ambiguous terms when they are not technically competent or do not wish to devote the required time to develop their desired guidelines on specific topics the well plan contains references that medici will control specific operations it does not appear that medici had the authority to control any opera tions on its own accord various contract terms indicates that lapindo retained ultimate control of all operations the well plan references two offset wells that may or may not have been used to develop the well plan information from these two offset wells shoul d have been included as an attachment to the well plan specific casing setting depth program is provided in the well plan basis is given for the reasoning used to select the casing setting depths the plan does not contain any information that indicates that the casing setting depths are optiona l or that they can be ignored the operators violation of this program caused the well to blowout the well plan indicates that the anticipated form ation temperatures should be normal but higher than normal temperatures should be anticipated the operators language about temperatures is 8confusing and vague it does not allow the rig site supervisors to be able to diagnose anomalies if they occur also the operator does not specify their basis for indicating that abnormal temperatures may be anticipated the operator indicates in their well plan that setting casing at depths identified in their plan is critical and must be done properly this statement when viewed from the actual well operations indicates weakness on the part of the operator the statements suggest that the operator understands the critical nature of setting pipe at lected depths in the well however the actual well site operations where important casing strings were not set indicate 1 the operator does not comprehend the necessity for proper casing setting pths 2 the operators lack of conviction in following its own well plan and 3 the lack of technical competence with lapindos engineering group medicis engineering group and their rig site supervisors the well plan and other contract documents require that job safety analysis be conducted for each new task the daily drilling reports do not indicate that jsas were conducted although required in the well plan the daily reports do not indicate that drills were conducted for bop and pit drills evacuation and h 2s operations the pore pressure and fracture pressure informat ion is incomplete it does not provide sufficient information to allow proper well plan to be developed also the basis for the data shown in the well plan has not been provided the casing program selected for the banjar panji well is incorrect for the pore pressure and fracture pressure conditions however it is adequate to prevent the blowout if properly implemented proper casing program is provided based on th given conditions the program uses the only widely accepted procedure the operators plan for handling shallow gas is inadequate if shallow gas kick would have occurred it would have quickly become blowout if the operators plan were implemented the operator establishes kick tolerance for the 958 inch casing seat this type of information is useless and is employed when the well plan is inadequate to handle the given well conditions the operator did not follow their strict requirements that all kicks should be shut in section 80 discussion of drilling and well control operations on the banjar panji 1 well measure of rig efficiency is to compare the actual drilling time to the down time for rig repairs waiting on parts etc this comparison is known as the efficiency ratio er consider the case of properly functioning rig with equipment that has been tested refurbished by the oem and has the complete certification paper work from the oems an anticipated ratio of drilling time to down time is in the range of 151 to as high as 201 this is interpreted to mean that the rig can drill 15 20 hrs per 1 hour of downrepair time drilling time and down time was calculated for the banjar panji 1 well the drilling time was 3265 hours while the down time was 8305 hours this gives an er of 03911 and indicates that 9the tiga musi masa java tmmj 4 rig provi ded horrible operating efficiency this poor performance may be unmatched in the modern drilling era at some point the operator should have notified medici that they were in default either by fact or implied of their ipdm contract they should have been put on notice the operator should have reconsidered the viability of this well with the tmmj 4 rig the rigs performance history could sugge st that it jeopardized the potential for successfully drilling the well technical reasons were provided in the ddrs nor could reason be logically inferred as to the operators extraordinary tolerance to the drilling contractors relentless equipment problems the operators tolerance may be related to the conflict of interest issue caused by partial joint ownership of the operator and the drilling contractor the operator should have made the decision to rent mud pumps rather than spend time with repeated attempts to effect repairs the drilling contractor caused the operator to suffer excessive costs due to the pump problems the drilling contractor received the benefit of having the operator indirectly pay for refurbishment of junk pumps the lack of cementing effectiveness in all casing strings on the banjar panji 1 well played key role in the development of the blowout after the kick was taken on 29 may 2006 casing and cement are required to properly isolate depth zone s throughout the well casing string without an effective cement sheath is of little value in maintaining control of the well the drilling industry including both the operators and the drilling contractors has adopted the practice of preparing job safety analyses jsa before each new task the process is repeated each time different task is required even if the task at prior time had under gone jsa the jsa is an active procedure where the crew members involved with the task meet and discuss the task requirements potential hazards and means to mitigateavoid the hazards on any given daily report for well being drilled it is common that 25 jsas or more will be conducted per day the daily drilling reports ddr for the banjar panji no1 well are noticeably absent of jsas it appears that safety meetings were conducted during cementing operations although these safety meetings were probably requirement of the cementing company and not originated by the operator or drilling contractor in addition to jsas serving as safety program they also serve as an education tool for employees this education function appears to be of significant importance for the apparently inexperienced crew working on the rig leak off tests were performed on each casing string after the float shoe was drilled the lot pressure results shown in the ddrs show the gauges used to capture the pressures resulting in reading variations as an example the lot data for the 16 inch liner had pressure readings from three gauges all which were different the lot program relies on accurate gauge readings which may not have been in play in this case specif ic data points for plotting the lot results were available only for the 16 inch liner 10also lot interpretation on the 16 inch liner which was the only casing lot where the data were available shows questionable practice when ga thering the data the lot should be stopped when the initial leak off is observed this occu rred after approximately three barrels of mud were pumped however the operator continued injection to eight barrels which would have caused the testing fracture to be extended beyond the lengt h required to achieve good test lot similar analyses could not be performed on the shallower casing strings as complete data set was not available improperly selecting the setting depths for casing strings is the cause of most well problems including kicks blowouts stuck pipe and lost ci rculation properly designed and implemented casing setting depth program should avoid these pr oblems or mitigate them if encountered the casing setting depth program was not properly designe d nor was the well plan casing setting depths implemented in drilling of the well this is major contributing cause of the blowout synthetic oil based mud sobm was properly selected to drill the well this mud system has the capability to avoid or reduce hole difficulties relating to shale hydration normally associated with water base mud common industry practice is to conduct kick drills on frequent but random basis this achieves high level of awareness among drilling crew personnel the ddrs do not show that any kick drills were conducted while drilling the well it appears the operator who specifies requirements for kick drills did not appreciate the value of the drills likewise the pumps are run on daily basis at w rate with recorded pressure this slow pump rate spr is required to properly kill kick the ddrs do not indicate that sprs were taken however this information is often containe d in the iadc tour reports which have not been made available in this case the regan annular bop used for the shallow gas section is antiquated and should not be used on several occasions the operator attempted to use the improper sized downhole equipment for the size of wellhead being used this type of error indicates fundamental weakness in the operators technical management and engineering groups cement evaluation log should have been run after cementing each casing string the bop configuration used on the surface casing was improper the daily reports did not contain detailed info rmation concerning the bop testing this information is commonly found on many operators reports it appears the tmmj crew was poor at drilling operations the operator set pipe too shallow for the three casing strings this action invalidated the well plan drilling should have been halted until new well plan could be developed 11the 16 inch casing encountered hole problems when running in the hole th operator elected to set the pipe at the shallower depth the proper pr ocedure was to pull the casing out of the hole and condition the hole prior to rerunning the casing the daily reports did not contain all desired info rmation concerning the casing jobs for all three casing strings the cement jobs on each casing string were ineffective this ultimately provided behindcasing flow path for the blowout fluids the operator used the forbidden practice of reversing out after each open hole cement job the lot procedure for each casing string is questionable the operator did not shut in the well each time that kick signs were observed the 150 ton and 350 ton elevators used to run the 1338 inch casing were too worn to properly run the casing the 150 ton and 350 ton elevators used to run th 1338 inch casing were far below the minimum acceptable elevator rating of 500 ton when usi ng the api requirements this created life threatening situation on the rig floor the 1338 inch casing consisted of 72 lbffoot k 55 grade casing this had collapse rating far below the design requirements the operator improperly designed this casing string it could have failed in adverse conditions it appears the flange bolts on the bops were over stretched and should have been replaced the operator made fatal mistake by their failure to run the planned casing to 6500 feet the operator made fatal mistake by their failure to run the planned casing to 9000 feet the operator should not have drilled into the kujung as deep as 9297 feet without casing the daily geological reports identified trace magnecious metal samples that appeared to have been ignored by the operator massive volcanic sand structure was encountered below 6000 feet to the top of the kujung formation this structure was not anticipated drilling should have been halted until this structure could be assessed as to its impact on the well plan the driller failed to identify numerous pressure increases that would have occurred when bit jets became plugged the operator should not have run used bit back into the well vsp tool was run at 8629 feet the vsp is dow nward looking seismic tool run on wire line it has the same capability of any seismic survey with the exception that its depth is more restricted at 12the depth the vsp was run it should have identifi ed any potential geological anomalies in the next 500 feet the ddr did not provide any information as to the interpretation of the vsp tool lost circulation occurred at 9297 feet the daily reports do not give an indication as to the severity of the losses after losses were observed the operator should not have continued pulling out of the hole at 8700 feet without circulation this suggests that they were attempting to pump while pulling out of the hole the drill string should have been left at 8700 feet or run into the hole to the bottom the operator did not realize that massive lost ci rculation problem existed and can be effectively treated only when the bit is deep into the well near the loss source the inability to measure the drill pipe displacement is another indication that the loss was severe continuing to pull pipe while losses were occurring reduces well bore pressures by reduction in mud hydrostatic pressure and swab pressure the shutin pressure readings of 350 psi on the drill pipe and 450 psi on the casing indicate the kick influx was not from zones entirely below the bit it the kick influx was below the bit pressure readings would be consistent on the drill pipe and casing likely interpretation is that the kicking zone is near the depth of the bit the operator incorrectly diagnosed the depth of the kick influx based on the shut in drill pipe and casing pressures the volumetric method is not recognized method for removal of kick fluids from the well bore unless the kick fluids are all below the bit the kick and hole did not indicate any characteristics that would require implementation of the volumetric method when not required this method should not be used as it easily leads to worseni ng of the situation as best case the volumetric method can be used until the kick fluids are above the bit at which time the drillers method should be used the well did not die as suggested by the ddr the likely scenario is that an underground blowout ugbo was in progress the flow path was pr obably vertically in the poorly cemented casing annulus gas bubbling observed soon after this observation confirms that ugbo was in progress the likely flow origin was proximate to the bit s location at 4291 feet and the flow exiting from the hole path was the 1338 inch liner seat at 3580 feet the loss of 300 barrels of mud further supports the argument that an ugbo was in progr ess it should have been considered by competent rig site personnel the pipe was pulled from 4245 feet to 4241 feet before sticking an interpretation of down hole behavior at this point is important but cant be assessed due to brevity of information in the ddrs the operator did not recognize that the priori ty was the kick and underground blowout potential and not the stuck pipe or the loss circulation at this time loss circulation zones were at the bottom of the hole below 9270 feet and also at relatively shallow depth perhaps at the casing seat the bubbles around the surface at the rig site were the first clear indicator that an ugbo was in progress the changes in bubble height indicate the flow is being gas lifted and not flowing large volumes 13due to source pressure more important interp retation is that the kick source is not abnormal pressured the operator does not appear to have recognized that he was pumping directly into the ugbo flow stream and was having significant effect on the blowout if pumping had continued the blowout may have been killed at this time the rigs mud inventory appears to have been poorly managed that caused the frequent requirements to stop operations and mix mud also the operators focus was on the loss issue and not the blowout issue if the focus had shifted to the blowout the blowout may have been killed the focus was improperly shifted from pumping lcm mud to cement for solving the loss problem cement should never be pumped in live well environment it has conceivable chance of success and is more likely to aggravate the situation by plugging the drill string the operator was too obsessed with the stuck pipe problem while disregarding the ongoing ugbo by this time the ugbo had become an above ground blowout agb rather than running free point survey the operat or should have run temperature log to identify the behind casing flow scenario the operator did not recognize that sticking inside the 1338 inch liner to 3580 feet was highly unlikely unless the most recent circulations carried large volumes of rock cuttings up the casing the operator did not recognize the importance of the rock cuttings operations to cut and remove drill pipe started the plan was to abandon the well at this point it is almost incontrovertible that the operator was grossly inexperienced to handle this situation their actions to cut pipe and attempt well abandonment were as minimum neglig ent this type of action to plug the well is not re commended by any technical publications that are recognized world wide the operation undertaken by the operator has precedence in the recorded history of blowout events based on an analysis of blowout database that contains over 3500 blowout histories actions taken by the operator from this point forward borders on criminal negligence as it endangered personnel the rig and the surrounding environment 1430 forward recommendations 31 introduction during the course of this investigation severa l

types of contracts be reviewed with respect to the lessons learned from the banjar panji 1 blowout 1540 introduction 41 introduction on 29 may 2006 the banjar panji well bl owout the medco board of directors has commissioned an investigation as to causation of the blowout and to develop guidelines based on lessons learned from the event to be used on future wells as means to prevent the reoccurrence of similar event neal adams services nas was commissioned to conduct this investigation and prepare report to the boar d of directors of medco energi to accomplish this objective medco has provided nas with an extensive range of pertinent documentation it is currently believed that the documentation provided by lapindo is adequate to accomplish the objectives of this investigation should other documentation or information become available after this investigation is completed it will be reviewed if necessary this report may be enhanced to reflect the findi ngs from this new material 42 scope of work scope of work sow has been developed nd has served as the guide for conducting this investigation the scope of work follows 1 perform general review of the well bore diagram highlights and chronology already provided and any additional records provided during the defined work period 2 identify possible causes contributing to the loss of control of the well 3 perform preliminary analysis to determine one or more likely sequences of casual factors leading to current well control conditions 4 identify possible means for avoid recurrence of these causes and results in future operations and comment on whether these means are genera lly considered routin industry practices 5 as practical identify methods and data needed to perform more complete analysis and confirmation of what happened and why section 9 contains description of findings applic able to each item in the scope of work the findings used to satisfy the scope of work in sect ion 9 were developed in prior sections of this report 43 work methodology the work methodology used to complete this re port includes 1 detailed study of numerous documents provided by medco to nas 2 tec hnical discussions with medco personnel and 3 site visit to view the banjar panji 1 blowout this report causation factors for the banjar panji 1 blowout was written and submitted to medco subsequent presentations were made to various groups within the medco group 1644 deliverables this report has been delivered to the above referenced contact person in the form of digital file 1750 discussion of seismic analyses 51 introduction an investigation has been conducted of the seismic data and analysis acquired at time prior to drilling of the banjar panji well although this anal ysis does not appear to have any direct cause of the blowout it was necessary to study the techni cal area interpretation of the seismic data was conducted by medco at prior time and reviewed by nas it appears that medcos interpretation is correct 52 seismic analysis seismic survey and analysis was conducted over part of the brantas block at prior time figure 51 shows the location of the seismic lines shot in the banjar panji porong area figure 52 shows the shot line most proximate to the site location for the banjar panji well pertinent faults have been emphasized with red lines by the medco seismic group prime fault intersects the banjar panji well at 4610 feet to 5 520 feet the type of faulting seen in figure 52 is common to salt or mud diapirs it is likely that most of the faults shown in figure 52 are sealed primarily due to the hydratable clays in the shale deposition region the faults should remain sealed and not pose any drilling problems unless some tectonic activity occurs drill site selection in faulted area such as that shown in figure 52 must be done with caution faults can be associated with lost circulation and unstable hole conditions kick fluids can move through sections of fault if unsealed it is recommended to avoid selected drill site in an area proximate to faults if requirement for drilling exists the recommended approach is to select site in faultfree area and directional drill to the primary target proper planning is important and should involve individuals from seismic geology and drilling groups 18 19 20 60 discussion of geological conditions 61 introduction the geology in the area of the banjar panji well has been extensively studied by medcos geology group their work has been reviewed pertinent parts of th eir work have been incorporated in this report the most important geological factors affecting the planning and drilling of well are the formation pore pressure and the formation rock strength fracture pressure these two pressures control minimum and maximum mud weights mud and cement programs and casing setting depth selection also they can affect hole stability and well control 62 analyses of specific geological conditions figure 61 illustrates the as planned and as drilled geology the figure also shows the porong 1 well which was used as an offset guide it is quickly apparent that the as drilled geology in the banjar panji 1 well is substantially different than th as planned geology the region below 6000 feet is comprised of vol canic sandstone also the 0 1500 feet region shows variations the substantially different geological condition s between as planned and as drilled should have given rise to intensive discussions and reevaluation of the wel l plan as soon as the new conditions were observed the well plan for th banjar panji well as planned would probably require some modification before the well could be safely drilled however uncertainty associated with the geology in the deeper hole section made it unlikely that the well could be confidently drilled and not pose hazards the available info rmation used in preparing this report does not contain any indication that lapindo gave any cons ideration to the necessary modifications to the well plan 21 22 70 analyses of the banjar panji 1 well plan 71 introduction the well plan is the primary source of information used to complete section 7 from this source an analysis of the well plan has been completed the findings from the analyses fall into two categories the first category contains general findings that can be applied throughout operations in running form the second category contains findings for specific point in the well plan both categories are presented in the following sections 72 general comments from the well plan 721 introduction the general comments presented in this section 72 apply to all operations on the bjp well 722 good practice andor industry practice the well plan frequently used terms such as good practice or industry practice the oil industry does not have an accepted body of guidelines that falls into these categories operators often use these vague and ambiguous terms when they are not technically competent or do not wish to devote the required timie to devel op their desired guidelines on specific topics 723 medici to control the well plan contains references that medici will control specific operations it does not appear that medici has the authority to control any opera tions on its own accord various contract terms indicates that lapindo retains ultimate control of all operations 724 offset wells the well plan references two offset wells that may or may not have been used to develop the well plan information from these two offset wells shoul d have been included as an attachment to the well plan 725 casing setting depth selection specific casing setting depth program is provided in the well plan basis is given for the reasoning used to select the casing setting depths the plan does not contain any information that indicates that the casing setting depths are optiona l or that they can be ignored the operators violation of this program caused the well to blowout 2373 specific comments from the analysis of the well plan some quotations from the well plan are quoted here comments are shown following the quotes and are printed in an italics print analyses of ba njar panji 1 well plan report section operation critique comments lapindo brantas inc drilling program banjar panji1 prepared by pt medici citra nusa idpm contractor 2 geolgical information the banjar panji1 exploration well is loca ted in lapindos working area onshore east java near podong sidoarjo the nearest offset we lls that have been drilled are pojong1 and wunut2 which are located 67 km nee and 12 km west of banjar panji1 respectively the well plan references two offset wells presumab ly used as guide for preparing the well plan for the bjp well as the porong1 and wunut2 which are located as shown in the above paragraph the well plan contain s some information from the porong1 well most distant from the bjp well it d oesnt appear that the wunut well was used in planning the bjp well the well most proximate to the bjp well is usually the most reliable offset well this practice was n ot followed in this case further the well plan did not provide an explanation as to the reason that the porong1 well was used in preference to the wunut well which is most proximate to the bjp well site good practice with respect to offset wells used to prepare well plan for proposed well is to attach all available offset wel l information to the proposed well plan this practice makes the information availabl at the rig site in the event the proposed well deviates from the plan while drilling the on site supervision can look to the offset well data for possible informat ion that may be pertinent to the observed departure this well is deeper than normal for the area whil normal temperature gradient is expected as in the offset wells higher than norm temperature gradient should be anticipated where bottom hole temperature may reac h the extreme of the down hole equipment temperature ratings this paragraph conveys confusing conundrum to fie ld supervisors it indicates that normal temperatures are expected yet abnormally hig h temperatures made be encountered field supervisors should be provided with the supporting information used to make these statements without the proper supporting information the field supervisors are hindered in performing their job as signments and will not be able to 24identify and understand temperature anoma lies this responsibility becomes even more critical for any well being drilled in possi ble geothermal environment the well is expected to penetrate into the overpressured formations more casing and liner strings need to be set at the planned dep th the success to complete this well safely as planned rely significantl on down hole actual conditions and supervisors diligent to set casingliner shoe at t he right depth the need for qualified field supervision and the best pore pressure prediction crew are definitely emphasized in the critical well this paragraph when viewed from the actu well operations indicates weakness on the part of the operator the statements sugges t that the operator understands the critical nature of setting pipe at select ed depths in the well however the actual well site operations where important casing strings were not set indicate 1 the operator does not comprehend the necessity for prop er casing setting depths 2 the operators lack of convicti on in following its own well plan and 3 the lack of technical competence with lapindos engineering gro up medicis engineering group and their rig site supervisors 31 safety all work is to be conducted in accordance with lapi ndo brantas inc and medici citra nusa mcn safety policy the safety policies of lapindo and medici have not been made available for review if this information should become available it is bel ieved that numerous violations would be identified as relates to drilling operati ons on the bjp well safety meeting should be held on regular basis or prior to any hazardous operation eg casing running cementing perforating testin g etc attended by all crews ie drilling crews service companies and mcn drilling supervisor the ddrs contain only few notations relative to c onducting safety meetings if proper practice were followed the few safety meeti ngs noted in the ddrs were initiated by third party contractors rather than lapindo andor medici bop drill and pit drill should be conducted by ever shift before and during drilling 8 12 inch pilot hole and at anytime on re

document co ntaining good drilling practices the american petroleum institute api publishes ries of documents known as recommended practices or rps that appl to broad array of specific of topics the term good drilling practices is often used by operators when they dont have the technical capability to identify specific pract ices to be followed with respect to the apis collection of rps lapind and medici violated numerous of the p i s ugge s d pra c tic s s ome viola tions we re of s uc h s ve rity s to ve endangered the lives of crew members section 8 co ntains some references to these violations of api rps 33 well bore schematic figures 71 and 72 show the as planned well schem atic and the as drilled well schematic figures shown at the end of section 3 figure 72 can be used to note that the planned casin g strings at 6500 feet and at 9000 feet were not run running and cementing either or both pipe strings s hould have prevented the blowout 35 pore pressure mud weight and formation streng th figure 73 shows the anticipated pore pres sures and fracture pr essures for the bjp well the well plan does not indicate the source f this critical data the fracture pressures from 0 2000 feet were not provided so the same pressures for the 8000 feet to 10000 feet interval were not availab proper well plan can not be generated without complete understanding of fract ure pressures throughout all sections of the well the proposed well schematic sh own in figure 71 is improperly designed to address the formation pressures in figure 73 nonetheless it is likely this well schematic would have prevented the blowout if it had been pro perly implemented the only published and accepted casing setting dept h selection program is found in the book drilling engineering well planning ap proach by neal adams 1984 and the society of petroleum engineers new textbook fo r university undergraduate students the casing setting depth and well planni ng sections in this book were authored by neal adams this technique by adams has been applied for the fo rmation pressure and fracture pressure data shown in figure 73 the results are shown in figure 74 to figure 78 casing andor liner depths are shown pipe and hol sizes not shown here would be developed on several other variables 41 shallow gas although at this flank location shallow gas is xpected there was shallow gas kick experienced in well tga1 located around the rea at around 1250 feet an 8 12 inch pilot hole is intended as mitiga tion plan for the shallow gas hazard close monitor on the mud density in and out of hole and g as presence in the mud out are required at all time until the surface casi ng is set and cemented be prepared with sufficient kill mud before drilling the pilot hole and perform good practice for the trip out of the hole the operators description of shallow gas handling procedures to be employed on the bjp well is inadequate if these procedures would have become necessary the 26shallow gas would have created surface blowout 44 potential lost circulation lost circulation may be encountered when drilling c arbonates possible pressure reversal from 156 lbsgal to lower mud weight may occur in kujung formation which could cause loss of hydrostatic and induce for well kick this problem was experienced in porong1 well stop drilling at the right 958 inch casing point or set 958 inch casing inside kujung is very critical to the success of handling losses when drilling kujung formation close control over flui d level and any signs of loss circulation should be treated accordingly ensure nough stock of lcm materials at the rig site this paragraph suggests the operator realizes the i mportance of setting the 958 inch casing and the equally important point of sett ing it at precise depth unfortunately the operator violated their well pla n that ultimately caused the bjp blowout 54 drill 141 2 inch x 17 inch hole and set 133 8 inch casing 5 maximum of 10 barrels kick with 04 lbsgal kick tolerance is allowed at shoe the operator establishes kick tolerance limitatio n unfortunately they did not recognize that kick tolerance calculations are meaningless and are usually employed by those operators that have developed an improper well plan such as was realized on the bjp well 56 drill 105 8 inch x 121 4 inch hole and set 9 5 8 inch casing set 95 8 inch shoe inside kujung carbonate 2 gg are to pick 1520 feet depth inside top sect ion of kujung carbonate porong1 indicated first drilling break around 44 feet below top carbonate gg are requested to confirm on this otherwise reduce the footage in side kujung carbonate to 1015 feet for safety purpose the operator failed to implement this part of their well plan their failure leads to the blowout on the bjp well 646 well control guidelines 1 after surface casing is set and the bop st ack has been run the well will be shutin in the event of kick it will not be diverted drillers method will be used deviation to this should get lapindos approval throughout the well several occurrences were obser ved where the well was flowing contrary to their requirement in the well plan the did not shut in these kick signs 8 blowout drills will be conducted every shift unt il supervisor is satisfied with all crews performance there after weekly for each cre w the ddrs do not indicated that the operat ors requirements for pit and kick drills were followed 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 3580 discussion of drilling and well control operations on the banjar panji 1 well 81 introduction the daily drilling reports ddrs contain the primary source of information used to complete section 8 from this primary source an analysis of drilling and well control operations has been completed the findings from the analyses fall into two categories the first category contains general findings that can be applied throughout operations in running form the second category contains findings that are specific to day or an event both categories of findings are presented in the following sections 82 general comments from analyses of the daily drilling reports 821 introduction the general comments presented in this section 82 apply to all operations on the banjar panji well bjp 822 rig operating efficiency measure of rig efficiency is to compare the actual drilling time to the down time for rig repairs waiting on parts etc this comparison is known as the efficiency ratio er consider the case of properly functioning rig with equipment that has been tested refurbished by the oem and has the complete certification paper work from the oems an anticipated ratio of drilling time to down time is in the range of 151 to as high as 201 this is interpreted to mean that the rig can drill 15 20 hrs per 1 hour of downrepair time drilling time and down time was calculated for the banjar panji 1 well the drilling time was 3265 hours while the down time was 8305 hours this gives an er of 03911 and indicates that the tiga musi masa java tmmj 4 rig provi ded horrible operating efficiency this poor performance may be unmatched in the modern drilling era at some point the operator should have notified medici that they were in default either by fact or implied of their ipdm contract they should have been put on notice the operator should have reconsidered the viability of this well with the tmmj 4 rig the rigs performance history could sugge st that it jeopardized the potential for successfully drilling the well technical reasons were provided in the ddrs nor could reason be logically inferred as to the operators extraordinary tolerance to the drilling contractors relentless equipment problems the operators tolerance may be related to the conflict of interest issue caused by partial joint ownership of the operator and the drilling contractor 36the operator should have made the decision to rent mud pumps rather than spend time with repeated attempts to effect repairs the drilling contractor caused the operator to suffer excessive costs due to the pump problems the drilling contractor received the benefit of having the operator indirectly pay for refurbishment of junk pumps 823 cementing the lack of cementing effectiveness in all casing strings on the banjar panji 1 well played key role in the development of the blowout after the kick was taken on 29 may 2006 casing and cement are required to properly isolate depth zone s throughout the well casing string without an effective cement sheath is of little value in maintaining control of the well 824 job safety analyses the drilling industry including both the operators and the drilling contractors has adopted the practice of preparing job safety analyses jsa before each new task the process is repeated each time different task is required even if the task at prior time had under gone jsa the jsa is an active procedure where the crew members involved with the task meet and discuss the task requirements potential hazards and means to mitigateavoid the hazards on any given daily report for well being drilled it is common that 25 jsas or more will be conducted per day the daily drilling reports ddr for the banjar panji no1 well are noticeably absent of jsas it appears that safety meetings were conducted during cementing operations although these safety meetings were probably requirement of the cementing company and not originated by the operator or drilling contractor in addition to jsas serving as safety program they also serve as an education tool for employees this education function appears to be of signifi cant importance for the apparently inexperienced crew working on the rig 825 leak off testing leak off tests were performed on each casing string after the float shoe was drilled the lot pressure results shown in the ddrs show the gauges used to capture the pressures resulting in reading variations as an example the lot data for the 16 inch liner had pressure readings from three gauges all which were different the lot program relies on accurate gauge readings which may not have been in play in this case specif ic data points for plotting the lot results were available only for the 16 inch liner also lot interpretation on the 16 inch liner which was the only casing lot where the data were available shows questionable practice when ga thering the data the lot should be stopped when the initial leak off is observed this occu rred after approximately three barrels of mud were pumped however the operator continued injection to eight barrels which would have caused the testing fracture to be extended beyond the lengt h required to achieve good test lot similar analyses could not be performed on the shallower casing strings as complete data set was not available 37826 casing setting depths improperly selecting the setting depths for casing strings is the cause of most well problems including kicks blowouts stuck pipe and lost ci rculation properly designed and implemented casing setting depth program should avoid these pr oblems or mitigate them if encountered the casing setting depth program was not properly designe d nor was the well plan casing setting depths implemented in drilling of the well this is major contributing cause of the blowout 827 synthetic oil based mud synthetic oil based mud sobm was properly selected to drill the well this mud system has the capability to avoid or reduce hole difficulties relating to shale hydration normally associated with water base mud 828 kick drills common industry practice is to conduct kick drills on frequent but random basis this achieves high level of awareness among drilling crew personnel the ddrs do not show that any kick drills were conducted while drilling the well it appears the operator who specifies requirements for kick drills did not appreciate the value of the drills 829 slow pump rates likewise the pumps are run on daily basis at w rate with recorded pressure this slow pump rate spr is required to properly kill kick the ddrs do not indicate that sprs were taken however this information is often containe d in the iadc tour reports which have not been made available in this case 3883 specific comments from analyses of the daily drilling reports analyses of drilling operations report date hours operation critique comments

shallow gas hand ling efforts is that shallow gas kicks almost certainly become blowouts in matter of seconds it is not possible to take shallow gas kick and kill it with conventional proc edures that would be used for kick from deeper interval 2 circulated the hole 35 pulled out of hole while pumping 05 prepared bha with 26 inch bit 9 repair 2912 inch annular bop 99 5 safety precaution of run in

annular engineer w as appropriate it is assumed that the operator used oem parts for annular repairs the regan annular preventer is used on this well as bop for controlling shallow gas blowouts the regan an nular bop has poor performance record for this type of application for this reason most operators appear to have elected to use other manufacturers such as shaffer cameron or hydril 514 11 14

depth of 1237 feet and the actual setting dept h of 1195 feet is not large but could be viewed as precursor to the operator s failure to comply with the well plan 2 circulated the hole 25 short trip

have assessed the holes tenden cy for packing off the potential for packing off could bstantially increase for running the next casing string it appears that departure from the forecasted pressure had occurred the failure to interpret thi s observation relative to the long term health of th well was critical over sight at this point the operator should have determined that the banjar panji 1 drilling ope ration was in jeopardy of failure and could result in more substantial adverse effects ch as blowout which was realized later 6 circulated and increased mud weight from 118 lb sgal to 124 lbsgal called casing point at 2304 feet ins tead of 3200 feet as per drilling program the decision to set casing at 2304 feet instead of the planned 3200 feet proved to be terminal error as minimum the operator should have recognized t he long term significance of setting pipe too shallow this action invalidated the existing well plan for the b anjar panji well drilling operations should have been discont inued until new well plan could be developed and approved 4 pull out of hole while pumping run back to bot tom 15 circulated and then pulled ou t of the hole for logging 35 pulled out of

specified by oem literature equipment such as liner hanger can only be repair ed by the oem this is widely accepted by the oil indust ry regulatory agencies and other certifying bodies it is inconceivable and unforgivable that the sizin g of the liner hanger relative to the inside of the well hea d had not been identified prior to this problem as this type of problem had already occurred on several prior instances an argument can be made that the operator was incompet ent negligent or both due to the serious nature of th is type of over sight on repeated basis the operator shoul d

be selected b ased on 35 design factor thus the elevator rating shou ld be 35 x 257700 lbf or 901950 lbf the elevator rating t hat exceeds this value is the 500 ton elevator the des ign factor of 35 is used to avoid catastro phic failures of the casing at the rig floor level the operator used 150 ton elevators initially this elevator was substantially below the api design level of 500 ton elevators this selection borders on criminally end angering personnel members working on the rig floor for unexplained reasons the operator changed out t he 150 ton spider elevator for 350 ton unit

the drill pipe total v olume displacement was hard to counter continued to pull to 4500 feet the operator should not have continued pulling out of the hole at 8700 feet without circulation this sugge sts that they were attempting to pump while pulling out of t he hole the drill string should have been left at 8700 fee t or run into the hole to the bottom the operator did not r ealize that massive lost circulatio n problem existed and can be effectively treated only when the bit is deep into the well near the loss source the inability to measure the drill pipe displacemen t is another indication that the loss was severe continuing to pull pipe while losses were occurring reduces well bore pressures by reduction in mud hydrostat ic pressure and swab pressure 29 3 pulled to 4245 feet

350 psi on the dri ll pipe and 450 psi on the casing indicate the kick influx was not from zones entirely below the bit it the kick infl ux was below the bit pressure readings would be consisten t on the drill pipe and casing likely interpretation is t hat the kic king z ne is ne r the d pth f the bit t he pe r to r incorrectly diagnosed the depth of the kick influx based on the shut in drill pipe and casing pressures see f igures 82 and 83 the volumetric method is not recognized method fo r removal of kick fluids from the well bore unless t he kick fluids are all below the bit the kick and hole did not 55indicate any characteristics that would require implementation of the volumetric method when not required this method should not be used as it easi ly leads to worsening of the situation as best case th volumetric method can be used until the kick fluids are above the bit at which time the drillers method s hould be used the well did not die as suggested by the ddr the l ikely scenario is that an underground blowout ugbo wa s in progress the flow path was probably vertically in the poorly cemented casing annu lus gas bubbling observed soon after this observation confirms that ugbo wa s in progress the likely flow orig in was proximate to the bits location at 4291 feet and the flow exiting from th hole path was the 1338 inch liner seat at 3580 feet the loss of 300 barrels of mud further supports the argument that an ugbo was in progress it should have been consider ed by competent rig site personnel the pipe was pulled from 4245 feet to 4241 feet b efore sticking an interpretation of down hole behavior at this point is important but cant be assessed due to bre vity of information in the ddrs the mud weight reduction to 89 lbsgal indicates t he sobm at

minutes elapsed between eac h bubble the changes in bubble height indicate the flow is b eing gas lifted and not flowing large volumes due to source pressure more important interpretation is that the kick source is not abnormal pressured the operator does not appear to have recognized tha t he was pumping directly into the ugbo flow stream and was having significant effect on the blowout if pum ping had continued the blowout may have been killed at this time 5 mixed 160 lbsgal mud mixed with lcm the rigs mud inventory appears to have been poorly managed that caused the frequent requirement
