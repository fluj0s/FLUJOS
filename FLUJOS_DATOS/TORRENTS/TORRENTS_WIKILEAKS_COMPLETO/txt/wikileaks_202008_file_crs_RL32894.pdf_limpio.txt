government government and finance division httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32894antidoping policies the olympics and selected professional sports summary the use of performanceenhancing substan ces by athletes has long history predating the ancient greek olympiads concern about this practice was manifested in the 20th century by in the case of the olympics the creation of antidoping organizations and the adoption of antidopi ng policies by these organizations and professional sports leagues in the united states leading the way was the international olympic committee ioc wh ich implemented testing in 1968 at the olympic games in grenoble france and mexico city mexico beginning in the 1980s several professiona l sports leagues in the united states such as the national football league nfl and major l eague baseball mlb followed suit this report compares current antidoping policies for performance enhancing substances among the olympic movement and six professiona l sports leagues details associated with the policies of the olympics major league baseball the nfl and the national basketball association nba policies are presented in table 1 table 2 includes the same deta ils about the policies of major league soccer mls the womens national basketball association wnba and the national hockey league nhl the report also presents elements of what have been identified as model antidoping policies and in the appe ndix provides comparison of major league baseballs former and current antidoping policies table 3 and glossary of related terms in general the report indicates that the antidoping policies for the olympic movement are more independent of the sports they regulate than are the policies of the six professional sports leagues discu ssed in this report both in the manner in which they are established and in the tities responsible for their implementation for example the world antidoping agen cy wada unilaterally established the antidoping policy for olympic athletes wh ereas the professional sports leagues policies are the result of negotiations with their respective players associations the olympic movement also maintains the most comprehensive list of prohibited substances and methods and provides sanctions that are more strict than in the professional sports for example the olym pic standard provides twoyear ban for first violation whereas th nba imposes 10game suspension without pay for first violation direct comparison of these sports is sometimes difficult b ecause the policies use different terminology or make reference to other standards the policies are also constantly changing in response to the development of new substances that are sometimes designed to avoid detection in some cases the policies prohibit certain substances for which tests are not available in order to inform at hletes about harmful substances however in other cases tests and sanctions are not provided for substances for which tests are available this report will be updated as antidoping policies change and elements of those policies become clearerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32894contents n t i d p i n g p l i c i s 1 l m p i c p l i c i s m r i n d p n d n

policies the olympics and selected professional sports antidoping policies while the use of drugs and other substances such as alcohol ether strychnine anabolic steroids stimulants and hallucinogenic mushrooms as means of improving athletic performance has lengthy history predating the ancient greek olympiads condemnation of the practice did not surface until the early 20th century1 in 1933 dr otto reiser commented that the use of artificial means to improve performance has long been considered wholly incompatible with the spirit of sport and has therefore been condemned nevertheless we all know that this rule is continually being broken and that sportive competitions are often more matte r of doping than of training it is highly regrettable that those who are in charge of supervising sport seem to lack the energy for the campaign against this evil and that lax and fateful attitude is spreading2 despite such concerns about the us of performanceenhancing substances pes by athletes antidoping policies for the olympic m ovement and veral major professional sports leagues in the united states were not drafted until the latter part of the 20th century on the other hand the two youngest sports leagues major league soccer mls and the womens national basketball association wnba first addressed the issue of performan ceenhancing substances when they were created the

olympic movement are more independent of the sports they regulate than are the policies of major league baseball the nba the nfl mls the nhl and the wnba both in the manner in which they are

associations and the leagues for example the medical director that administers the nbas antidoping policy is selected jointly by the nba and the national basketball players association n bpa by

the olympic movement and mls maintain the most comprehensive lists of prohibited substances and methods major league soccer has incorporated wadas list of prohibited substances into its doping policy the development of comprehensive list by wada may be due at least in part to the general understanding that some substances or drug s benefit only athletes in certain sports9 for example drug that slows down heart rate and reduces fine motor tremors would be more helpful to an archer than bask etball player another feature on which the olympic movement and most pr ofessional sports leagues di ffer is whether an athlete is responsible for the substances discove red is in his or her body in both the olympics and the nfl an athlete is responsible but the policies of other professional leagues either ar silent on this issue or include provisions that suggest an athlete may not be subject to strict liability for substances in his or her body sanctions for testing positive also vary the olympic movement imposes the most stringent penalties the first violation results in twoyear ban and second violation results in lifetime ban from competition as defined by wada10 in contrast in the nba first violation results in 10ga suspension second violation results in 25game suspension and third viola tion leads to oneyear suspension issues in comparing antidoping policies the structure and content of these spor ts antidoping policies vary in number of ways including the subjects covered in those policies the extent of detail provided and the language nd terminology used to iden tify or descri be prohibitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32894crs5 11 the federal government has established five schedules of controlled substances the following three criteria are used to determine on which schedule to place substance or drug its potential for abuse whether the ite m has currently accepted medical use in the united states and the probability that abuse of the substance could lead to physical or psychological dependence schedule i include s substances and drugs that have high potential for abuse that currently have accepted medical use in the united states and that lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision substances and drugs listed on one of the remaining four schedules have currently accepted medical uses and the potential for abuse and the probability that

substances in sport and exercise p 330 substances as result direct comparison of the policies is extremely difficult and certain of their provisions may be subject to differing interpretations also various contextual factors need to be considered when comparing the different sports anti doping policies identifying prohibite d substancesmethods it is sometimes difficult to determine which specific substances and methods are prohibited in an antidoping policy as result it is difficult to compare those policies these difficulties can arise when different policies use different rminology or when policy refers to an associated statute or standard for example major league baseballs list of prohibited substances incorporates by refe rence several of th federal governments lists of controlled substances11 examples of substance names found on one of the lists of controlled substances are thi opental phendimetiazine and clortermine however it is not clear whether any of th substances are beta2 agonists agents with antiestrogenic activity glucocorticos teroids or betablockers classes of substances identified by wada as perform anceenhancing substances our efforts to obtain clarification from major league baseball or the players association on this and other matters are continuing changing nature of policies the nature of the problem of doping in sports has implications for the creation of lists of prohibited s ubstances and testing policies in some cases performance enha ncing substances being used by athletes may not appear on the lists of prohibited substances because sports officials are not aware of their existence or use for exam ple in an effort to evade detection of steroid use some athletes use designer steroids whic h are described as follows designer or new steroid is subs tance that has been chemically produced synthesized in the laboratoryand that retains the anabolic properties desired for such drug at the same time the mo lecular structure is chemically altered so that the currently used steroid scre ening test will not find the drug in an athletes specimen12 when it was created tetrahydrogestrinone thg was designer steroid thg became known after thenanonymous track and field coach in the united states provided sample to usada which forwar ded the sample to the ucla olympic analytic laboratory using this sample

note h for additional information about the bloodbased test for human continuedsubstance13 because designer steroids are deve loped specifically to avoid detection it is impossible for antidoping organizations or sports leagues to include them on their lists of prohibited substances therefore as new doping methods become known antidoping policies must be revisited from time to time to ensure they are up to date some of the professional s ports included in this report have changed their anti doping policies the nfls most recent ch ange added agents with antiestrogenic activity to its list of prohibited substances increased the number of times player may be tested during the offseason from two to six and lowered the ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone that constitutes presumptively positive test comparison of major league baseba lls former and current policies table 3 in the appendix also shows severa l significant differences under the original policy which applied to the 2003 and 2004 s easons hormones may not have been prohibited the list of sanctions allowed firsttime offenders to be placed in treatment program and permitted the imposition of fine in lieu of suspension without pay for second through fifth viola tions and testing wa s not conducted during the offseason the policy in place fo r the 2006 season prohibits the use of hormones imposes 50game suspension without pay for first violation 100 game suspension without pay for second violation and permanent suspension for third violation and includes provision for offseason testing tests or sanctions for some prohibited substances antidoping policies may not provide tests or sanctions for certain prohibited substances in some cases tests for those substances are availa ble but are not bein g used for

known substances for which there are laborator tests or in the case of hormones and other substances that occur naturally in the human body for which there is an insufficient amount of data to determine what levels of hormones are abnormal or indicative of abuse and what levels are normal15 for example natural hormones other than testosterone such as hum an chorionic gonadotropin insulin and erythropoietin may be found on lists of prohibited substa nces but laboratory tests may not be available yet and what cons titutes an abnormal vel in the human body may not yet have been determined nevertheless including substances for which laboratory tests do not exist on list of prohibited substances may serve an organizations purposes for example an organization may establish list not only to alert athletes to doping tests but also to inform them about harmful substances one of the purposes of the world anti doping program and the world antidoping code is to protect the athletes fundamental right to participate in dopingfr ee sport and thus promote health fairness and equality for athletes worldwide16 certain elements of the rationale for the code may also have bearing on the inclusi on of substances for which tests are not yet available these include for example ethics fair play and honesty health character and education respect for rule s and laws respect for self and other participants17 the national football league c ites three reasons including the health of players for its concern bout the use of prohibited substances they threaten the fairness and integr ity of the athletic competition on the playing field the league is concerne d with the adverse health effects of steroid use although research is tinuing steroid use has been linked to number of physiological psychological orthopedic reproductive and other serious health problems the use of prohibited substances by nfl players sends the wrong message to young people who may be tempted to use them18 thus it appears that wada and the nfl and possibly other organizations as well recognize that the value of an antidoping program or policy ex tends beyond testing to include messages about harmful substan ces and how they might undermine athletic competitionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32894crs8 19 it bears noting that nfl players also ar banned from participating in any endorsement

of terry madden chief executive officer unite d states antidoping agency unpublished available from the authorelements of model antidoping policies experts in the field of drug testing nd policy have describe d what they believe to be the requisite elements of an ffective antidoping policy for example speaking at senate committee hearing in 2004 the chief executive officer of usada said such policy begins with sample collection plan that includes appropriately timed year round noadvancenotice testing the plan must provide for the collection of samples at the time that athletes most benefit from doping and must be flexible and responsive to evolving doping techniques must be built around comprehensive list of categories of prohibited substances and methods programs must incorporate sufficient flexibility to deal with the creation and use of desig ner drugs therefore the continued dedication of resources to the testing laboratories that are charged with developing and validating testing methods for this wide array of substances is an important aspect of deterrence also combines defined sanctions of fficient magnitude to deter drug use with fair means of imposing such sanctions significantly while usada believes the privacy rights of individuals accused of doping violation must be respected individuals right should outweigh the rights of all athletes to compete in clean sport and to be assured that those who break the rules are appropriately sanctioned provides for the education of athl etes as to why healthy competition is important and why taking the uninformed h ealth risks associated with prohibited substances is bad choice the achievements in sports like the achievements in life should be the result of hard work commitment and dedication must devote significant resources to research for the detection of new doping substances and techniques and the pursuit of scientific excellence in doping control20 similarly general barry r mccaffrey us army ret thendirector office of national drug control po licy appeared at senate hearing in 1999 and stated that with regard to international comp etition the agency was focused on achieving these principles truly independent and account able international antidoping agency testing on 365dayayear notice basis statute of limitations whenever evidence becomes available that an athlete cheated by doping the athlete will be stripped of his or her honorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32894crs23 21 us congress senate committee on commerce science and transportation effects of performance enhancing

tomorrows scientific advances and advanced research to end the present catandmouse game of dopingby closing the loopholes created by gaps in science 21 conclusion combining elements of maddens and mccaffreys plans such as well thoughtout sample collection plan and co mprehensive list of prohibited substances could result in an antidoping program that would increase the probability of catching athletes who use prohibited substances whic h in turn might also increase athletes perceived risk of being caught for exampl requiring that samples be preserved for at least 10 years could aid in identifyi ng athletes who have used performance enhancing substances that we re undetectable previously as the investigation of the bay area laboratory cooperative balco has shown it is possible for individuals to develop what are known as signer steroids substances that are advertised as providing effects similar to steroids but are not identifiable by conventional boratory tests22 10year or longer re tention period could help in closing this gap particularly if it is accompanied by an aggressive research program aimed at detecting and deve loping tests for previously unknown substances also imposing sanctions of sufficient magnitude and providing an education program on health risks could help to c ounterbalance incentives that mig ht prompt athletes to use prohibited substances finally establishm ent of an independent agency to manage testing education and research appear s to be vital to successful antidoping program it would seem desirable to place these functions in an organization independent from the organization that is responsible for supporting or employing athletes and that benefits directly or even indirectly from their performances while the antidoping initiative of the olympic movement includes many of these elements it is uncertain whether major professional sports leagues in the united states such as major league ba seball and the nba and nfl are in position to take similar steps public pressure and congressional interest may have played role in prompting major league baseball and the players association to re open their collective bargai ning
