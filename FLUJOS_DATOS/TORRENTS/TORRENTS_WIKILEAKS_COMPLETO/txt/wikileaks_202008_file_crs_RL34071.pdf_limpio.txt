reversion of hong kong from british to chinese sovereignty much has changed and little has changed on the political front the hong kong special administrative region hksar has selected its first chief executive only to have him step down and be replaced in process not without some controversy meanwhile belated changes by the british in the makeup of hong kongs legislative council legco were initially undone but subsequent changes in the legco selection process have brought things back nearly full circle to where they stood prior to the handover there is also unease about the independence of hong kongs judicial system and the protection provided by hong kongs basic law in light of decisions made by the chinese government similarly the civil liberties of the people of hong kong remain largely intact in part this can be attributed to the increased politicization of the people of hong kong the freedom of the press in hong kong is still strong but also faces challengesboth on the legal front and from allegations of selfcensorship on the part of the media owners reluctant to antagonize the peoples republic of china yet even with these challenges many hong kong residents do not appear to perceive decline in their civil liberties since 1997 economically hong kong is still major international financial center and leading gateway into china however hong kongs economic in teraction with the chinese mainland has grown deeper and broader over the last 10 years than was expected increasing the citys economic connections with china this closer tie to the mainland is being bolstered by the signing of free trade agreement in 2003 called the closer economic partnership arrangement or cepa between china and hong kong current economic and trade dynamics have raised concerns that hong kongs relationship with china will shift in the long run from one of synergy to full integration possibly undermining the hksars high degree of autonomy recent social and cultural trends appear to reflect some apprehension about the longterm implications of current economic and political trends there has been decline in hong kongs expatriate expat community including us nationals also there is perception that hong kongs middle class is disappearing underlying many of these social and cultural trends is redefinition of hong kong by its residents indicating closer identification with china at present few of these longterm trends have had significant effect on hong kongs political or economic situation and its relations with the united states under the ushong kong policy act of 1992 pl 102383 the united states treats ho ng kong as separate entity in variety of political and economic areas so long as the hksar remains sufficiently autonomous from china while hong kong

passed since the establishment of the hong kong special administrative region or the hksar on july 1 1997 the event commonly referred to as the handover marked the end of 155 years of british colonial rule and chinas resumption of full sovereignty over hong kong during the last 10 years there have been modest changes in hong kongs political situation and more significant changes in its economy these political and economic changes have had an impact on hong kongs social and cultural identity despite some political and economic setbacks the hksar remains vibrant international trade hub in asia the actual transferral of sovereignty over hong kong was governed by the joint declaration of the government of the united kingdom of gr eat britain and northern ireland and the government of the peoples republic of china on the question of hong kong commonly referred to simply as the joint declaration signed on december 19 1984 in beijing 2 under the terms of the joint declaration china promised that hong kong would enjoy high degree of autonomy and the current social and economic systems in hong kong will remain unchanged for 50 years the joint declaration also required chinas national peoples congress npc to pass basic law of the hong kong special administrative region generally referred to as the basic law stipulating ch inas policies on hong kong that are consistent with the terms of the joint declaration the national peoples congress passed the basic law on april 4 19903 hong kong has long been important to the united states in several ways first hong kong is major entrepôt in asia especially for trade with china second hong kongs longstanding open trade policy has made it major ally for us efforts to liberalize international trade third hong kongs common law legal system and its respect for civil liberties are bellwether in asia for human rights congressional interest in hong kong was demonstrated by the passage the united stateshong kong policy act of 1992 pl 102383 the act commits the united states to treating the hksar as separate entity from the rest of china in variety of political economic trade and other areas so long as the hksar remains sufficiently autonomous to warrant special treatment section 202 of the united stateshong kong policy act empowers the president to make the determination of the status of hong kongs autonomy

foreign policy which naturally applies to united states policy toward hong kong plus the act states that the human rights of the people of hong kong are of great importance to the united states and

democratization of the selection of the hksars chief executive and legislative council legco and towards the goal of universal suffrage in hong kong in the area of civil liberties the freedoms enjoyed under british rule have continued since the handover vi rtually unchanged with the notable exception of the controversy surrounding the proposed antisedition legislation in 2003 the freedoms of speech and assembly appear to have been largely respected by the chinese and hksar governments but there is concern about selfcensorship by some in the hong kong media after 1997 hong kongs economy was subject to seri of external shocks that precipitated and prolonged recession the asian financial crisis of 1997 5 which began almost concurrently with the handover had ripple effect on hong kong resulting in major asset value realignment commodity price and wage deflation and decline in the citys gross domestic product gdp hong kongs economic recovery was then delayed by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars in the be ginning of 2003 however since the end of the sars outbreak hong kongs economy has rebounded in part due to its deepening trade relations with the chinese mainland6 in addition to hong kongs extended recession and recent recovery the last 10 years have witnessed deepening and broadening of its economic and trade ties with the chinese mainland this has occurred in part due to global market conditions but also due to the closer economic partnership arrangement cepa between hong kong and the chinese mainland and the individual visit scheme new tourism policy for mainland visitors to hong kong introduced by the chinese government on july 28 2003 according to some observers hong kong has become the hub of panpearl river delta economic region that is one of the major engines of chinas high economic and trade growth rates 4 for further information on the ushong kong policy act see crs report 97311 hong kongs reversion to china

designed to clarify the distinction between the chinese mainland and the hong kong both politically and economically httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34071g10g152g151g144g561g13g152g151 g144g497g561

culture hong kong has experienced significant decline in the size of its expat population and concurrent rise in its mainland population in addition hong kongs middle class has endured declining incomes and loss of economic security also there is growing interest and concern about the preservation of hong kong culture best exemplified by popular movement to preserve historic buildings such as the old railroad clock tower in tsim sha tsui these social and cultural changes have raised the issue of hong kong identity that is distinct and separable from chinese identity at present these political economic and cultural changes do not appear sufficient to erode hong kong separateness from the chinese mainland however there are aspects to these changes that warrant monitoring the economic changes appear to be blurring the existing border between hong kong and the chinese mainland while the social changes may be blurring the difference between being chinese and being hong konger over time if the separation between the chinese mainland and hong kong effectively disappears for all practical purposes then the united states and congress may choose to revisit the decision to extend hong kong special treatment g18g152g149g146g157g146g140g138g149g561g6g142g159g142g149g152g153g150g142g151g157g156g349g561 the hksar is an executiveled government with much of the power in the hands of the chief executive and his or her appointed department cretaries the two most important department secretaries are the chief secretary for administration and the financial secretary hong kongs legislature legco has comparatively limited powers it can effectively veto legislation proposed by the chief executive approves or disapproves of the annual budget and has some oversight over the operations of the executive branch hong kongs courts have the exclusive power to adjudicate hksar legal cases with the exception of matters related to national defense foreign policy and the interpretation of the basic law legal cases involving these three topics are handled by the standing committee of chinas npc since the handover there has been serious political debate over the details of hong kongs independent executive legislative and judicial powers there have been controversies over the selection process for the chief executive as well as the chief executives term in office regarding the hksars legislative powers the key issues have centered about the composition of legco and the manner by which its members are selected as for hong kongs judicial powers the main 7 for

respect to the interpretation of the basic law hong kongs facto constitution besides these general constitutional issues there also has been notable change in hong kongs political parties and the level of politi cal involvement of the hong kong people hong kongs political parties have changed in both name and character over the last 10 years indicating the possible development of broadbased parties concurrent with the change in the political parties the people of hong kong appear more interested informed and involved in politics than before the handover the politicization of the hong kong population in part can be attributed to an increase in their opportunities to be involved in political activities such as elections it is also in part due to widelyheld perception that the hksar government was somewhat dysfunctional during the first few years after the handover forcing people to pay more attention to political issues than they did when hong kong was british colony

the chief executive shall be selected by election or through consultations held locally and be appointed by the central peoples government the article continues by stating the method for selecting the chief executive shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the hong kong special administrative region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress it also indicates that the ultimate aim is the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures annex i of the basic law provides the specifics on how the chief executive who serves five year term is to be selected it stipulates that broadly representative election committee of 800 people select the chief executive 9 to be nominated person must receive at least 100 votes from the election committee the selection of the chief executive is based secret ballot on onepersononevote basis however annex i is not specific about how to choose the chief executive after 2007 saying only that if there is need to amend the method for selecting the chief executives for the terms subsequent to the year 2007 such amendments must be made with the endorsement of twothirds majority of all the members of the legislative council and the consent of the chief executive and they shall be reported to the standing committee of the national peoples congress for approval ambiguity in the language in the basic law and historical circumstances have led to two specific controversies about the selection and

reasons in march 2005 part way through his second term tungs chief secretary for administration donald tsang yam kuen was appointed acting chief executive tungs resignation raised the first controversy which was about the length of the term of his replacement according to some legal scholars the basic law only provides for the chief executive to serve fiveyear term so the replacement should serve full fiveyear term to others the replacement should only serve out the last two years of tungs term with new selection taking place in 2007 in april 2005 tsang requested binding legal decision from beijing on the duration of the replacements term in office arguing that legal review in hong kong independent judiciary would take too long the standing committee of the npc decided that the replacement should finish out tungs term and the next selection should take place as scheduled in 2007 members of hong kongs prodemocracy political parties and the hong kong bar association

the balance on tungs term in july 2005 following the selection of tsang in 2005 the seco nd controversy almost immediately emerged in the form of campaign to change the selection process for the chief executive in 2007 prior to the resignation of tung in 2005 the standing committee of the npc announced in april 2004 that the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage in 2007 shall not be applied but that the specific method of selection could be appropriately modified 11 proposal from tsang to make incremental modifications in the selection process for chief executive in 2007 as well as the legislative council in 2008 was defeated by the legislative council in december 200512 as result changes were made in the 2007 selection process although there was progress towards universal suffrage for the 2007 chief executive selection tsangs bid for reelection by the election committee did not go unchallenged despite tsangs strong backing by the chinese government alan leong kah kit of the newlyformed civic party ran against tsang leong was able to secure 132 votes in the election committees nomination ballot making him an official candidate for chief executive during the campaign tsang and leong held two public debates that were broadcast live on television and radio an unprecedented event for hong kong although leong lost the election to tsang he did secure 123 votes in the election committee tsang won with 649 votes 13 supporters of direct popular election of the chief executive point to the precedents set by the 2007 selection process contested election public debates split vote in the election committee as evidence of modest progress prodemocracy advocates also point to the ratings for the two continued names after in cases where the person has an adopted

of 2007 the commission on strategic developments committee on governance and political development an advisory body to the chief executive is expected to release legislative green paper14 examining possible models roadmaps and timetables for electing the chief executive by universal suffrage15 the initial expectation was that the green paper would contain up to three specific proposals for hong kongs transition to universal suffrage however confidential sources report that the final green paper to be issued by the hong kong government will probably consist of summary of the range of options for each of the main topicsmodels roadmaps and timetables for the chief executive selection process among the elements to be discussed in the green paper are 1 the number of people on the nominating committee 2 how members of the nominating committee are selected 3 number of votes required to be nominated 4 limits on the number of candidates and 5 transition process to universal suffrage at present there is clear indication how soon hong kongs chief executive will be selected by universal suffrage the earliest possible date is 2012 but few believe that the chinese government will approve such direct transition instead analysts believe the chinese government will endorse an interim measure that expands the number of people on the election committee from 800 to either 1200 or 1600 people according to cherry tse kit ching ling of hong kongs department of constitutional affairs the resolution of the model and roadmap will come before the decision on when to have direct election of the chief executive by universal suffrage according to legco member leung kw ok hung the soonest the chinese government would consider the direct popular election of the chief executive is 2022 however some observers are concerned that delaying universal suffrage for the selection of the chief executive until 2022half way through the 50 year guarantee stipulated in the joint declarationis

chris patten implemented series of reforms reconstituting legco into more democratic institution in 1995 the last legco under british rule was selected with 20 of the 60 seats selected in geographical elections with universal suffrage 30 seats selected by functional constituencies in which 11 million people were eligible to vote and 10 selected by members of special election committee17 in addition the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 the stated goal of the patten reforms was to broaden participating in the election and to select legco that would serve both before and after the handover this socalled through train legco would provide some additional stability to hong kongs government during the transition according to patten however the chinese government objected to pattens legco reforms except for the lowering of the voting age to 18 stating that they violated the terms of both the joint declaration and the basic law on august 31 1994 the npc ruled pattens legco incompatible with the basic law and passed legislation stipulating how provisi onal legislative council would be created to take office after the handover on december 21 1996 chinas election committee selected the members of the provisional legislative council which met in shenzhen until the handover and replaced the reformed legco after the handover the provisional legislative council remained in office until 1998 when the first posthandover legco elections were held in 1998 hong kong selected new legco to serve twoyear term as stipulated in article 69 of the basic law the 60 members of the legco were divided into 20 members from geographical constituencies 30 members from functional constituencies and 10 from the election committeea return to the patten seat formula of 1995 but without the broader voting base for the functional constituencies nearly 15 million people voted for the geographical constituency seats in 1998 turnout of about 53 of the eligible voters in 2000 hong kongs third posthandover legco was selected this time with 24 members elected by geographical constituencies 30 from functional constituencies and six by the election committee to serve fouryear term turnout for the 2000 legco geographical elections was down from 1998about 43 of the eligible voters participated the elections of september 2004 saw of 3030 split of legco members between geographical and functional constituencies the seats reserved for election committee were eliminated the turnout rate for the geographical constituencies rose in 2004 to over 5512 higher than in 2000 and 2 higher than in 1998 paralleling the push for universal suffrage for the election of chief executive there was increased discussion about the democratization of legco following the 2004 election as was previously stated in april 2004 five months prior to the 2004 legco elections the chinese government announced that while it was open to reforms in the selection of legco members in 2008 it opposed direct move to universal suffrage for all legco seats this discussion was complicated because it involved not only the issues of universal suffrage and one person one vote but also how legco was to be constituted and the process of its transformation tsangs proposed 2005 reforms also included changes in the size and constitution of legco for the next election in 2008 the number of seats would be increased to 70 equally divided between 17 in contrast to the posthandover election committee the 1995 election committee was comprised of members of hong kongs district boards which were regional government bodies that administered various social and community service programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34071g10g152g151g144g561g13g152g151 g144g497g561

functional constituency seats would be filled by increasing the number of legco members selected by the district councils18 from one to six to some observers tsangs proposal would have been firststep along the path towards universal suffrage and democratization it would have increased the number of legco members directly elected by popular vote plus have added five functional constituency members who were to be selected by district council members th reequarters of whom were elected by popular vote also it was thought that most of the newlyadded legco members would be prodemocracy increasing the likelihood of additional reforms in the future opponents to tsangs proposal countered that it would have increased the number of functional constituency seats without expanding the number of people eligible to vote for those seats for some prodemocracy advocates the goal is to eliminate the functional constituency seats not expand them for others the goal is to create system in which every eligible voter in hong kong can vote in one geographical district and in one functional constituency neither group saw tsangs reforms as positive step towards their respective goal in december 2005 legco voted against tsangs incremental reforms in response tsang authorized the committee on governance and pol itical development to investigate alternative models roadmaps and timetables for implementing universal suffrage for legco when compared to universal suffrage for the selection of the chief executive the democratization of the legco elections is relatively complex particularly because of the functional constituencies according to annex ii of the basic law any change in the formation of legco requires the approval of twothirds of the current legco the consent of the chief executive and shall be reported to the standing committee of the national peoples congress for the record because of the twothirds requirem ent there is concern that the current functional constituency members can effectively block any proposal that dilutes or eliminates their power also in light of previous decisions by the chinese government on the interpretation of the basic law see below some observers believe the language of annex iii will be used to argue that any changes made must be approved by the standing committee of the npc

most important exception has involved legal issues regarding the interpretation of the basic law in particular there have been three high profile cases where the chinese government has made decisions on the meaning of the basic law that were seen by some as eroding the independence of hong kongs courts and the legal protections provided by the basic law itself another interesting posthandover development is the significant increase in the number of civil cases 18 hong kong is divided into 18 districts each with district council responsible for administering variety of public facilities and community services there are total of 529 district council members of which 400 are elected by the residents of the district 102 are appointed by the chief executive and 27 are exofficio members

law article 2 of the basic law grants the hksar indep endent judicial power including that of final adjudication in accordance with the provisions of this law article 82 vests the power of final adjudication in the newlycreated hong kong c ourt of final appeal article 85 reiterates the independence of the hong kong courts stating that they should be free from interference however chapter viii of the basic law entitled interpretation and amendment of the basic law vests the power to interpret the basic law in the standing committee of the npc in turn article 158 stipulates that the standing committee shall authorize the courts of the hksar to interpret on their own in adjudicating cases the provisions of this law that are within the limits of the autonomy of the region article 158 also states that the hksar courts may also interpret other provisions of this law in adjudicating cases however if these are not appealable decisions concerning the relationship between the central authorities the chinese government and the region or affairs which are the responsibility of the central peoples government then the hksar courts are to seek an interpretation from the standing committee via the court of final appeal prior to rendering decision since 1997 there have been three high profile cases where the chinese government has announced decisions regarding the interpretation of the basic law that to some people circumvent or supercede the provisions of th basic law two of those casesthe april 2005 decision on the length of tsangs term in office and the april 2004 announcement that there would not be universal suffrage for the 2007 and 2008 electionswere discussed earlier in this report the third case arose in 1999 and involved the interpretation of articles 22 and 24 of the basic law article 24 defines who will be considered per manent resident of hong kong and who has right of abode in hong kong the first two categories of people eligible for permanent resident status are 1 chinese citizens born in the hksar before or after the handover and 2 chinese citizens who have resided in hong kong for seven continuous years either before or after the handover in addition article 24 describes third category as persons of chinese nationality born outside of hong kong of those residents listed in categories 1 and 2 article 24 also grants all permanent residents the right of abodethe right to live in hong kong however article 22 stipulates that people from other parts of china must apply for approval for entry into the hksar this includes the number of persons who enter the region for the purpose of settlement following the handover suit was filed in hong kong courts on behalf of children born in the chinese mainland who had at least one parent ligible for permanent resident status in hong kong the suit claimed that these children had the right of abode in hong kong under the third category of article 24 and should be allowed to reside in hong kong the hong kong government argued that under the terms of article 22 these children must obtain the approval of the chinese government the court case created some apprehension about the number of children that would be eligible move to hong kong if the courts ruled in thei r favor according to one hong kong government study 16 million children in chinanearly quarter of hong kongs populationwere potentially eligible to immigrate into hong k ong the hong kong government and many hong kong residents feared that the influx of so many children would greatly overburden schools

strong desire to see the courts rule against such broad definition of eligibility for permanent resident status on january 29 1999 hong kongs court of final appeal ruled in favor of the broad definition in response then chief executive tung went to beijing to ask the standing committee of the npc for its interpretation of the basic law as it applies to this case some legal scholars in hong kong protested that tungs request violated article 158 of the basic law which states that such request should come from the court of final appeal before it rendered its final decision on june 26 1999 the standing committee announced its decision siding with the hong kong government in favor of more restrictive interpretation of the basic law in its decision the standing committee stated that children could emigrate to hong kong only if one of their parents was already permanent resident of hong kong at the time of their birth and if they obtained approval as required under article 22 of the basi c law some commentators were highly critical of the npc decision terming it not an interpretation of the basic law but reinterpretation 19 there continue to be periodic protests in hong kong on behalf of the mainland children being kept out of hong kong under the restrictive interpretation although the right of abode issue has become less prominent over time when combined with the npc decisions on tsangs term and universal suffrage in the 2007 and 2008 elections the right of abode issue has brought into question the independence of hong kongs courts and the degree of protection the basic law provides to the people of hong kong g22g145g142g561g9g155g152g160g157g145g561g146g151g561g5g146g159g146g149g561g5g138g156g142g156g561 another major development in hong kongs judicial system is the rapid increase in the number of civil cases the number of civil cases rose from 8161 in 1996 to 17270 in 2006 more than doubling in 10 years according to representative of hong kongs depart ment of justice the rise in civil cases is in part due to the greater use of the chinese language in posthandover hong kong courts 20 under the basic law all legal proceedings can be held in either english or chinese in addition all of hong kongs laws are available in both chinese and english as result more people in hong kong have access to the laws and may feel more comfortable bringing disputes to court in addition there is view that the rise in ci vil cases also reflects increased awareness and concern among hong kong people about their legal rights in this view the economic downturn from 1998 to 2003 and the perceived incompetence of the tung administration see below forced people to become more attentive to politics and to hong kongs legal system also as peoples economic circumstances became difficult they turned to civil suits to protect themselvesan alternative made easier because of greater access to chinese language versions of hong kongs laws 19 for example see the testimony of human rights watch to the senate foreign relations committee east asian and pacific affairs subcommittee in july 1999 available online at

prominent person since the handover there has been trend towards the creation of larger political parties although still small by us standards organized around shared political perspectives in addition some of the older political parties are going through generational shift as past leaders move towards retirement and new leaders emerge however people in hong kong generally vote based on their opinion or the politician not based on loyalty to political party in the local parlance hong kong parties are generally referred to as being either pro democracy or probeijing the leading prodemocracy parties are the democratic party the frontier party the relatively new civic party and the newlycreated league of social democrats the main probeijing parties are the liberal party and

currently has over 600 members prior to 1997 it was one of hong kongs most popular prodemocracy parties winning 19 of the 60 seats in the 1995 legco elections however since the handover its political fortunes have suffered in part due to internal disagreements on the partys position on various political and economic issues including its opposition to minimum wage law in 2002 some members left the party because of its stance on economic issues and joined the frontier party in the 2004 legco elections the democrats won nine seats10 less than they held in 1995of which seven were in geographical

combined over the last 10 years to raise the political awareness and involvement of the people of hong kong first the perceived failure of the tung administration to respond adequately to several economic and social problems pushed people to pay more attention to politics than they did under british rule second the hong kong mediatelevision radio and newspapersbecame more political and more critical of local politics and politicians third changes in hong kongs government have altered the relationship between the government and the hong kong populat ion making it more acceptable for people to express their views about government officials chinas selection of tung chee hwa to be the first hksar chief executive was not surprising but it did not instill people with great confidence tung was businessman with little political experience known for his conservative economic and perceived close ties with some top government officials in beijing almost immediately after assuming office tung faced series of crisesincluding the asian financial crisis speculative run against the hong kong dollar avian flu and the problemplagued opening of the new chek lap kok airportto which his administration responded in what was widely regarded as faltering and ineffective fashion in response to the shortcomings of the tung administration people in hong kong became more politically aware and at times critical of the hong kong government at the same time the hong kong media also increased the political content of its coverage in particular talk radio stations began to feature more

hosts have themselves been subject to sharp criticismas well as threats of physical harmbut the shows have become very popular finally the shift from british colony to highly autonomous region has also altered the nature of hong kongs top government officials especially in the executive branch when hong kong was colony the governor and the department secretaries were generally british civil servants appointed by the british government similarly for most of hong kongs colonial era legco members were appointed by the governor given that the key political figures were foreigners chosen by foreigners there were few incentives for hong kong residents to engage in politics since the handover the selection of the chief executive and the members of legco is done locally and the top government officials are gene rally born and raised in hong kong according to member of the current legco 21 the fact that the government leadership is now local means that hong kong people have

legislation was met with immediate widespread opposition smaller number of voices of support and growing wave of demonstrations lawyers journalists religious leaders and others argued that the proposed legislation could be used by the hong kong government to ban or prosecute organizations or individuals for political purposes in addition the proposed legislation seemed to extend authority of some mainland laws into hong kong diminishing the autonomy of hong kongs legal and judicial systems supporters rejected these claims arguing that it had been five years since the handover and it was time for hong kong to comply with the requirements of article 23 while the verbal debate on the merits and demerits of the proposed legislation continued public demonstrations grew in number and size on december 12 2002 thousands of hong kong residents held protest rally then on july 1 2003 over half million peoplethe second largest demonstration in hong kong history 22marched from victoria park to the central government offices on hong kong island in protest of the article 23 proposals the rally lasted well into the night and included people of all ages ethnic backgrounds and economic classes in hong kong the size and depth of the public opposition to the article 23 proposals apparently surprised tung and his senior advisors meanwhile initial support for the legislation from the probeijing liberal party weakened on july 6 2003 liberal party leader and legco member james tien pei chun announced that he was resigning from the executive council and that he would advise liberal party legco members to vote for postponement of consideration of the proposed legislation ten days later secretary of security regina ip lau suk yee and financial secretary anthony leung kam chung resigned citing personal reasons 23 however most observers believe they were asked to resign in light of the massive protest and widespread opposition to the article 23 proposals on september 5 2003 tung withdrew the proposed legislation besides fending off perceived threat to civil liberties in hong kong the public outcry and demonstrations against the article 23 proposals had several lasting political effects first many people saw the events as proof that the people of hong kong could directly affect government policy second some of the organizers of the 2003 protests went on to form the prodemocracy civic party see above third the perceived unrest in hong kong may have contributed to the eventual stepping down of tung 22 the largest demonstration in hong kong history took place

hong kong government is continuing to protect the rights of hong kong residents alt hough there have been occasional arrests of falun gong supporters and others at various demonstrations since the

handover as evidence of this selfcensorship people point to the dismissals and resignations of several journalists and radio announcers who were critical of the chinese and hong kong governments 25

unexpected effects of the handover has been rapid increase in economic interaction between the economies of hong kong and the chinese mainland prior to 1997 hong kong was generally viewed as the hub of regional economic network reaching from across southeast asia up into the chinese mainland35 however due in part to the effects of the asian financial crisis hong kongs manufacturing and trading companies have reduced their investment flows and activities in southeast asia meanwhile the comparatively fast growth of the chinese economyand its booming consumer markethave proven to be more attractive alternative location for business expansion as result the economic relationship between the chinese mainland and hong kong has grown faster and deeper than expected prior to the handover g5g7g18g3g561 another factor driving the deepening of economic interaction between china and hong kong is cepa because china and hong kong are separate customs territories trade between the two effectively is treated as trade across an international border bilateral shipments of goods and materials must clear either hong kong or chinese customs and people crossing the border must pass through either hong kong or chinese immigration even though the chinese mainland and hong kong are parts of the same country in addition under chinese law hong kong companies wishing to invest in the chinese mainland are c onsidered foreign companies just like us companies seeking entry into china by negotiating free trade agreement with china hong kong has bolstered its competitive advantage on the chinese mainland under the terms of cepa over 1400 products of hong kong origin can be imported into china tarifffree in addition wide variety of service sectors are provided greater access to the mainland market than stipulated in chinas wto accession agreement for some service sectors cepa allows hong kong companies to establish wholly owned subsidiaries in the chinese mainland that can compete in the mainland markets for many of the professional services legal accounting etc hong kong practitioners are able to provide limited services in the chinese mainland that are prohibited to other foreign practitioners finally in the financial sector hong kong banks are allowed to offer bank accounts credit cards and remittances denominated in renminbi while hong kong residents are allowed to convert more currency into renminbi than other foreigners plus they are able to open renminbi checking accounts in banks in guangdong province according to research done by the hong kong trade development council hktdc 36 cepa has led to an increase in hong kongs domestic exports to china led by rapid growth in the tarifffree product categories according to report submitted to the legco panel on commerce 34 for an analysis of the economic relationship between china and hong kong see towards an integrated market the future of hong kongs economy and its inter action with the

million worth of goods have been sent to the chinese mainland under the tarifffree provisions of cepa plus 305 million hong kong dollars 39 million of net capital in vestment in hong kong manufacturing has been induced by cepa the report also states that cepa has caused net increase in net capital investment in the services sector of 48 billion hong kong dollars 615 million37 both china and hong kong view cepa as wor k in progress with ongoing discussions to expand the scope of the arrangement to include more products more services and to foster greater access for hong kong businesses and professionals to the chinese mainland market for hong kong manufacturers one of the main appeals of cepa is the ability to sell to mainland consumers allowing shift away from exportoriented operations similarly for hong kong service providers cepa opens up new business prospects in large and growing mainland market finally for hong kongs financial sector by granting renminbidenominated transactions hong kong banks and other finance companies have improved access to chinese companies and consumers

years number of studies have been done on the economic relationship between hong kong and the pearl river delta in the chinese mainland 38 according to one study the economic interaction between hong kong and the pearl river delta region has been critical to the development of both economies according to these studies hong kong serves as the business hub for the panpearl river delta region maintaining the highvalue added administrative and financial activities in hong kong while the chinese mainland increasingly takes on the less technical operational and support activities in addition to the manufacturing activities as result when taken as whole the h ong kongpearl river delta economic region is comparable in gdp and trade volume to chinas yangtze river delta region utilizing about half the land mass and population of its northern competitor 39 however major difference between the panpearl river delta region and the yangtze river delta region is the existence of the immigration and customs border within the former region complicating economic and trade flows within the region as member of legco recently described it the border was once seen as an assurance but is now viewed as hindrance 40 some analysts believe economic pressures will push hong kong government officials to work more closely with their colleagues in southern china to find ways to reduce the complications

chinese mainland and hong kong as previously described hong kong businesses continue to invest in mainland facilities and are transferring more of their operations into the chinese mainland meanwhile mainland companies are investing in hong kong hong kongs total foreign direct investment in the chinese mainland was worth nearly 190 billion at the end of 2005 and mainland investments in hong kong exceeded 163 billion41 as of 2006 china related companies accounted for nearly third of the companies listed on the hong kong stock exchange and had market capitalization value of over 870 billion up from just 67 billion in 1997 possibly the most obvious evidence of the deep ening economic relationship between the chinese mainland and hong kong is the growth in bilateral trade total merchandise trade with china more than doubled in value between 1997 and 2006 see table 3 in 1997 35 of hong kongs foreign trade was with china but by 2006 46 of its total trade was with china by contrast hong

kong also raise questions about the longterm status of the hksar as highly autonomous economic entity in many ways the chinese mainland is currently more important for hong kongs economy than hong kong is important for chinas economy at present various institutions and structuressuch as the hong kong dollar the separate customs and immigration departments and compliance with the joint declaration and the basic lawpermit the hong kong government to maintain degree of economic separation from the chinese mainland as result it is possible to refer to the current economic dynamic between hong kong and the chinese mainland as synergetic relationship however there are elements in the current economic trends that could portend the eventual integration of hong kong into the chinese mainland economy in the long run mainland companies are growing in influence in hong kong s stock exchange inward investment flows and other business activities rising share of hong kong business transactions are denominated in renminbirather than the hong kong or us dollarand hong kongs financial sector plans on introducing more renminbi denominated financial services at recent presentation prominent hong kong professor suggested that the hong kong dollar may become collectors item to show to ones grandchildren 43 to some observers the level and nature of business activity between hong kong and the chinese mainland may eventually supercede the ability of th structural institutions to maintain viable degree of separation according to this scenario as more and more trade and financial flows in hong kong are conducted in renminbi rather than hong kong dollars it will become increasingly difficult to support the current linked exchange rate with the us dollaror possibly maintain separate hong kong currency similarly it is argued that it will become hard to distinguish between hong kong company that has most of its actual business activities taking place in the chinese mainland from mainland company that is listed on the hong kong stock exchange and operates mostly from its hong kong office so too the legal distinction between product of hong kong and product of china may become increasingly difficult to make as the flow of goods and services across the border grows especially if the product in question makes multiple trips into and out of hong kong and the chinese mainland in short there is possibilityof unknowable likelihood at this timethat global market forces will push the economies of hong kong and the chinese mainland to become fully integrated which has implications for whether hong kongs economy is judged highly autonomous from the chinese mainland

economic and trade relations since the handover hong kong remains separate member of the world trade organization wto and often is helpful ally in trade negotiations seeking to further international trade and investment liberalization the united states and hong kong recognize each other as separate customs territories and their customs authorities enjoy productive and generally friendly professional relationship the exchange of products subject to us export controls continues without serious problems 45 the hong kong and us dollars are both fully convertible and openly exchanged in

progress on the suggested ushong kong bit according to official us statistics us trade with hong kong has experienced very little growth since the handover see table 4 while there has been modest increase in exports to hong kong there has also been slight decline in imports from hong kong as result total merchandise trade between the united states and hong kong increased by about 300 million over the last 10 years but the us bilateral trade surplus with hong kong increased by 50 billion also both exports to and imports from hong kong noticeably declined following the events of september 11 2001 us exports to hong kong have since recovered but imports from hong kong have continued to decline largely due to the relocation of hong kongs manufacturing into the chinese mainland us service

trade and investment continues to flow there are few areas of longterm concern about ushong kong trade relations in its most recent survey of its members the american chamber of commerce in hong kong amcham hk found that 98 of amcham member companies indicated that they were satisfied with the overall business environment in hong kong and half of the companies said they planned on expanding their business in the next three years49 however amcham hk has also expressed concern about specific aspects of us and hong kong policies that they see as hindering better economic and trade relations one of the perennial issues for amcham hk is the us policy to tax overseas income 50 according to amcham hk the united states is one of only five nations that tax foreign earned income51 while the us tax code contains relatively high exclusion 82400 in 2006 that is adjusted for inflation recent changes in the us tax code52 increased the effective tax rate by altering the treatment of housing and educational allowances and expenses according to amcham hk the us taxation of foreign earned income makes it nearly twice as expensive to hire us nationals to work in hong kong as other expats and is pushing us companies in hong kong to hire foreign nationals from australia britain canada and new zealand rather than hire us citizens not surprisingly they have called on the united states to discontinue the taxation of overseas incomes and see the raising of the income exclusion as minimal step to reduce the negative impact on us companies and individuals operating in hong kong 49 2006

pollution in hong kong during the month of may 2007 hourly air pollution readings conducted by the hong kong government at roadsides around the city were high more than twothirds of the time53 on particularly bad days it is impossible to see across victoria harbour distance of little more than one kilometer air pollution is also growing issue for the people of hong kong and is high priority of the hong kong government air quality in hong kong has been on the decline since the 1980s following the opening of southern china to hong kong manufacturing facilities because the prevailing wind direction is from the chinese mainland much of the pollution emanating from hong kongowned factories in guangdong province ends up drifting over hong kong in addition rising traffic congestion and the construction of taller buildings along the waterfront have been cited as contributing factors to hong kongs air pollution problem the hong kong government is making concerted effort to reduce the citys air pollution in july 2006 chief executive tsang announced the action blue sky campaign designed to raise public awareness of air pollution hong kong has already converted nearly all of its taxi cabs from diesel to liquified petroleum gas lpg to reduce emissions and is pushing the private bus companies to convert their fleet of vehicles to lpg the hong kong government is also working with utility companies in both hong kong and the chinese mainland to find ways of reducing emissions at power generation facilities despite these and other actions hong kong continues to have significant air pollution problem the third issue raised by amcham hk is the quality of education available for the children of expats in hong kong hong kong has an ex tensive network of international schools that provide an education comparable to the curriculum offered back in the home country however the return of many hong kong residents to hong kong following the handover has increased the demand for the limited number of openings at these schools g11g150g153g152g155g157g138g151g157g561g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g138g151g141g561g5g158g149g157g158g155g138g149g561g22g155g142g151g141g156g561

decline in the number of expats in hong kong since the handover especially from britain canada and the united states see table 5 between 1996 and 2001 the number of british ex pats living in hong kong decreased by nearly 150000 people much of this dramatic decline is attributable to the removal of british troops from hong kong following the handover however there is similar troop withdrawal to accoun t for halving of us expats in hong kong between 1996 and 2001 or the 64 decline in the canadian population 53 information from the web page of the hong kong environmental protection department

kong according to some observers its international quality has declined while its chinese cultural attributes are on the rise in addition significant number of executive positions in the private sector that previously were filled by western ex pats are now being done by mainland immigrants meanwhile at the other end of the income spectrum many jobs previously done by hong kong chinese are being taken by recent mainland immigrants as well the perceived influx of mainland chinese at both the top and bottom of the income distribution is causing some tensions within the hong kong chinese population much as the united states experienced with its waves of immigrants some people in hong kong view the newcomers with suspicion 54 this suspicious attitude towards mainland immigrants was reinforced by the tung administration when it released rather dire predictions of the effects of the arrival of mainland children and their families during the right of abode controversy it is not uncommon to hear claims in hong kong that mainland immigr ants are responsible for rise in crime the decline in the quality of education and general loss of good manners in hong kong since the

losing its middle class with more and more of the middle management jobs being relocated 54 hong kong currently allows up to 150 mainlanders to immigrate into hong kong each day this quota has gone largely unfulfilled for the last couple of years httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34071g10g152g151g144g561g13g152g151 g144g497g561

being forced to work harder for less pay recent income statistics show some evidence to support this claim during the depths of hong kongs recession nominal salaries and wages in the private sector declined every quarter from the beginning of 2002 to the end of 200455 in addition the hong kong government recently announced that hong kongs gini coefficient56 had risen from 0518 in 1996 to 0533 in 2006 by contrast the us gini coefficient in 2005 was 046957 and chinas gini coefficient in 2005 was 04658 there are also indications that the chinese government is concerned about the status of hong kongs middle class during may 2007 interview with hong kong cable tv lu ping former director of the state councils hong kong and macau affairs office stated that prior to the handover the chinese governments biggest concern was that big businesses particularly the ones overseas might pull out 59 in retrospect lu believes although we had paid attention to people in the middleclass and the grassroots level who make up the majority after all it wasnt enough more could have been done for them60 g10g146g156g157g152g155g146g140g138g149g561g18g155g142g156g142g155g159g138g157g146g152g151g561 even before 1997 an undercurrent of nostalgia swept around hong kong while there were very few public expressions of disapproval of hong kongs return to china there were many private disclosures of sadness at seeing the departure of the photo of the queen in government buildings and other attributes of hong kongs british heritage in addition musician anthony wong yiu ming performed concert to sellout crowds in 1997 entitled people mountain people sea yan san yan hoi 61 that featured wellknown love song in which one half of an excouple expresses his or her sorrow about the end of the relationship as well as his or her appreciation for everything the other person taught the singer during the concert wong performed the song while dressed up in an outfit patterned after the british union jack the symbolism of wongs clothing was not lost on the audience since the handover there continues to be an interest in preserving hong kongs distinct cultural heritage the hong kong government has increased its efforts to preserve historical buildings both of chinese design such as village temples and colonial origin an example of the hong kong governments efforts to preserve historical buildings is the reconstruction of murray house in stanley in 1999 62 55 nominal wage data from the census and statistics department hksar 56 the gini coefficient is measure of income

dismantled so that the bank of china building could be constructed and the materials were placed in storage for the next 16 years in 1990 hong kongs housing department suggested that murray house be reassembled in stanley an area on the south side of hong kong island the building reopened in stanley in 1999 with the hong kong maritime museum located on the ground floor and sh ops and restaurants

in tsim sha tsui and the queens pier on hong kong island gave rise to series of public demonstrations and an occupation of the pier by more than 20 protesters prolonged debates in legco and the

reexamination taking place in hong kong about its identity one major aspect of this process is definingor redefininghong kongs relationship with china an example of the redefinition of hong kongs relationship to china is how hong kong residents identify themselves64 in survey conducted just after the handover 35 of the respondents referred to themselves as hong kong citizens heunggongyan 25 said they were chinese hong kong citizens chunggwok gei heunggongyan 20 called themselves hong kong chinese citizens heunggong gei chunggwokyan and bit more than 18 used the term chinese citizens chunggwokyan in december 2006 survey 22 used the term hong kong citizens 32 preferred chinese hong kong citizens 20 said hong kong chinese citizens 24 answered with chinese citizensrevealing slight shift towards greater association among hong kong residents with their chinese identity selfidentification is not trivial matter for todays hong kong citizen to some probeijing politicians criticism of the chinese government is viewed as being unpatriotic and disloyal however for prodemocracy politicians the criticism may be considered an expression of patriotism if the goal is to make hong kong ndor china better place for typical hong kong citizens the issue becomes one of resolving the tension between ones loyalty to hong kong and to china combining the social and cultural changes with the posthandover economic dynamics the issue of hong kongs long term ability to remain separate and distinct from the chinese mainland resurfaces at present the hong kong government is emphasizing hong kongs identity as asias world city as well as the entryway into the emerging chinese mainland market the focus is on projecting hong kong as being an international and cosmopolitan city and the natural bridge into china what cannot be determined at this time is if and for how long hong kong can remain both part of and separate from china

there are very few issues that indicate need for significant changes in us policies about hong kong by and large the provisions of the us hong kong policy act are being met and hong kong is fulfilling

the democratization of hong kong is written directly into the ushong kong policy act and there appears to be strong and widespread support for democracy among the people of hong kong in public opinion polls hong kong residents routinely support the direct election of the chief executive by universal suffrage and to almost an equal extent support the election of the members of legco by universal suffrage for example in surveys conducted prior the standing committee of the npc announcement of april 2004 between 70 and 80 of the respondents supported the direct election of chief executive in 2007 65 similar set of surveys found that nearly threequarters of the people supported direct election of legco before the standing committee of the npc stated its opposition to the direct elections and nearly twothirds continued to support direct elections afterwards two possible ways for congress to promote hong kongs progress towards universal suffrage and democracy are 1 closely monitor the work of the committee on governance and political development as it develops the green paper on models roadmaps and timetables for electing the chief executive by universal suffrage as well as its legco reform proposals and 2 provide assistance to the current legco in its ongoing research into the policies and practices of the us congress in fy2006 the state departments human rights and democracy fund allocated 450000 to project in hong kong designed to strengthen political parties and civil society organizations also the state department s country report on human rights practices for china contains separate section on hong kong including analysis of its progress towards democracy in addition to these programs congress may wish to provide information and resources to hong kongs political parties as they explore the possible creation of broader grassrootsbased parties g5g146g159g146g149g561g14g146g139g142g155g157g146g142g156g561 outward indications seem to support the view that the civil liberties of the people of hong kong remain relatively unchanged since the handover public opinion polls conducted regularly since the handover reveal perceived erosion in the freedoms of speech press or assembly among hong kong residents at present the only issue that clearly raised concerns about civil liberties in hong kongthe article 23 proposalsis on hold until chief executive tsang or the chinese government decide to press the matter again with legco and the people of hong kong beyond continuing to monitor civil liberties in hong kong congress might contemplate consultations with legco about alternative legal options in drafting legislation on issues such as treason sedition and subversion 65 the surveys were conducted by the public opinion programme of the

friendly both parties are reportedly fulfilling their bilateral and multilateral obligations under existing treaties and agreements trade and investment flows between the two economies have recovered from recent downturn but do not exhibit the same level of growth seen in trade relations with other economies also the decline of us nationals in hong kong may indicate reduction in us influence in hong kong based on the comments of us business representatives in hong kong there are some actions congress could consider taking to counter the possib decline in us influence not surprisingly the us business community in hong kong favors congressional reexamination of us laws governing the taxation of foreign earned income and consideration of ways of balancing the revenue generated by the tax against the implicit cost it creates for us companies wishing to hire us nationals overseas in addition congress may wish to support technical assistance to hong kong in its efforts to reduce air pollution also congress might choose to explore direct and indirect ways of fostering the creation of more international schools in hong kong with curriculum consistent with the us educational system finally congress may include language in suitable legislation to reactivate the section 301 provision of the ushong kong policy act that requires an annual report from the state department to congress
