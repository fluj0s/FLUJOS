proposals reactions and implications robert sutter senior specialist foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the chinese government has strongly criticized us announcements that it will develop or assist in deploying missile defense systems involving cooperation with us allies in east asia and reports of such possible us cooperation with taiwan for those in the united states the us plans have many perceived disadvantages and advantages1 the latter include notably providing degrees of protection for the united states and its allies against ballistic missile attack many in china believe that proposed us development and deployment of ballistic missile defenses at home and in east asia pose potentially serious complications for chinas ability to use its nuclear weapons to deter possible us pressure and aggression and to use chinese ballistic missile capability to exert leverage over japan taiwan and others in east asia beijings options include using political means to curb us efforts or to seek reassurances from the united states military options include increasing the number of chinese missiles and warheads and using force to intimidate taiwan from developing viable missile defense system though the us government may attempt to reassure china that it is not the target of the new systems initial chinese reactions suggest that the united states may face serious difficulties with china if on balance it sees us interests well served by current plans and goes ahead with them and especially if it supports ballistic missile defense efforts in taiwan this report will be updated periodically introduction the chinese government has strongly criticized us announcements that it will develop or assist in deploying missile defense systems involving cooperation with us 1 in march 1999 legislation favoring national missile defense for the united states s 257 and hr 4 received close congressional attention for review of the arguments about these systems see

congressional research service the library of congress crs2 allies in east asia and reports of such possible us cooperation with taiwan in the past few months chinese media and government spokesmen have warned against us efforts to work with japan to develop theater missile defense tmd system that would protect japanese and us forces there from the growing ballistic missile threat posed by north korea or other countries2 they also have criticized strongly reports coming from taiwan that the united states is considering assisting taiwan in the face of perceived growing ballistic missile threat from mainland china3 the peoples republic of china prc foreign ministry in an unusually detailed statement by its spokesman on january 21 1999 laid out chinas position in opposition to us announced or reported efforts in these areas4 specifically the statement noted chinas grave concern over defense secretary cohens announcement the previous day of plans to develop national missile defense nmd system for the united states and tmd systems for east asia and possibly elsewhere and to seek revision of the antiballistic missile abm treaty in order to carry out these efforts the spokesman said these decisions will have wideranging and far reaching negative impacts on the global and regional strategic balance and stability will promote missile proliferation and will violate the abm treaty which china strongly supports chinas belief that us cooperation with japan and other countries to develop tmd to protect us forces and allies in east asia or other regions will have serious adverse impact on the security and stability of these regions chinas special emphasis on taiwan he asserted that any supply of tmd equipment or technology to taiwan will be considered move that seriously infringes on chinas sovereignty and territorial integrity and will certainly meet with strong opposition from the chinese people us media reports note the dilemma the clinton administration faces in not wishing to seriously alienate china and possibly upset its engagement policy with the prc as it pursues missile defense options supported by japan and others abroad as well as by the us congress5 among the many actions taken by the 105th congress in support of greater us missile defense efforts the fy1999 defense authorization act required defense department report to congress laying out tmd architecture to protect us forces and allies in asia and the pacific the fy1999 defense appropriations act required defense department report to congress on the military balance in the taiwan area

secretary of state albrights early march 1999 visit to beijing to discuss the dispute over missile defense and other issues chinese officials increased public criticism with the foreign minister and the premier denouncing the plans7 chinese nuclear and ballistic missile forces status and intentions8 since the mid1950s china has made strong efforts within its limited economic and technical capabilities to develop modest nuclear force and related delivery systems in order to help deter superpower or regional eg indian conflict and intimidation secure strategic retaliatory capability in case of nuclear war and demonstrate chinas international power chinas few dozen nuclearcapable bombers are too slow and technically backward to penetrate modern air defenses beijing relies for nuclear weapons delivery mainly on its mobile groundbased and nascent seabased ballistic missiles about 100 missiles chinas current mobile missiles landor seabased are not long range and generally would not be addressed by the proposed nmd system they may be blocked by the tmd systems proposed by us advocates9 about 20 longerrange chinese icbms mainly silobased missiles may be able to overwhelm limited national missile defense system but as static targets those silobased missiles might be vulnerable to attack by an adversary with sufficiently accurate ballistic missiles both russia and the united states have such missiles china is in the final stages of developing mobile longrange ballistic missile that would not have this vulnerability against this backdrop many in china believe that the proposed us development and deployment of ballistic missile defenses at home and in east asia pose potentially serious complications for chinas ability to use its nuclear weapons to deter possible us aggression pressure intimidation or other such actions including the possible us military intervention against chinese military operation against taiwan10 if the united states were to share this system with russia as well as other chinese neighbors eg japan and south korea the effects on chinese nuclear strike calculations could be substantial during the uschina crisis in the taiwan strait in

for the united states could reduce or eliminate this prc option meanwhile chinese military strategy has put more emphasis in recent years on the use of conventionally armed shorter range ballistic missiles these weapons notably the m9 missile12 having range of 375 miles were featured in the military exercises beijing launched against taiwan in 1995 and 1996 and are widely seen as an implicit source of prc leverage in efforts to press taiwan to reunify with the mainland on terms acceptable to the prc13 possible chinese reactions us policymakers will consider many factors14 in determining whether and how to develop and deploy missile defense systems at home in east asia and elsewhere and whether and how to share such systems with taiwan advocates see variety of benefits for the security of the united states us forces in east asia and us allies and friends in the region among possible negative factors for consideration are beijings possible reactions to such us actions in general chinas possible reactions are seen as following two paths one involves possible chinese militarypolitical measures directly related to the us actions the other involves broader chinese international security policy and relations with the united states militarypolitical measures beijing could choose to wait until the us and its allies and associates actually develop and deploy defensive systems affecting chinese missile forces chinese leaders have seen washington and moscow debate such antiballistic missile systems for long time going back to the 1960s but the results have not substantially jeopardized chinese missile capabilities beijing could endeavor to use arms control initiatives to halt or curb missile defense developments andor deployment in the process china might be prepared to offer concessions in other areas eg chinas development of nuclearcapable missiles and proliferation of those missiles or related technology deemed important to the united states and its allies and associates china could seek formal reassurances from the united states that missile defense systems would not be directed at china and that the united states would deploy them in ways that would be seen by beijing as not primarily directed against chinese missiles this may be hard to do and could prove to be especially difficult if japan and south korea were to receive tmd systems such deployments would 11 new york times january 25 1996 12 this missile can be armed with conventional or weapons of mass destruction warhead 13 see among others taiwan crs issue brief 98034 14 see sources noted in footnote 1 crs5 presumably work in protecting these countries against most chinese missiles as well as north korean missiles of course any us support for missile defense in taiwan would be seen as directed solely against the prc beijing could increase proliferation of weapons of mass destruction technology delivery systems or other such sensitive material in unstable areas of keen interest to us policy eg the persian gulf china could pursue military measures to counter missile defenses this could involve developing greater number of and more capable missiles using decoys and socalled penetration aids developing multiple warheads for existing or future chinese missiles increasing the mobility of chinas longest range missiles and other steps beijing may feel compelled to resume nuclear testing in order to develop warheads better able to penetrate missile defenses china could launch military actions near taiwan and possibly japan as warning against developing missile defenses such actions could include repeat of the livefire artillery and ballistic missile exercises seen in the taiwan area in 1995 and 199615 chinese international security policy us action on missile defense may affect an ongoing debate in china over international security policy and relations with the united states16 even if us intentions were otherwise chinese leaders could conclude from such us development and deployment that the united states and its partners see china as real or potential adversary that cannot be trusted and needs to be checked with missile defenses others in china argue that chinas interests are best served through closer economic political and other interaction with the united states and its allies the outcome of this debate will probably be among the factors determining how accommodating china is prepared to be on the wide range of bilateral regional and global issues important to the united states issues range from chinese policies on nuclear and missile proliferation trade questions and human rights conditions to beijings role in dealing with the danger posed by north koreas nuclear program global arms control efforts and other issues17 us implications and options this brief review of possible chinese reactions suggests that the united states may face serious difficulties regarding china if the us develops and deploys missile defense systems at home and east asia and especially if it supports ballistic missile defense efforts in taiwan most notably china might see little choice other than to increase nuclear 15

development and reducing the numbers of nuclear arms beijing may even feel compelled to resume nuclear testing in order to develop weapons better able to penetrate missile defenses there is distinct possibility of military tension in the taiwan area us concern with these possible developments will be weighed against the many perceived benefits for the united states us forces overseas and us allies and associates of the proposed nmd tmd and possible us sharing of such systems with taiwan us advocates of these approaches likely will urge going forward as means of increasing protection of the united states and its allies despite chinese criticism and opposition some in this group also believe that current highlevel prc criticism is designed to intimidate the united states and therefore judge that giving in to prc pressure would send the wrong signal about us determination to play leading strategic role in asian affairs others may seek to reassure china that it is not the target of the new systems perhaps even offering to share information about the system with china although beijing is thought to be interested in learning about missile defenses this benefit may not be sufficient to offset the negative impact of the missile defenses system in the united states and east asia on chinese missile forces and missile modernization some observers suggests the united states could endeavor to offset china for this impact on chinese security concerns with gestures in other areas possibilities include more liberalized us civil technology transfer policies easing chinese market access to the united states stronger support for chinas entry into world trade organization wto stronger us backing for beijings position visavis taiwan and other steps of course each of these gestures would have consequences for other kinds of us interests and opposition from certain sectors for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20031
