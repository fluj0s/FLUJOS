defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30176japans economic miracle what happened summary what happened to japans economic miracle since the 1990s japan has been experiencing slow economic growth income contraction and recession along with high unemployment and other problems these trends since the 1990s compare starkly with the 1970s and 1980s when japans rapid economic growth and development drew admiration from much of the world including many in the united states and thrust japan into the elite club of major industrialized countries japan even became established in the minds of some as model for economic growth and development for other economies to follow particularly those in east asia but japans difficulties have cast cloud over its economic prospects and tarnished perhaps unnecessarily so its image as leading economic power in asia and the world economic conditions in japan are having major impact on usjapan economic relations and on the overall usjapan relationship strong and stable japanese economy is important to the united states and the world japan is the second largest industrialized economy in the world if japans economy continues to grow slowly or contract us exports to japan would probably continue to decline creating problems for us exporters trying to build market there stagnant or contracting japanese economy diminishes overall world economic growth and world income in the longterm repairing japans economic difficulties may present the united states with significant opportunities many of the structural problems that some experts have cited as cause of japans less than stellar growth have also been impediments to us exports and investments in japan and the source of much friction between the two countries if japan can successfully address these structural problems it would likely improve market access in japan and help alleviate the bilateral trade and investment friction as important as japans economy is to the united states the direct policy influence the united states can have on the japanese economy is limited japans economic problems are function of its own macroeconomic policies and structural deficiencies decisions on these issues are within the purview of the japanese government the united states including the congress can press japan to pursue macroeconomic policies and microeconomic measures that will lead to sustaine d economic growth in the end the best us defense against continued economic stagnation in japan will be maintaining us economic strength this report will be updated

1990s japan has been experiencing slow economic growth or at times recession accompanied by rising unemployment and other problems these trends compare starkly with the 1970s and 1980s when japans rapid economi c growth and development drew admiration from much of the world including many in the united states and thrust japan into the elite club of major industrialized countries japan even became established in the minds of some as model for economic growth and development for other economies to follow but japans difficulties have cast cloud over its economic prospects and have tarnished its image as leading economic power in asia and the world japans economic problems and prospects have broad implications for the united states and the world as whole the problems emerged and grew as economic crises hit economies in east asia russia and latin america japans economic difficulties reignited tensions with the united states as the us trade deficit has soared and have raised concerns in the united states and elsewhere about the likely brake they would have on economic growth in this country and the world as whole the economic problems in japan have been the subject of legislation and congressional hearings they remain of interest to the 107th congress as the us trade deficit with japan grows and as some us industries are adversely affected this report examines recent economic trends in japan that paint picture of very difficult economic and financial situation and reviews the main factors that have contributed to it it examines the impact of the crisis on the us economy and on usjapan economic ties and presents the options available to us policymakers to protect us interests events in japan are evolving this report will be updated as warranted key conclusions the japans economic performance remains poor it suffers from very low or negative growth deflation and rising unemployment and its prospects do not seem to be very positive furthermore it is unlikely to get much external help from the united states or europe as they are also facing slow growth japan also faces burgeoning debt burden the causes of japans economic problems are varied and complex they are rooted in some immediate factors the burst of the assets bubble in the early 1990s and japanese government macroecono mic policies that immediately precipitated the crisishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30176crs2 but they are also rooted in the fundamental structure of the japanese economy the complex web of government regulations and business conglomerates of critical importance is japans banking sector the burst of the asset bubble left japans private banks holding trillions of yen in nonperformin g and troubling loans for the past 25 years successive japanese governments have used fiscal and monetary stimulus and have proposed economic restructuring programs with limited success the koizumi government has proposed its own program centered on fiscal discipline and banking reform the program faces the challenge of trying to maintain fiscal restraint and to encourage banks to dispose of bad loans at time of global economic slowdown koizumi also faces the resistence of entrenched economic interests that have undermined previous economic reform efforts japans economic future has major implications for the united states it is major trading partner and the second largest global economic power yet us influence on japanese economic policy is limited and is primarily confined to diplomatic pressure in the end the best defense against troubled japanese economy will probably be strong us economy trends in the japanese economy examining the indicators the image of the japanese economy in the united states around the world and within japan itself has changed many times in the postwar period from the 1950s to the 1960s japan was viewed as poor but advancing economy relying on the production of laborintensive goods to drive its reindustrialization in the 1970s and especially in the 1980s japan developed into the worlds second largest and fully industrialized economy on track to overtake the united states as the leading economy in the world its success in the production of autos computers and other sophisticated goods its high growth rates and the rapidly increasing japanese standard of living helped form this image some observers even viewed japanese economic policies and structure as the model to be emulated and it often was by other east asian economies but that popular image of japan has changed almost 180 degrees since the 1990s as japan has undergone various difficulties highlighted by slow and at times negative economic growth rates as with many popular images both the positive and negative ones of japan have been somewhat exaggerated japan was never an invincible economic juggernaut as some writers viewed it in the 1980s nor is it now collapsed economy nevertheless most experts would argue that japan faces both near and long term challenges that call for bold policieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30176crs3 1crs calculations based on data in oecd economic outlook 64 december 1998 p191 as economies develop they are able to import technology from more advanced countries investment in these technologies allow less advanced economies to develop and grow rapidly but as they become more mature the stock of available technology diminishes as countries must innovate longer and more expensive process 2the oecd is group of the 29 most industrialized economies including the united states and japan japans gdp growth rates japan experienced impressive though declining economic growth rates in the postwar era from 19601970 japan averaged an annual real adjusted for inflation gdp growth rate of 110 from 19701980 54 and 1980 1990 41 most economists argue that declining average economic growth rates are commensurate with maturing economy1 despite the declining trend japans economic growth rates remained on average above those of the united states and the other industrialized countries of the organizatio n for economic cooperation and development oecd2 economic growth trends for japan since the 1990s have declined markedly raising concerns both in and outside japan from 19912000 japans real gdp grew on average 14 substantially below previous trends and as the graph in figure 1 indicates below us and oecd trends since 1991 the growth rate has not exceeded 2 except in the anomalous year of 1996 when it grew 35 that graph in figure 2 shows quarterly seasonally adjusted gdp growth rates

that of the united states although it has remained below those of most west european countries and the oecd average from 19811990 japan had an annual average unemployment rate of 25 compared to 71 for the united states3 but japans unemployment rate has increased steadily since the 1990s as of july 2001 it had reached 50 record for postworld war ii japan4 standard of living japan has incurred low inflation rates much lower than rates in the united states and oecd countries as whole in fact japan now faces problem of prolonged deflation negative rates of change in price levels extended periods of deflation can be problem for an economy because declining asset prices discourage investment figure 3 depicts japanese inflation rates compared with the united states and the oecd countries as whole from 1991 to 2000 despite its economic problems japan remains one of the wealthiest countries in the world whose citizens enjoy one of the highest standards of living japanese citizens enjoy one of the worlds highest per capitagdp rates in 2000 it was nominally 36300 compared with 36000 for the united states measured using purchasing power parity ppp which takes into account exchange rate and cost of living differences japans per capita gdp was below that of the united states 25600 compared to 36000 but still above that of many other industrialized economies5 japanese citizens pay much higher prices for housing fuel food and other staples than do us citizens thus decreasing their standard of living somewhat japans citizens enjoy the highest average life span 81 years in the world compared to the united states 77 years6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30176crs5 foreign trade balances japan has continually run surpluses in its current account balances on merchandise trade investment income and unilateral transfers primarily due to large surpluses in its merchandise trade but increasingly as result of rising income from investments abroad figure 4 the current account surpluses are reflective of high domestic household savings rate in japan around 15 of disposable income at times the trade surpluses have presented political problem for japan as countries such as the united states that continually run bilateral trade deficits have considered the deficits reflective of unfairness in japans trade policies and practices and have encouraged japan to reduce its surpluses on the other hand japans large savings provide pool of financial capital to the united states and other low savings countries that need to borrow capital for investment japanese capital for example helps to finance the us national debt impact of japans economic problems japanese poor economic conditions have implications for japan the united states and beyond for japan itself continued slow growth or recession eventually could seriously damage the standard of living of the average japanese citizen falls in national income would mean decline in tax revenues that would worsen japans already difficult fiscal situation continued slow growth could affect business confidence and consumer confidence causing them to delay or reduce investment and spending further exacerbating the gloomy economic trends furthermore pronounced and extended poor economic performance can undermine popular confidence in political leaders and create political instability factors contributing to the economic problems the causes of japans economic problems are varied and complex they are rooted in some immediate factors the burst of the assets bubble in the early 1990s and japanese government macroeconomic policies that immediately precipitated the crisis but they are also rooted in the fundamental structure of the japanese economy the complex web of government regulations and business conglomerates burst of the bubble the trigger of the crisis was the burst in the assets bubble in the early 1990s the assets bubble refers to the runup of prices on land stocks and other assets in the

from liberalization of capital controls that unleashed funds seeking higher yields in addition banks were searching for new customers as firms their biggest borrowers turned from banks to equity markets for their financing banks turned to real estate and real estatebased loans as their targets the sudden inflow of capital drove up asset prices the phenomenon fed on itself perpetuating inflated asset values investors used the inflated assets to collateralize loans which they used to buy more assets the inflated asset values created wealth effect making consumers and businesses feel flush with cash leading them to spend and invest accordingly business investment and consumer spending soared stock prices skyrocketed as the nikkei index jumped from 10000 to 40000 between 1984 and 1989 real estate prices increased so rapidly as to make homes in japans biggest cities unaffordable without extra long term mortgages japanese investments in us real estate and businesses triggered fears of an invasion of us industry these trends contributed to high economic growth in japan in the mid1980s japans real gdp grew an average of 39 per year it peaked at 58 in 1988 but beginning in 1989 and into the early 1990s the japanese monetary authorities determined that the low interest rates and the highly expansive money supply were not sustainable and threatene d the economy with inflation japans central bank the bank of japan raised its official discount rate from 25 in may 1989 to 6 by august 1990 the money supply growth was slowed dramatically and contracted in absolute terms in 1992 tightened credit and money supply brought halt to asset buying and the speculative bubble burst by the end of 1990 stock prices plummeted by the end of 1992 the nikkei average had bottomed out at temporarily at 16925 about 60 below its 1989 peak it rebounded somewhat in the mid to late 1990s reaching levels close to 21000 but in one of the signs of japans recent and continuing economic problems the nikkei average has plummeted below 10000 in 20017 the economy was especially hard hit by the sharp drop in land and property prices which spawned wave of defaulting loans much like the us savings and loan crisis of the 1980s in japan as whole urban land values declined an average 28 from the end of march 1991 to the end of march 1999 in the six largest japanese cities where land values had jumped more than 200 from 1985 to 1991 they declined 62 from the end of march 1991 to the end of march commercial real estate in these areas declined 788 the sharp downturn in asset values along with the tightened monetary policy precipitated decline in economic growth in 1991 that began the continuing period of economic stagnation in japan that has worsened to the present land prices have continued to declinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30176crs7 9 us library of congress congressional research service japans banking crisis by dick k nanto crs report rs20994 10lincoln ed japans economic mess jei report may 8 1998 18a p 10 the financial sector crisis the asset bubble exposed deepseated structural problems in japans financial sector which contributed to japans anemic economic performance the collapse of the real estate market and the stock market left many japanese banks with huge volume of loans which were not likely to be repaid the financial crisis was due in part to the use of stocks and real estate as collateral the number and size of the loans ballooned with the rise in asset values and actually fed the bubble and collapsed when the bubble burst the crisis has been caused also by government practices particularly those of the ministry of finance that oversees the banking sector the practices included the so called convoy policy that of promoting growth throughout the banking sector with the stronger banks assisting the weaker ones rather than allowing weaker ones to go bankrupt or merge with stronger ones the collapse of the market also exposed questionable accounting practices that allowed banks to hide nonperforming loans rather than having to write themoff as of march 2001 japanese deposittaking financial institutions held 434 trillion 3675 billion in nonperforming loans an increase from 424 trillion at the end of march 2000 many analysts assumed that the japanese government had under reported the extent of the nonperforming loan

have also pointed to japanese government fiscal and monetary policies as contributing to the economic malaise japans fiscal situation deteriorated severely in the 1990s from 1990 to 1995 the japanese general government fiscal balance went from surplus equivalent to 29 of gdp to deficit equivalent to 37 of gdp gross debt increased from 651 gdp in 1990 to 806 gdp in 1995 net debt essentially gross debt minus social security contributions increased to 11 gdp in 1995 and it is expected to grow as the aging japanese population contributes less to government revenues and takes more in social security payments11 the deteriorating public finances resulted from the slowdown in economic activity in the early 1990s in japan due in part to the burst of the bubble plus the additional costs of series of stimulus packages12 in anticipation of the fiscal problems japan would face the powerful ministry of finance strongly promoted more austere tax and expenditure policies one of the major pillars of the austerity program was the passage of the fiscal structural reform act in 1997 among other things the act required that by japanese fiscal year 2003 the government would longer be able to issue bonds to finance budget deficits and the general government deficit would have to decrease to 3 of gdp13 the government began to take other measures to reduce its budget deficits in april 1997 it increased the consumption tax from 3 to 5 and reversed temporary tax reduction that had been imposed earlier to stimulate demand14 the government had timed the fiscal austerity measures in anticipation of longawaited recovery in japans economic growth indeed in 1996 real japanese gdp increased 39 after lackluster growth the previous years of the decade15 the general government deficit decreased to 34 in 1997 indicating tighter fiscal policy but the fiscal contraction while financially prudent contributed to the return of economic stagnation in 1997 and 1998 japans recent monetary and fiscal policies has been loose one school of thought on japanese economic policy argues that japans macroeconomic policies have played the key role in japans economic stagnation economist adam

implemented large fiscal stimulus package and it resulted in the boom in economic activity in 1996 posen has suggested that the japanese economy still has room to grow through fiscal stimulus potential growth without triggering inflation nor would the extra fiscal debt overly burden the japanese economy mit economist paul krugman is another member of this school but focuses on the role of monetary policy he has argued that the japanese economy has entered into liquidity trap at very low interest rates individuals will willingly hold not spend all additions to the supply of money thus rendering monetary policy ineffective17 structural economic problems another group of analysts argues that macroeconomic factors fiscal and monetary policies are not as important as structural rigidities within the japanese economy in addition to those in the financial sector that led to the financial assets bubble such rigidities they argue have not only led to japans economic problems but will prevent japan from realizing its full growth potential unless they are removed one such economist richard katz argues that japanese economic problems are rooted in what he calls its dual economy18 the japanese economy is really two segmented economy he argues one segment is highly efficient and consists of sectors that have proved competitive in the world economy and are highly productive industries in this segment include cars electronic products computers semiconductors and capital machinery the second segment are those sectors that are very inefficient with low productivity they survive through protective government regulations and private business practices this segment includes industries that produce glass cement paper petroleum products and petrochemicals processed foods and basic steel it also includes many elements of the service sector such as financial and retail services according to katz and others the japanese economy had been able not only to survive but thrive until recently because the competitive part of the dual economy was so efficient that it was able to prop up the noncompetitive part they did so by having to depend on those sectors for their inputs for example the car manufacturers would buy flat glass basic steel and other components from domestic manufacturers but at higher prices than they might have had to pay if they bought from more efficient foreign suppliers they sold their products through designated retailers they also had to pay high prices for energyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30176crs10 19ibid p 8

httpwwwmofgojpenglishtradest199828cehtmthis arrangement could continue as long as the export sectors remained sufficiently competitive to absorb the costs of the less efficient sectors but katz argues that in the mid1980s with the sharp appreciation of the yen japanese exporting firms could longer absorb the costs without sacrificing their ability to compete globally many of the industries particularly the car manufacturers and electronics manufacturers were forced to relocate operations abroad with demand for japanese exports cut and producers moving abroad japan made up for the loss of demand by pouring more of its financial resources into investment driven by loose monetary policy this strategy allowed japan to boost growth rates in the 1980s yet katz points out those investments were inefficient yielding lower returns than investments made in other industrialized countries the continual pouring of funds into assets created the bubble and sowed the seeds of the economys destruction when the bubble burst in the early 1990s it signified the end of the last hurrah of faltering system trying to pump itself up along with japans dual economy katz points to second related problem chronic inability to consume all that it produces the japanese economy saves too much largely because of the lack of an adequate social safety net and social security retirement program if that savings cannot be exported it is consumed through investments which have become increasingly inefficient or pumping up of the economy through government public works programs19 the east asian financial crisis the currency crisis that hit several large east asian economies thailand indonesia malaysia and south korea from mid1997 contributed to prolonging japans economic problems20 japan had become more reliant on east asia as an export market and the growth in japanese offshore production in east asia created customers for exports of japanese technology in 1996 asia accounted for 44 of japanese exports in 1997 after the onset of the asian crisis the share declined to 42 and by the end of 1998 to 35 although it increased somewhat to 37 by the end of 1999 in 1998 japanese exports to those countries most sharply hit by the financial crisis declined dramatically south korea 364 thailand 307 malaysia 307 and indonesia 545 furthermore in 1998 imports from the countries hardest hit by the financial crisis declined very sharply south korea 693 thailand 746 and malaysia 782 the decline in japanese imports made it more difficult for these countries to export

possibility of their loans there going bad which added to the banking sectors already enormous problems japans response to the economic problems the examination above of japans economic problems demonstrates that number of factors have contributed to them the burst of the asset bubble the crisis in the financial sector macroeconomic policies structural problems in the economy and the east asian currency crisis successive japanese governments since the 1990s have responded with piecemeal initiatives on these various fronts with little in the way of nearterm success judging by japans continuing poor economic outlook macroeconomic measures macroeconomic policies are defined as governments policies on spending and taxation fiscal policy and on currency and credit emissions and interest rates monetary policy these economic policy tools can be very powerful but their use is constrained by the financial resources available to government and also by the need to maintain price stability fiscal measures since 1992 the successive japanese governments have passed and implemented 10 economic stimulus packages combinations of tax cuts and spending increases to try to boost the limping economy but they have had to do so against the backdrop of an aging population that will in time demand more in terms of pensions and contribute less in taxes putting additional demands on the government budget the extra spending is political gamble for japanese political leaders if the stimulus packages prove effective the japanese economy could return to sustained economic growth however if the economy does not grow or does not grow sufficiently to boost business and consum er confidence then japan is faced with very high debt burden which would become harder to pay off if the economy is not generating increasing income japan already has the highest gross debt gdp ratio among industrialized countries figure 5 indicates that between 1991 and 2000 japans ratio had doubled to

august 1990 by february 1999 the boj had dropped the rate to zero rate which it maintained until august 2000 when with japans economic prospects looking somewhat brighter it raised the rate to 02525 however the bank in effect returned to zero rate policy in february 2001 as the japanese economy faced deflationary pressures the bank indicated that the rate would be in place until consumer price changes turn positive26 commensurate with the more expansionary monetary policy the boj announced in august 2001 that it would increase the current accounts of japanese private banks that is the cash balances held in their accounts with the boj from total of 5 trillion to 6 trillion in late september 2001 boj chairman masaru hayakami announced that the target would be set above 6 trillion indicating that the bank would do what it takes to encourage spending27 it is important to note that japanese monetary policy has not been as loose as it might first appear inflation rates in japan have been very low far below those of most industrialized countries therefore real adjust for inflation interest rates in japan which are the effective rates are higher than in many countries in

was highly inefficient and subject to corruption heavy government regulations prevented the sector including banks trust banks securities companies insurance and other credit institutions from adequately responding to the competitive demands of global economy these problems became especially apparent when the financial bubble burst and banks were left holding bad loans the proliferation of troubled banks challenged the longheld government policy of trying to keep all institutions afloat the convoy system government regulations made it difficult for banks and other lenders to offer new financial services that were tailored to new markets troubled domestic financial institutions could not merge with foreign institutions to shore up their capital base and the financial sector was isolated from foreign competition in november 1996 the then hashimoto government announced sweeping program of financial reforms popularly called the big bang among other things the program is designed to break down barriers among the various types of financial institutions to increase competition among them the main provisions of the big bang included29 imposing higher penalties on financial institutions for illegal acts loosening government restrictions on management of investment trusts pension funds and other assets allowing individuals and companies to make foreign currency transactions without prior government approval making the bank of japan independent of the ministry of finance opening the japan financial inspection agency eliminating licensing requirements for securities brokerages eliminating restrictions on commissions on securities trades and removing barriers to banks insurance companies trust banks and securities companies from operating in one anothers sectors in addition to the big bang japan signed the world trade organizations wto financial services agreement in december 1997 which requires signatory governments to allow foreign firms to participate in domestic financial markets furthermore in april 1998 the bank of japan began to enforce tighter capitalasset ratios as required by the bank of international settlements bis enforcing these standards may have curtailed the ability of japanese banks to lend japan and the united states also engaged in bilateral negotiations and agreements aimed toward opening japans markets for insurance and other financial services to foreign competition the big bang is designed to be implemented over time and will affect the economy gradually but japan faces the immediate crisis of banking

agencies to manage and otherwise dispense with nonperforming loans and failed banks30 financial reform is very important but only part of the economic restructuring efforts that the japanese government has taken in the 1990s japan has grappled with economic restructuring for many years in 1986 report released by an advisory commission led by former bank of japan chairman haruo maekawa asserted that japan needed to take measures to stimulate domestic demand by relying less on exports to stimulate economic growth in the face of growing trade surpluses and political pressure from trading partners including the united states these measures were to include economic deregulation but the japanese government did little in response the japanese government has taken economic reform more seriously as it has faced continued economic stagnation in the 1990s also the governments poor response to the kobe earthquake in 1995 manifested the corruption in some government ministries the lack of effective interministerial coordination and arcane and inefficient government regulations the japanese government embarked on deregulation and restructuring on number of fronts in march 1995 the government initiated deregulation action program dap threeyear program fy1995fy1997 designed to make regulations the exception rather than the rule in the japanese economy the initial program targeted about 1100 measures to be taken but was revised and increased to 2800 by march 1997 among other things the program focused on strengthening the enforcement of the antimonopoly act japans main authority for antitrust activity in order to improve efficiency and increase competitiveness in japanese industries in addition the dap would reduce barriers to entry of new firms to industries review regulations that inflate prices of electricity and other utilities cut consumer protection regulations and environmental regulations to minimum required and reduce regulations that bar entry of foreign entities into the japanese economy the program focused on regulations in the following areas housing and land information and telecommunicat ions distribution standards certification and import procedures financial services including securities and insurance energy labor and others in 1996 the hashimoto government raised the priority of economic restructuring it did so by introducing

passengers are much higher in japan than in other industrialized countries japan has heavily regulated the entry of new firms ostensibly to prevent supply capacity from getting too large to reduce costs and improve efficiency the government has liberalized restrictions on the number of airlines and flights to introduce more competition in the industry and barriers in shipping and passage transport trains buses and taxis are being loosened the government is taking steps to improve efficiency of land use by revising regulations on land use and housing32 legislation was passed to reorganize the governm ent in order to reduce the number of ministries and streamline their operations cutting costs and bureaucratic red tape importantly the government has increased resources at the fair trade commission to improve enforcement of anticompetition laws and has increased penalties for violations33 although the hashimoto and obuchi governments took major steps to reform the japanese economy and these steps have had results critics point out that japans path to economic restructuring and reform remains long one the oecd has argued that japan needs to accelerate the pace of reform implementation or else see popular confidence in the program erode it also needs according to the oecd to expand efforts in banking telecommunications energy landuse reform taxation policy and other areas for economic restructuring to be effective34 economist richard katz has argued that japanese efforts to date have only skimmed the surface of what needs to be done and that japan needs to undertake more fundamental changes that eliminates the dual economy primarily by more radically reducing the governments role in economic decisionmaking35 economist edward lincoln remains skeptical that japan can address the financial practices that got the economy in trouble in the first place36httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30176crs16 37 eiu country reports japan june 2001 38 driwefa japan report

minister he succeeded yoshiro mori who himself had assumed the leadership in april 2000 after obuchi suffered fatal stroke koizumi was elected by the grass roots membership of the ldp much to the chagrin of the partys senior leaders koizumi campaigned for the job on platform of economic reform and seemed to gain popularity among those who wanted change in japan shortly after assuming the leadership koizumi announced package of economic emergency measures or guidelines to revive the economy his governme nt expanded on those guidelines in june 2001 by releasing economic policy framework which sets out the main macroeconomic and structural objectives and strategies for his government banking reform has become centerpiece of the koizumi governments economic strategy the governments program calls for drastic disposal of non performing loans npls that is to encourage banks to writeoff completely their nonperforming loans in 23 years37 but that objective has proved an arduous one one issue has been to determine the scope of the problem the volume of what non banking analysts consider to be nonperforming loans has greatly exceeded the number of nonperforming loans officially reported by banks second issue is the potential economic impact banks are reluctant to writeoff loans of major clients with whom they have longterm relationship and government officials are concerned about the impact on the economy if major companies are forced to close down because they can longer get bank financing on august 30 2001 the head of the financial supervisory agency the agency that

program is ambitious and addresses many problems that japanese and foreign experts have cited as the roadblocks to full economic recovery in japan but skeptics may point to more than 25 years of japanese political economic history and that included economic efforts that failed produced only lackluster results impact of crisis on the us economy and the us response as the second largest economy in the world japan makes an impact and when changes positive or negative occur in the japanese economy they can have significant effects on the rest of the world especially smaller countries that are highly dependent on trade and foreign capital the united states is the largest economy in the world twice the size of japan and therefore not as vulnerable to external economic changes as are smaller countries nevertheless japans economic stagnation has affected the us economy especially in foreign trade balances and investment flows one result of japans economic stagnation has been the rise in financial capital outflows from japan for many years japan has been net exporter of financial capital product of high savings rate that exceeds its rate of domestic investment but during the recent periods of recession in japan the capital outflows surged as the savings rate has remained high while the rate of growth in domestic investment has at times been negative the united states has for many years been net importer of financial capital product of very low savings rate that is exceeded by its rate of investment the united states has been major recipient of capital from japan it has therefore experienced increasing surpluses in its bilateral capital account with japan40 the inflows of capital from japan help to augment the pool of capital available to investors in the united states putting downward pressure on us interest rates the mirror image of the capital account in the us balance of payments is the current account if the united states incurs surpluses on capital

base some exporters such as producers of aircraft and parts and integrated circuits actually increased their business in japan us import levels from japan have increased in the last few years nevertheless as the second largest economy strong japan makes significant contribution to world economic growth and its stability is critical to ensuring the stability of world financial markets and the world econom as whole as the worlds largest creditor japan is the source of large volumes of financial capital to the united states and other countries sudden withdrawals of which could have strong adverse effects on us and world financial markets japan is also dominant force in the international monetary fund the world trade organization and other multilateral and regional economic organizations the united states also has strong interest in the economic and financial stability in east asia the negative effects of japans economic problems on those countries thus indirectly affects the united states some observers have argued that japans failure to increase imports from east asia have forced those countries to sell more in the us market thus increasing their trade surpluses with the united states there is not much foundation to this argument since the growth in us trade deficits with those countries was primarily the result of decreased us exports rather than increased us imports japans poor economic performance has tended to dominate usjapan relations since the 1990s us policymakers the business community and the agricultural sector have been eyeing economic developments in japan as us export markets have been shrinking with the rest of the japanese economy they are also concerned that japan would strive to export its way to recovery by maintaining weak exchange rate to boost the price competitiveness of japanese exports in the us market in that regard us policymakers in the executive branch including the president and in the congress have been pressing japan to proceed with reforming its banking sector and restructuring the rest of its economy for many years the united states has made restructuring and economic deregulation direct or implicit elements of trade negotiation s with japan us negotiators and industry representatives have long argued that government policies and regulations by effect if not by design protect inefficient domestic producers from foreign competition and provide japanese exporters with an unfair advantage over competitors in the united states and other countries furthermore the structure of japanese business especially the dominance of crossownershi p conglomerates keiretsu their business practices and their tolerance by the japanese government have prevented us firms from

each one of these elements will be responsible for reporting to the president and the prime minister on the progress of their work42 the outlook for the japanese economy few would deny that japan has been and remains in very serious economic situation the unprecedented for postwar japan poor economic growth rates rising record unemployment rates and the lack of business and consumer confidence paint rather dismal picture for an economy that was the economic miraclefor many decades the buildup of the assets bubble in the 1980s and its bursting at the beginning of the 1990s triggered japans economic problems the sudden and continuing drop in the values of real estate stocks and other assets sharply cut into the wealth of japanese and sent the banking sector suddenly holding billions of dollars in bad loans reeling the crisis has adversely affected the sense of wellbeing of the average japanese citizen the nearterm outlook for the japanese economy is not promising many of the major economic forecasters are predicting very slow or negative economic growth in 2001 and probably 2002 if many observers agree that japans economic situation remains serious they disagree on the fundamental causes and therefore on the solution the debate pits those who argue that fiscal stimulus andor monetary stimulus will unleash economic growth against those who argue that such macroeconomic measures will provide shortterm spurt at best unless japan undertakes fundamental structural changeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30176crs21 determining which school of thought is correct is task beyond the scope of this report nevertheless based on japans experience since the 1990s one can conclude that japans road to recovery depends on proper balance between macroeconomic policies and economic restructuring the rise in the asset bubble and its burst resulted from structural problems within the banking sector confidence within that sector will have to be rebuilt if it is to exercise its important role as financial intermediary in the japanese economy japan can also realize important productivity gains which would contribute to economic growth if it pursues deregulation and restructuring in other important sectors at the same time as japans experience in 199697 proved when economic recovery was truncated by premature tightening of monetary policy and increase in taxes if the government does not conduct the correct fiscal and monetary policies economic growth can be prematurely aborted in pursuing macroeconomic stimulus the japanese government is constrained by the limitations of its revenues and of its ability and willingness to borrow to finance deficits it is constrained in pursuing deregulation and restructuring by the ability and willingness of policymakers to confront the various interest groups within the bureaucracy and elsewhere that have had stake in the status quo japanese governme nts under various leaders have attempted to tackle these challenges with limited success often failure to achieve complete success has lead to the political downfall of those leaders prime minister koizumi and his government face the many of the same challenges their program addresses many fo the obstacles to economic growth that japanese and foreign experts have cited but already the government is meeting resistence and doubt implications and policy options for the united states us economic policy toward japan has reflected broad range of us national interests and pressures and us policy will have to continue to reflect those interests if it is to be effective these interests include those in the american business community and agricultur that are looking for unfettered access to markets and strong japanese demand for their exports and investments as well as those who are wary of competition from japanese production beyond the specific interests of individual sectors are the overall interests of the united states in robust and stable japanese economy japan is the largest economy in east asia where it accounts for roughly 23 of the regions gdp japan serves as model for economies in transition such as china and vietnam and is critical as an engine of economic growth in the region in the foreign policy and national security area japan is an important world partner and chief ally in asia the united states and japan face the mutual threat of an unstable north korea and also the challenge of how to manage relations with rapidly emerging china strong and robust japan is vital to fulfilling its role as partner of the united states in meeting these foreign policy challengeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30176crs22 but as important as japans economy is to the united states the direct policy influence the united states can have on the japanese economy is limited at best the united states could promote economic growth in japan by selling yen for dollars or by boosting us interest rates to drive down the value of the yen more expensive dollarcheaper yen would make japanese exports cheaper and would increase japanese exports to the united states all other factors remaining the same but such policy option would present other problems for the united states increased imports from japan would increase the us trade deficit which could prove politically sensitive especially with those sectors of the us economy feeling the increased competition from japanese imports furthermore higher interest rates would slow down us economic growth national sovereignty restricts the influence the united states can exert in shaping japanese economic policy although outside pressure has often raised the consciousness in japan with respect to problem and can speed up decisionmaking decisions on macroeconomic policy and economic reform are within the purview of the japanese government and policymakers will undertake them within the context of what they perceive to be japans national interests but those limitations have not prevented the united states from defending its interests and pressuring japan to move forward with deregulation and economic stimulation the united states will likely continue to do so in bilateral negotiations on sector specific issues and on the broader issues of foreign investment and deregulation the united states also will likely continue to work with japan on such issues in multilateral fora such as the world trade organization wto and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd an effective us approach in these negotiations would underscore the mutual benefits to both countries of japan following us suggestions in the long term if successful japans efforts to overcome its economic difficulties might present the united states with significant opportunities many of the structural problems have acted as barriers to us exports and investments in japan and the source of much friction between the two countries if japan can successfully address these structural problems it would likely improve market access in japan and help alleviate the bilateral trade and investment friction in the nearer term the best us defense against continued economic stagnation in japan will be maintaining us economic strength
