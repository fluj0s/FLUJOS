updated september 3 2008 jane g gravelle senior specialist in economic policy government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33768major tax issues in the 110th congress summary during the first part of 2007 the most prominent congressional taxpolicy action focused on small business in may congress approved legislation pl 11028 increasing the federal minimum wage and providing smallbusiness tax cuts in the second part of 2007 major focus of tax gislation was the lternative minimum tax amt for individuals which was project ed to apply to growing number of taxpayers under current law individuals pay the higher of their amt or regular tax unlike the regular tax the amt is not indexed for inflation and rising prices along with income growth and regular income tax cuts have increased the amts scope congress has addre ssed the amts growth with temporary measures that restricted its scope with th latest scheduled to expire in 2007 proposals to cut the amt initially included other tax measures both unrelated tax cuts and revenue raising provisions designed to offset th impact of tax cuts on the federal budget deficit as deliberations progressed however legislation focused increasingly tightly on the amt with major concern of bate being whether to provide revenue raising offsets on december 19 congre ss enacted the tax increase prevention act of 2007 pl 110166 whose only elements were amt cuts congress addressed but did not take final action on tax legislation in variety of other areas over the course of 2007 including energy taxation tax measures related to the 2007 farm bill international taxation and exte nsion of set of narrowly focused expiring tax benefits the exte nders where the proposals involved tax cuts prominent issue was whether and how to offset the revenuelosing effect of tax cuts congress thus considered rang of revenueraising tax measures over the course of the year for example attempting to reduce the tax gap between the taxes us taxpayers owe and what they pay as well as restricting tax shelters and tax benefits for us firm s that operate abroad major focus of congressional tax liberations in early 2008 has been an economic stimulus package designed to boost what is an apparently flagging economy leaders of the house of repres entatives reached an agreement with the administration on plan containing tax cuts including rebate for individual taxpayers and several busine ss tax cuts on february 13 the president signed modified version of the house stimu lus bill pl 110185 calling fo r 1517 billion tax cut in fy2008 the farm bill was enacted may 22 pl 110234 and housing relief bill as pl 110289 on july 30 other likely areas for congressional ac tion in 2008 are suggested in part by items on which final action has not been taken energy taxes and the extenders although few extenders have been adopt ed another amt patch will likely be considered in addition indications of economic weakness ma be met with an economic stimulus package that might include range of tax cuts this report was originally written by david l brum baugh and will be updated as legislative and economic events occur

during the first half of 2007 the most prominent congressional action on tax legislation focused on small business in the first weeks of the new congress the house and senate each appr oved versions of hr 2 bill increasing the minimum wage the senate bill contained smallbusiness tax cuts designed to offset the wage increases burden for small business and the house subsequently passed stand alone bill hr 976 containing smaller t of smallbusiness ta x benefits in mid march both chambers folded their minimum wage and respective tax provisions into separate versions of hr 1591 supplementa l appropriations bill and in late april congress approved conference committee version of the bill on may 1 however president bush vetoed the measure because of its iraqrelated provisions on may 24 congress approved an altern ative spending bill hr 2206 that included the tax provisions and the president signed the bill the following day pl 11028 during the summer of 2007 congressional ta xpolicy deliberations turned to variety of narrowly targeted policies for example energy taxation agriculture and conservationrelated taxation tax relief related to forgiv mortgage debt and tobaccotax increase serving as revenue raising offset for the state childrens health insurance program schip in ddition the farm bill approved by the house on july 27 contained tax proposal designed to restrict the use of bilateral ta x treaties by firms resident in third countries while the senate finance committee in early october approved tax measure containing agriculturerelated provisions along with energy and conservation tax incentives broader issue that congress focuse d on as the year progressed was the alternative minimum tax amt for individuals as described in more detail later in this report absent c ongressional action an increasing number of taxpayers are subject to the amt each year in previous years congress had provided temporary cuts in the amt that staved off increases in the amts applicability however the most recently enacted relief expired at the end of 2006 which made the issue increasingly pressing as the end of the 2007 tax year approached on october 25 chairman charles rangel of the house ways and means committee introduced hr 3970 containing am t relief as well as variety of both tax increases and tax cuts for businesses and individuals the bills amt provisions were oneyear cut in the amt followe d by outright repeal congressional tax policy debate increasingly focused on the amt and as deliberations proceeded central part of the debate and majo r difference between house and senate amt proposals became whether amt relief sh ould be coupled with revenueraising measures that would offset any adverse impact of the legi slation on the deficit on october 30 chairman rangel introduced hr 3996 whose amt provisions provided oneyear through 2007 cut in the amt rather than hrhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33768crs2 3970s temporary cut and ultima repeal in addition to the amt however the initial version of hr 3996 proposed to ex tend for one year set of other numerous temporary individual and busin ess tax benefits the extenders the measure also contained set of revenueraising provisions that would bring the estimated revenue impact of the bill close to revenue neutrality raising as much tax revenue as it was estimated to lose the full house passed the bill on november 9 the senate did not pass the house bill and instead pproved an amended version of hr 3996 containing only temporary amt relief w ithout either offse tting revenueraising measures or other tax cuts on december 12 the house approved h r 4351 another temporary amt bill that would also be revenueneutral but that contained fewe r unrelated provisions than the initial house version of hr 3996 the senate however did not approve the bill and on december 19 the house pproved the senatep assed standalone temporary amt tax cut without offsets app licable to 2007 the president signed the measure which became pl 110166 major focus of congressi onal tax deliberations in the opening month of 2008 has been an economic stimulus package signed to boost what is an apparently flagging economy leaders of the house of representatives reached an agreement with the administration on plan containi ng large tax elements including rebate for individual taxpayers and several busin ess tax cuts the full house passed the measure as hr 5140 on january 28 on january 30 the senate finance committee approved its version of stimulus plan that differed in some respects from the house passed bill on february 7 both the house and senate approved the version of the stimulus plan the house had passed in january but modified to deny the rebate to illegal immigrants and to extend the credit to social security and veterans disability recipients the president signed the bill it became pl 110185 the farm bill hr 2419 signed on may 22 2008 pl 110234 contains variety of tax provisions ffecting farmers payroll cr edits provisions affecting timber and changes in ethanol credits both the house and senate considered relief measure for the housing industry the senate passed hr 3221 on

authority the house bill hr 5720 included home buyers tax credit pr operty tax deduction expanded housing bonds and expanded low inco housing credits the house bill also had revenue offsets including delay and limit for worldwide interest allocation rules and basis reporting on capital gains by brokers the final bill signed on july 30 pl 110289 contained offsets but net operating loss provisions other likely areas for congressional ac tion on taxes in 2008 are suggested in part by items on which final action was not taken in late 2007 energy taxes and the extenders s 2886 has been introduced by nators baucus and grassley to address the extenders and to extend the amt pa tch second stimulus bill remains possibility hr 6049 proposes oneyear exte nsion one of the original extenders relating to gifts of conservation property was included in the farm bill httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33768crs3 congress does not consider tax policy in an economic or budgetary vacuum this report thus provides br oad view of tax policys cont ext before taking closer look at the particular tax issues that congress has either already considered or appears likely to consider in coming months the economic context tax policy is frequently considered by policymakers as tool for boosting economic performance in various ways and the likely economic effects of tax policy are often hotly debated for example if the economy is sluggish and unemployment is high tax cuts are some times recommended by some as fiscal stimulus to boost demand or in the longer term tax cuts for saving and investment are championed by some as means of boosting longterm economic growth at the same time taxes can also affect longrun growth through the federal budget along with spending tax revenues determine the size of the budget surplus or deficit and the size and nature of the budget balance can affect l ongrun growth by determining the extent to which governmentborrowing needs compete for capital with private investment thus damping longrun growth taxes also have distributional effect that is the rate and manner in which taxes apply to different activ ities groups and income levels can alter the distribution of income within the economy for exam ple taxes can affect the distribution of income across income levels affecting vertical equity by applying at different rates to different income levels and taxe s can affect horizontal equity by applying differently to differe nt types of income with these broad economic effects in nd discussion of three aspects of the economy follows first is look at the cu rrent state of the economy both in terms of longrun growth and the shortrun state of the business cycle next is review of the recent current and expect ed future state of the fede ral budget third is brief review of the level and di stribution of the tax burden the state of the economy throughout 2006 and the first two quart ers of 2007 the economy continued its expansion and recovery from the recession that reached its tr ough in n ovember 2001 the economy has now registered positive r eal economic growth for 22 consecutive quarters real growth was relatively sluggish during the first quarters of the recovery but began to pick up momentum in mid2003 in 2001 the first full year of the recovery real gross domestic pr oduct gdp grew at 08 rate followed by 16 in 2002 25 in 2003 39 in 2004 32 in 2005 and 33 in 2006 the growth rate was 25 in the last quarter of 2006 then fell to 07 in the first quarter of 2007 before rising to 38 in the second quarter and 49 in the third in july

congress works on bipartisan proposal the washington post january 18 2008 p a1 registering more rapid growth earlier in the recovery although he also noted that weakness in the housing market has placed drag on growth1 as 2007 progressed however signs of economic weakness surfaced in number of areas one prominent area was hous ing where prices stopped rising after years of growth and drops occurred in house sales and reside ntial investment second fina ncial markets came under strain as investor concerns about the credit quality of mortgages especially subprime mortgages had damping effect on credit flows further banks began reporting large losses resulting from declines in the market value of mortgages and other assets leading them to become more restrictive in their lending to firms and households also rising oil prices were believed to have damping effect as their impact perc olated through the economy and the unemployment rate increased to 50 in december2 the federal reserve board responded by taking actions to eas monetary policy in the second part of 2007 the apparent worsening of the econo mic situation led to support for economic stimulus legislation from the administr ation congressional l eaders and federal reserve board chairman ben bernanke both the administration and tax policymakers in congress began developing stimulus package in midjanuary which was enacted in february3 see tax cuts for economic stimulus below on pages 79 second stimulus package is under discu ssion the fed cut interest rates in march and april of 2008 gdp grew in the first two quarters of 2008 with 33 growth rate in the second quarter but empl oyment fell the unemployment rate fell slightly in january and february and rose slightly in march and remained at about that

for the fouryear period fy1998 fy2001 cbos most recent budget report re leased in january 2008 projects rise and then gradual decline in the deficit as percentage of gdp with small budget surplus 05 of gdp occurring in fy20125 as described below however this projection assumes that current policies remain in place and if that assumption is dropped the outlook changes an importa nt consideration given congressional interest in extending or making perm anent the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts which are scheduled to expire at the end of calendar year 2010 broader historical perspective shows several reversals in the federal budget situation in recent years the budget wa s in deficit throughout the 1970s 1980s and most of the 1990s before registering rplus in fy1998 the surplus resulted from both the booming economy and legislation signed to enforce budget discipline the budget surplus grew for the next two years reaching peak of 24 of gdp in fy2000 before declining in fy2001 and moving into deficit in fy2002 the difference between the surplus in fy 2000 and the deficit for fy2007 was 36 of gdp the budget data indicate that the change was result of both growth in outlays and decline in revenues as percentage of gdp the decline in revenues was more pronounced though not by wide margin revenues have d eclined from 209 of gdp in fy2000 to 188 in fy2006 drop of 20 percentage points outlays have increased by 18 percentage points over the same period the dec line in revenues had two sources the recession of 2001 and subs equent sluggish economic growth and enacted tax cuts the decline in the relative size of the deficit in fy2006 compared to fy2005 decline equal to 07 of gdp resulted from an increas in revenues and decline in outlays receipts increased by 03 of gdp while outlays fell by 04 of gdp the increase in total receipts in fy2007 prima rily reflects an increase in individual income tax receipts the outlook however may change as desc ribed elsewhere in this report the tax cuts enacted in 2001 by egtrra ex pire at the end of calendar year 2010 extending the tax cuts would have s ubstantial impact on the budget particularly after 2010 in addition the

maintained8 the federal tax burden the broadest gauge of the federal tax bur den is the level of federal receipts as percentage of output gross domestic product or gdp by this measure the federal tax burden has fluctuated cons iderably over the past five years in fy2000 federal receipts reached postworld war ii peak as percentage of output at 209 by fy2004 however receipts had fallen to 163 of gdp their lowest level since 1959 before rising again to 188 in fy 2007 in pa rt the fluctuations were result of the business cycle the long economic boom of the 1990s helped push receipts to their record level in fy2000 while the ensuing recession and sluggish recovery helped reduce the vel of revenues in subsequent years however policy changes too were responsible sign ificant tax cuts in 2001 2002 and 2003 each contributed to the decline in taxes another way to look at the tax burden is to compare it across income classes in combination the various components of the federal tax system have progressive impact on income distribution that is upperincome individuals tend to pay higher portion of their income in tax th an do lowerincome persons in isolation however the different components of the system have different effects the individual income tax is progressive but while payroll taxes are progressive in the lower and middle parts of the income spectrum they become regressive as incomes increase the corporate income tax and estate tax are both progressive although they impose only small burden excise taxes are regressive cbo has published distributional analyses for all

their 2008 tax returns in 2009 individuals w ill recalculate the credit based on 2008 information and can claim an additional cr edit if the 2008 information increases the amount of the credit if the 2008 credit is less than that actually received individuals will not be required to pay the difference according to the treasury department the checks will be issued beginning in may 200813 the plan phases out the combined child and basic credit for individuals earning threshold amount of more than 75000 150000 for joint returns it reduces the credit by 5 of the individuals income in excess of the threshold phaseout threshold business tax benefits under current law businesses are allowed to expense ie deduct immediately the ac quisition cost of limited amount of new investment in machines and equipment ra ther than depreciating it over period of years expensing thus provides postponeme nt deferral of ta xes which constitutes tax benefit because of the economic pr inciple of discounting the idea that given amount of funds is worth more the s ooner it is received prior to the stimulus act for 2008 firms were permitted to ex pense up to 128000 of investment the allowance was gradually reduced phased out for firms whose investment exceeds 510000 threshold the amount of the llowance was temporary increase over permanent cap of 25000 that is set to apply in 2011 and thereafter the permanent phaseout threshold is 200000 the stimulus bill provides oneyear for 2008 additional increase in the ex pensing cap and threshold to 250000 and 800000 respectively when not eligible for expensing outlays for tangible business property that is machines and equipment and commercial structures are required to be deducted gradually over number of years for 2008 the stimulus plan provides temporarily more generous depreciation rules for m achines and equipment under which 50 of the assets cost can be deducted in its fi rst year like expensing this provision provides tax benefit in the form of deferral although it is not as large economic considerations14 according to economic theory the purpose of fiscal stimulus is generally to boost th demand side of the economy in the short run when aggregate demand is thought to be temporarily insufficient to ensure full employment of the economys resources in designing fiscal stimulus one consideration is therefore whether the chosen approach is effective in injecting funds into the economy individuals may save rath er spend part of tax cut or transfers from the government and different stimulus tools may have different effects onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33768crs10 15 for detailed discussion of the economic impact of alternative fiscal policy tools see crs report rs21136 government spending or tax reduction which might add more stimulus to the economy by marc labonte 16 for detailed economic analysis of alternative taxcut stimulus measures see crs report rs21126 tax cuts and economic stimulus how effective are the alternatives by jane g gravelle and crs report rl31134 using business tax cuts to stimulate the economy by jane g gravelle saving second consideration is timing see for example th above statement by chairman bernanke stimulus measures address shortterm temporary slackness in aggregate demand and if stimulus is mistimed it may occur when the economy has resumed positive growth and thus contribute to inflationary pressures further at least part of fiscal stimulus is spent on imported goods which means that its impact is partly diluted finally fiscal stimulus can potentia lly reduce longrun economic growth countercyclical fiscal policy works by in creasing the federal budget deficit and herein is quandary while tax cut or spending increase might boost demand in the short run its effect on the budget defic it can reduce longterm economic growth by reducing the amount of national saving ava ilable for investment because of these three considerations fiscal stimulus pack age is frequently thought to be effective if it quickly and effectively injects funds into the economy but does not reduce long term growth by permanently incr easing the federal budget deficit15 temporary or onetimeonly tax cuts or spending increases have sometimes been proposed as way to provide short run stimulus without permanently reducing longrun growth in addition another speci fic design question facing policymakers is the appropriate mix of tax cuts and spending tools from strictly economic perspective the answer depends on the particular tax cut or spending increase that is chosen for example an increase in government spending can consist of either increased transfers to individuals for ex ample increased payments under the various government incomesupport programs or an increase of government purchases here an increase in purchases would incr ease aggregate demand more than either an increase in transfers or tax cut of identical size because it is likely that at least part of the latter will be saved rather than spent16 drawback to some types of government purchases however is that the government may not be able to put them into place quickly different types of tax cuts are also t hought to vary in their effectiveness of injecting funds into the economy on th business side for example investment incentives are generally thought to provide more stimulus per do llar of revenue loss than cut in corporate tax rates because firms may spend part of the benefit from rate cut on increases in dividends rather than on investment and dividend recipients may save rather than spend part of the former for individuals there is empirical evidence suggesting that lowerincome individuals are more likely to spend more of tax cut or transfer payment than are

that was adopted the job creati on and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107147 however did not contain rebate the act did include temporary bonus accelerated depreciation that was aimed at boosting business investment as well as temporary extension of net operating loss nol carrybacks for businesses prominent fiscal stimulus measures adopt ed in past decades were the revenue act of 1964 the kennedy tax cut of 1964 pl 88272 and th tax reduction act of 1975 pl 9412 the 1964 act reduced both individual and co rporate tax rates and augmented the existing investment ta x credit for businesses the 1975 measure included tax rebate18 hr 3970 the tax reduc tion and reform act one of the broadest tax proposals c onsidered by congress in 2007 was hr 3970 the tax reduction and refo rm act introduced by chairman charles rangel of the house ways and means committee on oc tober 25 the bill is an omnibus tax package containing variet of both individual and cor porate income tax provisions very preliminary revenue estimates indicate the bill would reduce revenue by net total of 538 billion over 5 years and by 75 billion over 10 years19 on the individual side chief focus of the bill is the individual alternative minimum tax amt as described elsewh ere in this report without legislative action the amt will include an increasing tion of taxpayers in its scope the bill has two amt provisions 1 oneyear patch that does not repeal the tax but that extends temporarily higher exemption level and allows nonr efundable regulartax credits to offset the amt and 2 comple repeal of the

benefits for indivi duals and businesses beyond the amt however hr 3970 pr oposes number of general tax cuts for individuals including an increased st andard deduction an increased child tax credit and expansion of the number of taxpayers qualifying for the earned income tax credit the bill would also extend for one year set of temporary individual income tax benefits extenders among the largest of these is the optional deduction for state and local sales taxes and the deduction for tuition in addition to these tax cuts the bill proposes number of revenueraising items applicable to individuals including rtax on upperincome i ndividuals designed to offset the cost of repealing the amt restoration of limits on itemized deductions and the personal exemption and an increase in the floor for itemized deductions in addition the bill would tax the carried interest income of investment fund managers as ordinary income rather than capital gains the estimated net effect of the bills individual income tax cuts and revenueraisers would be revenue loss of 450 billion over 5 years and 64 billion over 10 years in broad outline the proposals corpor ate income tax provisions couple very large tax cut provision reduction of the hi ghest statutory tax rate to 305 from current laws 35 with number of na rrower but in some cases sizeable revenueraising items as with indivi duals the bill also proposes oneyear extension of temporary cor porate tax benefits and it so would make permanent temporarily increased expensing benefit applicable to investment in equipment by relatively small businesses prominent among the bills revenueraising measures is repeal of the tax deduction for domes tic production and ferral of deductions attributable to taxdeferred foreignsource income together

foreign jurisdictions by us multinationals the alternative minimum tax for individuals the individual alternative minimum tax presents timesensitive issue for congress as each year passes more and mo re individuals will be subject to the amt rather than the regular tax according to one recent study in 2001 24 million individual income tax return s 18 of the total cont ained an amt liability in 2004 an estimated 35 million returns 26 had an amt liability in 2010 an estimated 371 million returns 256 will owe the amt27 the portion will decline for number of years thereafter if egtrras expiration occurs as scheduled but then will resume growth the reason for the increase in the applicability of the amt is its basic mechanics the amt functions like parallel income tax with lower rates than the regular tax but with broader base th at is with fewer deductions exemptions credits and special tax preferences than are allowable under the regular tax each year taxpayer pays either his or her regular tax or the tentative amt whichever is higher taxpayers are permitted fl at exemption amount in calculating their amt however the exemption is fixed at flat dollar amount that is not indexed for inflation and while the amt only has two rate brackets 26 and 28 the bracket dividing point is likew ise not indexed in contrast the structural features of the regular income tax personal exemp tions the standard deduction and rate bracket thresholds are indexed thus as time passes and incomes grow in both real and nominal terms the amt exceeds the regular tax for more taxpayers the phenomenon was magnified by the rate reductions and ta x cuts for married couples provided by egtrra and jgtrra as well as other tax cuts enacted in the past the original purpose of the amt was to ensure that individual with substantial income could use tax benefits and omissions from the tax base to reduce his or her tax liability below certain point there are several reasons why policymakers may be concerned with the prospect of its increased applicability first taxpayers who become subject to th amt face higher tax liability than they otherwise would some taxpayers moving into amt status may thus view the applicability of the amt as tax increase second taxpayers in amt status are not able to fully participate in tax cuts acted under the regular tax for example application of the amt prevented those taxpayers subject to the amt from fully realizing the tax cuts enacted under egtrra and jgtrra third the amt introduces complexity to the tax system and the amount of time spent in tax preparation increases for taxpayers in or near amt status on more conceptual level the amt can be viewed as balancing conflicting goals of the income tax on the one hand various deductions exemptions credits and other benefits under the re gular income tax are thought to be useful in promoting various activities considered to be socially desira ble or conducive to economichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33768crs17 28 it might be argued that the level intended by congress is that established under the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 where the permanent exemption levels and bracket amounts and rates were established 29 us congressional budget office the budget and economic outlook p 16growth on the other hand it is often deem ed desirable for tax system to achieve certain level of fairness both in horizontal terms the equal treatment of individuals with the same income but in different circumstances and vertical terms the relative treatment of individuals at different income levels further economists argue that broadbased tax systems with low rates characteristic of the amt are less damaging to economic efficiency than high errate systems that apply to bases laden with special benefits with the amt taxpayers can use the tax benefits available under the regular tax only up to point where considerations of equity and efficiency trigger applicability of the amt the bene fits economic growth and social goals are balanced with fairness and efficiency concerns to the extent the amts growth has resulted from inflation and lack of indexation it might be argued that the amts advance is unintended and the balance between equity and social and economic goals intended for the amt has been upset28 factor that substantially complicates the amt issue is its revenue effect which assumes increased prominence given current federal budget deficits for example indexing the amt for inflation would eliminate much of the impetus of the taxs increasing applicability according to congressional budget office cbo indexing the amt would reduce federal revenues by 569 billion over 10 years an amount equal to 16 of fe deral revenues expected ove r the period if egtrras tax cuts are extended or made permanent the cost of restraining the amt would be considerably larger29 as described above cong ress addressed the amt on temporary basis in 2001 and 2003 under egtrra and jgtrra by increasing the exemption amount thus reducing the number of taxpayers who woul d otherwise pay the amt in 2004 the working families tax relief act wftra pl 108311 extended through 2005 an exemption amount of 58000 for married couples and 40250 for single filers in 2006 the tax increase prevention and r econciliation act pl 109222

components and in the magnitude of their revenue effects specifically the finance committee bill contains revenue losing items estimated to re duce revenue by total of 32 billion over 10 years and

tax gap and in possibly restricting tax shelters some provisions such as credit card repor ting reporting the basis for capital gains and the economic substance doctrine have been considered in legislation as discussed above the tax gap and tax shelter concepts are closely related but not synonymous so clarification is useful the tax gap is concept defined by the internal revenue service for use in administering the tax code it is the difference between the amount of tax voluntarily and time ly paid by taxpayers and the actual tax liability of taxpayers the tax gap thus includes both deliberate and illegal tax evasion and nonpayment that occurs fo r more innocent reasons for example taxpayer error or simple inability to pay the concept of tax shelter is less precisely defined but is generally an ec onomic concept though whether to make it legal one as well is in fact an issu that has been debated in congress and elsewhere tax shelter is taxplanni ng device that individual or corporate taxpayers use to either illegally evade or legally avoid taxes in ways that were not intended by policymakers the tax gap leaders of both taxwriting committees have expressed interest in looking for ways to reduce the tax gap congressional interest appears to be especially high in the senate finan ce committee which conducted hearings on the tax gap in july 2006 and where the gap has

either through its oversight or legi slative functions legislatively the staff of the joint committee on taxation jct has issued two reports outlining numerous legislative approaches for reducing the tax gap35 the reports contain proposals aimed at restricting tax shelters nd closing perceived loopholes as well as measures that would address noncompliance by other m eans including simplification andor clarification of tax laws increased wit hholding and increased information reporting number of the reports proposals were incl uded as revenueraising measures in the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2006 it thus appears likely that if additional legislation is considered to address the tax gap it may include items from the jct report in september 2006 the department of the treasurys office of tax policy issued report outlining strategy for reducing the tax gap36 although the report was lacking in specifics and contained only preliminary information in some areas it listed number of different ways in which the irs might attempt to reduce the tax gap including strengthening reporting re quirements making efforts to enhance access to data enhancing ex amination and collection au thority revising penalties issuing addition regulations and guidan ce for taxpayers increasing research improving information technology and tablishing more efficient compliance activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33768crs23 37 us treasury office of tax policy comprehensive strategy for reducing the tax gap p 2 38 these definitions are taken from joseph j cordes and harvey galper tax shelter activity lessons from twenty years of evidence national tax journal vol 38 september 1985 pp 305320the report also however argued that component of reducing the tax gap should be reduction in tax code complexity which in the words of the report makes the tax law too difficult for ta xpayers to understand and for the irs to administer it also stated that enfor cement activities should be combined with commitment to taxpayer service and that compliance pr oposals should be sens itive to taxpayer rights and maintain an appropriate balance between enforcement activity and imposition of taxpayer burden37 the treasury departments qualifications illustrate what is probably the chief policy issue related to the tax gap the question of how vigorously to address it there are few policymakers or tax analysts who object in principle to the idea of reducing the tax gap in broad term s noncompliance not only reduces federal revenues directly and can thus be viewed as contributing to the budget deficit the gap also damages the perceived fairness of the tax system on the part of taxpayers who are compliant beyond the agreement in principle however there are disagreements over the extent to which cerns about taxpayer rights and the overall level of tax burdens should mitigate efforts to shrink the tax gap tax shelters in popular usage the term tax shelter denotes the use of tax deductions or credits from one activity to reduce taxes on another in economic terms tax shelter can be defined as transaction for exampl paper investment or sale that reduces taxes w ithout resulting in reduced re turn or increased risk for the participant38 but so vague and general is the term in most usages that it could also be defined simply as tax saving ac tivity that is viewed as undesirable by the person or agency observing the activity and using the term tax shelters can be either legal tax voidance or illegal tax evasion to the extent tax shelters are illegal they therefore contribute to the tax gap to the extent that they are legal but unintende d uses of the tax law loopholes they reduce tax revenue beyond the loss caused by the tax gap like the tax gap tax shelters not only reduce tax revenue directly but raise questions about tax fairness among taxpayers not using shelters in addition while some sh elters lack economic substance others involve the actual shif ting of economic resources solely for the purpose of saving taxes and may thus reduce economic efficiency congress has evinced considerable interest in tax shelters in recent years and has enacted some restrictions into law th american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca pl 108357 contained number of provisions designed to restrict tax shelters in part the acts provisions were directed at specific tax shelters for example leasing activities and the acquisition of losses for tax purposes built in losses in addition the act included provisions for example revised pe nalties and reportinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33768crs24 39 for list and description see crs report rl32193 antitaxshelter and other revenueraising tax proposals considered in the 108th congress by jane g gravellerequirements designed to restrict sheltering activity in general39 in 2006 the senate version of tipra c ontained number of tax shel ter restrictions but the provisions were not included in the conference committee bill prominent among the provisions was what the bill termed cl arification of th economic substance doctrine that has been followed in number of court decisions related to tax shelters generally the economic subs tance doctrine disallows ta x deductions credits or similar benefits in the case of transac tions determined not to have economic substance the senate version of tipr would have integrated aspects of the doctrine into the tax code itself similar measure was contained in the senate version of the ajca but was not adopted codification of the economic substance doctrine has been estimated by the joint tax committee to raise significant tax re venue given conti nuing federal budget deficits and the adoption of payasyougo type rules in both chambers of congress congress has continued to c onsider adopting economic subs tancerelated restrictions on tax shelters as means of providing re venue offsets for tax cuts elsewhere in october 2007 for example the senate finance committee approved economic substance related provisions as part of package containing energy conservation and agriculture tax benefits see th preceding section entitled taxes in 2007 agriculture legislation c odification of the economic s ubstance doctrine is also revenue raising item in the omnibus ta x bill hr 3970 introduced by chairman rangel of the house ways and means committee international taxation there are some indications that congress may include the tax treatment of us firms foreign income in any search for additional tax revenue for example during the summer of 2006 democratic leaders included call to end tax breaks that reward companies for moving american jobs overseas in the general policy agenda they outlined in the leadup to the midterm elections economic theory is skeptical bout whether tax policy towards us multinationals can have longterm impact on domestic employment although shortterm and localized impacts are certainly possible taxes can however alter the extent to which firms engage in overseas operations rather than domestic investment under current w tax benefit known as d eferral poses an incentive for us firms to invest overs eas in countries with relativel low tax rates in general terms deferral permits us firms to indefinitely postpone us tax on their foreign income as long as that income is reinvested abroad in foreign subsidiaries deferral is generally available for active busine ss operations abroad but the tax codes subpart f provisions restrict deferral in the case of inco from passive investment if made proposals to restri ct deferral may consist of expansion in the range of income subject to subpart f in recent years however the thrust of legislation has been more in the direction of expanding deferral and cutting taxes for overseas operations than for expandinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33768crs25 40 steven t dennis democrats first 100 hours costly amt rewrite an opening challenge to

subpart f in the case of banking and related businesses receiving active financing income and in the case of the look through treatment overs eas operations receive from other firms see also the discussion of tipra below further several analysts have recently argued that attempts to tax overseas ope rations are either counterproductive or outmoded in the modern integrated world economy traditional economic analysis however suggests that overseas investment that is taxed at lower or higher rate than domestic income impairs economic efficiency budget paygo rules there is some interest in congress in adopting budget rules that would place new limits on tax cuts and direct spending outlays that increase the federal budget deficit and the house took action on such rules in the first week of the 2007 session40 such action while not directly alte ring tax policy has the potential of altering the context in which tax policy is considered and could alter both the size and content of tax legislation according to some observers payasyougo paygo budget rules now lapsed that were enacted in 1990 made an important contribu tion to the federal budget surpluses that occurred in fy 1998fy2001 after decades of deficits41 the rules were provided by the budget enforcement act bea title x iii of pl 101 508 the omnibus budget reconciliation ac t of 1990 under the paygo rules if

the sequestration rules were effective they never required deficit reduction they only applied to increases in the budget deficit however because the alternative minimum tax may gradually increase tax

work opportunity tax act of 2007 tax treatment of small business is tinuing focus of c ongressional attention and the first months of the 110th congress were exception consideration of small business taxation occurred in conjunction w ith deliberations on the federal minimum wage the president and others argued that an increase in the federal minimum wage an issue debated early in the 110th congress should be coupled with consideration of tax cuts for small business the tax cuts were viewed by their proponents as means of offsetting the extra burden higher minimum wage may place on small businesses the tax cuts were enacted on may 24 as the small business and work opportunity tax act of 2007 component of larger act containing appropriations and an incr ease in the minimum wage pl 11028 the act provided tax cuts amounting to an estimated 71 billion over 5 years and 48 billion over 10 years the cuts were partly offset by revenueraising items amounting to 70 billion over 5 years and 44 billion over 10 years for net revenue gain of 71 million over 5 years and 55 million over 10 years net effect near to revenue neutrality43 taken alone the revenue losing and revenuegaining measures in the conference agreement fell between the house and senate bills in terms of their size the senate version of the bill provided both for larger tax cuts and revenue offsets than did the

nnot claim the allowance under the permanent rulesthe final acts tax cuts were generally t hough not exclusively targeted at small business prominent provision was an extension of the expensing tax benefit for business investment in machines and equipment tax benefit provided by section 179 of the tax code the provisi on is linked to small business because it applies only to firms undertaking less than certain level of investment the provision is tax benefit in that it permits firms to deduct in the first year of service expense capped amount of investment outlays rather than requiring the outlays to be deducted gradually in the form of depreciation as is required with most tangible assets permanent provisions of the in ternal revenue code cap the expensing allowance at 25000 per year and begin pha seout of the allowance when firms investment exceeds 20000044 however temporary ru initially enacted in 2003 and extended on several occasions incr eased the annual cap and threshold to 100000 and 40 0000 respec tively the increased amounts are indexed for inflation occurring after 2003 th amounts for 2007 are 112000 and 450000 the most recent extension was provided by tipra in 2006 and extended the increased allowance and threshold through 2009 pl 11028 extended the increased expensing allowance and also increased the allowance to 125000 and the phaseout threshold to 500000 another temporary tax benef it the act addressed was the work opportunity tax credit wotc in general wotc permits employers to claim tax credit equal to specified percentage paid in firstyear wages to members of certain targeted groups including families receiving mporary assistance for needy families tanf support qualified veterans highrisk youth and others under prior law wotc was scheduled to expire at the end of 2007 pl 11028 extended the credit through august 2011 and made several modifications in qua lification criteria for the targeted groups the act modified the tax credit employers can cl aim against social security fica taxes paid for employees who receive tips the modification was designed to keep the new higher minimum wage from having the effect of reducing the credit under both the act and prior law the credit is equal to the employers fica tax on tips in excess of those meeting the minimum wage requirement arithmetic thus dictates that if the minimum wage is increased and other changes are made and tips do not increase the tax credit will be reduced an increase in the minimum wage reduces the amount by which tips exceed the minimum wage pl 11028 increased the minimum wage to 725 from prior laws 515 and would thus have reduced the tax credit absent other changes however the act provides that the credit will continue to be calculated based on prior laws minimum wage the act also provided that both the fica credit and wotc can offset taxpayers alternative minimum tax the act contained two principal revenue raising provisions one increased the scope of the kiddie tax provision that taxes children under the age of 18 athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33768crs28 their parents tax rate on unearned income exceeding certain threshold the act increased the applicable age by one year ie under age 19 or under 24 if fulltime students the second revenuera ising provision lengthens the period after which interest and penalties are suspended for unpaid taxes in cases where the taxpayer has not received notice from the irs tax relief and health care act of 2006 trhca pl 109432 separately from the broa d tax cuts enacted under egtrra and jgtrra the tax code contains numerous tax provisions almost excl usively tax benefits that were initially enacted on temporary basis with specific expiration dates the provisions extenders tend to be relatively narrow and are generally designed to promote specific types of activity or inves tment they have nded to be grouped and considered together with each other but separately from the more generally applicable tax cuts enacted under egtrra and jgtrra the specific areas of economic activity c overed by the extenders vary widely and each presents its own unique policy issu at the same time however the basic economic issues presented by almost all the extenders are similar economic theory holds that the economy functions most effi ciently when taxes or other factors do not distort the allocation of resources by fa voring one activity over another only in unusual cases where there is failure of th market to function properly is economic efficiency held to be improved by intr oducing tax distortions the extenders each present the question of whether the particul ar benefit they provide corrects market failure absent such failure however the particular benef it may be supported by belief in the social benefit of the activity that is promoted in 2006 congress considered the extenders as part of reconc iliation legislation but did not include them in the reconciliation bill that was enacted the tax increase prevention and reconciliation b ill of 2005 see the discussion in the next section however congress returned to the ex tenders in its postelection session on december 9

whose size was modest compared to number of other tax bills enacted in 2001 2003 and 2004 the chief elements of tipra were extension of two temporary provisions contained in earlier taxcut bills

gains and dividends to 15 5 for income in th 15 and 10 regularincome brackets but scheduled its reductions to expire at th end of 2008 absent an extension the capital gains rate would have reverted to

dividend and capital gains rate s for two years through 2010 as described above congress enacted temporary increases in the amt exemption in 2001 and 2003 under egtrra and jgtrra respectively in 2004 wftra extended through 2005 an exemption amount of 58000 for married couples and 40250 for single filers tipr extended the increased exemption for one year under its provisions the exemption amount is 42500 singles and 62550 couples for 2006 absent furthe r action the exemption amounts will revert in 2007 to the preegtrra amounts of 45000 and 33750 for couples and singles respectively tipra also extended for two years through 2009 an increased expensing allowance for smallbusine ss investment in machines and equipment under tipra the maximum expensing allowance is 100000 absent its extension the allowance would have reverted to 25000 in addition tipra extended for two years through 2008 more generous rules for the active financing income of us multinational firms the act also contained number of revenueraising itemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33768crs30 among the most prominent was scalingb ack of the exclusions for foreign earned income and housing provided by section 911 of the tax code and new requirement for withholding by payments made by state and local government entities to contractors the conference agreement on tipra differed in important respects from both the house and senate bills the house bill but not the senate bill contained the extended capital gains and dividend rates the senate bill but not the house bill contained extension of the increased am t exemption as described above tipra contained both at the same time however both the house and senate bills contained extension of numerous expiring tax provisions extenders beyond the several measures that were
