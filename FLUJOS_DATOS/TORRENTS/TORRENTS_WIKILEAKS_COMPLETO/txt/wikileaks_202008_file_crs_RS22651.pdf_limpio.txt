g343g561g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 the intended purpose of regulatory relief for financial services providers is to lower the cost of regulation on institutions offering financial services however regulatory relief provisions could have significant impact on the growing concentr ation in the us banking industry for example regulatory relief that reduces regulations limiting banks ability to merge could lead to more large and fewer small banks on the other hand it is important to bear in mind that financial institution regulations exist for many important purposes to encourage the safety and soundness of individual institutions ensure systemic stability deter concentration and encourage competition and provide consumer protection regulatory tools vary as well in addition to the laws and regulations specifying both the kinds of activities in which institutions may engage and their structural arrangements regulatory tools include licensing provisions periodic examinations reporting and disclosure requirements and supervision by regulators particularly of problem institutions in providing regulatory relief members of congress regulators and industry analysts necessarily face the issue of whether existing laws and regulations restrain efficiency andor competitiveness in the financial services marketplace the financial services regulatory relief act of 2006 pl 109351 120 stat 1966 was enacted on october 13 2006 after protracted debates in both houses of congress on the underlying billshr 3505 and s 2856 while federal financial services regulators are implementing pl 109351 regulatory relief provisions excluded from the law are now being reintroduced in the 110 th congress this report gives brief summary of the provisions of pl 109351 by title followed by the provisions that federal regulato ry agencies are implementing the report then briefly examines the financial services regulatory relief provisions that currently being reintroduced in the 110th congress it concludes with discussion of financial services regulatory relief legislative process and the banking industrys increased concentration

implemented it may take years and new legislation to complete the implementation as demonstrated by the provisions of the gramm leachbliley act of 1999 which is being implemented by pl 109351 in 2007 at the same time provisions that were considered in the legislative process but were excluded from pl 109 351 are now being reintroduced in the 110th congress one title would permit national bank greater flexibility in designing its articles of association including how its directors are elected national bank could also choose not to use cumulative voting which is now mandated by current law this title also has provisions to simplify dividend calculations and repeal obsolete regulations including regulations that limit the authority of the comptroller of the currency these provisions like the national bank provisions of hr 3505 see above provide national banks greater organizational flexibility but stop short of permitting national banks to fundamentally change their current organizational structure g22g146g157g149g142g561g11g24g495g561g21g138g159g146g151g144g156g561g3g156g156g152g140g146g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 would amend the

receiver for national bank by providing 30day period for party to judicially challenge an occ appointment section 711 underscores the authority of state regulators for institutions chartered on the

and the securities and exchange commission asked for comments on their joint proposal to clarify the rules governing banks securities activities1 this is in response to title i of the financial services regulatory relief act of 2006 which directed the sec and the federal bank regulatory agencies to jointly issue proposed rules within 180 days of the laws enactment this proposal is the latest effort to meet the mandate of the grammleachbliley act glba of 1999 that repealed broad registration exemption for bankers securities activities and replaced it with specific exemptions the sec had issued several proposals that were criticized by bankers and their regulators the bank regulatory agencies and the sec will take comments 1 this joint effort is supported by many analysts see

the sec has also extended the exemption for banks until july 2 2007 the federal reserve board has also invited public comments on its rules that would implement section 601 of the financial services regulatory relief act of 2006 which eliminates several statutory reporting and disclosure requirements related to insider lending by insured depository institutions2 the bank regulatory agencies supported eliminating these requirements because the agencies have not found them useful in monitori ng insider lending or preventing insider abuse when these rules become final they would amend the federal reserve boards regulation which places restrictions on the ability of insured depository institutions to extend credit to their executive officers directors and principal shareholders section 728 of the financial services regulatory relief act of 2006 mandated that federal regulatory agencies develop model format for conveying financial institutions privacy policies the model must be easily underst ood by consumers it should clearly explain consumers right to opt out of permitting the sharing of their nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties the law mandated that the regulatory agencies develop the model and issue it for public comment later than 180 days after the date of its enactment which is april11 2007 the model if approved in final rulemaking would serve as safe harbor for institutions that use it to satisfy their account opening and annual privacy notification requirements the privacy notices were required by the grammleachbliley act of 1999 effective july 1 2001 but as the new proposal mentioned many of the notices that were offered to comply with glba were long and complex causing complaints of confusion from consumers the sample model provides simple introductory information telling consumers why the financial institutions share customer information and what types of information are shared it also details the uses of the shared information and indicates whether the consumer can limit the sharing most important the model provides simple optout form that can be returned to the financial institution the federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed interim rules to implement section 605 of pl 109351 this provision of the law extends the range of small institutions eligible for an extended 18month onsite examination cycle to wellcapitalized wellmanaged banks and savings associations with up to 500 million in total assets this change reduces the cost of preparing for onsite examinations for more small institutions before this regulatory change effective april 3 2007only banks with less than 250 million in total assets could qualify for the extended 18month cycle g20g142g146g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g142g141g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 analysts expect more provisions of hr 3505 and s 2856 that were not included in pl 109351 will be reintroduced in the 110 th congress as well as new provisions favorable provisions for credit unions thrifts and small and large banks are likely to be reintroduced as separate bills or titles attached to nonfinancialservices legislation as was the case in other regulatory relief bills in past congresses 2 for the federal reserve boards press release and other documentation see

hr 3505 in the 109th congress was the first provision to be reintroduced in the 110th congress ctrs are currency transaction reports this provision would exempt institutions seasoned customers from the requirements under federal antimoneylaundering laws that require currency transactions of more than 10000 to be reported to the internal revenue service hr 3505 would have exempted suspicious activity reports sars as well as ctrs for seasoned customers it was argued that sars exemptions could seriously undermine the us antiterrorism financing efforts title i in hr 3505 which was excluded from pl 109351 by the senate would allow national banks to elect to be organized as s corporations s corporations are limited liability corporations llcs that avoid double federal taxation of profits in the 110 th congress the senate approved package that includes 757 million in tax benefits for banks including 351 million aimed directly at s corporation banks this provision was part of hr 1591 the bill to provide war supplemental funding that the president has threatened to veto nearly third of all american banks are s corporations they are usually smaller banks however one of these banks has assets of 14 billion and 42 have assets of more than 1 billion 3 the credit union regulatory improvement act of 2007 curia was introduced in the 110th congress on march 15 2007 hr 15374 the new bill has 21 provisions which is three more than there were in the credit union regulatory improvement act curia of 20055 in the enactment of pl 109531 only five of the 15 provisions in hr 3505 were included in the law this suggests that while the number of credit union regulatory relief provisions are growing congress has been very selective in the ones it enacts the new bills additional provisions tend to be more multifaceted for example in title i capital modernization it proposed lowering the capital requirements amended the riskbased net worth requirements and amended the net worth restoration plans in curia 2007 section 201 would simply raise the cap on credit union member business loans to 20 from the present 125 g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 to date not all the provisions of pl 109351 have been implemented it may take years and new legislation to complete the implementation as demonstrated by the provisions of the grammleachbliley act of 1999 which is being implemented by pl 109351 in 2007 at the same time provisions that were considered but excluded from pl 109351 are now being reintroduced as separate bills in the 110 th congress at some point later in the legislative session these individual relief bills may be bundled in single regulatory relief bill regulatory relief legislation often changes the playing field for depository institutions because many regulations restrict or expand the activities of institutions consequently regulatory relief legislation often has significant impact on particular institutions in the financial services

burden woul d have an impact on reversing the growing concentration in the financial services industry is uncertain because knowledgeable observers agree that the banking industry concentration is partly attributable to economies of scale larger institutions experience declining average cost as they grow these same institutions experience economies of scale in complying with the fede ral banking regulations this implies that additional regulation relief legislation makes it increasingly difficult for smaller institutions to comply and compete in the marketplace
