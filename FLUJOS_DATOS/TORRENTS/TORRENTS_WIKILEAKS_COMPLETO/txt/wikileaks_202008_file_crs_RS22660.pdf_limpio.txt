current law and the bills introduced over the past several years ll seek to balance the availability of imported prescription drugs with the assurance that these imports would be safe and effective spons ors of drug importation legisla tion want to reduce or restrain the financial burden prescription drugs place on us consumers senator dorgans website description of his gislative proposal uses the title reducing the cost of prescription drugs under current law it is illegal for anyone to import prescription drug other than its manufacturer the law includes provisions for pharmacists and wholesalers to import but provides that they not become effective until the secretary of health and human services hhs certifies that the importati on program would be safe and offer cost savings to us consumers secretaries in both the clinton and bush administrations have declined to provide that certification referring to safe ty and cost concerns the requirement was first establis hed by the medicine equity and drug safety meds act of 2000 which added ffdca section 804 spite much debate to change that approach congress included im portation provisions in the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act mma p l 108173 that retained the certification requirement current law addresses importation for personal use differently until secretary provides the certification the w does not permit individuals to import prescription drugs for their own use if secretary were to certify and allow the importation program section 804 still would not directly allow indi vidual importation it would authorize the secretary to waive under sp ecific conditions the provisions that prohibit importation by individuals fda has chosen to leniently enforce that ban and has allowed

for cons umers to bring lowerpriced prescription drugs into the united states according to its policy statement on importing drugs for personal use fda intended this enforcement discretion to allow individuals to get treatments not otherwise available in the united states3 s 242hr 380 the pharmaceutical market access and drug safety act of 2007 would rewrite section 804 it would eliminate the secretar ys certification requirement and allow pharmacists wholesalers and i ndividuals to import prescription drugs under program that would addr ess potential safeguards re garding drug safety and effectiveness in s 242hr 380 senator dorgan and cosponsors led by senator snowe and representative emanuel and co sponsors led by representativ emerson continued the approach they had taken in the 109th congress s 242hr 380 differs in few aspects from its predecessor in part by incl uding some provisions from the other 109th congress bills those provisions related primarily to aspects of packaging that address identification and protections against tampering and count erfeiting and requirements to impede unlawful drug importation requests by prohibiting certain payment system transactions involving unreg istered foreign pharmacies s 242hr 380 differs from current law in its approach to ensuring that imported drugs are safe and effective the bill so includes provisions to influence industry behavior so that drugs are available for im port by us consumers at cost savings to current domestic prices finally it includes administrative arrangements including financing safe and effective drugs relationship to fda approval current law explicitly requires that an imported drug be approved for us sale by the fda s 242hr 380 would require that manufacturer notify the hhs secretary when drug that could be imported differs from the version fda has approved for sale in the united states the us label drug the bill would require extensive information about whether the difference if it were to be made to us label drug w ould require supplemental app lication to fda and whether fda would require that the application be pr ocessed before the drug could be marketed

10 countries admitted to membership in may 2004 the legislation includes criteri by which the secretary could add other countries to this list ensuring drug identity to address the possibility th at adulterated or counterfeit drugs could enter the us market s 242 hr 380 calls for variety of procedures regarding registration monitoring inspecting and testing packaging and labeling and internet pharmacies registration current law requires that cana dian establishment involved in the distribution of prescription drug that is imported or offered fo r importation into the united states register with the secretary its name and place of business and the name of its us agent s 242hr 380 would requi re all exporters from permitted countries and all commercial importers to register monitoring inspecting and testing while current w relies on laboratory testing of samples of every shipment of impor ted drugs to verify their content potency and labeling s 242hr 380 would instead require documentation of monitored uninterrupted chain of custody from manufacturing facility to importer the requirements related to registration involve ongoing and onsite physical m onitoring of the facilities of drugs manufacturer exporter and importer if the secretary determines it necessary these would include the inspection of any f acility and its records that handles the product along the chain of custody packaging and labeling to ensure that drug dispensed to individual consumers is the same product that was tested monitored or inspected at specific manufacturing shipping or storage facility s 242hr 380 would require that the packaging of all prescription drugs not ju st those being imported incorporate overt optically variable counterfeit resistant technologies that pr ovide visible identification of the product and be s imilar to those used to secure us currency in addition manufacturers must incorporate the technol ogies into elements of the packaging including blister packs shrink wrap package labels package seals bottles and boxes the bill would require that the exporter and importer agree to mark each shipping container to identify its compliance with all registration conditions the markings must include anticounterfeiting or trackandtrace technology taking into account their economic and technical feasibility and must be designed to prevent unauthorized affixation internet pharmacies current law does not address use of the internet to sell or purchase imported prescription drugs s 242hr 380 would require that detailed information be accessible on an internet pharmacys website covering pharmacist credentials address and tele phone contacts and the name and professional licensure information of the person if any who provide s for medical consultations through the site for purposes of providing prescriptions the bill includes many restrictions such as one could dispense or sell drug if the purchaser or patient who communicated through the internet did not have valid us prescr iption and the dispenser of the prescription drug must have qua lifying medical relations hip with the patienthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22660crs5 cost savings to us consumers even if secretary were to issue the certification necessary to begin the drug importation section in the ffdca many anal ysts and members of congress anticipate manufacturer resistance to practice that might limit the i ndustrys revenue s 242hr 380 contains specific provisions design ed to influence industry behavior discrimination and unfair acts s 242hr 380 would make it unlawful for manufacturer directly or indi rectly including being pa rty to licensing or other agreement to discriminate or act unfairly against an exporter importer or person who distributes sells or uses an imported pres cription drug by charging higher price denying restricting or delaying supplies or refusing to do business drug differences s 242hr 380 would make it unlawful for manufacturer to make drug for distribution in permitted country so that it differs from the drug made for us distribution for the purpose of restricting importation of the drug enforcement provisions include the involve ment of the federal trade commission and the state attorneys general patent law recent federal court case has raised the prospect that drug manufacturer could under certa in circumstances sue drug importer for patent infringement and block us imports of drugs the company sells abroad the court ruled that us patent is not exhausted by fore ign sales and thus drug manufacturer could exercise its patent rights nd block imports of its patented drug products into the united states s 242hr 380 would insert new subsection in the pate nt and trademark act to reverse this judicial pr ecedent under the provision g oods that were the subject of authorized foreign sales by us patent holder may be imported into the united states without regard to the us patent administration of importation provisions s 242hr 380 would set up fee mechanism to fund the administrative and regulatory tasks of the importation program it also would set specific implementation dates funding current law includes explicit funding mechanism other than authorizing appropriations of such sums as necessary to implement the prescription drug importation provisions s 242hr 380 prov ides for both exporter and commercial importer fees designed to cover all costs of the program it links the aggregate total of all fees to the estimated costs of the importati on program setting limit of 25 of the total price of drugs imported the secretary would collect from each exporter and importer both flat registration fee and proportional registration fee each individual importer or exporter would pay the latte r fee based on the extent of its own activity and calculated to estimate its proportion of the aggregate amount s 242hr 380 would require that these fees be used only for the administrati on of the importation provisions that the bill would addhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22660crs6 4 see crs report rl33175 importation of prescription drugs sidebyside comparison of current law s 109hr 328 s 184hr
