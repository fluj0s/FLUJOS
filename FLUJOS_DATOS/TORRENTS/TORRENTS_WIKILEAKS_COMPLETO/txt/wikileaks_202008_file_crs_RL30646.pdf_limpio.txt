national interests that challenge the united states on issues of importance to both countries the end of the cold war has altered balance that once placed security above political and economic competition the leading european union members including france are enhancing political cooperation raising questions about traditional areas of us leadership in europe at the same time us and french interests often intersect and the two countries cooperate in important endeavors france like the united states believes that it has special role in the world for many years french leaders have believed that france has mission to encourage human rights and democracy for the past halfcentury version of frances mission is that the country must play key role in shaping the european union key french leaders are critical of us culture and the us government including congress they have described congress as isolationist and unilateralist on such issues as sanctions and national missile defense they also believe that us leaders have tendency in foreign policy to seek to fix things or find full solution when at best in their view particular problem can only be managed but not eliminated some french leaders and intellectuals view us cultural and economic influence as materialistic and insidious the european union is central to french political and economic life france wishes to see institutional reforms in the eu to make the union more flexible in decisionmaking to wield greater influence in the world the eu in the view of france and some other member governments must have military capability to this end france and britain have taken the lead in building european security and defense policy esdp while some us officials believe that esdp could enhance burdensharing and encourage stability in europe others fear that it may marginalize nato by assuming current nato tasks and reducing the role of the united states in europe in addition some congressional and administration critics believe that esdp will create hollow force that borrows us assets and degrades the readiness of us forces range of regional issues are on the usfrance bilateral agenda france often buffers us interests by assuming peacekeeping responsibilities in different parts of the world and through other means that encourage stability at the same time the two countries sometimes compete for political and economic influence in the middle east africa and elsewhere the common interests of the united states and france remain greater than their differences in instances where the two countries interests have been seriously challenged they have tended to work together in european security issues above all france is seeking to bear greater burden with the tradeoff that washington must in the french view cede greater measure of influence to parishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30646contents introduction 1 background 2 the political setting 2 overview of french

introduction france while key ally has developed policies in pursuit of its national interests that often present challenge to the united states on issues of importance to both countries the end of the cold war has altered balance that once placed security above political and economic competition clear intention of the leading european union members including france to enhance political cooperation is raising questions about traditional areas of us leadership in europe during the past decade an increasingly critical perception among french political leaders and intellectuals toward the united states including congress has led to more than the traditional barbs aimed at us policy and culture this changed perception is finding expression in concrete policies in part intended to set eu members on course more independent of us influence france and several other countries to lesser degree are seeking to enhance eu influence in shaping the us debate over issues that affect european interests the french governments perception of and reaction to threats to security its faith in multilateral institutions to manage international problems and popular belief that globalization is an americandominated trend harming french interests set france apart from the united states on range of questions at the same time key interests of france and the united states remain intertwined and government policies in paris and washing ton on many issues are mutually beneficial on many questions the policy and objectives of the two countries converge this report begins with brief analysis of french political and economic developments followed by sketch of french views of frances role in the world and of the united states an examination of the key role that the eu occupies in french policymaking follows with an eye on affected us interests next follows an analysis of competing french and us efforts to shape european security policy with special attention to french military modernization and intentions in promoting development of european security and defense policy esdp with emphasis on implications for us leadership of nato the next section examines

chirac améliore sa position sans surclasser lionel jospin monde henceforth lm april 4 2000 p 6 jacques chirac retour monde des livres may 19 2000 p viiibackground the political setting france is in period of cohabitation with president of one party and prime minister of another in 1997 gaullist president jacques chirac illadvisedly called legislative elections in which his party the rally for the republic rpr and its centrist governing partner lost large majority the socialists gained plurality and chirac appointed lionel jospin to form leftist coalition government prime minister jospin has given mostly minor ministerial posts to the greens and the communists the constitution gives preponderant role to the president as decisionmaker in foreign and defense policy but jospin has capitalized on disarray within the right by occasionally taking initiatives without chiracs clear approval however both the jospin government and chirac agree that france must seek to strengthen the political development of the european union and build an eu that enjoys real voice in global affairs jospin is expected to challenge chirac in coming presidential elections both legislative and presidential elections will occur in 2002 jospin from the moment he became prime minister has pledged to break established traditions and practices he has emphasized efforts to end corruption in government and business and sought to open the economy to greater outside investment in part due to the eus urging in march 2000 jospin replaced unpopular and ineffective ministers and brought in socialists who would broaden the governments base on the left and in the center on the right chirac saw his party split apart after the failed legislative elections of 1997 sizable faction led by former rpr member charles pasqua is criticizing chirac for supposedly abandoning gaullist principles by agreeing to cede more sovereignty to the european union and for his political leadership pasqua and others from the centerright may challenge chirac for the presidency both chirac and jospin remain popular with the french public with chirac viewed as statesmanlike and jospin as courageous and modern1 wellperforming economy has bolstered the fortunes of the socialistled coalition when jospin became prime minister in june 1997 unemployment stood at 13 by july 2000 it had fallen to 97 in 1998 the government pushed law through parliament that reduced the work week from 39 to 35 hours critics contend that while the law may encourage hiring it may ultimately reduce productivity they also contend that many jobs created under the socialists are lowpaying and often parttime and that there is brain drain of young people trained for the high technology sector going to the united states and britain both for education and for jobs inflation is low and has remained steady perhaps helped by european monetary union which both jospin and chirac have strongly supported to many observers surprise the socialists have proceeded with gradual privatization where there was previously considerable intervention in key industries such as defense banking telecommunications and insurance the

political importance many economists believe the economy will expand through 2002 factor that could aid jospin as the architect of government economic policy2 overview of french perspectives france like the united states believes that it has special role in the world the core of the perceptions of frances role in the world stems from the revolution that began in 1789 the revolution was an event of broad popular involvement widespread bloodshed expropriation of property and execution of the king fed the notion that there could be turning back to monarchical government not only was the monarchy overthrown and powerful church structure forcibly dismantled but french armies and ultimately french administrators in their wake also transformed much of the continent into societies where more represen tative institutions could ultimately take root the revolution was therefore central formative element in modern european history the cultural achievements of france before and since the revolution have added to french influence french became the language of the élite in many european countries by 1900 french political figures of the left and right shared the opinion that france was and must continue to be beacon for the rest of the world3 the view that france has mission in the world endures today french intellectuals of the eighteenthcentury enlightenment laid the basis for many of todays precepts about human rights and democracy later forged into concrete form by the revolution and evinced by the modern french state for many years the french government emphasized the message of human rights and democracy particularly in the developing world and in central europe by the mid20th century some french colonies such as algeria and morocco sharply disputed whether actual french policy met the ideals of this message in different form through much of the 1990s french officials particularly gaullists were highly assertive in seeking to engender french views in european union initiatives sometimes in concert with germany and sometimes alone in 1996 the former gaullist prime minister alain juppé called for an inner circle in the eu defined as small number of states around france and germany that must move forward to secure european monetary union common foreign and security policy and military force able to protect the unions interests his foreign minister added

sometimes become entangled in rhetorical fusillades aimed at the united states president chirac has said that he wishes to see the european union become an active and powerful center the equal of the united states and one of the great centers of decisionmaking and action in the world with france playing catalytic role in forging such leadership5 prime minister jospin has said that he sees tendency to hegemony in us security policy in europe french officials criticize what they view as unilateralist us initiatives or actions against the interest of the european allies and taken without consultation and say that they wish to see important international issues undertaken in multilateral context6 congress is increasingly the target of french criticism french officials and media cite the senates defeat of the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt in the fall of 1999 sanctions legislation against cuba and iran and support for the national missile defense program as examples of unilateralism president chirac has said that congress all too often succumbs to the temptations of unilateralism and isolationism leading foreign policy analyst in notably vitriolic editorial has attacked the senate as irresponsible for its vote on ctbt and charged that the majority of us elected officials are totally ignorant of international issues7 some observers of france and the united states see fundamental clash in the way in which the two countries pursue international policies in this view the united states now the lone superpower and protected for much of its history by two oceans has tendency to wish to fix things to achieve full solution in short order to problem8 in contrast france has been invaded many times in its history and thereby lives with an inescapable sense of vulnerability and limitations having experienced long and often violent path to stability and democracy france is more likely to seek to manage an international problem and to seek longterm

elections and ideology cannot alone yield democracy and sanctions cannot force government to change its ways instead many years must pass with an evolution of civic institutions and attitudes before people decide to adopt and develop its own model of democracy9 more than rhetorical sparring over specific issues is at play because there is also perception that us power and influence are affecting the substance of everyday life in france this is not altogether new development since the end of the first world war many french have viewed the american evocation of technology and the virtues of industriousness as having yielded culture in the united states that values materialism more than intellectual endeavor an original meaning of the french word américanisation was mass production with negative connotations about the loss of individualism and creativity today in global economy many french politicians and commentators are portraying us practices as invasive and insidious while some french observers believe that american individualism contributes positively to global economic growth because us entrepreneurs are often unafraid of the risks of restructuring old industries to make them more competitive and some invest in us companies others believe that unbridled us capitalism leads to rapacious materialism and society where the poor are left by the side of the road10 interior minister jeanpierre chevènement the most nationalistic voice in the government contends that globalization often used negatively in france as synonym for americanization risks making europe rich suburb of the american empire such sentiments are sometimes reflected in the street the violent sacking of mcdonalds in 1999 in reaction to us tariffs on french agricultural goods and as symbol of american capitalism and culture received wide coverage in the french media many french investors appear to believe that us money managers who demand high rates of return have bought heavily into french companies forcing their restructuring and leading to employees being thrown out of work us ambassador felix rohatyn has spent considerable effort countering this perception by noting that it is companys own managers and competition in the international marketplace and not wall street clique that bring about decisions over restructuring11 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30646crs6 12 statement of the prime minister on the priorities of the french presidency of the eu before the national assembly may 9 2000 and jacques chirac european defense speech before the weu parliamentary assembly and the ihedn may 30 2000france and the european union the european union is central to french political and economic life in concrete sense france shares sovereignty with other eu members through agreement on eu legislation that guides french laws on wide range of social and economic issues because brussels has significant influence over daily life the french government must constantly make the case to citizens that the eu is beneficial and not distant decisionmaking bureaucratic entity overriding the democratic process most notably qualifying for emu meant imposition by paris of austerity budgets that curbed government expenditures and reduced public debt as well as acceptance of the european central bank ecb that set monetary policy for the eleven countries adopting single currency in real sense france and its emu partners have ceded to the ecb sovereign power to determine price stability interest rates and exchange rates in return member states believe that emu will make the european union more competitive in international markets more influential in international trade and financial institutions and their individual societies wealthier with diminished unemployment less costly social programs and greater social peace emu is both an economic and political act meant to deepen integration of member states political economic and social life in contrast to the preceding gaullist government an important change of tone on the french governments role in the eu is noticeable under jospin today to chirac and jospin the eu is union deepening of the nation european affairs are longer foreign affairs and the european debate is not separate from the national debate12 these views are step back from those of the gaullist government of the mid1990s which described france as the catalytic force shaping key eu policies jospin in particular is more likely to describe france as mediumrange power unable to play the role of the eus arbiter and he recognizes frances limitations for influencing events on the global stage such change is politically significant because it could diminish concerns in such countries as britain italy and the netherlands that paris is attempting to impose french model on the union and is more willing instead to seek compromises that clearly acknowledge the interests of states with differing views france has long joined with germany in undertaking the key steps to build the european union most recently the two countries were the driving force for emu implemented in 1999 among 11 of the unions 15 members the french and german governments agree that eu institutions must be reformed to streamline decision making before the union enlarges further although france has less enthusiasm for enlargement but the close working relationship from the years when the late french president mitterrand and former german chancellor kohl drove major eu initiatives is less apparent today some french officials believe that german chancellor schroeder has less interest in france than his predecessor and that his principal goals are to consolidate unification build german economic power and cement relations with central european

brussels is out of touch with the needs of the man in the street that the union is sediment of treaties and regulations14 member governments face the institutional challenge of making eu decisionmaking machinery more efficient and the political challenge of persuading their citizens that the union is bettering their lives and not robbing countries of their national identities the french government during its eu presidency of julydecember 2000 has as its goal to make eu decisionmaking more flexible and the union appear less technocra tic and more responsive to citizens needs jospin in speech to the national assembly made after consultation with chirac outlined the objectives of the french eu presidency among these were reform eu institutions to diminish the possibility of deadlock and weight votes on the basis of population in the european council to reflect more democratic proportional representation before the eu enlarges step that would strengthen the influence of more populous members such as france and germany15 enhance economic integration to promote job creation and further member states coordination of social policies strengthen defense and security cooperation in eu structures provide for more reinforced cooperation exemplified by emu to allow willing states to deepen integration on selected issues even when other states do not wish to participate16 the french governments ambitious agenda contains several important political signals to member state populations the agenda promises that continued political integration will not sacrifice the peoples democratic voice to critics of the eus bureaucratic machinery and to governments leery of enlargement it promises reformhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30646crs8 17 crs cooper euus economic ties in decisionmaking and to countries wary of greater deepening such as the united kingdom it warns that political integration will continue us perspectives and the french eu presidency for many years us administrations and congress have strongly supported enhanced political cooperation and economic growth in the european union as means to build stability on the continent and to provide market for us products and an attractive environment for investment the eu is the united states largest trading partner purchasing onefifth of us exports of goods and over onehalf of us exports of services the united states and the eu also have an enormous crossownership relationship each is the largest investor in the others market17 at the same time us officials and congress are often impatient with the pace of eu decisionmaking especially since the end of the cold war congress and both the bush and clinton administrations have urged the union to move more quickly in accepting new member states as parallel to or in some cases substitute for nato enlargement to encourage the growth of democratic societies and market economies us officials also regularly press representatives of eu governments to accept specific countries for membership france not alone in the union has preferred to move cautiously on eu enlargement and views us support for particular candidates as an inappropriate intervention on matter of sovereignty for eu governments in particular french and many other european officials resist us support for turkey controversial candidate due to its human rights record its muslim population its antiquated agricultural economy and the potential for largescale emigration to current eu states french officials agree that turkey is of pivotal strategic importance for europe but note that qualifying for the eu is process that requires an extended period of time the union has designated turkey as candidate state for membership eu members agree that union institutions often function in halting manner to enlarge the union before those institutions are made more efficient would result in increased deadlock over difficult issues more broadly france and most other eu members believe that candidate states must reform their economies and learn to accept shared sovereignty in order to build coherent truly integrated union some french officials are also concerned that continuing enlargement will place too many countries within germanys political and economic orbit to some us officials there is particular french edge to the enlargement issue aimed at the united states officials from poland the czech republic and hungary each of which joined nato in 1999 say that french officials have told them in effect make choice be atlanticist or european but you cannot be both central european governments have sought nato membership to ensure against the potential threat of revived aggressive russia nato membership today means following us leadership in most security and many political issues it is the interpretation of some central european officials that the french call to make choice means that to join the union they must put eu institutions and objectives first and not treat their nato membership as an acknowledgment of us leadershiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30646crs9 18 discussions with central european officials poland is

transatlantic legislative dialogue house international relations committee 106th congress 2nd sess compiled by committee staff and crs june 2000 periodically updatedin europe and the world18 french officials strongly deny that such conversations have taken place another possible interpretation of such discussions is that france is attempting to persuade candidate states to take eu requirements for membership more seriously and put greater domestic political capital into meeting guidelines that can be economically painful for elements of their populations it is also possible that some central european officials emphasize these discussions to pressure france and other eu countries to prove them wrong and move more quickly on enlargement us support for greater eu political integration may have its limits since summer 1999 when france and britain began to make concrete proposals for european security and defense policy esdp discussed more fully below us officials and some members of congress have expressed concern that the eu is creating duplicate security institution to nato without creating real military capability able to respond to threats miscellaneous euus issues france joins with other eu members in formulating policy often after lengthy negotiation on many issues the french government and other members normally refuse to engage in detailed bilateral discussions of such issues with us administration or congress and refer such matters to the commission the unions executive office which has competence to undertake international negotiations and propose legislation on these issues the united states and the eu discuss range of economic issues19 france has played an important but not necessarily singular role in persuading the eu to adopt its final position on some of these issues small sampling of such issues follows at the world trade organization wto the united states has won decisions requiring the eu to allow entry of range of products of genetically modified organisms gmo france has led an effort in the eu to overturn commission decision to permit the entry of selected group of such products an effort that has led to retaliatory tariffs by the clinton administration the eu has restricted licenses of importation of bananas many from former french colonies or current overseas possessions to mostly european importers to the detriment of us and latin american entities the wto has ruled in favor of the united states and other countries and against the eu on banana imports but the eu has not yet formulated an acceptable regime for licensing disputes between the united states and the eu persist over telecommunications and s2793 the foreign government investment act would prohibit any foreign company that is

investment and as means to influence political developments in china by exposing it to broader more democratic international currents the united states and the union cooperate often quietly on range of sensitive international political issues20 in october 1999 the eu and the united states agreed to cooperative framework to combat money laundering international organized crime and computer crime

for european security institutions france views natos future role as one that ensures collective defense against revitalized russia should it prove hostile france and britain are leading an effort to provide the european union with credible military capability one day able to operate independently of nato congress has had an important role in influencing the transatlantic debate over european security institutions during the 1998 nato enlargement debate the us senate passed the kyl amendment which stated in part that new threats such as proliferation terrorism and obstruction of the flow of natural resources will require that nato members possess national military capabilities to rapidly deploy forces over long distances sustain operations for extended periods of time and operate jointly with the united states in high intensity conflicts21 administration officials say that they had the amendment in mind when in the following months they sought to designate such threats as requiring consideration of nato military response in negotiating language for new strategic concept france and some other allies opposed such language and prevailed in emphasizing political and diplomatic means instead to counter such threats supposed us tendency to resort too quickly to military action in crisis has become an issue in usfrench relations the french government also believes that us domination of allied decision making is detrimental to europes longterm interests in part due to initial reluctance of the united states to become involved in the bosnian conflict in the early 1990shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30646crs11 22 alain richard opening remarks transatlantic forum washington dc june 28 2000 authors notes and text provided by french embassy discussions with french officialsand in part due to significant congressional opposition to us involvement in both bosnia and the kosovo conflict many french officials are concerned that one day the united states may not wish to be involved in crisis that the europeans believe threatens their security this sentiment shared in number of continental capitals has fueled interest in developing more independent european military capability nato in broad sense the french government agrees with congress and the administration that proliferation terrorism and instability in oilrich regions are threats to security but the french government does not agree that nato is necessarily the instrument that should respond to such threats in any discussion of natos future french officials tend to underscore first the enduring links of transatlantic relations cultural and economic ties philosophical values and concern over russias course they note that the united states and france seek to guarantee human rights and spread democracy and build stability in the balkans but in the view of defense minister alain richard europe has its own analysis of threats and interests in the world frances analysis differs from that of the united states on several key issues in contrast to the united states france and other european countries believe that the should legitimize nato crisis management operations france views russia as partner of the first order in crisis management operations an evident reference to european sentiment during the kosovo conflict that the clinton administration initially sought to keep russia at arms length in resolving the crisis while france welcomes us involvement in the balkans paris also believes that balkan stability does not reach the same level of importance in washington as it does in european capitals the french government is particularly concerned that congress will curtail or end us involvement in the balkans before the region has been stabilized french officials also hold general european view that recourse to military action must be subordinate to political and diplomatic efforts to resolve crisis and that military action at all levels must be clearly under civilian control22 the french government believes that the us tendency to seek to fix things is part of us inclination that can lead too rapidly to decision to use force before other available options have been exhausted in the gulf war in 1991 the french government thought that the united states moved too quickly to the military option before the kosovo conflict of 1999 france thought that the united states initially was moving too quickly towards use of the military in both wars france concurred in the final decision to use force then participated in both conflicts in the allied debate over new strategic concept in 1999 france led an effort to ensure that the document did not reflect the language and sense of the kyl amendment interpreted by the europeans as urging early

view crisis manageme nt and political initiatives such as the encouragement of democracy in nato candidate states are important parts of the agenda for the postcold war era france in the words of chirac wishes to see better balance in the alliance with the european pillar and european influence enhanced french officials believe that the united states without adequate consultation sometimes makes unilateral decisions on security issues that affect european interests while france acknowle dges that peace could not have been brought to bosnia without us leadership nor the kosovo conflict resolved without strong us military engagement it often questions us actions in kosovo for example the french government believes that the principle of taking key steps only after reaching consensus was violated when the united states without going through the allied command structure fired cruise missiles against serb targets23 in the political realm french officials cite us steps on arms control that they believe adversely affect french and european interests in august 1999 chirac said that the world must carefully avoid anything that might jeopardize the abm treaty as this could lead to breakdown of the strategic balance and revival of the nuclear arms race aggravated by the proliferation of ballistic missiles24 france believes that the nonproliferation treaty the chemical weapons convention and the comprehensive test ban treaty combat proliferation after the cold war france decided to reduce its nuclear weapons force dismantling its landbased systems scaling back plans for nuclear submarine modernization and closing its nuclear test site the government in large part based these decisions on belief that these treaties would be observed and as means to encourage other countries to follow suit the senates defeat in october 1999 of the ctbt in the french view was serious blow in the effort to curb proliferation and it adversely affected strategic decisions about frances nuclear forces french officials are critical of administration discussions with russia to revise the antiballistic missile abm treaty of 1972 in order to deploy national missile defense nmd

multinational staffs filled by officers from member countries at the higher levels integrated with national units at the lower levels the senior officer the supreme allied commander europe saceur is always us officer france withdrew from the integrated military structure in 1966 but has remained in the political structure of nato with representative on the north atlantic council the alliances political governing body frances absence from the command structure has meant until quite recently that french forces seldom trained with other allied forces some us officials contend that french absence from the command structure contributed to the poor performance of french forces in the gulf war longstanding objective of the united states and other allies has been to encourage france to return to the command structure frances return to the integrated military structure however is highly unlikely president chirac in the mid1990s said that france would consider returning to the command structure if nato were renovated meaning that more europeans would be given influence in allied political and military decisionmaking and that the alliances structur and doctrine would be reshaped to fit the postcold war era jospin before coming to power as prime minister seemed to oppose french return to the integrated command structure in contrast to the gulf war french forces performed well in the kosovo conflict view held by us as well as french officials in light of this performance and frances ability to participate in key decisionmaking during prosecution of the conflict french officials say that paris is longer considering return to the integrated command structure26 french officials contend that ad hoc formulas under which france is engaged with the allies as in the kosovo conflict have worked well and that french forces mesh smoothly at the operational level with other allied forces in their view there is therefore need to return to the integrated command structure the development of esdp discussed below also makes unlikely frances return nato enlargement france has joined other nato members in endorsing the principle of further enlargement of the alliance at the 1997 nato summit france supported the candidacies of two unsuccessful aspirants slovenia and romania france has never been enthusiastic about enlargement of the alliance in part due to the belief that

includes promotion of arms control agreements already noted such as the ctbt and npt policy in concert with french nuclear arms reductions the french government has acknowledged deficiencies in its forces during the kosovo conflict while france contributed the most aircraft and flew the most offensive and reconnaissance missions of any european ally it nonetheless experienced shortfall in allweather sensors at times grounding its planes as well as in precisionguid ed munitions and unmanned aerial vehicles the french government is encouraging other european countries to join in building an air tanker fleet and an improved satellite intelligence capability28 questions remain whether the new force once in place can achieve its objectives for several years the french defense budget has been declining training costs could increase with the new rapidresponse mission some defense analysts say that the smaller force will pressure paris to make hard choices about the range and number of missions to be undertaken at the same time analysts also believe that the overall french force if one includes for example the gendarmes to be used in balkans peacekeeping is highly flexible in

european security and defense policy esdp but has expressed concern as has congress that it might conflict with nato in mission and organization french and british officials are supporting esdp because they believe that the european effort to bring peace to bosnia and to resolve the kosovo conflict was ineffective they also state that esdp should it succeed in enhancing european capabilities will lead to greater sharing of the military burden with the united states in addition they believe that the united states dominated decisionmaking on balkans issues where european interests and longterm resolve are greater than those of the united states for france clearcut political issues relating to the eus larger role are involved defense minister alain richard has written that the eu to achieve the desired political and economic weight in the world must assume greater responsibilities in the defense field such weight is incompatible with military weakness chirac has said that during the kosovo conflict the europeans did not convey the impress ion that they were fully in control of the fate of their own continentwhat we have achieved in the commercial and monetary spheres we must now achieve in the fields of security and defense31 the mission of military forces under esdp is to handle the petersberg tasks search and rescue peacekeeping and crisis management including peacemaking clear consensus in the eu on the exact definition of those tasks is lacking some french officials and some german officials define crisis management broadly to include mission that would capture natos conflict in 1999 with serbia over kosovo french officials acknowledge that today the eu countries lack for example the air transport necessary as well as air combat aircraft to undertake such mission and that the eus rapid reaction force in the planning stages would have been insufficient for ground invasion of kosovo had that been necessary these officials say that esdp is in its earliest stages that european defense budgets must increase and that considerable development and training of multinational forces must take place in the coming years for the policy to be credible but in contradiction to paris stated desire to lead the way for stronger european defense the french defense budget has been declining modestly in 2000 the french defense budget as percentage of gdp

defense industry the french government is advocating convergence criteria for eu members in defense technology research many of the criteria concentrate on technologies in which the europeans were deficient during the kosovo conflict defense minister richard has said that enhanced european defense technologies should allay some us concerns that the alliance is becoming twotiered us officials have criticized the allies for failing to develop or purchase advanced technologies leaving the united states to bear the brunt of the military burden for example in night missions over serbia during the kosovo conflict while the clinton administration has encouraged development of stronger european defense industry and has said that the united states will be more open to european mergers and acquisitions of us defense companies to encourage cost savings some us companies are clearly uneasy that political preferences will cause european governments to buy european in one view the consolidation of defense industries on both sides of the atlantic may lead to more bidding situations that pit single european entity against an american company and where the political leaders face pressure to buy at home34 us concerns over esdp some administration officials and some members of congress believe that esdp contains an unspoken agenda to develop an organization responsible for european defense with the intention of marginalizing nato they wish to see esdp concentrate upon building military capabilities that will contribute to burdensharing in the alliance and are wary of eu organizational structures that appear to emulate natos north atlantic council in political decisionmaking or its military planning and field staffs in some instances the administration has sought aggressively to influence esdp in late 1999 for example state department official reportedly submitted document with us wording for the helsinki summit statement on esdp move seen by many eu members

borrow key nato assets and use them for operations led by the eu under such guidelines the united states and other nato members such as turkey and norway that are not in the eu would have clear voice in decision making only after permission is given to utilize nato assets in the us view such missions might affect us interests and might diminish us readiness by using its assets the united states and noneu allies believe that they should therefore be closely involved in both planning for an operation and in decisions leading to the launch of the operation some executivebranch officials and some members of congress believe that it is unlikely that the united states would be willing to provide assets without having significant role in decisionmaking for conflict french officials counter that the structure yet to be created to link the eu and nato will provide for adequate consultation that should allay such concerns in the view of french and other european officials congress has been more negative toward esdp than the administration s res 208 passed on november 8 1999 drew criticism from many european officials because it stated that esdp should undertake an autonomous missiononly after nato had been offered the opportunity to undertake that mission but had referred it to the european union for action some french officials viewed this as an effort to undermine the sovereignty of eu members arguing that there is hierarchy of status or decisionmaking between nato and the eu and that there can thus be right of review by nato over the eu some french officials appear to believe that noneu european members of nato would represent the voice of washington in eu councils development that they oppose foreign minister védrine has said that the six european nato members that are not in the eu have been demanding closer association with eu decisionmaking for possible missions either in anticipation of joining the union or as an affirmation encouraged by the united states of

share interests in several key regions the balkans russia the middle east and africa currently raise issues of importance to both paris and washington balkans frances policy in the balkans is largely decided in concert with the eu and nato and there are continuing discussions with the us government the french government has urged that european countries take the lead in implementing the dayton peace accord in bosniahercegovi na and in stabilizing kosovo france during its eu presidency is sponsoring conference on stabilization of the balkans the eu has agreed to longterm goal of integration and association of bosnia croatia macedonia albania and postmilosevic yugoslav ia with eu countries france like the united states is seeking to isolate milosevic and engage opposition movements and the diminishing remnants of independent serbian society such as nongovernmental organizations and churches unlike the united states france and several other eu members contend that sanctions targeting the serbian population rather than milosevic and his power structure should be lifted in both bosnia and kosovo french officials do not share the onceemphasized us view that multiethnic societies can be created foreign minister védrine has written that truly multiethnic kosovo is chimera security for all and coexistence is our objective but like the united states france favors autonomy and not independence for kosovo french officials are explicit in their view that an independent kosovo would likely be irredentist seeking to unite with albania and merge albanianinhabited territory in

cultural interests in the region endure with some exceptions french policy sometimes expressed through the european union is convergent with that of the united states the peace process the jospin government views us engagement in the middle east peace process as indispensable but not sufficient to bringing about an agreement from the mid1960s french policy reflecting the countrys past involvement in the region was seen as proarab and critical of israel there has been some adjustment in policy under jospin the french government played key role in drafting an eu communiqué of march 1999 that stated that the union declares its readiness to consider the recognition of palestinian state in due course in the context of negotiated settlement based on land for peace between israel and the palestinian authority congress and the administration oppose endorsement of palestinian state while negotiations are continuing under jospin french relations with israel have improved and the two countries agreed in april 2000 to resume highlevel technical and industrial cooperation after years of difficult relations syria and lebanon one of the principal reasons for improvement in french israeli relations has been the jospin governments strong criticism of syria in february 2000 jospin told the knesset that hezbollah militants operating in southern lebanon were guilty of terrorist

over the beirut government and israel first guarantee the security of peacekeeping force there and that unifil have robust rules of engagement that would permit it to defend itself some french

preventing saddam hussein from develop ing covert weapons programs the french government favors an end to sanctions in return for reinstitution of an inspection regime of indefinite duration paris believes that us policy is intended primarily to bring saddam husseins downfall and that the united states would not be satisfied with any reasonable degree of iraqi compliance with an inspection regime some us officials privately criticize the french position as inspired at least in part by contracts signed by french firms with iraq for petroleum development that would take effect after

2000 p 8africa frances long involvement in africa began in the colonial period during the nineteenth century the french government administered colonies there until the early 1960s french interests have centered on cultural geostrategic and economic issues france continues to promote the use of french and the spread of french culture in francophone africa the jospin government emphasizes strategic issues in africa less than other french governments in the postcolonial era frances stated policy is that it will longer support authoritarian governments in africa as means to preserve cultural and economic ties through the 1990s french forces often used to prop up unpopular regimes numbered 70008000 today there are approximately 4500 french troops confined to senegal côte divoire gabon chad and djibouti the principal military objective of french forces now appears to be to train indigenous forces for peacekeeping france like the united states now encourages regional peacekeeping organizations in africa to stabilize countries in conflict to this end france contributes resources both to the reinforce ment of capabilities of african missions of peacekeeping recamp and to the african crisis response initiative acri france has extensive economic involvemen t in many francophone african countries and is the principal trading partner of several of them france provides greater proportion of its gdp to development assistance than any g8 country with over 60 of that aid going to african countries in april 2000 the french government announced that by 2004 it would write off approximately 7 billion of debt owed by africas poorest countries45 conclusion two long sought objectives of both the united states and its allies have ironically created friction in the useuropean relationship while the end of the cold war has led to diminished threat to security it has also led to important differences among the nato allies over the response to threats that remain and the deepening integration in the european union promises greater stability and economic potential on the continent but also carries in some quarters desire for greater independence from the united states especially in security matters france is at the forefront of european efforts to ensure that new threats are met through multilateral responses that exhaust political measures before military options are raised and to sustain the pulse of eu integration in part because many elements in french society are critical of american values and what is perceived as domineering american leadersh ip in nato us officials and media often point to paris sometimes unjustly as the focal point for the genesis of debates between the united states and the europeans several other european

are heavyhanded and impulsive some french observers see paradoxes in us reactions to european initiatives46 these paradoxes are of some consequence french officials do not believe that their us counterparts have sorted through the logic of the differing perceptions that the paradoxes express in first paradox french officials know that congress and administrations of both parties have pressed european allies for 50 years to assume greater burdensharing in nato stated goal of esdp but they also see reluctance by us officials to surrender measure of leadership to reflect any altered balance in military capabilities when us officials charge that esdp is about institutionbuilding in the eu rather than real military capabilities french officials reply that it is both to france and to some other eu countries further political integration in the european union to have real weight must be accompanie d by enhanced military capability and capacity to take military action independently of the united states if necessary many european officials assume as matter of course that enhanced european capabilities must be reflected in an enhanced european leadership role in security matters including within nato in second paradox european officials have heard fears expressed by us administrations for years of european caucus in nato that might present washington with fait accompli in the north atlantic council before fully engaged debate could occur now however they believe that the united states is seeking nato caucus within the eu by insisting that nonunion states such as norway poland and turkey each politically close to washington be included in eu decisionmaking on potential crises to be handled through esdp french officials object to any early role in decisionmaking for an esdp mission by noneu members because they believe that those states have not assumed the political risk understanding and cost that have accompanied the long years of constructing union of shared sovereignty paris sees washington and ankara and oslo as latecomers to the party that did not pay the sizeable price of admission in third much disputed paradox french observers saw congress and the clinton administration chafe at the war by committeeduring the kosovo conflict while europeans feared prosecution of war by us generals guided more by domestic concerns about american casualties than by strategic needs on the ground in yugoslavia this third paradox held within it change in policy by country britain that has been for many years washingtons closest ally the smoldering transatlantic disagreements during the kosovo conflict in part charged by congressional doubts and criticism are having concrete consequences the differing perceptions on the two sides of the atlantic fueled sentiment in europe especially in britain once ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30646crs24 reluctant partner for france to build esdp in the view of many european officials britain has taken an important step with clear potential for developing an independent european capacity in security matters many us and french interests remain closely intertwined french officials do not want the united states to leave the alliance and as clearly demonstrated in bosnia and kosovo they desire us forces to play central role in any conflict in europe in security matters france has proved important to protection of us interests french forces were present during the gulf war for example and they played significant role in the kosovo conflict especially when compared to the forces of other allies french officials point out that while they opposed strategic concept in 1999 that would outline military responsibilities for the alliance beyond europe france might nonetheless join the united states in future conflict as france did during the gulf war should french interests be endangered france enjoys considerable political weight in africa and the middle east and is key country in the united nations for those in congress and in the executive branch who desire continued us leadership and primacy of nato in european security matters french efforts to build politically strengthened eu and an effective esdp could reduce the us role and us influence on the continent for those who desire greater contributions by other countries in peacekeeping or in international financial institutions or in development assistance french influence and policy often buttress us interests and diminish the need for greater expenditure of us resources for those who desire greater european burdensharing in the alliance esdp holds at least the possibility of greater military capability among continental allies and for those who wish to reduce the us troop presence in europe and with it us responsibilities for european stability esdp largely driven by france might also one day serve us interests if it contributes to stability in region of the world of great importance to american trade and investment
