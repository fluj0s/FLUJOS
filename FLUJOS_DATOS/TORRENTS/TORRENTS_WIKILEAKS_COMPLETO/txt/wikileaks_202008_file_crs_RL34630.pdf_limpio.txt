political parties and some third parties select their presidential nominees at conventions these conventions are run by and for parties without formal role for the fe deral government fe deral funds do however provide certain financial support to convention committees that choose to accept public money additionally congress appropriate s federal funding for the securing of the convention venues variety of policy issues surrounds convention financing some observers have questioned why federal funds subsidize c onventions considering the availability of substantial private resources and that they are party rather than governmental events others have contended that private funds particularly so called soft money which falls outside the scope of fe deral campaign finance law have become too pervasive in conventions and that tight er restrictions are needed these divergent views on the use of public funds to support party conventions also appear in other contexts in the broader debate surrounding campaign finance policy two taxpayersupported revenue sources are available to conventions 1 presidential public campaign funds and 2 security funds approximately 1336 million from those sources have gone or will go toward the 2008 democratic and republican national conventions third parties receive d convention funds for the 2008 election cycle1 before proceeding it is important to note the distinction between presidential public funds and security funds presiden tial public funds and security funds come from separate revenue sources they are llocated differently are used for

although convention committees may not accept private funds other than certain amounts to offset legal and accounting needs local host committees may solicit and spend private contributions for activities related to the convention such as use of an auditori um or convention center promoting the convention city and hosting recep tions or tours for attendees29 as practical matter the regulation of federal versus nonfederal funds rests largely on how feca and the fec have treated each source feca is largely silent on campaign finance aspects of nonfederal funds and the fec has determined that nonfederal f unds do not explicitly support the conventions per even if they support events associated with those conventions in particular 2003 fec rulemaking reaffirmed the co mmissions longheld view that donations of funds to host committees are as matter or law distinct from other donations by prohibited sources defined in feca in that they are motivated by desire to promote the convention city and hence are not subject to the absolute ban on corporate contributions in 2 usc 441b feca provision this conclusion is buttressed by the fact that frequently members of the opposite political party have played prominent and active roles in convention host committees30 state or local governments or coalitions of those governments may also provide financial assistan ce to conventions through entities known as municipal funds31 the fec has also permitted corporations and labor unions which may not provide direct financial s upport to federal campaigns to make certain contributions of goods or services to host committees and municipal funds32 in addition commercial vendors ma provide goods or services to convention committees at reduced or discounted rates or at charge in certain circumstances33 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34630crs9 34 crs is unable to determine the amount of nonfederal funding used by boston and new york city in 2004 and there are projections available for the 2008 conventions in denver and minneapolisst paulsecurity operations even though the primary use of the 100 million of federal funds through dojs security grants is intended to offset the security costs incurred by state and local governments dditional funds may be needed therefore one can assume that nonfederal funding sta and local government funding is also used to secure the conventions the am ount of nonfederal funding is based on the costs to state and local law enforcement entities that work with the usss and other federal law enforcement agen cies during the convention34 additionally unlike the funding used by party convention co mmittees any nonfederal funds used for convention security would come from st ate and local governments not pecf

affect convention security funding policy issues and options pecf convention funding as congress considers whether or how to address pecf convention funds members may first examine what role it wi shes those funds or other federal funds to play in modern conventions the curre nt system of pecf convention grants and the presidential public financ ing program generally has been in place since the 1976 election cycle and has remain ed essentially unchanged si nce that time although this report is not focused on nonfederal funds g soft money it is widely accepted that such funds play prominent even if indirect role in convention financing as discussed below the tension between federal and nonfederal funds is likely to shape congressional consideration of convention financinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34630crs11 35 for discussion of constitutional issues see crs report rl30669 the constitutionality of campaign finance regula tion buckley v valeo and its supreme court progeny by l paige whitaker 36 this assumes that sufficient balances woul d remain in the pecf to cover convention grants 37 some of the material in this section is adapted from crs report rl34534 public financing of presidential campaigns see that report for additional discussionthose who are wary of private interested money in politics typically argue that public funds are way to insulate c onventions or other aspects of elections from undue individual corporate or labor influence and from real or apparent corruption stemming from private funds fr om that perspective maintaining or expanding public financing of conventions could be attr active similarly congress could choose to restrict s ources of nonfederal funds35 on the other hand in light of the availability of nonfederal funds ev those who support public financing in general might argue that federal funding for conventions is unnecessary or that it should be diminished finally those opposed to campaign finance regulation often view any public financial assistance to campaigns or conventions as an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds as is evident from the preceding discussion the policy options addressed below or others would likely be part of larg er debate surrounding convention financing and presidential public financing in general maintaining the status quo if congress chooses to make policy changes the role of pecf convention funds will remain as it is today convention committees that choose to accept public funds would continue to be bound by the regulations discusse d above and nonfederal funds w ould likely continue playing role in convention financing the amount of pecf funds ava ilable to convention committees is likely to continue to increase incrementally with inflation36 options that could increase or decrease federal convention funding37 the policy options discussed below could change the amount of federal funding available to conven tions some of these options are proposed in current legislation others provide additional approaches that have been offered for consideration but are not the s ubject of current legislation regardless of the particular approach expanding federal funding could decrease the perceived need for nonfederal funds however in the absence of add itional regulation of nonfederal funds or volunt ary decreases in spending by entities providing nonfederal funds expanded federa l funding could also increase the total amount of money surrounding conventions any change in federal convention funding would require amending the amounts currently specified in federal law 4 million for major parties as adjust ed for inflation 168 million in 2008 changing the prioritization of convention funds as noted previously pecf convention grants are reserved befo re matching funds or generalelection grants are paid to publicly financed pres idential candidates if however congress believes that funding candida tes should be

in the 110th congress hr 776 s 436 hr 4294 and s 2412 would all increase the checkoff amount but do not propose dditional funding for conventions 42 26 usc 6096a on the increa see pl 10366 107 stat

law doing so might help avoid future financial shortfalls in other aspects of the public financing program particularly primary matching funds nonetheless it is po ssible that shortfalls could then affect convention funds especially if convention funds were distributed after candidate funds appropriating funds appropriating funds would permit congress to annually or every four years deter mine the amount of money available to conventions as opposed or in addition to the current pecf amount of 168 million per major party38 if the pecf grant structure were abandoned in favor of appropriated funds c ongress could legislate any ot her funding amount or none as discussed below39 accordingly although appropr iations might yield more funding for conventions than is currently availa ble congress might so appropriate less funding appropriating c onvention funds would also mark departure from congresss traditional approach to presidential public financing which has always emphasized taxpayers roles in determining available funding altering the checkoffdesignation question as noted previously federal financing of pres idential campaigns includi ng convention financing relies entirely on checkoff signations by individual taxpayers currently the checkoff question allows taxpayers only to designate to the pecf 3 for individuals or 6 for married couples filing jointly av ailable funds are then distributed through convention grants general election gran ts and matching f unds as described previously congress could however choos to alter the checkoff designation by posing two separate questions to taxpayers one for candida financing and another for convention financing of course taxpayers might c hoose to either provide more or less funding to conventions and candidate campaigns altering the checkoff amount increasing the checkoff designation amount is frequently proposed as way to provide additional funds to the pecf in general40 the same could be proposed for convention funding in particular41 for the first and only time congress tripled the checkoff amount from 1 to 3 and 2 to 6 to their current levels in 199342 although increasing the

status quo if congress chooses to make policy changes the routine of appropriating conve ntion security funds during presidential election years would remain unchanged state and local law enforcement entities would continue assisting the usss in securing the convention venues and then apply to doj for reimbursement following the completion of the conventions state and local governments can use some dhs grants such as the state homeland security grant program shsgp and the urban area security initiative uasi for convention security activities even though dhs does not administer the convention security grants that c ongress appropriated in fy2004 and fy200846 the grant approval process for the dhs progra ms however is not flexible so the programs have limited application to conventions states and localities when hosting convention would need to inco rporate plans to use shsgp and uasi funding for convention security in thei r grant applications dhs does authorize states and localities to reprogram shsgp and uasi funding with the dhs secretarys approval however that may re sult in states and localities not funding other planned homeland security activities options that could increase or decrease federal convention security funding the policy options discussed below could change the amount of federal security funding av ailable to conventions none of these options have been proposed in legislation authorize shsgp or uasi amount s for convention locations for presidential election years congress coul d fund convention security through dhss shsgp and uasi grants this could be achieved by either increasing the shsgp and uasi allocations for conve ntion locations in election years or by requiring convention states and localities to pply and program sh sgp and uasi funding specifically for convention security during ection years as noted above this is an option that states and localities can utilize however it may result in not funding other planned homeland security activities this option would also remove doj from the convention secur ity funding cycle states and localities have an established grant application mechanism with dhs related to homeland security funding and activities and the use of shsgp and uasi appropriations for convention security ar guably are homeland security activities authorize usss to reimburse stat and local government costs another option congress may consider is authorizing the usss to reimburse state and local convention security costs b ecause the usss is the federal agency responsible for convention security one c ould argue that cong ress could appropriate funding to the usss to reimburse state nd local costs arguably the usss couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34630crs15 be more effective in auditing state and local law enforcement costs and determine reimbursement amounts since the usss is the lead federal agency for convention security this option like the preceding one would remove doj from administering the convention security funding conversely this option would require the usss to establish and administer grant process that is not at present responsibility of the agency discontinue convention security funding to states and localities congress could also choose to not appropria funding to reimburse state and local governments convention security costs th is might result in reduced security role for state and local law enforcement entities or force state and local governments to fund all of their convention s ecurity activities however this option seems unlikely given the present national concern with hom eland security and the national interest in protecting major presidential candidates and ensuring the security of mass political events conclusion although pecf funding of convention operations has been in pl ace since the 1976 election cycle the role of federal c onvention funding remain s subject to debate in congress and beyond most of that bate however occurs within the broader discussions of presidential public financing and hard versus soft money in campaigns congress has several options for revisiting the federal role in pecf funding if it chooses to do so the role of the federal government in f unding convention security is fairly new development since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 as federal state and local governments further refine their homeland security activities generally and specifically convention security operations congress may consider different options for how the federal government provides f unding for state and local costs incurred in securing convention venues
