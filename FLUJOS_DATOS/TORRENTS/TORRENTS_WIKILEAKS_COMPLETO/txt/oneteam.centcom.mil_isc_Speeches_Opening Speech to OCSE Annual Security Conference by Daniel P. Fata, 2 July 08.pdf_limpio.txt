united states mission to the osce osce annual security review conference 1 2 july 2008 vienna austria opening speech as prepared for delivery by daniel p fata deputy ssistant secretary of defense for european and nato policy july 1 2008 thank you mr chairman the osce agenda includes some of th most challenging security issues our governments face including the unresolved separa tist conflicts in eurasia sensitive arms control issues and the growth of international terrorism in this organizations long history begi nning with the helsi nki final act in 1975 patience and political will have prevailed of ten enough to create an admirable record of accomplishment the first agreements of the then csce made human rights as well as security and economic cooperation part of th framework that endures today as guide to relations among participating states in the security area the c onfidence and security building measures that became the vienna document included an inspection provision that broke ground for later arms control agre ements and it was under the aegis of this organization that the cfe treaty was negotiated this annual meeting is vital forum yet we should look beyond reviewing the security issues our governments faced in the past year and instead actively engage in areas that need stronger osce activity the osce as an institutional structure is in good shape rather than paper efforts at inte rnal reform we should focus on meeting existing commitments and solving real problems in the outside world in this vein there are concrete sets of issues that i w ould like to focus on for the coming year among the most difficult security challeng we face are those that originate outside our region terrorism is one mass murd ers of our citizens in their own cities and towns leave doubt as to the urgency of th problem clearly the solutions are multi dimensional not just military not simply matter of improving intelligence we must also address conditions that make some areas bases of support for terrorist and allied groups although qaida and their taliban supporters can longer rely on secure bases in afghanistan their operations there are made easier by porous borders poor border control facilitates na rcotics trade supporting these groups and worsens problem affecting our own societies without effectiv customs and border control still fragile afghan state loses major source of revenue the secretary general recently devel oped proposals to implement the osces border security and management concept in afghanistan this program of assistance to afghan border policing and customs was deta iled and thoughtfully constructed we believe that programs on the afghan side of th border would have the greatest impact and could be begun at an early phase i refer to the proposed border training at shir kahn bandar and the project for osce mentori ng and monitoring at afghan border crossing points both projects would be conducted in government controlled areas of northern afghanistan although the training they would provide should have an eventual impact in the south as well we view these two pr ojects together with the proposed regional border management staff college as the most useful such border control programs build on wellestablished area of osce expe rtise and they deserve our full support general craddock the supreme allied comm ander of nato forces will address the broader security situation in afghanistan tomorrow the separatist conflicts in georgia mol dova and azerbaijan continue to plague security and development in the eurasia regi on the osce has always played strong and positive role in shaping mediation and building confiden ce between conflicting sides most recently the osces meetings on georgi arussia tensions were helpful in reducing the potential for conflict and dr awing attention to the russian shootdown of georgian uav over georgian airspace the united stat has called on moscow to reverse its unconstructive actions and activel facilitate with us and othe rs diplomatic process to resolve the abkhazia and south ossetia conflicts we could start from the peace plan proposed by president saakas hvili that prime minister pu tin has publicly supported georgia for its part must continue to resist any rash decision s or unwise political demands even in the face of repeated provocat ions we want to work with russia in this effort and russia if it chooses could play constructive role in settlement that took account of the parties interests russias w ithdrawal of the airborne troops and heavy artillery and railroad troops is necessary step in this regard in south ossetia we continue to support additional osce monitors as well as joint georgiaoscerussian monitoring of the roki tunne l and checkpoint at didi gupta to bolster military transparency in the region because of this the osce should intensif its focus on the threat of separatist conflicts and be more actively engaged in th eir resolution this extends to moldova and azerbaijan as well where the lack of conflict settlement continues to hamper the development of countries in the region we appreciate the role of the osce mission in moldova and the cio in pushing all sides to take concrete steps toward an eventual settlement we believe that progress on this front could also have positive impact on efforts to achieve progress in resolving the cfe impasse we remain committed to resolution of the conflict within the 52 framework that guarantees moldovas sove reignty and territorial integr ity while osce efforts such as the five plus two talks and the minsk group on nagornoka rabakh have not so far resolved these issues they are means to explore possible solu tions they cannot of course substitute for political will as th efforts proceed the presence of osce observers and the broader discussions in the osce itself focus attention on developing crises and may serve to inhibit da ngerous or destabilizing actions as we look back at osce accomplishments and ahead at new initiatives there is reason for optimism but gains can also be reve rsed and that is as true in the security area as on issues related to the human dime nsion the conventional armed forces in europe or cfe treaty which is longer bein g implemented by all states parties is case in point the us calls upon this state to resume implementation of the cfe treaty immediately although not an osce document per the current treaty affects all european states it is the only legally binding agreement constraining destabilizing conventional force concentrati ons in europe the adapted version of that treaty once ratified and with the accession of new states should eliminate fears that any powerful state or group of states would so concentrate its forces near other st ates as to be seen legitimately as threat the adapted treaty also includes more explicit provisions for host nation consent to the stationing of forei gn forces my government supports the cfe regime we believe the path to agreement nd to ratification of th adapted treaty by all states parties lies in the parallel actions package that nato allies and others have supported the parallel actions approach addr esses the concerns of all states parties including those that russia has raised we have not given up seeking agreement and we hope others do not this is time for patience determination and good will i believe there are paths to progress in all of the areas i have mentioned and history offers encouragement that we will find them thank you
