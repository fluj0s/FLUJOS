general pinochet of chile to spain for trial on alleged human rights violations committed while he was in power in chile and allowed him to return home the reason cited by the home secretary was that several strokes suffered by pinochet in the fall of 1999 had rendered him mentally incapable of meaningful participation in trial the proceeding stemmed from two requests for pinochets extradition made by spanish authorities in midoctober 1998 when they discovered pinochet was in england for back surgery and other purposes both requests alleged pinochets culpability for numerous human rights violations committed during his time in power trial court initially held him to be absolutely immune as former head of state from arrest and extradition but in seminal decision on november 25 1998 panel of the lords of appeal of the house of lords held 32 that the international law of human rights has evolved to the point that it overrides the longstanding doctrine of immunity on december 17 1998 however that decision was set aside on the grounds one of the judges in the majority had failed to disclose that he had continuing association with amnesty international private organization which had been permitted to intervene in the case as consequence differently constituted panel of law lords after twelve days of oral argument issued new decision on march 24 1999 that decision substantially narrowed the charges against pinochet to just few instances of torture allegedly committed after september 29 1988 because prior to that time neither england nor chile had ratified the torture convention but the court again held that pinochet possessed immunity as former head of state from the charges of torture because its limitation of the charges for which pinochet might be extradited and its ruling on immunity constituted substantial change in circumstances however the court in that decision invited the home secretary to exercise the statutory power he has over extradition requests and to reconsider whether spains extradition request ought to move forward the home secretary did so and on april 15 1999 he concluded that the extradition proceedings ought to be allowed to continue on october 8 1999 british magistrate ruled that spains extradition request met the standard of dual criminality set forth in the european convention on extradition and englands implementing statute and that therefore pinochet should be extradited to spain in early january 2000 however the home secretary reported that he was minded to terminate the extradition proceeding because of recent deterior ation in pinochets mental health spain belgium france switzerland and several human rights organizations protested but on march 2 the home secretary issued statement detailing his reasons and terminated the proceeding general pinochet immediately boarded chilean plane and returned to chile this report summarizes these complex and precedentsetting proceedings it

case selected legal issues introduction in midoctober 1998 spanish authorities formally petitioned their counterparts in england to arrest general augusto pinochet of chile who was then in hospital in london and to extradite him to spain for trial on charges that he participated in extensive violations of human rights during his time in power the petitions sought his extradition not only for few crimes he allegedly committed against spani sh citizens in both chile and spain but also for numerous crimes of murder torture hostagetaking and terrorism he allegedly committed against chilean nationals these petitions set in motion an unprecedented legal drama in england which inter alia posed number of fundamental questions about international law does sitting head of state have absolute immunity under international law from proceedings in the courts of other states for his actions if so does that immunity still apply after he has left office ie to former head of state has the traditional doctrine of headofstate immunity been eroded by the development of the international law of human rights does that law now countenance the exercise of universal jurisdiction over human rights violations so that any country can put alleged violators of human rights on trial even though the crimes were committed outside that countrys territory against persons who are not its own nationals the english extradition proceedings were complicated not only by these difficult issues of international law and the political turmoil the spanish request precipitated but also by allegations of conflict of interest by one of the british judges involved in the case and by the recurring involvement of the british home secretary pursuant to the terms of englands extradition statute on march 2 2000 the home secretary exercised his discretion and terminated the extradition proceeding on the grounds pinochet was longer mentally fit to stand trial and pinochet returned to chile but prior to that decision britains highest court had ruled that pinochet had immunity as former head of state from charges that he committed human rights violations while in power and that he could be tried for those violations in country other than chile notwithstanding the absence of trial on the merits this ruling was unprecedented and marked dramatic expansion in the international law of human rights this report summari zes the various proceedings in the case in chronological order it will not be updated background general augusto pinochet came to power in chile in military coup in september 1973 that coup displaced the socialist government of salvador allende that had been elected in 1970 and resulted in numerous deaths including allendeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30117crs2 1 for further background on chile and uschilean relations see chile politicaleconomic conditions and us relations crs report rl30035 by mark p sullivan 2 it might be noted that belgium france and switzerland subsequently filed requests for pinochets extradition as well but these were held in abeyance pending disposition of spains requestpinochet remained in power until march 1990 when democratically elected government took control and remained head of the army until 1998 when he became senator for life in 199091 chilean commission for truth and reconciliation investigated human rights violations allegedly committed between 1973 and 1990 and concluded inter alia that there had been at least 3197 cases of murder and disappearances under pinochets rule1 the commission did not investigate allegations that thousands of persons had also been tortured during that time although number of private suits were filed against pinochet after he relinquished power he had not been charged or tried in chile for any of the human rights atrocities allegedly committed during his reign in 1978 the chilean legislature in the interest of general tranquility peace and order had granted general amnesty to all persons involved in criminal acts with certain exceptions between 1973 and 1978 and pinochet also reportedly negotiated guarantee of immunity from prosecution in chile before he relinquished power in 1990 baltasar garzon judicial magistrate in spain had for some time been investigating alleged human rights violations in both chile and argentina during that time period discovering that pinochet was in england in the fall of 1998 garzon made two requests for his extradition the first request alleged pinochets responsibility for the murder of spanish citizens in chile between 1973 and 1983 and resulted in pinochets provisional arrest on october 16 1998 at the clinic where he was recuperating from back surgery the second request two days later alleged pinochets responsibility for torture hostagetaking genocide and murder in various periods between 1976 and 1992 the alleged crimes in the latter request were not limited to those against spanish citizens but included atrocities against chilean nationals and others the requests sought pinochets extradition to spain for trial there on these charges2 decision of the divisional court on october 28 1998 divisional court of the queens bench quashed both warrants for pinochets arrest that had been issued in response to spains request the court found the first warrant deficient for the reason that the murder of british citizen outside of england by person who is not british citizen is not crime under british law thus even though the murder of spanish citizen outside of spain by person who is not spanish citizen was crime under spanish law the court found that spains extradition request lacked the essential element of duality required by the european convention on extradition ie the crimes charged were not crimes under the laws of both spain and england the divisional court quashed the second warrant on the grounds pinochet had absolute immunity from arrest and prosecution outside chile as former head of statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30117crs3 3 this decision and the subsequent one of different panel of law lords on 32499 are entitled regina v bartle and the commissioner of police for the metropolis and other ex parte pinochet accessed at wwwparliamentthestationeryofficecoukpaldhomehtml 4 the law lords still adhere to the practice that each judge files his own opinionbut it stayed the decisions pending an appeal to the lords of appeal the highest appellate court in england on the issue of pinochets immunity november 25 1998 decision of the lords of appeal in an unprecedented ruling fivemember panel of the lords of appeal of the house of lords on november 25 1998 ruled 32 that pinochet had immunity as former head of state from spains request for extradition3 the question before the court in regina v bartle was not pinochet s guilt or whether he should be extradit ed but solely whether pinochet was entitled to immunity from arrest and extradition proceedings in the united kingdom with respect to acts committed while he was head of state lords nicholls steyn and hoffmann recognized that customary international law has long afforded heads of state absolute immunity from trial in the courts of other states for their actions while in office but they concluded that the international law of human rights has evolved to the point that acts of torture hostagetaking and murder on large scale can longer be considered legitimate functions of government and that therefore former head of state ought to be able any more to claim the immunity traditionally afforded they also concluded that english statutes implementing the torture convention and the convention against the taking of hostages superseded the doctrines of nonjusticiability and act of state lord nicholls noted in his opinion4 that international law customarily has afforded former head of state immunity with respect to acts performed by him in the exercise of his functions as head of state the question he said is whether the acts of torture and hostagetaking alleged against senator pinochet were done in the exercise of his functions as head of state that question he answered in the negative international law has made plain that certain types of conduct including torture and hostagetaking are not acceptable conduct on the part of anyone this applies as much to heads of state or even more so as it does to everyone else at least from the time of the nuremberg tribunal in 1945 he said head of state could have been in any doubt about his potential liability if he participated in acts regarded by international law as crimes against humanity such acts are simply not legitimate functions of head of state he asserted thus he concluded pinochet was not entitled to immunity from arrest and extradition as former head of state lord steyn stressed the gravity of the charges against pinochet in the extradition request namely that he allegedly ordered systematic campaign of repression and terror that employed murder hostagetaking and torture against opponents of his regime primarily in chile but also elsewhere under englands statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30117crs4 immunity act of 1978 and the diplomatic privileges act of 1964 he said former head of state is immune from criminal prosecution in england only for his official acts performed in the exercise of his functions as head of state but what are properly deemed official acts must be determined he claimed in light of international law and he asserted international law longer deems the acts of which pinochet was accused to be proper functions of head of state thus he concluded pinochet had immunity under english law or international law for the crimes charged in the deciding opinion lord hoffmann briefly stated that he too concluded that pinochet had immunity from the arrest and extradition proceedings citing in justification the reasons given in lord nicholls opinion lords slynn and hadley in the minority on the other hand contended that the international law of human rights has not yet evolved to the point where the traditional rule of immunity afforded heads of state from proceedings in the courts of other states should be deemed to be overridden the judges contended as well that such acts ought to be deemed nonjusticiable in english courts lord slynn reasoned that under englands diplomatic privileges act of 1964 and the state immunity act of 1978 the immunity of sovereign or other head of state in england is governed by the vienna convention on diplomatic relations of 1961 subject to any necessary modifications because the vienna convention bars the arrest or detention of any diplomatic agent and makes such agents immune from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving state even after leaving office for their official acts articles 29 311 and 39 lord slynn argued that pinochet is statutorily immune from the criminal jurisdiction of england for his official acts taking cautious approach on the international law question lord slynn contended that the immunity traditionally afforded former heads of state from the jurisdiction of other states has not as yet been eroded by developments in the international law of human rights he argued that limitation on such immunity should only be prospective not retroactive and should be accomplished through an international convention that clearly defines the international crime grants national courts universal jurisdiction over the crime provides that heads of state are not immune and has been given the force of law both in the state asserting immunity and the state seeking to deny it existing international law he claimed did not meet that standard to buttress his view lord slynn parsed various instruments of human rights law the charters of the international tribunals created to try violations of human rights laws the nuremberg tribunal and the tokyo tribunal after world war ii the yugoslav and rwanda tribunals now in existence and the provisions of the rome statute of the international criminal court concluded in the summer of 1998 all provided that position as head of state or other public official would be defense he noted but none of these charters he stated conferred universal jurisdiction on national courts in contrast he observed the torture convention of 1984 does confer universal jurisdiction on national courts and requires offenders either to be prosecuted or extradited but he said the torture convention explicitly eliminates immunity only for public officials and not for heads of state the genocidehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30117crs5 conventio n lord slynn asserted makes constitutionally responsible rulers liable but authorizes prosecution only in the state in which the act was committed or in an international tribunal in addition he contended the taking of hostages convention provides for universal jurisdiction but does not explicitly abrogate the immunity of head of state thus none of the human rights instruments adopted or entities established in the past half century he said clearly met the standards necessary to abrogate pinochets immunity for the crimes charged finally lord slynn stated that the act of state doctrine counsele d judicial restraint in this area of the law in british and american courts he said that doctrine generally has meant that the courts will not sit in judgment on the validity or legality of the official acts of other sovereign states taken within their own territory both for reasons of comity and in order not to interfere with the conduct of foreign relations lord lloyd traced much of the same legal reasoning customary international law he stated affords immunity to heads of state and to former heads of state for their official acts but not acts for their private benefit unless immunity is waived by the current government of the state of which he was once the head lord lloyd rejected the argument that the horrific nature of the crimes alleged against pinochet requires that an exception be read into the customary international law principle of immunity it would be unjustifiable in theory and unworkable in practice to impose any restriction on head of state immunity by reference to the number or gravity of the alleged crimes he also concluded that head of state immunity has not been abrogated either in the specific provisions of the international convention against the taking of hostages or the torture convention or in state practice if there were general international legal obligation to prosecute or extradite in cases of torture or hostagetaking he argued the amnesties that have been granted by numerous states for past violations of human rights would not be valid or binding moreover he said the provisions abrogating head of state immunity in the charters of the various tribunals that have been established to try human rights violations show that such crimes cannot be tried in the ordinary courts of other states because otherwise there would be little need for such international tribunals finally as an alternative ground for decision lord lloyd asserted that the courts should apply the principle of nonjusticiability because of its profound political implications he said the courts of the united kingdom are simply not competent to adjudicate the matter and should exercise judicial restraint by declining jurisdiction december 9 1998 decision of the home secretary with the issue of pinochets immunity seemingly resolved the question of whether his extradition ought to be allowed to proceed became matter of decision for the home secretary jack straw under englands extradition act of 1989 the home secretary must make both an initial determination of whether an extradition request should be allowed to proceed and final determination after all judicial proceedings have concluded on whether the person ought to be surrendered to the requesting country in both determinations the home secretary can consider both legal and nonlegal matters on december 9 1998 mr straw concluded that extradition proceedings against pinochet could go forward and issued an authority to proceed he rejected arguments based on pinochets health the politicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30117crs6 5 it might also be noted that on december 5 baltasar garzon formally issued 287page indictment of pinochet for the crimes of genocide terrorism and torture 6 the panels explanation is entitled judgment in re pinochet jan 15 1999 and can be found on the home page of the house of lords wwwparliamentthestationery officecoukpaldhomehtmlimplications of the matter and the possible bias of one of the law lords he did rule however that genocide is not an extraditable offense under english law5 december 17 1998 decision of the law lords but on december 17 1998 different judicial panel of the house of lords for one of the few times in the history of the law lords unanimously set aside the november 25 decision holding pinochet to have immunity from arrest and extradition on the grounds one of the judges in the majority lord hoffmann had had an undisclosed conflict of interest in the matter amnesty international ai private human rights organization had been permitted to intervene in the case and had participated in the earlier argument but lord hoffmann had failed to disclose that he was director of charitable wing associated with the group in subsequent opinion on january 15 1999 the law lords explained their reasons6 lord brownwilkinson noted that lord hoffmann was director and chairperson of amnesty international charity limited aicl and that aicl carried out research on human rights violations and also provided assistance to victims one of its reports he said had concerned human rights violations in chile thus he concluded lord hoffman had personal interest in the case and was in effect serving as judge in his own cause consequently he said lord hoffmann should have been automatically disqualified in such case once it is shown that the judge is himself party to the cause or has relevant interest in its subject matter he is disqualified without any investigation into whether there was likelihood or suspicion of bias the mere fact of his interest is sufficient to disqualify him unless he had made sufficient disclosure the other opinions concurred in lord brownwilkinsons reasoning lord goff concluded lord hoffmann as chairperson of one member of that organization aicl is so closely associated with another member of that organization ai that he can properly be said to have an interest in the outcome of proceedings to which ai has become party and so was disqualified from sitting as judge in these proceedings lord nolan emphasizing that the appearance of the matter is just as important as the reality simply concurred with lord brownwilkinson without further opinion lord hope of craighead opined that lord hoffmann had run afoul of the cardinal rule that where judge is performing judicial duty he must not only bring to the discharge of that duty an unbiased and impartial mind he must be seen to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30117crs7 impartial finally lord hutton stated that the links between ai and lord hoffmann were so strong that public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice would be shaken if his decision were allowed to stand march 24 1999 decision of the law lords nonetheless general pinochet remained under house arrest in an estate near london beginning on january 18 1999 differently constituted panel of seven law lords heard twelve days of oral argument on pinochets immunity as former head of state and whether the crimes charged were extraditable offenses on march 24 1999 the court ruled as follows by 61 margin the court held the charges against pinochet in spains petition for crimes allegedly committed prior to september 29 1988 not to be valid bases for extradition because they did not satisfy the dual criminality rule unanimously the court held three charges of torture and conspiracy to commit torture in chile after september 29 1988 and single charge of murder and conspiracy to commit murder in spain in 1975 1976 to satisfy the dual criminality test and to be valid bases for extradition by 52 margin the court held pinochet to be entitled to claim immunity with respect to the charge of murder and conspiracy to commit murder in spain in 197576 by 61 margin the court held pinochet not to be entitled to claim immunity with respect to the three remaining charges of torture and conspiracy to torture allegedly committed after september 29 1988 thus the court substant ially narrowed the scope of the extradition case against pinochet to three charges of torture and conspiracy to commit torture in chile after september 29 1988 for that reason six of the law lords suggested that the home secretary should consider anew whether to allow spains extradition request to continue to move forward in the english courts as noted above the dual criminality test means that the crimes alleged in an extradition request must be criminal under the laws of both the requesting and the requested state spain and england in this case lord hope set forth the primary analysis on this matter for the court and found that most of the charges in the spanish request did not meet that test or were otherwise defective he concluded as follows the petitions allegation of an instance of hostagetaking did not in fact describe the crime of hostagetaking and thus was substantively defective the charges of murder and conspiracy to murder outside of chile were not valid with respect to offenses allegedly committed in 1975 1976 in france the united states portugal and italy because the english courts did not gain jurisdiction over such extraterritorial crimes until englands adoption of the suppression of terrorism act on august 21 1978httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30117crs8 7 it might be noted that there was some confusion in the decision about the date on which the extraterritorial crime of torture became triable in england section 134 of the criminal justice act was adopted on september 29 1988 and judge hope consistently use that date as the demarcation point between torture offenses that met the requirement of dual criminality and those that did not but he also noted in his opinion that 134 did not come into force until two months after its adoption that would make the critical date november 29 1988the charges of murder and conspiracy to murder outside of chile did meet the dual criminality test with respect to single act of murder and conspiracy to murder allegedly committed by pinochet in spain in 19751976 because such offenses by nonnational would have been crimes in england at that time if they had been committed in england but pinochet retained his immunity from that charge most of the allegations of torture and conspiracy to torture in chile and elsewhere failed to satisfy the dual criminality test while the torture of nonspanish citizens outside of spain had long been crime in spain the torture of nonenglish citizens outside of england only became crime in england on september 29 1988 when england adopted 134 of the criminal justice act that section implemented the torture convention of 1984 and gave the english courts jurisdiction over the crime of torture and related crimes wherever committed and by persons of whatever nationality as consequence the crimes of torture and conspiracy to torture allegedly committed by pinochet prior to that date which constituted the bulk of the alleged atrocities did not meet the test of dual criminality7 the charges of torture and conspiracy to commit torture did satisfy the dual criminality requirement only with respect to three instances alleged to have been committed at pinochets direction in chile after september 29 1988 because after that date england as well as spain had extraterritorial jurisdiction over such crimes lords brownwilkinson goff hutton saville and phillips concurred in this analysis lord millett also agreed but contended that english courts could have exercised universal jurisdiction over the crime of torture under customary international law as early as 1973 even absent statute thus he said all of the torture crimes alleged met the test of dual criminality the decision on pinochets immunity as former head of state involved the interplay of english statutory law and international law regarding torture all of the law lords agreed that customary international law affords sitting head of state absolute immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of foreign states but the immunity of former head of state the majority said is controlled in england by the state immunity act of 1978 that act does not explicitly address the immunity of former head of state but provides that heads of state have immunity subject to any necessary modifications equivalent to that afforded diplomats under the vienna convention on diplomatic relations the vienna convention in turn affords diplomats absolute immunity while they are in their posts but limits their immunity once they leave their posts to acts performed by such person in the exercise of hishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30117crs9 functions as member of the mission ie to their official acts while in office thus the majority concluded under english law former heads of state have immunity only for acts they perform in their official capacities while in office and not for acts that are for their personal benefit or that are deemed not to be official functions the key question thus as it was for the first panel of law lords was whether torture and murder could be deemed official functions of government for which immunity could legitimately be claimed all of the law lords concluded that international law now places torture outside of the realm of the legitimate functions of states but they differed on when torture achieved that status and whether the torture convention of 1984 waives the immunity of former heads of state several of the law lords cited the inclusion of torture as crime against humanity in the charters of the nuremberg tokyo yugoslavia and rwanda tribunals and the recent rome statute of the international criminal court the general assembly resolution in 1946 endorsing the nuremberg principles the prohibition of torture in the universal declaration of human rights and the covenant on civil and political rights and the trials of eichmann and other alleged nazi war criminals in israel as evidence of an evolution in international law with respect to torture lords brown wilkinson hope hutton saville and phillips however said that the elimination of torture as legitimate function of government became certain only after the negotiation of the torture conventi on in 1984 thus they said the heads of particular states could longer claim immunity for allegedly official acts of torture once their countries had ratified the torture convention because chile did so on october 30 1988 and england did so on december 8 1988 these law lords agreed that at least by the latter date pinochet could longer claim immunity for the crimes of torture and conspiracy to commit torture with lord phillips disagreeing however they further agreed that the ordinary rules of immunity still applied with respect to the charges of murder and conspiracy to murder lord millett in contrast asserted that the prohibition of torture had become jus cogens norm under international law at least by 1973 and that therefore pinochet could claim immunity for any of the crimes of torture charged in spains extradition petition nor could he claim immunity for the crimes of murder and conspiracy to murder lord goff dissented entirely saying that waiver of immunity had to be express and that there was indication in either the text or the legislative history of the torture convention that it addressed or intended to address the issue of immunity he concluded therefore that senator pinochet is entitled to state immunity with respect to all of the charges of torture and murder against him that survived the dual criminality test april 15 1999 decision of the home secretary on april 15 1999 the home secretar jack straw responding to the law lords invitation to consider the matter anew issued another authority to proceed authorizing the continuation of extradition proceedings against pinochet stating that he had considered the matter entirely afresh and that the extradition petition was now limited by the law lords decision to the charges of torture and conspiracy to torture allegedly committed after december 8 1988 he rejected number of arguments in support of quashing the petition that pinochet had diplomatic immunity as the head of special mission that the crimes charged were of ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30117crs10 8 the magistrates october 8 1999 decision in the kingdom of spain v augusto pinochet ugarte can be found at httpwwwopengovuklcdmagistpinochethtm 9 it might be noted that once the matter is in his hands the home secretary has 15 days to receive representations from both sides and subsequently two months to render decision his decision is also subject to appeal to the courtspolitical character that the passage of time since the alleged crimes were committed rendered the extraditi on proceeding unjust or oppressive that the accusations were not made in good faith that pinochet ought more properly to be tried in chile and that pinochets age and health made him unfit to stand trial he also said that he had considered the possible effect of extradition proceedings on the stability of chile and its future democracy and its effect on the uk national interest pinochet attempted to appeal the home secretarys decision but on april 17 1999 judge ognall of the law lords ruled that judicial review at this point would be premature and would needlessly disrupt the extradition process october 8 1999 decision by the metropolitan magistrate subsequent to the law lords decision spain amended its extradition request to charge pinochet with one count of conspiracy to torture and 34 specific incidents of torture against chileans subsequent to 1988 on october 8 1999 metropolitan magistrate david bartle ruled that spains amended request for extradition met the requirements of the european convention on extradition and englands implementing statute8 the magistrate emphasized that he was not ruling on the merits of the case and that the convention does not even require that spain make out prima facie case all that is required he said is that the charges made against pinochet be serious crimes under the laws of both england and spain and that pinochet be found not to be immune on both issues he said the law lords had spoken the magistrate also ruled that he was not limited to considering only the three instances of torture and one count of conspiracy that had previously been before the law lords and the home secretary but could consider the additional information submitted by spain the magistrate ordered pinochet to be held for extradition pending further proceedings pinochets decision to appeal given the magistrates decision pinochet and his lawyers had to choose between appealing the judgment to higher court by means of habeas corpus petition or letting it stand as final decision as noted above the english extradition statute requires the home secretary to make the final decision with respect to any particular extradition after all legal proceedings have been concluded the statute also allows him to take into consideration factors other than those considered by the courts including the generals health and chiles demand that he be returned to chile thus acceptance of the magistrates decision as the final judgment would have put the matter in the hands of the home secretary immediately and allowed rapid resolution of the matter9 but such course would also have risked the possibility that the home secretary would not allow pinochet to return to chile but would affirm his extradition to spainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30117crs11 on october 22 1999 pinochet and his lawyers chose the cautious course and filed an appeal of judge bartles ruling in the form of habeas corpus petition in the divisional court any decision by the appeals court would have been subject to further appeal to the house of lords january 11 2000 announcement by the home secretary notwithstanding this appeal on january 11 2000 the home secretary jack straw issued statement stating that he had had pinochet undergo an extensive medical examination by four clinicians and that as consequence he was minded to terminate the extradition proceedings without waiting for final appellate ruling and let the general return to chile his statement said that the unequivocal and unanimous conclusion of the three medical practitioners and the consultant neuropsychologist is that following recent deterioration in the state of senator pinochets health which seems to have occurred principally during september and october 1999 he is at present unfit to stand trial and that change to that position can be expected the home secretary invited spain chile and other interested parties including france belgium and switzerland who also had submitted extradition requests for pinochet to submit any additional information they wished him to consider on the matter within seven days march 2 2000 decision by the home secretary on march 2 2000 the home secretary terminated the extradition proceeding on the grounds general pinochet was longer mentally fit to stand trial the home secretary stated that several strokes apparently suffered in september and october of 1999 had impaired pinochets memory for both recent and remote events his ability to understand complex sentences and questions and his capacity to express himself audibly succinctly and relevantly the examining doctors he said had found evidence that senator pinochet was trying to fake disability nor had they found any likelihood that his condition would improve as consequence he asserted an order to extradite pinochet would be oppressive the principle that an accused person should be mentally capable of following the proceedings instructing his lawyers and giving coherent evidence is fundamental to the idea of fair trial he stated as consequence he continued trial of pinochet in any of the countries that were party to the european convention on human rights would violate article 6 of that convention the home secretary stated that he is aware that the practical consequence of refusing to extradite senator pinochet to spain on account of his unfitness to stand trial is that he will probably not be tried anywhere but he concluded trial of the charges against senator pinochet however desirable is longer possible the home secretary also announced that he would not issue an authority to proceed with respect to the requests for pinochets extradition by belgium france and switzerland because none of the petitions alleged crimes of torture or conspiracyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30117crs12 to commit torture allegedly perpetrated after september 29 1988 and thus none of the charges met the basic requirement of dual criminality even if they
