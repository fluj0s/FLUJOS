democratic party spd led by cdu candidate angela merkel took office on november 22 2005 after the german federal election of september 18 2005 had produced clear winner some experts believe that the coalition will be fragile short lived and will accomplish little with each side trying to gain political advantage over the other such negative expectations are not shared by other analysts who believe that only such large coalition can implement potentially painful but needed economic and social reforms assuming that it can overcome partisan politics the most difficult and crucial areas on which the coalition must cooperate if the government is to succeed involve social and economic policy government success will be important not just for germany but also for europe and global economic health experts believe that angela merkel as chancellor wants to speed domestic social and economic reforms it is not clear whether she will have broader domestic support to do so especially among the spd base many observers expect more continuity than change in german foreign policy under the grand coalition government on most issues the cducsu and the spd are not far apart germany is expected to continue to give priority to multilateral approaches to solving international problems many expect chancellor merkel to balance traditional strong francogerman cooperation within the eu with closer ties to the united kingdom and other countries such as italy spain and poland she is expected to pursue european integration as corollary rather than in opposition to the transatlantic partnership us officials and many experts hope for improvement in usgerman bilateral relations under the merkelled government merkel has given priority to reducing the strains in transatlantic relations as well as improving negative german public opinion regarding the united states the new german government is unlikely to fundamentally change the german stand on iraq meaning that it will provide some financial and training assistance outside iraq but military personnel on the ground it is likely to continue to take lead in efforts to stabilize afghanistan chancellor merkel is expected to continue germanys domestic and international efforts to combat terrorism the united states germany and the eu are working together to oppose irans development of nuclear weapons chancellor merkel has indicated that she will not support lifting of the eu arms embargo against china which the united states also opposes number of differences are likely to continue even under the merkel government such as on the treatment of terror suspect prisoners extrajudicial renditions environmental policy and the international criminal court chancellor merkels first official visit to washington and her talks with president bush on january 13 2006 were designed to demonstrate that new positive chapter had opened in bilateral relations although differences were discussed candidly the two leaders agreed on most

democratic unionchristian socialist union1 cducsu and the social democrats spd led by cdu candidate angela merkel took office on november 22 2005 after the two parties worked out an agreement on coalition governing program the german federal election of september 18 2005 had produced clear winner or direction for the next government some see this government as shortlived and unlikely to succeed while others believe that only such coalition has the combined strength to implement potentially painful but needed economic and social benefits reforms assuming that it can overcome partisan politics foreign policy is likely to play secondary and less contentious role given the press of domestic business and general consensus on most international issues the atmosphere of us german relations has already improved since the merkel government took office as reflected by the successful first official visit of chancellor merkel to washington on january 13 2006 2005 election leadup to early election on may 22 2005 german chancellor gerhard schroeder surprised his country by announcing that he would seek early federal elections in september 2005 year ahead of schedule his decision followed the resounding defeat suffered by his social democrats spd in the state election in north rhinewestphalia traditional spd stronghold2 this was the most recent in string of state election losses that had given the christian democratic union cdu opposition firm control of the german bundesrat upper house of parliament the sluggish economy persistently high unemployment as well as concern about welfare and labor reforms both enacted and planned were widely seen as principal reasons for the spd defeat early elections are rare in germany because the german basic law constitution makes it very difficult for the bundestag lower house of parliament to be dissolved only the president can dissolve parliament and only after vote of 1 the christian socialist union csu is the bavarian sister party of the christian democratic union cdu 2 for more information see httpwwwgermanyinfoorg crs2 confidence in the government german president horst kohler set new elections for september 18 2005 after the bundestag held vote of confidence in the government which the chancellor himself initiated on july 1 2005 before the election was held the decision was reviewed and approved by the german constitutional court election results the election gave party the necessary majority with its preferred coalition partner although the christian democratic unionchristian social union cducsu got the most votes by slim margin it had an unexpectedly weak showing compared to preelection polls and in light of the general disgruntlement with the previous government analysts attributed the weak showing to the fact that voters were deeply skeptical of whether cducsu government could accomplish more than its predecessor and were also worried about some of the cdu reform ideas according to official results the cducsu received 352 percent of the vote barely beating out the social democrats spd with 343 percent of the vote this left neither party in position to form government with just its most likely coalition partner the free democratic party fdp actually did better than expected with 98 percent of the vote and ahead of the greens who received 81 percent the new left party union of east german former communists and breakaway faction of the spd received 89 percent of the vote enough to be seated as faction in the bundestag the former communist party pds did not achieve the 4 percent threshold to gain seats in the bundestag voter turnout was 777 percent slightly less than in the 2002 election3 table 1 major party vote percentages in the last three

results as reaffirming the continuing combined strength of leftist parties5 the vote for centerleft and left parties spd greens and the new left party totaled 513 percent despite lackluster performances both spd candidate chancellor gerhard schroeder and cdu candidate angela merkel claimed mandate as they each embarked on negotiations with other parties to try to form governing coalition after talks between the two main parties and possible junior coalition partners broke down the only remaining viable option short of calling new elections was grand coalition between the cducsu and the spd which was agreed to in october grand coalition was something that neither the cducsu nor the spd would have preferred grand coalition had governed the federal republic only once before for three years in the 1960s the new government and program on october 9 the two parties announced agreement on the makeup of the coalition government under the agreement angela merkel would become chancellor gerhard schroeder would step down and not serve in the new government in return the spd would get the position of deputy chancellor and eight cabinet positions including the ministries of foreign affairs finance and labor the cducsu would get the other six cabinet positions in addition to the chancellorship and the chancellery chief of staff6 the subsequent withdrawal from key positions of two of the most powerful politicians in the coalition talks complicated angela merkels efforts to form government csu leader edmund stoiber who had been designated to become economics minister withdrew from the prospective government on november 2 2005 and returned to his position as bavarian leader franz munterfering the designated deputy chancellor and minister of labor resigned his position as spd party chairman day earlier on november 1 2005 after being opposed by younger members of his party he indicated that he would remain in the government matthias platzeck the prime minister of brandenburg in east germany was named to replace him as spd chairman7 as supporter of reforms and fellow east german he was expected to be able to work closely with chancellor merkel shortly after being named platzek appointed young proreform centrist hubertus heil to be spd general secretary in place of another more leftist candidate who had been nominated peter steinbruck spd was named finance minister he was expected to be an advocate of social and economic reform in light of his support for the previous governments reform efforts which were substantial 4 atlantic times

shape coalition government program which began on october 17 were completed on november 14 2005 allowing angela merkel to be formally elected chancellor by the bundestag on november 22 compromise was difficult to achieve and the discussions were accompanied by considerable political disagreements even among the different factions within each party cducsu leaders identified four issues in particular that had to be agreed on before the coalition could take office new budget reviving the labor market reform of the welfare system and tax reform but had to give on most of them8 the parties could not agree on ms merkels campaign priorities including labor income tax health care or social security system reform in the end most of the talks focused on budget reductions and tax increases the parties agreed to three percent increase in the valued added tax vat and raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 other sensitive issues were set aside even so 50 members of the coalition parties did not vote for the agreed program in the bundestag however the coalition agreement was seen as just starting point for the government many issues were likely to be revisited and the agreed program could be altered by agreement of the governing parties for example on health insurance reform the parties agreed to find solution by the middle of 2006 meanwhile the new bundestag convened on october 18 2005 and elected norbert lammert cdu as bundestag president9 seats in the bundestag were allocated as follows table 2 makeup of german bundestag after the 2005 elections10 total 614 cdu 180 csu 46

coalition agreement on the outlines of the government program specific policies and priorities of the new government were considered likely to evolve as conditions demanded some experts believe that the coalition will be fragile short lived and unable to do much with each side trying to block the other some critics are skeptical about angela merkels strength as leader in view of her relative inexperience and perceived inability to inspire people other observers believe that she is being seriously underestimated and may prove tough and effective in fact her image has already improved significantly since she assumed office as the voters have seen her in action11 both parties appear to have vested interest in making the government work to overcome the seeming repudiation of each by the voters furthermore the difficult choices that need to be made to curb spending and reinvigorate the economy may require the support of super majority which the grand coalition represents with its combined strength and the weakness and fragmented nature of the new opposition the government should have little trouble putting its policies into effect if the cducsu and spd can agree but that is major question the new government represents significant change in the german political power structure woman is leading germany for the first time in history also for the first time political leaders from the former east germany will wield unprecedented influence holding the chancellorship and number of other key positions some commentators emphasize that the election results confirm the end of decades of postworld war two german consensus that in the past gave german politics great deal of predictability and stability in the run up to the 2005 elections the spd was seen as having moved sharply to the left since the election the compromises needed to forge grand coalition also forced the cducsu to move somewhat to the left others see the movement by voters away from the two largest parties as sign of polarization12 most important to some experts the new cast of leaders represents generational change from the group that came into its own during the 1960s many of whom on the left of the spectrum were from the radical protest movements of the late 1960s and early 1970s to generation that came of age after the fall of the berlin wall in 198913 some expect that angela merkel and other politicians of her generation will be more open and flexible in their outlook than their predecessors some see irony in the likelihood that germanys efforts at renewal may now be spearheaded by those raised in the east the cdu and spd do agree on some important issues one is the need for reform of the unwieldy german federal system where states rights and prerogatives 11 public opinion

frederick sudeman in financial times october 15 2005 crs6 overlap with those of the federal government most see the need for clearer delineation of federal and state responsibilities they advocate placing such things as environmental protection and some police powers exclusively under the central government the two parties have already worked together in the bundesrat in an attempt to make it easier for the various police and security agencies to cooperate in combating terrorism14 currently some 60 percent of legislation falls under the jurisdiction of both the bundestag and the bundesrat once planned changes to the federal system are implemented it is believed that the majority of legislation will require approval only by the bundestag rather than by both chambers15 the bundestag is the lowerchamber elected nationally and having the principal legislative role the bundesrat is made up of representatives appointed by the fifteen state laender governments and is the body in which the interests of the states are represented because most recent state elections were won by the cdu the christian democrats form decisive majority in the bundesrat state elections are not concurrent with federal elections so only the bundestag changed as result of the september 2005 election economic and social policy some commentators interpreted the 2005 election results as popular rejection of reform others disputed that view arguing that the election was not referendum on reform that the voters understood the need for reform and that most parties campaigned on reform platforms in fact recent german marshall fund survey supports the view that most germans recognize the need and are eager for genuine reform of the social and economic system among major european countries german citizens are least averse to reform according to the poll16 the most difficult and crucial areas on which the coalition must cooperate if the government is to succeed involve social and economic policy government success here will be important not just for germany but for europe and global economic health germany has the worlds third largest economy but its economic performance has stagnated for number of years acting as brake on other european and world economies both the cducsu and the spd recognize the need for reforms but consensus on specific measures may be difficult to achieve both parties agree that the previous governments package of planned reforms entitled agenda 2010 only some of which the previous government had been able to implement should be the starting point for the new governments efforts they also agree on eventually cutting corporate taxes to attract investment although such cuts may be postponed to ease the budget deficit however more is likely to be needed since such cuts will not apply to the majority of companies because most are still familyowned the 14 constanze stelzenmueller in the financial times october 11 2005 15 der koalitionsvertrag zwischen

partners agree on the need to reduce the budget deficit which has for several years exceeded the three percent ceiling under the eu stability and growth pact experts believe that angela merkel as chancellor remains committed to tax social welfare and labor market reforms even though the coalition government agreement does not spell out those reforms she has publicly advocated cutting the income tax rates at the top and at the bottom and compensating for the shortfall by raising the valueadded tax as has been agreed by the coalition partners and eliminating number of special tax breaks in order to create jobs and reduce unemployment she will seek to bring down labor costs among other things by shifting part of health care costs from employers to workers she got coalition agreement to gradually raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 such steps have the support of business leaders who have long called for similar changes17 it is not clear whether they will have broader support especially among the spd base even many in the cducsu are wary of sweeping labor reforms there is an urgent need to reduce unemployment from its average level of over 11 percent spd officials who head the labor and finance ministries are likely to receive strong pressure from the spds core labor constituency to try to preserve labor rights and benefits forecasts by several economic institutes predicted little immediate improvement in german economic performance in 200618 eastern germany continues to lag far behind the west and has much higher unemployment rate still many economists have become more optimistic concerning the prospects for german economic reform and recovery many predict that the german economy will rebound regardless of what the government does due both to restructuring that has already been completed and to the expected rebound in the world economy these economists argue that the reforms that chancellor schroeder instituted are more far reaching than he is given credit for and that the economic benefits from these reforms will soon be felt they also point out that within the corporate and private sectors major reforms have already been instituted that will have positive impact in 2003 the schroeder government risking the support of its core labor constituency introduced what were widely seen as necessary and long overdue reforms designed to overhaul the pension system loosen labor laws reduce unemployment benefits and cut back expenditures on the health care system and tax cuts to stimulate the economy19 the german share of global exports has increased germany is now the number one exporting country in the world ahead of the united states if consumer confidence and spending also recover germany could achieve stronger than anticipated growth early indications since chancellor merkel took office are positive german consumer confidence in december 2005 rose to its highest level since the beginning of 1999 suggesting rising optimism about economic prospects and possibly heralding broad based recovery following significant rise in corporate investment some economists now predict that economic growth in 2006 will be

httpengbundesregierungdedokumente crs8 percent20 in addition unemployment figures are better than expected for december others caution that the key to longterm economic health is still the implementation of further radical tax and labor market reforms and containment of health care costs they worry that the government and public might lose the sense of urgency about reform among the most acute pressures for reform especially of the social welfare and pension system are the serious demographic challenges that germany faces with its ageing population recent organization for economic cooperation and development oecd study warned that the ageing of the population could lead to lower economic growth strains on public finances and shortages of skilled labor21 the new government will be challenged by number of related social issues in order to take care of its ageing population germany needs to expand its younger work force substantially which at this point may be possible only by bringing in foreign labor germany society however remains resistant to substantial immigration thus germanys attitude to accepting and integrating immigrants including substantial muslim minority remains pressing issue for the merkel government the previous german government adopted new immigration and citizenship laws which for the first time established process by which foreigners in germany could gain permanent residency and eventual citizenship however germany has yet to assimilate immigrants into german society especially the countrys expanding muslim minority the 33 million muslims mostly turks now make up about 35 percent of the german population with birth rate three times higher than for ethnic germans the muslim population is expected to roughly double by 201522 many of these muslims view german society as unwilling to fully accept them unemployment and poverty are much higher in the german muslim community than in other segments of society especially among the youth german concern is growing over the radicalization of some young muslims and the potential emergence in their midst of an increasingly hostile and alienated population possibly susceptible to terrorist recruitment many germans see the muslim community as refusing to accept german norms and values and as wanting to stay apart from the majority population23 foreign policy many observers expect more continuity than change in german foreign policy under the grand coalition government on most issues the cducsu and the spd are not far apart in addition foreign policy is not likely to be the highest priority on the new governments agenda as it seeks to deal with pressing domestic problems however angela merkel is already seen as bringing some changes in style and substance traditionally the chancellor has the dominant voice on foreign policy 20 financial times december 29 2005 21 organization for economic cooperation and development germany ageing and

gallis crs9 regardless of which party holds the foreign ministry chancellor merkels key foreign policy adviser is christoph heusgen seasoned diplomat who was critical of gerhard schroeders conduct of foreign policy24 the new spd foreign minister frankwalter steinmeier though close associate and past adviser to gerhard schroeder as his chief of staff is seen as pragmatist who in the previous government conducted quiet diplomacy with his network of contacts in other countries to smooth relations during difficult times25 while he has not held major foreign policy positions he coordinated the german intelligence agencies and is considered global security expert26 former chancellor schroeder prided himself with having returned germany to normalcy among nations country like others that acts and speaks out in its own national selfinterest and is less hesitant to seek influence commensurate with its size and economic strength while pursuing distinctly german interests in bilateral relations in the european union and on broader international issues he was sometimes seen as strident and lecturing some observers expect that merkelled government will be less combative than chancellor schroeder was at times most experts also believe that german foreign policy will be shaped largely by domestic developments german influence in the world is likely to depend on its ability restore its own economic vitality germany is expected to continue to give priority to multilateral approaches to solving international problems the united nations will continue to be viewed as the principal multilateral forum for dealing with international security issues germany is major financial contributor to the and has sought to enlarge its role and influence by gaining permanent membership on the security council chancellor merkel is not expected to press germanys quest for permanent seat on the united nations security council according to cducsu spokesmen chancellor merkel will press for reform more broadly27 in any case the has postponed consideration of changes to the membership of the security council indefinitely since angela merkel had little background in eu politics it was unclear how she would seek to shape the german eu role her eu credentials were quickly tested at her first eu summit in december 2005 she reportedly impressed other participants with her knowledge of details and her commitment to making the eu more effective she was credited by her counterparts with playing decisive role in forging agreement on the eu 20072013 budget she was praised as coalition builder who helped defuse french concerns over farm spending and british problems with the eu rebate she also won goodwill by foregoing planned eu assistance to germany of 100 million euros and ceding the money to poland28 24 gunther hellman in the international herald tribune december 1 2005 25 peter siebenmorgen in the atlantic times november 2005 26 hugh williamson in

strong francogerman cooperation within the eu with closer ties to the united kingdom and other countries such as italy spain and poland she has indicated that she will be sensitive to the interests of smaller eu member countries especially the newer central european members she is expected to pursue european integration as corollary rather than in opposition to the transatlantic partnership she has indicated that her positions on issues such as the failed eu constitutional treaty the budget and the common agricultural policy cap are similar to those of chancellor schroeder the eu has long been central pillar of german policy as the instrument through which berlin seeks to play an influential role in europe and the world without arousing concerns among its neighbors germany has championed eu integration and enlargement the german bundestag voted overwhelmingly to ratify the eu constitutional treaty on may 12 2005 and the bundesrat followed suit on may 27 2005 this new eu treaty commonly referred to as the eu constitution represents the latest eu effort to reform its institutional bureaucracy and decision making procedures to enable an enlarged eu to function more efficiently however the crucial vote in the may 29 french referendum and the constitutions subsequent rejection by dutch voters in separate referendum seemed to stall further eu reforms and integration it was felt that strong leadership would be required to regain momentum some critics saw as problem the schroeder governments excessively close coordination of eu policy with france to the exclusion of other countries now some observers hope that germany will play more decisive leadership role by once again becoming the honest broker of competing eu interests as chancellor merkel appears to have done at the december eu summit german leadership is seen as necessary the country has traditionally been the engine of eu economic growth and political development germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget and other eu members account for almost 50 of germanys trade germanys ability to fully exercise its eu leadership will depend on the success of its efforts to stimulate domestic economic growth if it fails germany may be drag on the other eu economies germany has been primary supporter of the eus further enlargement to the east as means to ensure political and economic stability on germanys eastern border germany sees its prosperity as tied to the fortunes of new member and candidate countries germany is the main western trading partner of every country in central and eastern europe and leading source of foreign direct investment turkeys candidacy for eu membership was an issue in the 2005 election campaign with spd leaders supporting eventual membership and cducsu politicians including merkel voicing opposition to full turkish membership as opposed to some privileged partnership status however since eu accession talks with turkey have begun and are expected to take many years to complete the current government will not have to face the issue merkelled government is likely to continue germanys support for the eus european security and defense policy esdp though with greater emphasis on ensuring that it complements rather than competes with nato some view the previous schroeder government as more inclined to support the french drive to build an independent defense capability independent of nato many agree that until crs11 germany increases its defense spending substantially and grapples seriously with reforming its armed forces robust european defense capability is unlikely under chancellor schroeder german relations with russia were given high priority in fact schroeders very close personal ties to russian president vladimir putin to the extent that their families would vacation together were source of widespread criticism in view of this friendship chancellor schroeder was seen by some as softpedaling the erosion of democracy in russia the war in chechnya or russian attempts to pressure and interfere with the democratic process in other former soviet countries his policies toward russia were sometimes seen by germanys eastern neighbors as threatening to their interests as in the case of the agreed new gas pipeline between russia and germany that will bypass eastern europe and the baltic states negotiated by the schroeder government before it left office29 chancellor merkel has been more critical of russia and has made it clear that she will not follow in former chancellor schroeders footsteps in terms of the special relationship with russian president putin germany is likely to continue to pursue strong bilateral relations with russia particularly in light of germanys growing energy dependence on moscow but chancellor merkel has indicated that relations will not be to the detriment of germanys east european neighbors she has repeatedly emphasized the priority she will place on bilateral relations with poland country that had been skeptical of the close schroederputin ties germany and the united states bilateral and transatlantic relations usgerman bilateral relations are an area in which us officials and many experts hope for improvement under merkelled government angela merkel has been strong friend of the united states and an atlanticist who has given priority to removing the strains in transatlantic relations she and her spd coalition partners agreed in the coalition agreement on the central importance of germanys relations with both the united states and nato30 the new government has pledged in the coalition agreement to seek to improve public opinion on bilateral relations by creating better understanding of the united states among germans and of germany and europe in the united states at the same time the new government indicated that strengthened bilateral partnership would allow for differences of opinion on specific issues31 this message had already been conveyed in december 2005 during secretary of state rices trip to berlin and in washington by new german defense minister franz josef jung on december 19 29 shortly after schroeders resignation it was announced that he would become member of the board of an energy consortium including gazprom huge russian conglomerate with close ties to russian president putin this move while not illegal under german law was widely

first official visit to the united states as chancellor on january 13 2006 statements by president bush and chancellor merkel at the conclusion of their meeting in washington on january 13 2006 declared their talks success in again placing bilateral relations on firm footing of trust and indicated that candid discussions had taken place on wide range of issues they agreed that intensive cooperation is necessary in light of the common threat of terrorism and the iran nuclear challenge chancellor merkel indicated that she had invited president bush to germany and that she would be returning to washington in may 200632 traditionally germany has sought to maintain careful balance of emphasis between nato and the european union chancellor schroeders commitment to this balance was called into question by his statement to the wehrkunde conference in munich delivered on his behalf by defense minister struck on february 14 2005 and reiterated in wall street journal interview33 he stated that strategic issues in transatlantic relations should be decided with the eu rather than at nato this seeming endorsement of the primary role of the eu in the transatlantic context was seen by some experts to be in contrast with past german support for nato preeminence in the security sphere now chancellor merkel is seeking to restore the balance she has stated repeatedly that progress in eu integration should not come at the expense of the transatlantic partnership and other members of the cducsu have reaffirmed the central role of nato on security questions many expect her to also seek to play constructive role in euus relations the change in german leadership is already having an impact on the atmosphere of usgerman relations at the top despite significant efforts to smooth relations since 2004 the personal animosity between president bush and chancellor schroeder has been difficult to overcome mr schroeder is thought to have contributed to eroding german public opinion about the united states particularly with his vocal attack on us policy in iraq and with his very public rejection of the anglo american model for germanys own economic renewal ironically his rhetoric on iraq aimed at his domestic audience did not match german actions which were generally more supportive of the united states see iraq discussion below34 despite the positive signs of smoother bilateral relations there is agreement over how much chancellor merkel will be able to do in this regard pessimists warn that it will be an uphill battle for chancellor merkel to overcome negative public opinion toward the united states and the fallout from strong differences on specific us actions such as fresh allegations of cia use of us military airports in germany to transport suspected terrorists to third countries antiamerican or at least antibush administration sentiment has continued to grow among the german public and us policies for better or worse are part of the german domestic political debate some 40 percent of germans now view the united states as positive force 32 white house press release january 13 2006httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases 33 wall street journal

war attitudes number of longstanding differences are likely to continue even under the merkel government these include environmental policy especially with regard to climate change the international criminal court and the role of the united nations and other international organizations some also point to the heavy representation of schroederera spd members in the foreign policy establishment as factor limiting how much change can be expected from longer term perspective some specialists argue that the differences in outlook that have emerged between the united states and germany over recent years are based on fundamental changes in underlying realities rather than on specific policies and actions while close relationship with the united states is still strong german foreign policy interest reunited germany in stable europe is seen as less dependent on the united states for its security in turn the united states longer sees need to protect germany and as result the countrys importance to us policy has arguably evolved in fact from the vantage point of presentday us interests germanys influence on the direction of the eu is probably the most important aspect of germanys political role in the economic realm since germany is the worlds third largest economy the united states has very strong interest in german policies and how they are likely to influence the global economy whatever the changes in the nature of bilateral relations the more permanent economic cultural and military ties that bind the united states and germany remain very strong the united states and germany continue to share strong economic interests each country is leading investor in the economy of the other especially in the areas of research and development these investments contributed to some 13 million jobs in the two countries germany is the fifth largest us trade partner35 for germany the united states is its largest trade partner outside the eu extensive cultural and education
