in 2003 an estima ted 158 million workers were union members as percent of employed workers union membership peaked in 1954 at 283 in 2003 115 of employed workers were union members most studies find that after controlling for individual job and labor market characteristics the wages of union workers are in the range of 10 to 30 higher than the wages of nonunion workers the wa ge premium is generally greater for less skilled lesseducated and young er workers and larger for private than public sector workers union members generally receive better or more generous fringe benefits than similar nonunion workers job tenure nds to be greater and quit rates lower among unionized workers however the wage premium may have declined in recent years data from the bureau of labor statis tics bls monthly current population survey cps show that the level of union membership varies among different groups union members are more likely to be male white middleage work in the private sector and have high school degree or some college the rate of union membership is greater among men than wo men and higher among older than younger workers in 2003 123 of men were union members compared to 105

bargain collectively are intended to achieve different policy objectives these objectives include to increase the bargaining power of employees to reduce earnings inequality and to provide means for improved communication between labor and management government intervention in labor markets governments may intervene in labor ma rkets for number of reasons one of these reasons is to improve competition8 according to economic theory competitive markets generally result in the most efficient allocation of resources where resources consist of individuals with different skills capital goods eg computers machinery and buildings and natural resources in competitive labor markets workers are paid according to the value of their contribution to output under perfect co mpetition wages include compensation for unfavorable working conditions the latter theory called the theory of compensating wage differentials recogn izes that individuals differ in their preferences or tolerance for different working conditions such as health and safety conditions hours worked holidays and annual leave and job security9 if labor markets do not fit the model of perfect competition increasing the bargaining power of employees may rais wages and improve working conditions to levels that might exist under competitive c onditions in labor markets where firmhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32553crs5 10

frequently cited as examples of negative externalities home maintenance and improvements are often cited as examples of positive externalitiesis the only employer called monopsony unions can within limits increase both wages and employment10 if labor markets are already competitiv however economists maintain that increasing the bargaining power of employees may result in misallocation of resources in competitive labor markets higher union wages may reduce employment for union workers below the leve ls that would exist in the absence of unionization11 if unions lower employment in the unionized sector they may also increase the supply of workers to empl oyers in the nonunion sector lowering the wages of nonunion workers12 it can be difficult to determine the competitiveness of labor markets first identifying the appropriate labor market may be difficult labor markets can be local eg for unskilled labor regional national or even international eg for managerial and professiona l workers second labor market competitiveness is difficult to measure and labor mark ets may change because of economic technological or policy changes distribution of earnings competitive labor markets may result in distribution of earnings that some policymakers find unacceptable thus governments may intervene in labor markets to reduce inequality13 unionization may be means of reducing earnings inequality according to some economists greater quality may under certa in conditions eg such as the great depression of the 1930s also increase aggregate demand and therefore reduce

jobs or vice versa longitudinal data can capture the effect of otherwise unobserved personal characteristics some re search has concluded that the lower union wage premium found using longitudinal

relating to pay working conditions or other matters14 economic effects of labor unions this section summarizes the findings of selected research on the economic effects of labor unions15 earnings

more applicants resulting in larger applicant queues giving employers larger pool from which to hire qualified workers as result some evidence indicates that the quality of union workers may be better than that of nonunion workers doing the same kind of work29 quit rates may also be lower among union employees if unions give work ers and management means to improve communications and resolve issues productivity unions can potentially have both bene ficial and harmful effects on labor productivity restrictive work rules ma harm productivity by limiting the ability of management to assign work or introduce new technology higher wages may reduce investment in equipment and lower spending on research and development on the other hand higher wages may attract better workers and cause employers to substitute machinery and equipment for bor ie increasing the amount of fixed capital per worker lower quit rate may create an incentive for employers to provide more firmspecific tr aining union firms

salary workers and nonunion selfemployed workers workers not in the union sector have the option therefore of nonunion wage and salary employment or nonunion selfemployment but selfemployed workers are in effect both employer and employee and therefore do not unionize figure 1 shows union membership as percent of three measures of employment total employment b wage and salary em ployment and

percentage of employed workers who were represen ted by union fell from 17 to 1240 if the union wage premium has declined in recent years as discussed above lower union membership may account for part of this decline the decline in union membership may have also moderated some of the other economic effects of unions discussed above eg on pr ofitability and productivity characteristics of union

membership declined for all racial groups union membership among blacks declined by 40 percentage points and by 19 percentage points among whites42 one reason for the higher rate of union membership among blacks is that blacks are more likely to be employed in the public sector where union membership is greater than in the private sector see private and public sectors below in 2003 150 of public sector workers were black compared to 100 of privat sector workers see appendix b for an explanation of how individuals are categorized by race hispanic origin figure 5 shows that union membership is

and from 92 to 72 in the private sector the relative increase in the number of union members who are employed in the public sector may account for part of the reported decline in the union wage premium ie the union wage premium is smaller in the public than private sector in addition some evidence suggests that the d ecline in union membership in the private sector has contributed to rising

is also cited as reason for the decline in union membership in the private sector in so industries eg ai rlines trucking and telecommunications deregulation has increased competition among existing firms and led to the entry of nonunion employers49 increased foreign competition has also led american firms to look for ways to wer costs unionized firms may seek wage concessions from unionized workers or move production to nonunion locations5051 in addition employers may have become more sensitive to employee concerns resulting in greater job satisfaction among nonunion workers and reducing the demand for unionization on the other nd management may have become more sophisticated in opposing attempts by workers to unionize52 slower employment growth in union firm s may have also contributed to the decline in the proportion of the workforce that is organized53httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32553crs18 53 continued manufacturing plants in california concluded th at the annual rate of

eight months and back in the survey for four mo re months the questions about earnings and union status and hours worked are asked of households leaving the survey either permanently or for eight months during 12month period the observations on earnings are for unique individualsappendix b data and methodology the analysis in this report uses da ta from the monthly current population survey cps the cps is household surv ey conducted by the us bureau of the census for the bureau of labor statistics bls of the us department of labor the monthly cps is the main source of labor force data for the nation including estimates of the monthly unemployment rate the cps collects wide range of demographic social and labor market information each month approximately 50000 households are contacted to be intervie wed either in person or by phone the cps collects labor force data for civilians 15 and over the official definition of the civilian labor force is ages 16 and over the monthly cps sample is representative of the civilian noninstitutional population it does not include persons on active military duty5859 each month onefourth of the cps sample called the outgoing rotation group or org is asked questions about union membership and current hourly or weekly earnings the monthly cps s included questions on union membership and union coverage since november 198260 for the tables in appendix the org samples for each month from 1994 to 2003 were combined to calculate monthly average for the year61 the analysis in this report examines employed persons ages 16 and over employed persons include both wage and sa lary workers and selfemployed persons data on union membership and coverage exclude selfemp loyed persons data are for the sole or main job of fulltime and parttime workers several changes were made in the janua ry 2003 cps in answering the question about race respondents may now pick more than one race previously individuals could only select one race for 2003 th is report follows bls practice and only counts blacks and whites who selected one race category also beginning in 2003 the cps question on hispanic origin was reworded to ask respondents directly whether they are hispanic previously indi viduals were identified as hispanic based on their or their ancestors country of orig in hispanics may be of any race as result of these changes data for 2003 on r ace and hispanic ethnicity are not directly comparable to data for earlier yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32553crs35 62 mary bowler randy ig stephen mille r ed robison and

reflect the higher population estimates from the 2000 census and the higher rate of population growth since the census this report uses the revised sample weights for 20002002 the revised weights in crease the size of the labor force but have less of an effect on percentage calculations finally in 2003 new classification syst ems were introduced for industry and occupation because of these new system s data on industry and occupation for 2003 are not comparable to data for earlier ears and are not included in this report62 the regional data in figure 11 and table a11 are based on state

louisiana oklahoma and arkansas confidence levels the comparisons discussed in the text of this report are statistically significant at the 95 confidence level estimates ba sed on survey responses from sample of households have two kinds of error nonsampling error and sampling error examples of nonsampling error include in formation that is misreported and errors made in processing collected information sampling error occurs because sample and not the entire population of households is surveyed the difference between an estimate based on sample of households and the actua l population value is known as sampling error63 when using sample data re searchers typically construct confidence intervals around population estima tes confidence intervals providehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32553crs36 information about the accuracy of estimated values with 95 confidence interval and repeated samples from population 95 of intervals will generally include the actual value of population characteristic
