implement the first phase of the new compensation system during the 109th congress republican and democr atic leadership of both the house committee on international relations and the senate committee on foreign relations worked to resolve this issue by developing the foreign service compensation reform proposal this propos would 1 place the foreign service compensation system on payforperformance basis and 2 eliminate the current pay disparity by creating new worldwid pay structure at the washington dc salary level however re portedly due to cost concerns among the house republican leadership1 this proposal was not included in the final version of hr 6060 which was passed by the house and sena and enacted as pl 109472 the foreign service personnel and compen sation system is separate and quite different from the federal governments ge neral service gs system the current foreign service system was created under the authorities provided by the foreign service act of 1980 pl 96465 there are about 13000 foreign service officers and specialists with twothirds of th em serving abroad at over 250 posts and missions at any one time the remaining third is generally posted in washington dc typically members of the foreign service spend twothirds of their careers abroad serving at post from one to three years and then are assigned elsewhere in the world in terms of levels or rank within the foreign service it is divided into two categories the senior foreign service s fs is divided into 5 pay categories and like the civil service senior executive service ses requires presidential appointment into the senior service the regular foreign service is divided into nine ranks or classes with the fs01 level the highest most foreign service officers enter the foreign service at the 05 or 06 vels and generally serve for four to five years before being tenured and commissione d as foreign service officers the personnel system is basically an uporout system that reviews the members of the foreign service annually nd has both timeinclass t ic and timeinservice tis limitations that require promotions within certain time frames or the person is separated from the service because of this system most members of the foreign service leave the service after full and distinguished career in their mid50s at an 01 or 02 rank with the creation of locality pay adju stments for federal employees in 1990 pay gap began for the foreign service depending upon whether one was posted in washington dc or abroad because locality pay adjustments were not available for positions abroad each

personnel modernization the administration states its belief that the current civil service system is ineffective and needs to be tied to marketsensitive performancebased syst em thus for the

secretary of state rice wrot the house leadership expressing her support for these provisions and urging prompt consid eration and passage by the house of representatives2 for the administration to

certain basic assurances in order to support the move to new payforperformanceglobal rate of pay system these assurances included sufficiency of funds to implement and sustain the new system maintenance of the traditional role of the selection boards and the traditional relationship between the foreign services recognized bargaining agent and management ultimately afsa needed to believe

legislative issue for members of the foreign service and afsa is elimination of the pay disparity that ex ists between service in washington dc where most foreign service personnel ar domestically assigned and service abroad3 the federal pay comparability act of 1990 excludes federal employees posted outside the continental united states from receiving locality pay adjustments4 locality pay is designed to create pay comparability between federal employees and nonfederal workers doing the same levels of work within specific geographic locality in the continental united states5 because there is basis for comparison of foreign service personnel posted abroad to nonfederal workers in the united states those in the foreign service w ho spend about twothirds of their careers posted abroad receive less salary while serving abroad than their colleagues in washington dc this pay difference ffects both morale and decisions foreign service personnel make when applying for assignments supporters of changing the pay system argue that by fy2006 this difference resulted in more than 17 pay disparity and created an increasing pay disincentive to overseas service6 however this foreign

sections in the house bill hr 6060 as reporte d and s 3925 in the senate in arriving at this merging of views the draft bill submitted by the administration addressed th concerns of both the

to the members of that class but the secretarys determination would take into consideration severa l factors some of which are negotiated with afsa the draft stated that salary adjustments would be based on performance and that individua ls found to be performing below the standards of their class would receive salary adjustment the following issues were advocated by afsa the role of the selection boards in determining performance and promotion recommendations to the secretary is incorporated into the legislation the current requirement that th selection board recommendations be followed in the order that they are presented is also maintained the secretary continues to have the authority to withhold action temporarily on the recommendations of the selection boards but to do so would be under transparent pr ocedures negotia ted in advance with afsa the role of the foreign services union is recognized and isconsistent with current procedures assurances that sufficient pool

the payforperformanceocp trade off poisoned chalice or winwin the foreign service journal april 2006 p 5however key question for the departme nt of state and the foreign service was whether the proposal would avoid th labormanagement problems affecting dod and dhs currently the full implement ation of the personnel systems for dod and dhs is being contested by actions in the courts as federal employee unions seek to block the payforperformance system and the associated labormanagement rules contending that they do not provide for adequate employee protection and collective bargaining rights20 because the foreign service would forgo an automatic 3 in grade step increase plus the annual ec i and locality pay adjustments and accept performance based adjustments with unknown percentages of increases afsa sought assurances that the system would be fair to its employees in this case both labor and management concluded that the administrationafsa agreed upon proposal of july 28 was significantly different enough from the other payfor performance proposals and the foreign rvice system was unique enough that conversion to payforperformance syst em could be mutually beneficial the afsa president ambassador j anthony holmes earlier explained his views regarding the general concept of tying payforperformance system with an overseas comparability pay system stating pay for performance is an unknown for most of us from media reports of doddhs efforts to convert their civil servants to pfp system and the administrations working for america act targeting the rest of the civil service one can easily view it as menacing ideological and antiemployee but it is clear from states own experience with the senior fs conversion to pfp two years ago that it should be possible to make this work and have winwin situation all around the reality is that the present fs personnel system with its rankinperson not injob annual evaluations and competitive uporout system is inherently pfp already so the changes in the system should be much less dramatic than many of our members fear21 the current foreign service compensation system the foreign service personnel and comp ensation systems are very different from the civil service system as ambassador holmes stated the foreign service system resembles more payforperformance system than it does the civil service system proponents of the change to new system believe it is important to understand these differences b ecause the impact that performancebased compensation system would have on the fore ign service is less dramatic than many especially those who are familiar with the civil service system might anticipate further the senior foreign service sfs personnel system became performance based in 2005 when the

many senior executives believe that facto quotas are being enforced that are affecting final performance ratings 2 senior executives see clear consistent correlation between ratings and pay adjustments or how bonuses are distributed and 3 senior executiv doing good job at the fully successful or higher level often receive salary adjust ment 40 percent see the system as having negative effect on morale ses22 the experience for the sfs has been vi ewed more positively because of the different nature of the existing decad esold foreign service personnel system similarities to the civil service system like the civil service system the foreign service system currently has both levels or ranks and within these levels there are ingrade step adjustments that periodically allow an

foreign service personnel serving in locality pay area also r eceive locality pay adjustment equal to that which civil service personne l receive in the same locale differences to the civil service

discretionary authority initially the administration insisted upon the phrase in the secretarys sole and exclusive discretion many who are c oncerned about employee rights questioned whether the phrase should be included in th legislation they were concerned that it could be interpreted as curtailing traditional bargaining rights to negotiate procedures for the pay for performance sy stem and appropriate arrangements for employees adversely impacted by the change to such system those members and congressional staff asserted that it is contradictory to use the phrase sole and exclusive and
