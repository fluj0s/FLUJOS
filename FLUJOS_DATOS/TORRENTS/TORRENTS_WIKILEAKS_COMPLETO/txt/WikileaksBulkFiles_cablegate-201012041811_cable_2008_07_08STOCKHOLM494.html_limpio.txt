marr prel econ pgov sw subject proposed response to swedish request to release aesa radar for gripen fighter planes ref usdao stockholm dtg 051506zjun2008 b iir 6 982 0173 classified by ambassador michael wood for reasons 14 b and d summary 1 s embassy stockholm recommends we postpone response to the swedish request for release of aesa radar for swedish gripens until after norways selection of its next fighter jet currently slated for december 2008 in informing sweden of this delay we should consider offering us support for the enhanced nordic military cooperation proposals and also consider secdef visit in the fall per gos request end summary the swedish case for aesa 2 s in june 25 meeting with the ambassador minister of defense sten tolgfors reviewed swedens arguments on the benefits to the us of release of aesa radar for use on the saab jas gripen 39 fighters for the nordic region refs and b aesa on gripens would enhance nato interoperability sweden works closely with the us and nato on security and makes important contributions through military deployments under nato aegis in afghanistan and kosovo sweden supports greater role for europe in iraq where sweden is opening an embassy and recently hosted the international compact with iraq conference in stockholm the gripen contains 50 percent us content including engines avionics and weapon systems sales of the gripen are good for us industry aesa would increase us content and enhance sales prospects sweden supports nordic military cooperation which moves sweden closer to nato postponing response on aesa 3 s our original report on aesa releaseability reviewed the swedish case ref we now supplement our recommendations to call for postponement taking into account the potential impact on the norway fighter jet competition our recommendation for postponement is based on the following three points the swedish government has requested the granting of us export licenses for raytheons advanced electronically scanned array aesa radar to be used on saab jas gripen 39 fighters for the nordic region refs and b asserting that this would enhance nordic region air coverage and interoperability the gripen is competing with the lockheed martin f35 joint strike fighter jsf for sale to norway of 48 fighter aircraft norway is expected to take the decision on the gripen vs the jsf by early december the gripen is also competing with the jsf and boeings f18 for later sale to denmark of an additional 48 fighters swedish officials and saab want aesa radar in time to make the gripen more competitive swedish officials tell us they anticipate decision from washington on aesa releaseability by september 2008 given this potential impact of aesa releaseability on the norway competition and possibly the denmark competition we suggest postponing the decision on aesa releaseability for the gripen until after norways decision in december we futher recommend informing the swedes of this delay in advance this recommendation supplements ref assessment of releaseability if this course is chosen we should also explore doing something else for sweden to demonstrate our bilateral engagement and support for nordic cooperation while informing them of the delay we recommend exploring offers to support aspects of the swedens proposals for enhanced nordic cooperation this is politically and economically important to all the nordic and especially to sweden it is likely that many of the approximately 140 recommendations for nordic cooperation would benefit from us support and be in our interest we propose also favorable response to ref b request for visit to sweden by secretary of defense gates in fall 2008 wood
