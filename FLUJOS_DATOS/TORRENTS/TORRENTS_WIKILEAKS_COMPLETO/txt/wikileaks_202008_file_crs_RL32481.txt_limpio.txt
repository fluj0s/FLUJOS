activities in federal agencies preliminary inventory july 12 2004 genevieve j knezo specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress homeland security research and development funding and activities in federal agencies preliminary inventory summary according to the office of management and budget omb federal agency funding for homeland security research and development rd was requested at 36 billion for fy2005 54 increase over the enacted fy2004 level and about 63 more than enacted for fy2003 and about double the resources used in fy2002 the department of homeland securitys dhs rd programs constitute about one third of total federal homeland security rd funding other agencies which have substantial homeland security rd budgets listed in descending funding order include the national institutes of health the department of defense the department of justice the national science foundation the department of agriculture the environmental protection agency the department of commerce the department of energy and the department of transportation the sum of 36 billion is large amount and arguably the fastest growing component of the federal rd budget dhs has statutory responsibilities mandated by the homeland security act pl 107296 to coordinate federal homeland security rd throughout the government according to dhss under secretary for science and technology homeland security rd will be coordinated by fall 2004 coordination and subsequent congressional oversight depend in part on the quality of information about federal homeland security rd the little information that is available does not permit identification of the components of homeland security rd funding nor systematic comparisons among agencies this makes it difficult to answer questions about prioritysetting and coordination rd seems to appear most prominently in two categories of funding omb uses to identify types of homeland security budget accounts the two homeland security missions of defending against catastrophic threatsand of protecting critical infrastructures and key assets however the rd components of these categories have not been clearly identified it is not possible to compare across agencies to determine the actual funding for homeland security rd in functional areas such as countering bioterrorism border security information security threat mitigation and so forth or for fields of science such as chemistry environmental science or psychology clearer and more consistent information about homeland security rd might assist in eliminating unnecessary duplication filling in gaps identifying future rd personnel needs and improving the capability of different types of rd performers omb has responsibility to gather homeland security rd data and federal agencies also publish information tailored to their needs section 889 of pl 107 296 requires omb to report on homeland security funding and to consult at least annually with congress to identify which activities constitute homeland security activities for budgeting purposes there are many obstacles to obtaining consistent information and several options to improve these data these are addressed in companion crs report rl32482 federal homeland security research and development funding issues of data quality

attention correlating future rd needs with training of personnel developing policies to ensure availability of variety of different types of rd performers including in academia federal laboratories and industry and so forth combating terrorism rd data and information sources omb has principal responsibility to prepare data sets on homeland security rd funding although there is some overlap between data sets as will be explained in this report omb prepares separate information on combating terrorism rd and on homeland security rd the most comprehensive single source of information about federal funding and agency programs for combating terrorism is the omb annual series report to congress on combating terrorism3 the latest report for 2003 was published in september 2003 it contains

some budget accounts for rd programs or units that used this category were also counted12 it should be pointed out that the 9 according to the congressional budget office ombs publication of these

presidents budget 11 ombs 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism p 4 defined defending against catastrophic threats as this mission area includes homeland security programs that involve protecting against detecting deterring or mitigating the terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction including understanding terrorists efforts to gain access to the expertise technology and materials needed to build chemical biological radiological and nuclear cbrn weapons in addition this mission area includes funding for efforts or planning to decontaminate buildings facilities or geographic areas after catastrophic event 12 ombs 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism p 4 defined protecting critical infrastructures and key assets as an attack on one or more pieces of our critical infrastructure may disrupt entire systems and cause significant damage programs that continued crs7 2003 combating terrorism report noted that some funding for protecting critical infrastructure and key assets may be for cyber security and physical security improvements to agency facilities or infrastructure13 omb did not give enough information to differentiate between rd and physical protection activities therefore when attempting to estimate rd funding this crs report included the full amount as constituting rd if funding was requested in budget account that encompassed science or rd responsibilities although such cyber and physical security improvements to facilities and infrastructure may be for rd rd funding may or may not be included in these amounts it is clear

funded homeland security rd totals about 36 billion exclusive of facilities and construction this is large amount of funding and arguably the fastest growing component of the federal rd budget dhs has statutory responsibilities mandated by the homeland security act pl 107296 to coordinate federal homeland security research and development rd dhss under secretary for science and technology announced that homeland security rd will be coordinated by fall 2004 implementation of these responsibilities depends in part on the quality of information about homeland security rd programs in dhs and in other agencies the data that are now available on homeland security rd do not appear sufficiently detailed accurate or consistent to answer questions about prioritysetting policy and coordination among federal agencies omb prepares several different types of homeland security rd data sets for different purposes agencies also produce their own data it is difficult task to collect comparable crossagency data and omb has made considerable progress in constructing data sets while there are some similarities in these data sets there are also major differences among them making it difficult to have confidence in the accuracy of any one data set or in comparisons over time in its reports to congress on combating terrorism omb publishes summary data on federal agencies budgets for rd for combating terrorism and gives short descriptions of some agency programs these data are current only through the budget request for the fiscal year when the report is published omb describes homeland security rd as subset of combating terrorism rd omb has not published data on homeland security rd funding per but using an internal crosswalk budget data base it has produced an unpublished table on homeland security rd also in data appended to the fy2005 budget request and available electronically omb published information on homeland security funding by agency subdivided by programs and units according to the congressional budget office cbo ombs publication of these data are responsive to section 889 of the homeland security act of 2002 p l 107296 which directed omb to produce an annual report on homeland security funding to accompany the presidents annual budget submission65 omb is also required by that statute to consult with congress annually about ways to identify and report homeland security information rd would appear to be included in two funding categories omb uses to identify types of homeland security budget accounts the two homeland security missions of defending against catastrophic threatsand of protecting critical infrastructures and key assets however the rd components of these categories have not been clearly identified 65 congressional budget office

crs40 coordination of homeland security rd requires an ability to identify and compare funding and activities supported by separate federal agencies in relation to homeland security rd needs the inventory of agency programs identified in this report suggests certain issues for which more adequate data may be needed in order to determine policy priorities and accountability measures to coordinate homeland security rd programs such possible issues include are the funding amounts reported for homeland security rd mutually exclusive or does the rd reported as homeland security by agencies and omb also serve other civilian or defense science and technology needs that is is some homeland security rd funding data also reported under other categories of rd or does some homeland security rd support dualuse purposes is there double counting of such rd are agencies programs for homeland security rd new programs or are agencies simply re labeling rd that was previously conducted and categorized for other purposes what are the governments priorities for homeland security rd divided by application or functional area such as countering bioterrorism border security information security and threat mitigation what fields of science does federal agency homeland security rd support what is the breakdown by discipline such as by chemistry biology psychology social sciences and so forth and by type of rd such as basic applied and development is there unnecessary duplication or on the other hand major gaps in homeland security rd who are the major performers of homeland security rd such as by type including academia federal laboratory and industrial performers in order to meet future homeland security rd needs should plans be put in place to strengthen performer or scientific personnel capacity for selected fields is there an opportunity or need to promote dedicated information exchange or technology transfer among researchers who receive federal homeland security rd funding to allow researchers to easily learn about the rd accomplishments of others in order to hasten discoveries and to prevent unnecessary redundancy what are the similarities and differences in the rd conducted by different agencies in similar areas an example is the biodefense rd conducted by dhhs and dod what is nsfs role in supporting such work which agencies support rd on information security how are priorities determined clearer and more consistent information about homeland security rd might assist in eliminating unnecessary duplication filling in gaps identifying future rd personnel needs and improving the capability of different types of rd performers detailed list of strengths and weaknesses in the various federal homeland security rd data sets and options
