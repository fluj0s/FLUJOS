anyone has preclearsound versions of these tapes please check the others and post differences statement of purpose our purpose is to promote religious freedom and the scientology religion by spreading the scientology tech across the internet the cof abusively suppresses the practice and use of scientology tech by freezone scientologists it misuses the copyright laws as part of its suppression of religious freedom they think that all freezoners are squirrels who should be stamped out as heretics by their standards all christians moslems mormons and even nonhassidic jews would be considered to be squirrels of the jewish religion the writings of lrh form our old testament just as the writings of judaism form the old testament of christianity we might not be good and obedient scientologists according to the definitions of the cof whom we are in protest against but even though the christians are not good and obedient jews the rules of religious freedom allow them to have their old testament regardless of any jewish opinion we ask for the same rights namely to practice our religion as we see fit and to have access to our holy scriptures without fear of the cof copyright terrorists we ask for others to help in our fight even if you do not believe in scientology or the scientology tech we hope that you do believe in religious freedom and will choose to aid us for that reason thank you the fz bible association shsbc8 renum 8 6 jun 61 security checks security checks lecture given on 6 june 1961 based on clearsound only thank you well here we are at the 6th of june and our course seems to be going very well if you dont recognize today actually as i explained to edgar it isnt actually that i like to wear my hair long its just that there arent any barbers go ahead i dare you try to find one since we took edgar out of the profession theres nobody anymore left in the world who can barber theres small fee for this commercial all right i suppose by this time you actually have in your small moist palm copy of the hcob that has to do with these routines is it in your hands yet audience well then it probably will be tomorrow morning its the first bulletin concerning the routines and so on now whats going to change that bulletin lets look at the future just little bit we are not now trying to find out what auditors need as theoretical or ideal tools to clear people we are not at that stage we passed that stage long time ago actually we are trying desperately to discover right now what auditors will use and what they can use and sop goals and its related processes have been in development for use for some time please understand that as difference of action theres two things its what will auditors use what will they use and what can they use and these two things monitor what is put in their hands you got the idea now at first just the prehav scale was put in their hands and they had pretty good success with it here there just general runs in the prehav scale they werent able to goof it up too badly and they got some good success and i had some rather resounding profiles sent in here and everybody seemed to be very happy with the idea of assessing the pc on the general scale and cooking up some kind of an auditing command even bum one and running pc on it and rudiments in out or upside down you know and they got somewhere they got somewhere with this we got some good results so we have to assume that an auditor not only will do it but can do it see 1 and is it well accepted and 2 is it within his realm of ability you have to think of that when youre training students training people in scientology its what they can and will do now if you have somebody who can only run cchs and you have him in group of people who are doing auditing on outside pcs well wouldnt you be rather foolish to give him set of tools that he would not or could not apply because immediately your auditing results would break down right at that point sharply clearly and immediately you get the idea auditor can run cchs and yet you say run the hooblegoobles second differential of the integral zim thats what it sounds like to him see i mean youve said something very comprehensible to you youve said find his havingness and confront process and yet it sounded like the gobbledygook i just gave you see it doesnt make any sense to him so with great willingness perhaps salted down little bit with making you wrong he will go ahead and louse up the lot why well hes being told to run something he thinks he should understand this and you may come around for long time and find out that he just hasnt told you he didnt understand it now the test of anything is whether or not it produces results but remember this that result is determined by several things 1 the adequacy of the tool being employed that is the first thing result is established by that is first and foremost nobody will argue about that at all if you havent got the tools you cant do the job thats it and thats what scientology is basically the tools that do the job now this is modified by what auditors will apply or what people will use you see what will they use and that again is modified what can they use so we actually have three sets of determinisms here on what is good process it isnt whether or not the process used under ideal conditions will produce every time stratospheric flight you see that is not the test all by itself without that nothing is going to work thats for sure but its monitored by these other two things and when youre training auditors for god sakes keep that in mind huh weve had the principle for long time but i never articulated it and one of the parts of it was if somebody comes in raw into an hgc you find out from him what processes he has been having success with you could also ask him this one oddly enough what process has worked on you and he says oh 8c 8c i had wonderful gain back about 54 nobody has run it on since but back about 54 i had wonderful gain on 8c and ive run it on lot of pcs and so forth and you say to this fellow all right thats all youre going to run on pcs and you know youll get better profile gains than if you told him something else you got it until you can get him trained up and get reality on something else you had much better let him run something on which he has an adequate reality and if hes going to get result its because he himself believes he can get result now you can enter far too far into the esoterics of all this look at the factor youre involved with if an individual doesnt have subjective reality on something you cannot expect the individual to employ it with reality can you and theres nobody more sensitive to an unreality in preclear than an auditor but certainly theres nobody more unsensitive to unreality in an auditor than preclear yeah thats true so all of these things are monitoring factors on what auditors can and will use and right now auditors broadly have apparently had considerable success with the cchs over the years theyve been running them all wrong and backwards because theyve been running them doctored up and changed and alterised and improved see when as matter of fact it was something on the order of trying to improve the last space fleet that was developed in the last galactic empire at its utter peak you see and from there on all you were doing was pinning pink roses on the things and you finally pinned enough pink roses and blue bows on these spaceships until eventually the fleet didnt fly anymore thats about what happened now the original cchs was the only thing on which i did any research and it was done in the vicinity of 1957 i didnt employ them thereafter its an interesting story in connection with that is i personally wanted to find out if i could audit this way and i trained myself within hairs breadth of auditing the cchs i could audit those cchs in my sleep you know put on the perfect tone 40 performance you know i grooved myself in like youre learning model session now you know and i found out when i used this i got tremendous and very worthwhile gains but it was used according to the old regimen you see now all the research was done all of the training of people on how to do it was done and then i skipped it and then we had an acc or two and we ran into modifications for some reason or other they werent quite as keen to do the original version as they were modified version students now i just give you that in passing because this mustnt happen again to the cchs the cchs work perfectly when done 1957 that was their nadir and that was it and it was cch 1 2 3 4 and they were done this way up in london there are some old tapes up there thatd utterly fascinate you i think theyre in the other room here all about how you do the cchs and theyre mostly tapes of dont alteris it thank you dont alteris it thank you dont alteris it thank you thats about what they amount to thats what ken ran into headon here the other day because we had actually good process system destroyed by about 1958 and it was less and less in use well why was it less and less in use i wasnt paying much attention to it and i was finding out that it wasnt producing the results before and now that we need it ive turned around and reviewed it and i find out what is now called the cchs bears resemblance any more than little eva did to topsy in uncle toms cabin theyre just not the same breed cchs are very simple theyre very straightforward you do all the things it says you put your intention into the pc you dont qanda with the things he does you hold actually his body in an exact position you run them close up youre not trying to do anything but increase his reality and his control you see cch means communication control and havingness and if you get this duplication this was the sneak factor i suddenly discovered about the time of the first saint hill acc this duplication so the less duplicative you are the less havingness the pc has interesting isnt it well anyhow theres the cchs now the security check proposition now ill tell you what auditors wouldnt do the world around what they wouldnt do they wouldnt be imaginative enough to get the withholds off the case ill give you an example of security check that was written at central organization and i actually ought to frame it as how not to win it says do you have an arc break with norma do you have an arc break with joe do you have an arc break with bill and pete thank you youve passed the security check one just doesnt penetrate reality to that extent while one is taking responsibility for it see one wont be responsible for taking the reality of this because its pretty grim asking for withholds see all right auditors were perfectly willing to make people well they were perfectly willing to audit people they were perfectly willing to work with the most confoundedly geewhiz cases you ever heard of but ask for that withhold well they werent unwilling to ask for the withhold they were just unwilling to be sufficiently imaginative to do anything concerning it oh fellow murdered his first wife you see the auditor would never bring himself up to feeling that critical of the human race you get the idea well maybe the fellow just beat his first wife you ask him if he murdered his first wife and hell tell you i just beat her see you can always overask question and auditors would not do that imagine it theyd sit there with their rudiments out their rudiments out their rudiments out their rudiments out well it was killing people i mean not actually but it was just murder you know guy was feeling bad and so forth the auditor never asked for the withhold so we had to remedy this because this was rather whirledaround condition and that whirledaround condition resulted in what when i got down to south africa i found that somebody had dreamed up security check on my orders down there to parallel the laws of south africa and these laws are very imaginative because theyre dealing with people who have extremely imaginative crimes and actually there were things in there that i myself wouldnt have thought of doing exceeded my reality but over period of years south africa had collected them in their law books oddly enough the south african security check heres joke on johannesburg contained originally single question concerning overts or withholds on the organization any staff members any scientologists or anybody else isnt that fascinating had omitted that 100 percent from the zone of interrogation and the people who were putting it out had overts really only in that field fascinating isnt it all right now i put together this thing doctored it up and called it the joburg 1st see but for very long time to show you how hard this one is to get into operation people will eventually wake up and use it oh oh they say you know youve been standing there youve been screaming youve been saying use it use nothing else but it now use that that is security check that is what youre supposed to run on staff members that is what youre supposed to use when you security check somebody you use this form johannesburg security check hco ww form 1 you understand and they say okay do you have an arc break with norma do you have an arc break lots of people would like to rewrite this security check and apparently the law is this on rewriting security checks it works like this if the person is permitted to delete or skip one of the levels of the security check or if you give it to somebody to take certain levels out that do not apply the person takes out the very withholds he has even though he doesnt remember he has them isnt that curious so you must never permit security check to be rewritten you must never permit one to be edited for special use you understand i learned these things by accident oh you want all the johannesburg security checks sent in to you personally well here are all the security checks on the staff weve only given one johannesburg security check theyve had it for months theyve got another security check got the idea so you have an hco policy letter along about this time of life that says the only valid security check and when we say the only valid security check we mean the johannesburg security check or by whatever name it may be called by hco ww and it will only be the complete form of form issued at hco ww got it thats how hard that one is to hold in thats interesting they will give security check they will learn how to give security checks they will ask the most outrageous questions as long as they are written down and are part of security check but then youve got this other impulse all the time that is going around little bit here and little bit there well its not necessary to ask this question its about illicit diamond buying that only applies to south africa and were up here in northern siberia i was speaking by the way as though i were in chicago theyre trying to pass laws out in chicago these days that everybody who is pronounced crazy by anybody that happens to know his name are instantly shipped to siberia i mean alaska did you know that wonderful way of get clearing up the political scene the only trouble is the people who are in power when they dream these things up never quite remember that someday theyre going to be out of power thats because they dont know theyre going to live another life too its very very amusing that all the legislatures and so forth on the laws they pass because theyre old men and longer effect them walk into their next lifetimes and are totally subject to all of their conscription orders to all their educational orders to all their child labor blahblah the whole lousy works you see and you talk about being cause of your own effect god help legislator anyhow in passing this security check is not an alterisable proposition so dont let people edit them and dont edit them when youre giving them you say have you ever done any illicit diamond buying idb well its even phrase in south africa do you know how many pcs weve caught in england and america on this well its fascinating you know because it doesnt fall on illicit diamond buying necessarily it falls on anything to do with diamonds and people the weirdest things they will do with diamonds they smuggle them and they swallow them and they now that question alone is left in there as bit of gag its to identify the check and probably till the end of time i hope to keep that question in have you ever done any illicit diamond buying just to identify the source of the check but very shortly this is going to become hco ww form 4 security form 4 and it will be called by another name be called by another name probably be called an hgc processing questionnaire see something very mild and innocuous but itll still be hco w ww form 4 there actually will be few more questions there will be whole section in there which could be at once applied to the student and could be applied to the hgc pc we found that an awful lot of hgc pcs hang up in processing because they get mad at the chief registrar or theyre discourteous to the receptionist or something and theyre just having an awful time this particular morning and we dont quite understand why theyre having hard time it isnt what we think they should do its evidently what they think they should do you see theyre having dreadful time and they start asking for withholds and they get fall and they cant imagine what dreadful thing this is and they find out the pc didnt say good morning to the hasi registrar see its withhold they meant to say good morning but they decided not to say good morning then they decided it was discourteous that they had done this you got the idea and they get messed up with withholds on central org personnel or scientologists just in really the relatively few days that theyre around the place because they come in you see on obsessive unkindthought automaticities see they walk in and they got unkind thoughts going off automatically see and its going brrrrrrrrr thousand miles minute you know unkind thought here unkind thought there and an unkind thought someplace else and an unkind thought someplace else and an unkind thought someplace else and golly these things get square across their processing line so it is in an effort to keep auditors from breaking their hearts and people from wasting their money you have to give full check there will be new section in it then that refers to students and preclears the kinds of things that they possibly might do and there will probably be section in there for the benefit of the field auditor like have you said anything unkind to anybody you know about your auditor you got the idea well you know youd be surprised how many things are going to fall and this auditor is trying his best and he feels good about it all and this pc is just withholding like crazy because he goes out in propitiation and gets even with the auditor by telling everybody in the neighborhood what dirty rat he is and that he keeps seven women under the bed he only keeps two now the only way you can make one of these things work is to clean things up at the same time youre using it you see its twoedged sword if youre going to be reprehensible about unkind thoughts about scientologists and organizations and if this holds people up then it should be we should be quite militant on setting it up so that we dont merit these things you see and this includes oh i dont know i can think of several dirty words offhand speak thinking of unkind thoughts theres been somebody crashing around the united states who has evidently since 1952 has been complaining to bitterly about all of the thetans that come in the night and pdh him and he has now gone on an all out in the united states and hes writing mimeograph sheets to everyone telling them that theyve been pdhed and that everybody in gods green earth has pdhed them and central organization members have pdhed them and ive pdhed them what conceit and ive shown you the little trick and actually written an article in ability in america which is probably out right about now its the sad tail of pdh and its how you can demonstrate conclusively that the cat has pdhed you thats piece of our technical training around here now so those of you who have just come in get somebody to show you show you with you on the meter that the cat has pdhed you the meter will say so if you dont know how to run meter or if you know how to run meter very very well you can make meter say almost anything by getting associative words in and of course youd really if you really knew meter they wouldnt fool anybody because theyd see the sporadic and uneven falls you see youd just association of words anybody will get fall on pain anybody is liable to get fall on drug anybody is liable to get fall on hypnosis and anybody is liable to have done anything to cat so what you do is spot the moment when hes done something to the cat and that was the date the meter will answer up as has the cat pdhed you you just pick the moment of the overt thats all and he could pick the exact moment on the time track of something like this as long as he had an overt right at that instance see if it clicks its marvelous difficulty is that meter will not clear will not clear on an untruth if the pc is if youre still youve still got an untruth and youre trying to foist off on the pc some untruth the meter wont clear on it but as soon as you put the pc through the jumps on this kind of thing why the pc clears on it you see all right how does person get in kind of state that hed run around saying all such incredible things and so on well he gets in that kind of state because hes had case advance without ever anybody pulling his withholds so countering the fact that it might be little bit embarrassing to have some of these things disclosed is the fact that if it isnt administered you dont get any case gain and actually will practically torture pc by processing him for long period of time without getting off his withholds in other words its very unkind thing to do to use tools that boost his case way up and leave him with all of his withholds because his withholds now turn in with responsibility to overts about which hes going to feel very bad he managed to stay sufficiently irresponsible and dadedadedadeda that they never bothered him bothered him and all of sudden he gets little more responsible and he says i dont think it was nice to strangle that little girl i dont think that was so nice i wonder if it hurt her you know and about this time he gets little more case advance and he says oh god you know but of course i dont dare tell anybody theyd execute so he gets another little bit of case advance and he says blawrrayea he gets another little case advance and actually he could get to state of where hed go be going around craving peppermint candy you have forced him into life continuum youve snapped the valence in on him youve increased his responsibility without permitting him to be responsible for what hes done and when you increase persons potential responsibility without letting them be responsible for what they have done more desperately vicious mechanism could exist in processing have you got it so if you dont administer good tough security check and if you dont keep that security check good and keep it whole youre just setting it up for pcs not only to not be cleared but actually to start feeling miserable oddly enough feeling miserable theyre better off than they were being irresponsible you got the idea and theyll tell you so too but you just peg them you peg their processing gain it isnt that you do something overt that forces their case down you peg their processing gain and itll peg right up to the point where they become responsible for some overt act in the past and there the case will hang and thats it theyve had it from there on and you wont get any further advance out of that case so one of your rules is is when person ceases to advance rapidly you just pick up mr joburg and start in at the beginning and run through to the end and you all of sudden will find out why yeah but heres your theory if you get all of his withholds off early in processing why you wont run into this will you oh but wait he doesnt know anything about these overts he doesnt even consider the things hes done overts heres this girl she has kept all of her brothers and sisters in state of total blackmail and terror the oldest girl of the family or something she locked them up in closets shes responsible for one of them now being permanent cripple and so forth and you give her security check and the first check the only real withhold that you get off of her is that at the age of about seven she thought that her sister probably wasnt as pretty as she should be and that falls on the meter but nothing else falls now the person has to be processed and you suddenly find these other things those withholds come off you process them again now youve got whole new array and by consistently doing this one against the other processing against the security check you have an indirect measure of the progress of the case as well as opening up the road for the case to drive on it because if the person doesnt have any new withholds you have laid large ostrich egg in your last few hours of processing see but if you find new withholds on case that werent hitherto disclosed you know youre making progress so dont say to yourself ah i must be terrible at security checking because after all i ran him on the general levels for about eight hours and so forth but just before that i must have missed all of these withholds look at them how could i have been that stupid in running an emeter they werent there because person has to have some reality on terminal or condition before it falls on an emeter and thats why you assess terminals is because you dont want to run terminal on which the pc has reality and when this thing reacts it says reality you could call it an arc meter and youd just be in dandy shape it says reality reality now you know whats wrong you know whats wrong with mamie zilch you know its her husband you know so you take right off and you dont use an emeter and you run now mamie now mamie youve heard of this process ow what have you done to your husband what have you withheld from your husband what have you done to your husband what have you withheld from your husband and so forth and mamie says lets see i i uhm i uhm i actually find the question very difficult to answer i really have never done anything to the brute he kept throwing down wells and every time hed back the car out of the garage hed call out just to make sure that i was standing right behind it so that he could run into and he used to write letters i never saw any of these letters but he used to write letters to all of my friends saying that i had venereal disease lets see what else did he do to you say the question is what have you done to him ive never done anything to him in my life you say wait minute what goes on here well what goes on here is very simple the pc has not taken any responsibility for any acts with regard to her husband now it doesnt matter whether the husband was good man or bad man you understand the pc has taken responsibility for these acts and so theres nothing the pc has done to the husband is real so what is the source and why do you come about with overts and withholds anyhow its basically theyre based on something getting unreal to the pc so the more overts and withholds pc has the less pc registers on the meter and youll finally find the pc floating here at 20 with totally stuck needle and they wont move off 20 and you cant get the tone arm off 20 the sensitivity is up here at 16 and you say to them gee you must be clear you know lot of people checking out clears very early rather tended to invalidate the state of clear because they didnt know anything about meter at all there was very little known about meter but it takes that free floating needle it takes that needle there that is going to when you first see one of these free floating needles theyre unmistakable ah its awfully hard to fake one i dont think it could be faked its just smooth flow with sticks and reactions you see well that looks an awful thats with sensitivity way down here and that looks an awful lot different than person at 20 and the needle totally stuck and you kick him in the shins and you dont even get drop of the needle well thats state of total irresponsibility thats what that state is because youre registering dead thetan in body that somehow goes on ticking youre just getting the body reaction well of course this pc is going to go down here to 10 through 70 theres 70 on this emeter by the way but it cant turn to it you once in while will find pc there and youll go nuts trying to get him on the meter itll be down here at 65 and then youll get down here to 50 and you get down here to 40 this is over long long course of processing and hell wobble around here for while and hell finally get back here to 30 or if girl get back here to 20 and there it is its the same reading all over again ah except the sensitivity is down and the needle is just floating and the needle is longer stuck okay but thats high state of responsibility now how can person take responsibility for his acts unless you give him chance to and if he does take responsibility for his acts and isnt able to communicate them to you he goes out of session he blows he doesnt finish his intensives he doesnt keep on with the auditor he gets upset about auditing all these various evils we have seen in the past are all explained by this mechanism of the person goes up and hits the ceiling and the ceiling is the number of withholds for which he has become responsible and that he cant tell anybody so you got to take out the ceiling and let him move up to the first floor you got the idea so heres the picture in other words of this new bulletin it just plays this mechanism about which ive been talking one against the other you give the person case gain with the fastest tools you know how and his responsibility is increased so you get off his withholds and the best thing to use according to what auditors will use and auditors have used is this thing called security check it asks them all man and if theres anything missing on it theyll eventually appear on it we dont care how long it takes to give security check because its an unkindness not to give one thats the story of this bulletin thats at the background of this bulletin perhaps there are person can run sop goals on person right out of an institution if he were good auditor he could actually get the persons goals and so forth now it might take him two hundred hours the pc would be advancing the whole time its merely what auditors will do and at the present time you dont want anything but routines 1 and 2 being run anywhere you dont want to see these things run anywhere including angeles you ought to send cable tonight saying bulletin is coming to you date soandso use nothing but routines 1 and 2 and if i catch you using any other routines i will have few bleeding hearts because i can now run out my overts im dangerous got the idea why because theyve proved abundantly that they can run levels routines 1 and 2 and theyve proved abundantly they cant run level routine 3 they have proven this abundantly some of the people who turn up here some of the goals that have been found on them man all you do is ask them twice and you cant find it in the back of the meter or the bottom of the meter or anything else and yet theyve been run on it now do you know what can happen if you find the wrong goal wrong terminal on pc you can liveup the whole prehav scale thats whats going to happen and this is one of the tests about the third time you have found level about the third assessment you give him on the terminal you have found watch that list as you assess it and if theres something on the order of dozen levels live eheaah youve got the wrong terminal the wrong terminal makes every level of it live look at the state youre putting the poor critter into the thing is so compiled that about four levels of it will be live anyway youll have four levels of it but if dozen up dozen or more are hot and alive on this scale its not theres something wrong with the rudiments its just something is wrong with that terminal so along about your third reassessment you could do check on sop goals but thats kind of vicious because do you know that if you only partially flatten levels on the general prehav scale on the goals terminal you know you can make the fellow feel like hes nuts he starts going kind of nuts well youre driving tenthousandhorsepower machine see and it starts feeling kind of meummm hes got level after level unflat you yourself can demonstrate that we had some auditor up here he was being coached over the telephone from saint hill running somebody once he had all of his data he had it all laid out in tape he could run it off like parrot there wasnt any reason under the sun he shouldnt have done it and you know what he did he ran four levels in an afternoon on one pc because hed interpreted the instructions which wording by the way never occurred in any instructions and doesnt he said he interpreted the instructions because they were written wrong well they werent written wrong i went and checked it out on all the bulletins you never find you barely take the motion out of the tone arm and then you reassess that was what he thought the instruction said it doesnt even use those words you could say reversewise you run it until the tone arm is barely moving but not even these instructions occurred in the literature and instructions he was given see he couldnt even have made that mistake its sort of whew now the assessment was fairly accurate and had been done for him he didnt even have to do that in other words faced with goals and terminals lot of these people sort of go to pieces takes lot of training furthermore the pc is so easily arc broken so very easily upset he advances so rapidly that his responsibility is rising up to point where hes got withholds by the bucket coming up all the time and if he isnt well handled with perfect mechanical approach perfect technical perfect trs perfect emeter operation i mean perfect well youre never going to clear anybody thats it end of lecture
