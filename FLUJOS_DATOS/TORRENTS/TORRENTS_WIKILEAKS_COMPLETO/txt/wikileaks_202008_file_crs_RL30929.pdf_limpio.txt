preview of the characteristics of workforce improvement act participantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congressreceived through the

divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929job training characteristics of workforce training participants summary in 1998 the workforce investment act wia replaced the job traini ng partnership act jtpa as the countrys major job training program specifically the adult employment and training activities authorized under wia title ib replaced the adult training program authorized under jtpa title iia there are number of statutory differences between jtpa and wia which could affect the characteristics of who is served under wia and the type of training they receive these differences include the addition of individuals 18 to 21 to the definition of adults under wia elimination of the jtpa income eligibility criteria elimination of the jtpa older worker setaside and the inclusion of new wia priorities for providing training to recipients of public assistance and other economically disadvantaged persons through the years congress has shown considerable interest in who was served in federal job training programs for example in the 101st and 102nd congresses the house and senate held hearings and passed amendments to jtpa that addressed issues such as creaming the practice of serving individuals who are the easiest to place in jobs and require the least services possible racial and gender disparities in jtpa services and how to best serve older workers as part of the main jtpa program or in separate setaside program in developing wia congress also expressed interest in issues related to targeting services to various groups this interest is likely to continue as wia is being implemented and when it is considered for reauthorization in 2003 this report examines the statutory differences between jtpa and wia that might affect participation by various groups eg public assistance recipients the unemployed in the wia adult training program this report also presents data for program year py 1998 on specific characteristics of all adult jtpa participants receiving any services and data on general characteristics of only those jtpa participants who received training services this data will serve as baseline to compare the characteristics of wia participants when py200 0 wia data become available in 2002 the program years 1998 and 2000 were chosen as comparison years because py1999 was transition year for the implementation of wia and py2000 was the first year all states were required to implement wia when wia data for py2000 become available second report will be written comparing the characteristics of wia participants and jtpa participants this report presents an analysis of the characteristics of jtpa participants that answers the question who was served in jtpa and provides the basis for answering the question how do persons served under wia differ from those who were served in jtpa in the next report regarding demographic characteristics py1998 jtpa adult participants were more often female members of racial or ethnic minority at least high school gradua either not employed or not in the labor force and economically disadvantaged regarding training individuals age 55 and older were less likely to receive training services than were younger adults and public assistance recipients made up higher proportion of those receiving basic skills training than other kinds of traininghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929contents introduction 1

partnership act jtpa programs by the employment and training administration of the us department of labor in addition this report benefitted from the guidance review and comments of richard n apling thomas patrick gabe and james b stedman of the domestic social policy division congressional research servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl309291this report focuses on the adult training program wia authorizes other programs such as the dislocated worker program that are not discussed here 2in this report the term economically disadvantaged will be used synonymously with the term lowincome the first term was used in jtpa and the second is used in wia but their definitions are virtually identical 3dol bases its assumption that the number of participants will increase on the further assumption that the cost per participants will decrease as 1 the programs shifts from continuedjob training characteristics of workforce training participants introduction in 1998 the workforce investment act wia replaced the job training partnership act jtpa as the countrys major job training program specifically the adult employment and training activities authorized under wia title ib replaced the adult training program authorized under jtpa title iia1 wia differs from jtpa in several ways that could affect who participates in the wia adult program these differences include the addition of individuals 18 to 21 to the definition of adults under wia elimination of the jtpa income eligibility criteria elimination of the jtpa older worker setaside and the inclusion of new wia priorities for providing training to recipients of public assistance and other economically disadvantaged persons2 through the years congress has shown considerable interest in who was served in federal job training programs for example in the 101st and 102nd congresses the house and senate held hearings and passed amendments to jtpa that addressed issued such as creaming the practice of serving individuals who are the easiest to place in jobs and require the least services possible racial and gender disparities in jtpa services and how to best serve older workers as part of the main jtpa program or in separate setaside program in developing wia congress also expressed interest in issues related to targeting services to various groups this interest is likely to continue as wia is being implemented and when it is presumably reauthorized in 2003 this report presents data on the characteristics of jtpa participants in program year py 1998 the jtpa data are organized so that comparison with wia data will be possible the data in this report serve as baseline for examining assumptions about who might be served under wia for example the us department of labor dol anticipates that for py2000 the number of participants will increase and that the majority of participants in intensive and training services will be disadvantaged lowincome individuals including welfare recipients3 4 members ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929crs2 3continued serving only disadva ntaged to serving all adults age 18 and above and 2 participants receive services depending upon need ranging

committee on appropriations february 2000 p tes74 4the wia adult program is funded at 950 million for py2000 which is slightly less than funding for the jtpa adult program in pys1998 and 1999which was 955 millioncongress and others may also have assumptions based on their understanding of wias intent and the effects of the changes in the adult program made by wia on who receives services this report also serves as preview of the characteristics of wia participants and can assist congress in its oversight functions until wia data become available in 2002 at that time report will be written comparing the characteristics of jtpa participants and wia participants differences between jtpa and wia wia differs from jtpa in several ways that could affect who participates in the adult program these differences can be grouped into three main categories age eligibility income and other eligibility criteria and targeting this section explains the difference between the two statutes in these three categories age eligibility under jtpa adults were defined as individuals age 22 and older youth were defined as individuals age 1621 individuals in this age range were served in the adult program under wia adults are individuals age 18 and older individuals age 1821 can be served under the adult program the youth program or they can be co enrolled in both programs income and other eligibility criteria under jtpa individuals receiving services through the adult training program were generally required to be economically disadvantag ed this term meant individuals or their families who had total family income that was not higher than the poverty line or 70 of the lower living standard income level see appendix other adults who were considered economically disadvantage d were individuals or their families receiving welfare payments persons eligible for food stamps homeless persons or disabled adults whose own income rather than their family income was low up to 10 of participants in the adult program could be noneconomically disadvantaged if they had some other barrier to employment under wia there is income eligibility requirement for adults eligibility for wia is based on the level of service received wia offers three levels of services the first is core services for which being 18 years of age is the only eligibilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929crs3 5there is however entitlement to any wia service nor was there for any jtpa service 6the criteria for determining whether employment will lead to selfsufficiency are established at the local level but federal regulations specify that the criteria must at minimum provide that selfsufficiency means employment that pays at least the lower living standard income 7up to 10 of participants in the setaside program could have been none conomically disadvantaged if they faced serious barriers to employment and met the income eligibility requiremen ts of the senior community service and employment program title v of the older americans act in addition in the case of jtpa programs carried out with operators of title v programs individuals who were eligible for the title v program eg individuals who had an income more than 125 of poverty were deemed eligible for jtpa 8states are required however to include in their annual report to the secre tary of labor information on the performance eg entry into retenti on in and earnings of unsubsidized employment of outof school youth recipients of public assistance individuals with disabilities veterans displa ced homemakers and older individuals this reporting continuedcriterion5 core services include job search and placement assistance labor market information that identifies job vacancies the skills necessary for occupations in demand and employment trends initial assessment of skills and needs information on available services and programs and followup services to assist in job retention the second level is intensive services which are available to 1 unemployed adults who have received at least one core service are unable to obtain employment through core services and need intensive services to obtain employment and 2 employed adults who have received at least one core service and need intensive services to obtain or retain employment that leads to selfsufficiency6 intensive services include comprehensive assessments development of individual employment plans group and individual counseling case management and shortterm prevocational services the third level is training services which are available to adults who have received at least one intensive service have been unable to obtain or retain employment through such services have the skills and qualific ation to successfully participate in selected training program select training programs that are directly linked to employment opportunities in the local area and are unable to obtain other grant assistance including pell grants or need assistance above the levels provided by such other grants training includes occupational skills training onthejob training entrepreneurial training skill upgrading job readiness training and adult education and literacy activities in conjunction with other training targeting older worker setaside under jtpa each state was required to set aside 5 of its title iia allotment for serving economically disadvantaged individuals 55 years of age and older7 under wia there is older worker setaside priorities for services under jtpa there was general program requirement that efforts be made to provide equitable services among substantial segments of the population under wia there is comparable requirement 8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929crs4 8continued requirement could be perceived by states as placing priority on serving these groups although the requirement focuses on the performance of the groups and not the number or percentage of individuals served 9states and local areas establish the criteria for determining the availability of funds and the process by which any priority will be applied the local boards and the governors may establish process that gives priority to public assistance recipients and other low income individuals and that also serves other individuals meeting eligibility requirements 10reporting information for the program year ending june 30 2001 is due to dol by september 30 2001 the data will most likely be available to the public some time in the first few months of 2002also under jtpa not less than 65 of participants in each local area other than participants served under the older worker setaside had to be individuals who were in one or more of the following categories 1 basic skills deficient 2 high school dropouts 3 recipients of cash welfare payments 4 offenders 5 disabled 6 homeless or 7 in category established by the service delivery area with the approval of the governor there is comparable requirement under wia under wia priority for intensive and training servic must be given to recipients of public assistance and other lowincome individuals if wia funds are limited in local area9 participant characteristics and training received this section of the report is divided into two parts the first participant characteristics focuses on all participants who received jtpa services which in general are similar to the core intensive and training services provided under wia the next part training focuses only on jtpa participants who received training services data for both parts are for py1998 july 1 1998 through june 30 1999 this year will serve as baseline against which to compare the characteristics of wia participants in py2000 july 1 2000 through june 30 2001 when the py2000 data are available in 200210 second report will be issued making comparisons between jtpa and wia participants the program years 1998 and 2000 were chosen as comparison years because py1999 was transition year for the implementation of wia and py2000 was the first year all states were required to implement wia the word participant as used in this report means one incidence of enrollment in jtpa program by an individual who received services in addition to an objective assessment of skills levels and service needs who received services in any of the 50 states washington dc and puerto rico and who left the program for any reason if an individual left jtpa program reenrolled and left again in py1998 that would count as two incidents of enrollment and consequently as two participants in the tables that follow individuals who are counted more than once in single program eg adult youth older worker setaside constitute less than 2 of the total number of individuals and are included in the analysis individuals who participated in both the older worker setaside and the main title iia adult programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929crs5 11in spir data books the term terminees is used instead of the term participants used in this report but both terms are defined the same way 12jtpa py1998 data can be found in the py 98 spir data book april 2000 prepared by social policy research associates for the department of labor under contract number k 59506008030 13under wia youth ages 18 to 21 can be served in the adult program the youth program or both programs since it is impossible to know which jtpa youth would be comparable to those served under wia they are not included at this point in the analysis they are discussed later in this reportare not included in the analyses of older worker participants in these two programs because under wia there is comparable group of older workers ie older workers who can participate in two programs the data for this report are from the jtpa standardized program information report spir py98 public use file made available on cdrom by the employment and training administration of the us department of labor spir includes data on all participants11 in the adult title iia program spir data are not sample of participants12 note on the definition of terms the terms used below to describe the characteristics of participants can be found in the appendix examples of these terms are employed unemployed not in the labor force economically disadvantaged public assist ance recipient veteran and terms referring to various racial and ethnic groups eg white black hispanic participant characteristics the following analyses of participant charact eristics are organized into three categories adults older workers and young adults adults for the purpose of analyzing the characteristics of adults participants in the main title iia program and in the title iia older worker setaside are combined in tables 1 through 4 generally dol in its spir data books presents data separately for adults enrolled in the main title iia adult program and adults enrolled in the title iia older worker setaside since there is older worker set aside under wia the data for participants in the main title iia program and participants in the title iia older worker setaside are combined to create grouping comparable to wia grouping of persons age 22 and older13 table 1 shows the characteristics of all jtpa title iia adult participants in general the adult participants were more likely to be female 68 between the ages of 30 and 54 53 racial or ethnic minority 56 at least high school graduates 78 either unemployed or not in the labor force 82 and economically disadvantaged 96 also about 31 received public assistance one reason why wia participants might differ from jtpa participants is that almost all jtpa participants were economically disadvantaged because this was an eligibility criterion since wia does not have an income eligibility requirement forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929crs6 14it is not clear how the elimination of the setaside will affect the participation of older workers in wia there has been long standing debate on whether having setaside for older workers increases the number of older individuals served or acts as deterrent to serving older workers some observers assert that providers or state and local policy makers perceive the setaside program as the primary way to serve individuals 55 years of age and older and the main title iia program as the primary way to serve those under 55 years of age thus limiting servi ces to the former group others assert that society in general discriminates against older workers and without setaside they will not be served 15the criteria for determining selfs ufficiency is set at the state and local levels the wia regulations set the minimum criterion as employment that pays at least the lower living continuedthe receipt of services the proportion of persons receiving any wia services who are economically disadvantaged may fall below the py1998 level of 96 another reason why wia participants may differ from jtpa participants involves older workers over threequarters of the jtpa title iia participants age 55 and over were served in the older worker setaside program which is eliminated under wia if the data from the older worker setaside were not included in table 1 it would show that 23 rather than 93 of the participants were age 55 and older14 table 2 shows the characteristics of participants by their economic status the 4 of jtpa participants who were not economically disadvantaged were more likely to be 55 years of age or older white veterans and employed than were the economically disadvantaged participants if greater proportion of wia participants are not economi cally disadvantaged individuals as result of the elimination of the income eligibility requirement participants might be more likely to have these characteristics while wia requires that priority for intensive and training services be given to recipients of public assistance and other lowincome individuals it seems unlikely that the proportion of economically disadvantaged persons served under wia would be higher than the 96 level for all jtpa adult participants shown in table 1 table 3 shows the characteristics of participants by their status as public assistance recipients the 31 of jtpa participants who received public assistance were more likely to be female younger adults black not high school graduates and not in the labor force than were participants who were not recipients of public assistance if the wia requirement that priority for intensive and training services be given to recipients of public assistance and other lowincome individuals has the effect of increasing the proportion of public assistance recipients served then persons with these characteristics are more likely to be served table 4 shows the charac teristics of participants by their employment status the 18 of jtpa participants who were employed were more likely to be white and to be better educated than those who were unemployed or not in the labor force since wia explicitly allows for the receipt of intensive and training services by employed individuals who need to obtain or retain employment that allows for self sufficiency15 it is possible greater proportion of wia participants may be employedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929crs7 15continued standard income levelthan were jtpa participants however the characteristics of the employed participants under wia may be different from those under jtpa because wia participants may be less likely to be economically disadvantaged technical note in the tables that follow there are some characteristics eg gender age for which data are missing but in table for any characteristic is the percent of missing data greater than 004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929crs8 table 1

there is comparable group of older workers ie older workers who can participate in two programs they have been excluded from this analysis of older workersolder workers table 5 compares the characteristics of individuals age 55 and older who participated in the title iia older worker setaside with individuals age 55 and older who participated in the main title iia program persons who participated in both programs are not included in this analysis16 as shown in the table the two groups were similar except for three characteristics the setaside participants were more likely to be female 70 vs 56 and age 65 and above 29 vs 12 and less likely to be hispanic 12 vs 19 than the older workers in the main title iia program it is possible that the older worker setaside programs engag ed in more outreach to older persons and consequently served higher proportion of older individuals and women it is not clear why higher proportion of hispanic older workers were served in the main title iia program since both groups of jtpa older workers were similar in many respects it is likely that older workers in wia will have similar profile for example wia older workers are likely to have at least highschool education and be unemployed or out of the workforce however regarding gender age and ethnicity it is not clear whether wia older workers who with the elimination of the older worker setaside will be served in the adult wia program will look more like the setaside participants or like the main title iia older workers regardless of which program the older individual participated in persons age 55 and older differed in some characteristics from the population of all participants as shown in table 1 participants who were 55 and older were more likely to be white asian or pacific islander college graduate veteran or have disability than were all participants in addition older participants were much less likely to be recipients of public assistance the elimination of the older worker setaside and the wia requirement that priority for intensive and training services be given to recipients of public assistance could result in decrease in the proportion of older workers served however decrease in older workers is unlikely to affect the characteristics of all wia participants since the proportion of all participants who are 55 and older is

were out of school while of those 21 years old 92 were out of schoolschool is not wia eligibility criterion but since 96 of adult jtpa participants were not in school it can be anticipated that outofschool youth who comprise 79 of youth ages 1821 would be more likely than inschool youth to participate in wias adult program17 in general the young adult participants are more likely to be female 66 member of racial or ethnic minority 62 educated at least at the high school level 56 either unemplo yed or not in the labor force 82 and economically disadvantaged 97 in addition about 27 received public assistance the characteristics of young adults are similar to those of adults shown in table 1 with four main exceptions that are in part related to age differences young adults are less likely to have graduated from high school than adults 22 vs 43 are less likely to have any post high school education 5 vs 22 are more likely to not be in the labor force than adults 43 vs 32 and are less likely to be veterans 05 vs 64 as with the jtpa adult participants almos t all jtpa youth participants were economically disadvantaged because that was an eligibility criterion youth enrolled in the wia youth program or coenrolled in the wia youth and adult programs will still have to be economically disadvantaged young adults enrolled only in the adult program will not have to meet any income eligibility criteria since wia unlike jtpa allows individuals age 1821 to participate in the adult program there will inevitably be some young adults who will participate in that program however the characteristics of the young adult participants under wia may be different from those under jtpa for example it may be that young adults with characteristics most similar to jtpa adult participants will be more likely to participate in the adult program than other young adults based on the jtpa data this would indicate that perhaps individuals who have graduated from high school and are either employed or are unemployed as opposed to being out of the work force might be more likely to participate in the adult programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929crs15 table 6 characteristics of

training may be provided to individuals who have received at least one core service and one intensive service and who need training in order to obtain or retain employment at the level of selfsufficiency see the previous discussion on eligibility in the section of this report titled differences between jtpa and wia priority for training must be given to recipients of public assistance and other low income individuals if wia funds are limited in local area in this report participant is considered to have received training if he or she received basic skills training occupational skills training or onthejob training table 7 shows the percent of participants by program who received training as discusse d in the introduction dol expects the total number of participantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929crs16 receiving wia services to increase as the adult program moves to serving any adult over the age of 18 and to providing services that range from the less costly core services to the more costly intensive and training services if this proves to be true then an increase in the overall number of participants may result in decrease in the proportion of participants receiving training as more persons receive the lower cost core services and fewer persons receive the higher cost training services while in general there may be decrease in the proportion of participants receiving training it is less clear how the proportion of older workers and youth ages 1821 who receive training might be affected by new wia training provisions there are several questions that can be raised about the proportion of these two groups that might receive wia training services these questions and those pertaining to table 8 could be relevant as congress monitors the implementation of wia they are in the case of older workers will the new priority on training public assistance recipients affect the proportion of those workers who receive training since relatively small percentage of older workers receive public assistance table 5 or will there be effect because there is also priority on training economically disadvantaged persons and nearly 90 of jtpa older worker participants were economically disadvantaged in the case of participants 1821 years of age what will be the effect of opening the adult program to them will youth who do not meet the income eligibility criteria of the wia youth program enroll in the wia adult program to receive any service ie core intensive or training or will those economically disadvantaged youth enrolled in the wia youth program who primarily need the training services offered in the adult program enroll in it for those serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929crs17 18to make similar comparisons with other

by program who received training and were economically disadvantaged recipie nts of public assistance or unemployed or not in the work force the percent of these groups that received training under each of four programs is similar to the percent that received any jtpa services for example 307 of title iia participants were public assistance recipients table 1 and 314 of title iia participants who received training were public assistance recipients first column second row table 8 18 as noted in the introduction section at the beginning of this report dol expects that the majority of participants in training services will be economically disadvantaged individuals including welfare recipients wia does require that priority for intensive and training services be given to recipients of public assistance and other lowincome individuals if wia funds are limited in local area wia also explicitly allows for the receipt of training services by employed persons who need to obtain or retain employment that allows for self sufficiency it is unclear however how these provisions might affect the receipt of training by participants who are economically disadvantaged recipients of public assistance or unemployed or not in the work force questions that can be raised about the groups who might receive wia training are will smaller proportion of those receivi ng training be economically disadvantaged because of the elimination of the eligibility requirement will relatively high proportion of youth ages 1821 who receive training be economically disadvantaged because most youth receiving training under wia will be coenrolled in the wia youth program and therefore economically disadvantaged or will smaller proportion of youth be economically disadvantaged because they are enrolled only in the adult program which does not have any income eligibility requirements will the priority wia places on serving public assistance recipients result in greater proportion of these persons receiving training will smaller proportion of persons who receive training be unemployed or not in the labor force because wia explicitly allows for the receipt of training services by employed persons who need to obtain or retain employment thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929crs18 19older workers participating in the main title iia program or the setaside program are not shown separately in this table because the number of older worker receiving each type of service tend to be relatively small however older workers who received training in the main title iia program are included in the columns labeled title iia adultsallows for self sufficiency result in receiving training services will employed persons also be economically disadvantaged table 8 percent of selected

skills training and onthejob training under each of four programs is fairly similar to the percent that received any training for example 314 of title iia participants who received any training were public assistance recipi ents table 8 and 378 of title iia participants who received basic skills training were public assistance recipients first column second row table 9 one new wia requirement that may affect who receives which type of training is the requirement that basic skills training can only be provided in combination with other training this requirement is most likely to affect public assistance recipients because they constituted higher proportion of participants receiving basic skills training than of participa nts receiving occupational skills training or onthejobhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929crs19 training consequently there may be an increase in the proportion of public assistance recipients who receive occupational skills training and onthejob

jtpa adult participan ts and those youth who could be considered adults under wia and the types of training they received in py1998 the report answers the question who was served in jtpa and provides the basis for answering the question how do persons served under wia differ from those who were served in jtpa subsequent report using wia py2000 data is planned for the spring of 2002 when wia data will be available the forthco ming report will compare the characteristics of wia adult participants and the types of training they receiv ed to the jtpa participants it is likely to reflect some differences that could occur as result of statutory differences between jtpa and wia such as the addition of individuals 1821 to the definition of adults under wia elimination of the jtpa income eligibility criteria elimination of the jtpa older worker setaside and the wia specified priorities for providing training to lowincome persons and public assistance recip ients in certain cases however factors other than statutory differences may also affect the characteristics of wia participants and may need to be taken into account these factors could include the incidence of certain groups eg economically disadvantaged adults public assistance recipients in the general population and whether there is an increase in individuals coenrolled in wia and other programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30929crs20 20under wia the term lowincome is used instead of economically disadvantaged but its definition is similar 21the lower living standard income level as
