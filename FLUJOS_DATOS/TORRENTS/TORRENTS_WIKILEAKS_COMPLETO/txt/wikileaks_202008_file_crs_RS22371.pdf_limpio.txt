interest rates does it signal an impending recession marc labonte and gail makinen government and finance division summary the cyclical behavior of the economy is of great interest to congress yet the onset of an economic downturn is seldom recogn ized promptly recognition can take more than year after the fact and is based on the accumulation of considerable supportive data therefore policymaker s frequently search for reliabl recession predictors the behavior of interest rates may provide advanced warnin g of an impending downturn following six of the past seven episodes in which the federal funds rate the interest rate used to conduct monetary policy rose above the level of interest rates on all maturities of treasury secur ities the united states experienced an economic downturn the exception was in 1998 following period of monetary tightening by the federal reserve similar inversion pattern prev ailed from mid2006 to late 2007 the easing of monetary policy in evidence since sept ember 2007 is consistent with efforts to forestall or minimize an econo mic downturn economic growth has been low since the last quarter of 2007 and some forecaste rs are now predicting recession in 2008 recessions and the pattern of interest rates the dating of an economic downturn occu rs after the event has happened the national bureau of economic research nber the nonpartisan nonprofit think tank that dates the business cycle for the united states often waits considerable period of time before it declares that cyclical peak or trough occurred in particular month of particular year1 furthermore gross domestic product gdp data are issued with lag and from time to time do not show evidence of downturn until the data have been revised yet the cyclical behavior of the economy is of great interest to congress it not only affects the position of the federal budget but could potentially be remediated by welltimed policy changes for example congress is currently contemplating fiscalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22371crs2 2 for analytical purposes only the yields on us tr easury securities are used in order to hold the risk factor constant the yiel d on private sector securities can vary across time because investors change their evaluation of their riskiness like private sector securities treasury securities have virtually zero default risk 3 in this report inversion does not necessarily an that the yield on all shorter term treasury securities was above those on longer term debt it only means that the federal f unds rate was above the yield on all marketable treasury securitiesstimulus package in an effort to foresta ll recession clearly there are circumstances under which the early identification of an impending downturn may be advantageous the structure of interest rates may provi an advanced warning of an impending downturn typically interest rates are higher on securities with longer time to maturity yield curve refers to graph plotting the yield on securities by maturity prior to each of the last six nberdesignated dow nturns 1269 1173 0180 0781 0790 and 0301 the yield on all maturities of us tr easury securities fell be low the federal funds rate the rate that th federal reserve uses to conduct monetary policy2 in the discussion to follow this will be referred to as an inversion of the yield curve why this is likely to be associated with downturn is explaine d below this means that the federal funds rate which is very short term rate as desc ribed in the box below was higher than the yield on all treasury securities both short rm and those whose maturity is some 10 to 30 years in the future3 it should be noted that the time that elapses between the month the inversion occurs and the subsequent nb erdesignated peak in economic activity is not constant the number of months prior to the peak and the peak have been 20 monthsdecember 1969 8 monthsnovember 1973 15 monthsjanuary 1980 9 months july 1981 16 monthsjuly 1990 and 9 monthsmarch 2001 although the structure of treasury interest rates has had good predictive record it is not perfect there have been two ec onomic contractions si nce the federal funds market was developed in 1954 which were not preceded by an inversion those beginning in august 1957 and april 1960 and an inversion occurred both in june 1966 and august 1998 with subsequent econo mic contraction the 1957 1960 and 1966what is the federal funds market for financial institutions to create money and credit they must have reserves these reserves while supplied in the aggreg ate by the federal reserve can also be bought and sold by individua l financial institutions whos actual reserve positions are different from their required positions where this buying and selling occurs is called the federal funds market and the rate prevailing on these transactions is the federal funds rate most transactions in this ma rket are on oneday basis so the federal funds rate is very short term this mark et came into existence late in 1954 at the initiative of private banks so episodes considered in this report can only go back to that time the federal reserve announces rate for federal funds and intervenes in the market as needed to keep the rate cl ose to its announced target level however this does not mean that the federal funds ra is constant through fed intervention the rate tends toward its announced target levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22371crs3 anomalies may be due to the early and limited nature of the federal funds markets and the fact that this rate was not then the ma in vehicle for carrying out monetary policy the 1998 episode the august 1998 episode is both interestin g and different in major way from the five episodes that preceded it during these five episodes both the target rate for federal funds and the yields on treasury securities we re rising but the target was rising more rapidly during 1998 the fede ral funds rate was essentially held c onstant at about 55 whereas the yields on treasury securities were falling during the anomalous 1966 inversion the federal funds ra was rising whereas the yields on treasury securities tended to fall during the period fro m december 19 1995 to september 29 1998 the target rate had been held in the 5¼ to 5½ range while the yield on shorter term securities tended to track the ta rget rate during this period longer term yields began to decline early in1997 the yield on 30year treasuries declined from 65 to 50 it is now accepted that this decline in longer term yields was associated with an international flight to quality following the financial crisis in east asia in the last half of 1997 and the debt default by russia in the summer of 1998 the us international trade deficit measure of the inflow of capital from abroad rose from 11 of gdp in 1996 to 14 in 1997 and to 26 in 1998 as further evidence on the flight to quality the yield on american corporate bonds rated aaa fell from about 7 in late september 1997 to bout 64 year ter the unrest abroad also unsettled domestic financial markets as the flight to quality led to financial problems at large us hedge f und longterm capital mana gement in response to conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets the federal reserve redu ced the target by ¼ percentage points on september 29 october 15 nd november 17 bringing it down from 5½ to 4¾ thus because special international circumstances rather than tightening of monetary policy played an important role in causing yield curve inversion it is not surprising that an economic downturn did not ensue in fact quite the opposite occurred the rates of growth of gdp during 1998 1999 and the first half of 2000 were among the highest of that long expansion but had the fed not intervened to add liquidity to the financial system rece ssion might have occurred the 2000 episode between 1998 and mid2000 the federal reserve began gradual policy of monetary tightening several of the federal funds rate incr eases june 30 august 23 and november 16 1999 merely reversed the eas ing that had taken place during 1998 to deal with the financial unrest however on february 2 march 21 and may 16 2000 the target was increased to 6½ from 5½ at th at point the target was above the yields on all marketable treasury secur ities moreover by july 2000 the yield curve on treasury securities was quite inverted with shorter term yields ge nerally above successive longer term yields the stock mark et as measured by the sp 500 began to fall soon thereafter in october 2000 as noted above the longest economic expa nsion in american history 128 months came to an end in march 2001 the subseque nt contraction was bot h short and mild andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22371crs4 4 see crs report rl33666 asset bubbles economic effect s and policy options for the federal reserve by marc labontethe nber designated the trough as nove mber 2001 at that point new economic expansion begun during the next three year s the fed reduced the federal funds rate target from 6½ to 1 and the yield curve regained its more normal slope the 2000 episode is thus similar to the ot her five episodes in which an economic contraction followed an inversion caused by the systematic upward movement in the target rate for federal funds events in 20062008 as the expansion took hold and the unemploym ent rate began to decline the federal reserve between june 2004 and june 2006 ex ecuted 17¼ percentage point increases in the target rate raising it to 5¼ from 1 the target was then held at 5¼ until august 2007 during this period the yields on s hort maturity treasury securities moved in harmony with the target whereas longer rm yields did not from july 2006 through september 2007 the yield curve was inverted since october 2007 most treasury yields except the 30year treasury yield have re mained below the fe deral funds rate the tightening of monetary policy that was completed in mid2006 was associated with substantial weakening in the nati onal housing market in 2007 suggesting to some observers that the socalled housing ma rket bubble was beginning to burst4 t h i s development was coincident with the crisis in the subprime mortgage market that also emerged last summer the federal reserve responded by easing monetary policy the target was reduced by ½ on september 18 and by ¼ on october 31 and december 11 2007 both short and longterm treasury yields fell in sympathy part of the decline may have reflected the shift by financial institutions to the safety provided by treasuries as the financial crisis in subprime lending spread to date financial markets remain in turmoil this yield curve inversion like those th at prefigured number of past economic contractions follows from systematic policy of monetary restraint by the federal reserve since there has always been lag between the inversion and the onset of recession it may be too soon to c onclude that the latest inve rsion was false positive if recession were to occur this time around howev er it would come as surprise to the vast majority of forecasters who are curren tly predicting moderate growth in the year ahead and based on the data available to date current economic growth has been strong core inflation is low although headlin inflation is higher and the unemployment rate is still near rates that correspond w ith many measures of full employment additionally the record level of foreign capital inflows which equal the current account deficit might compromise the ability of an inverted yield curve to predict economic contractions economic theory suggests that upward pressure on interest rates can be relieved by capital inflows thus we re it not for large capital inflows longterm rates might be higher and the yield curve steeper today since capital markets have become more integrated over time the dampening effect of capital flows on domestic interest rate movements may be stronger now than in previ ous expansions furthermorehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22371crs5 5 frederic mishkin now member of the board of governors of the federal reserve and arturo estrella have shown statistically that the yield curve inversion was powerful predictor of recessions between 1960 and 1995 they estimate that flat yield curve indicated 30 chance of recession in the next four quarters with very steeply inverted yield curve indicating 90 chance of recession they find it to be one of the best singlemeasure recession predictors available see arturo estrella and fred eric mishkin predicting us recessions review of economics and statistics vol 80 1 february 1998 pp 4561 this pattern has also been found abroad on study found that yield curve inversions were predictors of recession in all eight of the count ries studied henri bern ard and stefan gerlach does the term structure predict recessions the international evidence international journal of finance economics vol 3 3 july 1998 pp 195215this dampening effect may be stronger in the treasury market than among private securities foreign holdings of us tr easuries have doubled since 2001 with some foreign central banks making large purchases why does this empirical relationship occur this paper has reported an empirical regula rity on the relationship between the yield on treasury debt and the federa l funds rate and the subseque nt course taken by economic activity5 case can be made that there is behavioral basis fo r this regularity to understand why yield curve inversi on might precede recession it may first be useful to explain why the yield curve is usually upward sloping and why treasuries of different maturities usually move together consider the debt management choices facing the treasury for the next say five years it can either borrow the money it needs by issuing fiveyear treasury note today or by issuing oneyear treasury bill today and rolling over that bill when it matures in each of the following four consecutive years since the treasury would like to minimize its borrowing costs the rate on fiveyear note would have to be close to the average expected rate on oneyear bills for the next five years for the treasury to be indifferent betw een the two financing methods if one option were less expensive than the other the tr easury would choose the less expensive option until interest rates had leveled out this explains why treasuries of different maturities usually move together but it does not expl ain why the yield curve is usually upward sloping that is because investors are only w illing to take on more risk if they receive higher rate of return in this case the gr eater riskiness of longer term treasuries comes not from default risk but from in terestrate risk the price of bond fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates and bonds w ith greater maturity length will change in value more than shortterm bonds for given change in interest rates thus even if investors expected interest ra tes to be constant over the ne xt five years fiveyear bond would have to offer higher rate of return than oneyear bond to compensate for interest rate risk in order for investors to be indifferent between the two and this results in an upward sloping yield curve next consider what could cause yiel d curve inversion an inversion usually occurs as result of rising federal funds rate which is consistent with tightening of monetary policy the federa l reserve reduces the supply of federal funds pushing up the federal funds rate with fewer reserves banks are forced to reduce loans and sell other assets that shows up as reduction in the growth of money and credit andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22371crs6 6 of interest is the argument that the economic downturns following the business cycle peaks of november 1973 january 1980 and july 1990 were associated with negative oil price shocks the empirical relationship reported in this paper casts doubt on this interpretation it suggests that the contractions were set in motion some months before these oil price shocks by tightening of monetary policy for example oil prices began to rise in october 1973 january 1979 and august 1990 whereas the inversions first occurre d in march 1973 october 1978 and march 1989 also the nber dates the peak of the 1990 expans ion as occurring in july month before oil prices began to rise the 2000 episode is more complicated oil price rises came during the tightening but before the inversion and subsequent 2001 recession occurred ultimately reduced rate of national spending if this reduction is large enough it can cause an economic contracti on an additional incentive for banks to contract credit following an inversion is that the rate they must now pay to borrow reserves is above what they can earn using those reserves for the acqui sition of very safe ssets if longterm rates are partly determined by the average of present and future shortterm rates then the yield curve would become inverted if shortte rm rates today were higher than shortterm rates expected in the future this would ccur when the federal funds rate was rising if investors expected it to fall in the future for example if they thought that the higher rate was going to reduce gdp growth they might expect that the fed would be forced to reduce the target rates in the future to increase gdp growth why is there time lag between the yield cu rve inversion and the recession in this case because of the lag between the change in fed policy and the slowdown in economic activity that tightening of credit conditions eventually causes as economists are prone to argue the time that elapses from decrease in the growth of money and credit to decrease in the growth of money spending is not uniform mainly because ec onomic conditions differ when monetary policy is tighten ed it can be both long and of variable length this accounts for the variable lag re ported above between the month the inversion occurs and the month in which the economy reaches business cycle peak6 conclusion an ability to predict the future directi on of the economy can be beneficial if it enables monetary and fiscal policymakers to undertake action today that might remediate otherwise unfortunate developments for that reason economists sear ch for good business cycle predictors the yield on us treasury securities relative to the federal funds rate appears promising in six of the past seven episodes in which the federa l funds rate has been above the yields on all maturities of treasuries the american economy has experienced recession these six episodes all share in common an increase in the federal funds rate reflecting shift to tighter monetary policy th exception to this pattern was 1998 during the 1998 episode the yields on long er term us treas uries were falling in the face of fairly constant federal funds rate this is now acknowledged to have been due to flight to quality in response to very uncertain financial outlook following the east asian and russian financ ial crises in 19971998 the shif t to monetary tightness that began in june 2005 pushed the federal funds rate above the yields on all treasury securities until the fed began easing policy in late 2007 the past history of yield curve inversions and subsequent ec onomic downturns suggests that recession could be in the offing
