deceased federal employees who were covered by fers may be eligible for social security benefits according to the laws governing that program if the benefit that the children would have received under csrs would have been greater than the social security benefit alone fers will pay monthly benefit that in combination with social security will equal the csrs benefit in most cases however the social security benefit alone will exceed the benefit that would have been payable under csrs 2 this amount is indexed annually to the rate of change in the consumer price index cpi crs3 nevertheless because social security survivor benefits end when child reaches age 18 or 19 if the child is still in high school fers pays benefit equal to csrs benefit for as long as the child is unmarried under age 22 and enrolled fulltime in postsecondary education health insurance for survivors widows widowers and unmarried dependent children under age 22 who survive deceased federal employee who was enrolled in the federal employees health benefits program fehbp may continue to participate in that program at the same cost as federal employee if prior to the employees death these individuals were covered as family members under the plan death in the performance of duty if the employees death resulted from an injury sustained in the performance of duty the employees surviving spouse and children are eligible for compensation equal to percentage of the employees monthly pay this compensation is not payable concurrently with survivor annuity under either csrs or fers survivor who is entitled to both an annuity under csrs or fers and to survivor compensation must elect one of the two benefits the compensation payable to surviving spouse if there are children is equal to 50 of the deceased employees final pay if there are surviving children in addition to the spouse the compensation is equal to 60 of pay if there is one child and 75 of pay if there are two or more children if there are surviving children but surviving spouse the compensation is equal to 40 of pay for one child plus 15 of pay for each additional child not to exceed 75 of pay if an employee who was killed while performing his or her duty left surviving spouse or children compensation equal to 25 of pay may be paid to one parent if he or she was wholly dependent on the employee compensation of 20 of pay may be paid to each parent if both were wholly dependent on the employee if the employee is survived by spouse or children then benefits are paid to the parents on prorated basis so that the total does not exceed 75 of pay if an employee who was killed while performing his or her duty left surviving spouse children or dependent parents compensation equal to 20 of pay may be paid to brother sister grandparent or grandchild who was wholly dependent on the employee if more than one such person was dependent compensation of 30 of pay may be paid and divided equally among them if one or more were partly dependent on the employee compensation equal to 10 of pay may be paid and divided equally among them if the employee is survived by spouse children or dependent parent then benefits are paid to the brothers sisters grandparents or grandchildren on prorated basis so that the total does not exceed 75 of pay the compensation for surviving spouse is paid for life unless he or she remarries before age 553 the compensation paid to surviving child brother sister or grandchild is paid until the individual marries reaches age 18 unless he or she is fulltime student or if over age 18 and incapable of selfsupport until the person is longer incapable of selfsupport the compensation paid to parent or grandparent is paid for life or until the individual marries or ceases to be dependent the maximum monthly pay on which 3 if the widow or widower remarries before age 55 he or she is entitled to receive lumpsum payment equal to 24 times the monthly compensation payment he or she had been receiving crs4 survivor compensation is based cannot exceed 75 of the maximum basic pay for level gs15 of the general schedule the government may pay this compensation as lump sum equal to the present value of all future payments if the monthly payment would be less than 50 if the beneficiary is about to become nonresident of the united states or if the secretary of labor deems it to be in the best interest of the beneficiary to do so funeral expenses the surviving spouse or representative of an employee killed in the performance of his or her duty will be paid the sum of 200 as reimbursement for the costs of terminating the decedents status as federal employee and sum not to exceed 800 for funeral and burial expenses if the employees death occurred away from home the federal employees compensation fund will pay the expenses related to transporting the decedents body to his or her last place of residence 10000 discretionary payment section 651 of pl 104208 authorizes payment of up to 10000 to be made by the head of federal agency at his or her discretion to the executor of the estate of federal employee who dies as the result of an injury sustained while on active duty on or after august 2 1990 the 200 payment for administrative expenses and the 800 payment for funeral expenses described above count against the 10000 payment authorized by pl 104208 death of retired civilian federal employee spouse survivor benefits married federal employees who retire under either csrs or fers automatically receive joint and survivor annuity unless both husband and wife decline it in writing in which case the worker will receive singlelife annuity4 under csrs if worker receives joint and survivor annuity the annual benefit is reduced by an amount equal to 25 of the first 3600 plus 10 of the annuity above that amount in return for this reduction the workers spouse is entitled to survivor annuity equal to 55 of the workers full annuity before the reduction is taken into account alternatively worker retiring under csrs and his or her spouse can elect smaller survivor annuity in which case the workers annuity is reduced by 25 of the first 3600 and 10 of the annuity above this amount up to the limit that he or she specifies as the base upon which the survivor benefit is to be calculated under fers if worker receives joint and survivor annuity the retirees annual benefit is reduced by an amount equal to 10 of the annuity that would otherwise be paid in return for this reduction the workers spouse is entitled to survivor annuity equal to 50 of the workers full annuity before the reduction is taken into account5 alternatively the couple may elect that the survivor benefit is to be based on onehalf of the retirees annuity in which case the retired workers annuity is reduced by 5 and the survivor benefit would be equal to 25 of the retirees unreduced annuity the reduction in the benefits of workers who elect joint and survivor annuity is sufficient to cover only 4 to elect reduced survivor annuity or singlelife annuity requires the written notarized consent of both the retired worker and his or her spouse if the worker cannot obtain the spouses signature the worker can submit the application to the office of personnel management opm without it the opm then will make goodfaith effort to notify the spouse that the retired worker has elected singlelife annuity after which the application can be processed 5 under fers the spouse of deceased retiree receives an annuity rather than lump sum crs5 about half of the cost of the fers survivor annuity and less than half of the cost of the csrs survivor annuity consequently survivor benefits under both csrs and fers are partially subsidized by the federal government if the marriage of retiree who had elected joint and survivor annuity ends his or her annuity is increased to the full amount payable under singlelife annuity if the retired worker marries or remarries after retirement he or she has maximum of two years during which to elect survivor coverage for new spouse and the retirees annuity is reduced accordingly the election for joint and survivor annuity must be made within two years of the date of marriage to elect survivor coverage for spouse married after the date of retirement lumpsum payment plus 6 interest must be made to cover the period preceding the postretirement marriage during which survivor reduction was in effect6 this payment is necessary to preserve equity between couples who are married continuously throughout retirement and those who marry after retiring because in both cases the survivor benefit is the same percentage of the retired workers annuity child survivor benefits under both csrs and fers survivor benefits are paid to children of deceased federal retirees in the same amounts and under the same eligibility criteria as apply to the children of deceased federal employees retired workers who are the parents of unmarried dependent children who might qualify for child survivor benefits are not required to take reduction in their retirement annuities health insurance for surviving spouses and children widow or widower of deceased retiree who is eligible for survivor annuity under either csrs or fers and who was covered under the fehbp at the time of the retirees death can continue to participate in the program at the same cost as applies to workers and retirees the survivor is eligible even if the amount of the survivor annuity is less than the monthly fehbp premium in which case the individual must remit the difference directly to opm retiree who marries or remarries after retirement can assure that his or her surviving spouse will be eligible for fehbp coverage by electing minimal survivor annuity if retired federal employee has former spouse to whom full survivor annuity was awarded through state court order the worker can at retirement or at the time of remarriage if later entitle his or her current spouse to continue participating in the fehbp after the retirees death by electing survivor coverage for that spouse even though the current spouse might receive survivor annuity as long as the former spouse is living and receiving the survivor annuity unmarried dependent children of deceased retiree can continue to participate in the fehbp until age 22 regardless of student status provided that they were covered as family members by the retiree in certain cases coverage can continue for up to 36 months beyond the childs 22nd birthday insurable interest annuities both csrs and fers allow retiring employee to provide survivor benefits to an individual who has an insurable interest in the retiree an insurable interest exists if the person may reasonably expect to benefit financially from the retiree continuing to live for example former spouse or current spouse can be named as having an insurable interest if spouse survivor benefit has been provided 6 under provision of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 this payment can be made through reduction in the retirees annuity rather than as lump sum crs6 for one or the other retiree who provides survivor benefits for someone with an insurable interest has his or her annuity reduced by 10 plus 5 for each full five years by which the named beneficiary is younger than the retiree the total reduction may not exceed 40 under both csrs and fers the survivor benefit paid to the named beneficiary is 55 of the retirees reduced annuity payable upon the death of the retiree spouse survivor benefits under deferred retirement federal employees are fully vested in entitled to retirement annuity after completing five years of service vested employees who resign from federal employment before they are eligible to retire can defer receipt of their benefits until they reach the age of eligibility under csrs deferred annuity can begin earlier than age 62 under fers an unreduced deferred annuity can start at age 62 for those with 5 to 19 years of service at 60 for those with 20 to 29 years of service or at 56 increasing to 57 for employees born in 1970 or later for those with 30 or more years of service reduced deferred fers annuity is available at age 55 for those with 10 or more years of service if the former employee dies after having begun to receive retirement annuity the surviving spouse is eligible for survivor annuity under the rules applicable to csrs or fers as described above if former employee who had been covered under csrs dies before reaching age 62 and commencing his or her deferred annuity survivor benefit is paid instead the surviving spouse receives refund of the employees contributions to the civil service retirement and disability fund7 if the former employee was covered under fers the surviving spouse may elect to receive an annuity or lumpsum payment if former employee dies before having begun to receive deferred annuity child survivor benefits are payable although they may be payable under social security if the employee dies before beginning to receive deferred annuity the surviving dependent children are eligible for survivor benefits under csrs or fers as described above costofliving adjustments costofliving adjustment cola is made once each year in january to benefits paid under csrs and fers under csrs the cola is equal to the percentage change in the consumer price index in the calendar quarter ending in the previous september compared to the same quarter one year earlier under fers however colas are limited any time that the annual increase in the cpi exceeds 208 if the cpi rises by 2 or less the fers cola is equal to the increase in the cpi if the cpi rises by 2 to 3 the fers cola is 2 if the cpi rises by more than 3 the fers cola is equal to the increase in the cpi minus one percentage point the thrift savings plan by filing form tsp3 participant in the thrift savings plan tsp can designate beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom the balance in his or her account will be distributed in the event of the employees death if form tsp3 has been filed the account balance will be distributed in order of precedence to 1 to widow or widower 2 to child or children 3 to grandchild or grandchildren 4 to surviving parents 5 to an executor previously appointed by the employee and finally to the next of kin according to the laws of the state in which the employee resided 7 widows of former members of congress may receive csrs survivor annuity even if the deferred annuity that had not yet started if they were married when the member left congress 8 fers retirees receive colas until age 62 unless they retired because of disability survivor beneficiaries under fers receive an annual cola regardless of age for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21029
