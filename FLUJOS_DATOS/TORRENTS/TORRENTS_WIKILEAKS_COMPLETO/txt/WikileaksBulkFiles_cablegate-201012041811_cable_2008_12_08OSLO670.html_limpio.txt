jsf ref oslo 629 b b oslo 585 c c oslo 522 classified by deputy chief of mission kevin m johnson for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary after an extensive coordinated usg effort the norwegian government decided to buy f35s in the joint strike fighter jsf program instead of the saab gripen this first foreign jsf sale is an important step for the program as it will likely have domino effect on other potential purchasers the sale was not an easy one however and we outline number of lessons learned that may prove helpful as other countries make their choice end summary the tale 2 c the country team has been living and breathing jsf for over year following road to success that was full of heartstopping ups and downs quick recap of key events includes in 2007 the gon announced criteria for future combat aircraft competition to include aircraft capability life cycle costs and industrial participation in april 2008 the two remaining competitors us f35 joint strike fighter and swedish saab jas39ng gripen delivered responses to mods request for binding information rbi saab immediately claimed that the gripen would be half the price of the jsf over the spring and summer saabs promotion of its industrial package was intensive and covered every province of norway norwegian labor party leaders admitted to embassy that they received frequent calls from local mayors in favor of the gripen sudden onslaught of negative press during this same time prompted us to meet with lockheed martin to better understand their media strategy and to discuss the best way to counter myths and disinformation about the jsf embassy and lockheed martin efforts to counter disinformation reaped some apparent success ref b in the fall of 08 we invited number of usg officials to visit oslo to make the public case on why the f35 is an excellent choice and the private case on why the choice of aircraft will have an impact on the bilateral relationship see refs ab the delivery of norways first c130j transport aircraft in november 2008 which followed intense usaf efforts to rush this vital capability to norway and came directly from the usaf production line allowed us to make the unstated point that we are good allies and reliable partners on november 20 the gon announced the decision to buy the f35s using unusually strong language for domestic political reasons to say the gripen was uncompetitive 3 c following the announcement the ambassador met with deputy defense minister espen bartheide in very relaxed meeting bartheide thanked us for sticking to defending our plane rather than attacking the gripen he praised the gons bottomup process that focused on the criteria noting that while some politicians would have like to have chosen the gripen the overwhelming technical success of the f35 in the ministrys four scenarios made such choice impossible he complained about saabs but not the gos reaction to the decision for example the gon had never promised them 24 hours notice of the decision which would have been illegal under norwegian insider trading laws commenting on the press coverage of the jsf bartheide said that aftenposten the paper of record had gone off the deep end8 with its open antijsf campaign of disinformation 4 c looking ahead bartheide said we were now on the same side and it would be very helpful if the usg were to publicly stress the strength of the f35 and the viability of the jsf program confirm there was usg political pressure to buy the plane note the low price of the f35 is due to the scale of the jsf program more than 3200 aircraft and the timing of the norwegian buy in 2016 when fullscale production of the aircraft will be in full swing arrange visits by us officials to emphasize the above encourage us companies to enhance the industrial participation package the one area that gripen clearly dominated 5 c bartheide stressed that norways role as the second to buy into the program following the us was an important bellwether and would have positive impact on other governments decisions he noted that having socialist government like norways chose the jsf is an even more powerful symbol than if rightwing government of another country had gone first while the gon will not actively lobby on behalf of jsf with other governments it is in the gon interest that other partners buy into the program he expects the danes will ask for the gon data analysis and the gon will try to accommodate that within the limits of confidentiality the lessons learned 6 c while many of the issues in this effort were unique to norway some lessons learned may be applicable elsewhere the main ones include get the whole country team involved the active involvement of the ambassador and dcm odc dao polecon fcs and public affairs offices ensured that the fighter plane decision was an embassy priority this was necessary to convince lockheed martin and washington officials that it was important to devote time and resources on norways decision working with lockheed martinto determine which aspects of the purchase to highlight in norway the capabilities of the jsf vs the gripen were the strongest suit and embassy and lockheed martin efforts focused on discussions of why the jsfs capabilities were the best match for norways needs especially in the high north this focus played to the jsfs strengths and eventually proved to be the decisive factor despite perceived weaknesses in other areas such as the industrial package jointly develop press strategy with lockheed martin and collectively determine the role the embassy will play in this strategy use the ambassador to give numerous ontherecord interviews but also to have offtherecord indepth discussions with editorial boards on the purchase be constantly available to the media to discuss the technical merits of the aircraft and be assertive in refuting disinformation in norway there were many selfproclaimed experts talking about the f35 and making wildly inaccurate statements on everything from its lack of ability to its exorbitant price it was important to counter these assertions and our odc chief gave more than 20 separate interviews create opportunities to talk about the aircraft the ambassador hosted luncheon for retired senior military and thinktankers during which an extensive presentation on the capability of the f35 was given this enabled our host nation advocates to actively contribute to the public dialogue from their respective positions of authority embassy also coordinated with lockheed martin for attendance at all relevant airshows and roundtable discussions the fighter competition was consistently part of our informal discussions with mfa mod and influential think tanks talk about the impact on the relationship carefully deciding our line on this was critical given norwegian sensitivities we needed to avoid any appearance of undue pressuring which was construed as threatening8 norway in its sovereign decisionmaking process but we couldnt let stand the view that the choice didnt matter for the relationship we opted for choosing the jsf will maximize the relationship8 as our main public line in private we were much more forceful reach out to other usg agencies and experts to encourage their participation in the process and leverage their tools to support the effort in this process also ensure the same messages are delivered in dc to the partner embassy as are delivered overseas to the host nation government whitney
