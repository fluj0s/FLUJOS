posted here before they sent their kids to leelanau its part of the strategy leelanau wont change their policies until we make it impossible to do otherwise we need to make in their interest to respect rights like free speech and we can do that by hitting them where it hurts their wallet when parents read whats on this site theyre more likely to be suspicious of the schools claims ask questions stay involved and often times never send their kids to boarding school in the first place leelanau is losing money and losing parents its working weve been keeping track of google searches

httptwittercomleelanautalk the leelanau schools secrecy problem march 20th 2009 tags 3 comments for those who may not be aware this week is sunshine week national week celebrated by journalists and public interest groups to focus attention on sunshine laws the laws that allow the public to access records held by their government newspapers and groups across the country do variety of things like file freedom of information act requests and lawsuits against government agencies that dont allow the light of public scrutiny some newspapers black out parts of their publications that couldnt exist without public records and some write articles about government agencies that arent letting the public see whats going on i couldnt think of better way to celebrate sunshine week than to shine some light on one of the most secretive nonprofits ive ever encountered the leelanau school whether its hiding records harassing students threatening journalists or outright censoring information the leelanau school has truly done it all the first batch of documents is from various michigan state agencies they detail the schools registered agents and the schools articles of incorporation and modifications among other things over the past few years number of students and faculty have been upset to see the library turn into the lrc multiple bookshelves have been dismantled and hundreds of books have been thrown away i know this because i was an lrc aid and i helped them do it what most people dont know and what i didnt know until recently is that leelanaus board actually formed separate foundation specifically to fund the school library for the use by the school community and the public at large its articles of incorporation and information about it are included in this first set of documents the second release we have is copy of every leenews announcement from 2007 these announcements from school administrators detail activities that occur on campus and often the administrations views on them on occasion the school makes statements or commitments in these announcements that it doesnt keep the standard way to see these announcements is via teacherease but this isnt very accessible for one thing you cant search through previous announcements instead you would have to manually click on each one and read through it additionally the school is free to change any of the announcements they have put online this makes it easy for the school to doubleback on previous commitments these announcements also contain the names of students as well as other information about them for this reason we have told google and other search engines to not to index the leenews archive we also have number of announcements from 2008 the third release we have is information about lawsuit filed against the leelanau school for 3575000 from 1992 this case was settled out of court and we couldnt find any references to it anywhere on the internet the school doesnt want this information to be released because its stain on their record they did something that made somebody upset enough to sue the school and that doesnt look good to prospective parents these files only say which papers were filed not their contents if somebody wants to get on pacer and download them that would be great docket report docket summary the fourth release we have is leelanaus irs 990 tax returns for 1999 2000 and 2001 for over decade the leelanau school has attempted to conceal their financial situation from donors parents students and the public by filing their tax forms late using extensions other nonprofits dont do this unless theres something catastrophic that requires them to such as fire in the records room we now have enough tax returns to generate statistically sound conclusions about the schools financial situation and the damage caused by exheadmaster richard odell the school is still millions of dollars in debt according to the most recent tax return we have these returns also often list contact information for donors and the names of financial aid recipients if these donors knew what leelanau was hiding do you think they would keep donating what if they went on donation strike would leelanau change their policies if prospective parents knew the school couldnt pay the bills would they still send their kids there if students knew that their diploma might only be worth the paper its printed on in few years due to the school going bankrupt would they attend the pdf files have the images in them compressed to make them smaller if you are interested in the original scans please contact us and we will be happy to provide them to you were releasing this information for lot of reasons some of them are retaliatory were retaliating against the schools secrecy were retaliating against students who have gotten in trouble for having books or magazines the school didnt approve of were retaliating for the web filter were retaliating for the threats made against student journalists were retaliating against the backroom blackmailing that the school has engaged in to silence its critics were also releasing this information for something better hope that one day there will be nothing to retaliate against that students faculty and parents will be able to participate in school governance that donors will be able to make educated decisions and that leelanau community members will be able to speak freely about the school without having to fear losing their jobs or their diploma that people wont be threatened when they speak their mind we cant do this without you and we cant publish without your support we cant talk about what goes on if nobody tells us and we cant publish documents unless you help us get our hands on them we cant blow the whistle when the school crosses the line if you dont tell us about it the press wont talk to us if nobody is interested in what were doing if you are angered by what you read about here take that anger and put it into something productive something insurrectionary something subversive something controversial something fun something liberating or something progressive take it where you want and dont let anybody stop you at the end of the day only you are fit to judge what you do and if you do nothing the outcome is predictable these documents dont mean anything if nobody does anything with them take this information put it out there and put it into practice get involved with the school community and engage yourself adb time magazine and drug testing february 28th 2009 tags 1 comment httpwwwtimecomtimehealtharticle08599187684000html this article is for teachers but lot of these same arguments apply to students as well the school has lost lot of students so far this year and lot of this has come from drug use the random drug screens dont seem to be deterrent many of the students who were either let go or were sent to rehab went for among other reasons prescription drug abuse this article links rx drug abuse with drug screens and this appears top be true this weekend the school screened record 10 people in one day if drug test costs 44 dollars and the school pays all but 10 the 10 is charged to the students psa account thats 340 dollars that could be spent in some other way all used in one day this money could easily afford new working mouses for the lrc more posts to

dean of faculty but he also teaches calculus class and has worked as teacher and coach at private schools across the country in addition he previously worked as an academic support coordinator for student athletes at north carolina state university we figured its good time for us to do something if we wanted to try something different said ralston 51 who will relocate to michigan with his wife mary beth it looks like place that has got lot to offer national search produced more than 40 applicants said robert mcnutt chairman of leelanaus board of trustees the field was narrowed several times before ralston and another finalist were invited to visit campus he would not disclose details of ralstons contract he has been very deeply involved and committed to the residential life aspect of boarding school mcnutt said of ralston who lived with his wife and two sons now in college in dormitory housing at hill hes very missionoriented person and that really appealed to us this is the fourth year the leelanau school has focused exclusively on ninth through 12thgrade students who struggle with learning such as those with attentiondeficit disorder or dyslexia ralstons first teaching job was at private school for boys with dyslexia in new york state and said leelanaus work with similar students appealed to him schools regardless of their students learning abilities need to help all children find and develop their strengths he said theres this gem of school that it doesnt look like lot of people are aware of yet ralston said of leelanau getting the word out is one of the things i hope to do the school enrolls 73 boarding students and nine day students this year mcnutt said with goal of reaching 130 students since the admissions change he added enrollment has grown by 65 percent odell left leelanau to work as president of the pendleton school in bradenton fla private school for student athletes that he founded about nine years ago nytimes judge pleads guilty in

across some interesting files today the first one is an invitation from the leelanau school to ohio exgovernor neil goldschmidt click for the full version the other one is court document from the michigan state court of appeals referencing case the school was involved in heres an excerpt respondent also contends that the mtt erred by failing to consider the effect of tax exemption for the prince center on competing establishments in support of its argument respondent relies solely on leelanau center for education v leelanau twp 5 mtt 388 docket 96752 february 26 1988 although in that case the mtt compared the premises at issue with other private camps rule of law required the mtt in the instant case to make such comparisons thus respondents argument that the mtt legally erred by failing to consider the effect of tax exemption on any competing establishments is unavailing does anybody know what this case is about does anybody have copy of the case ive heard that leelanau has been involved in lawsuitscases several times before but this is the first time ive come across such information online as always you can send an email to leelanautalkatgmailcom we keep our sources
