6810c14 class viii tape 18 the new auditors code well here we are coming down to the end of the course down toward the bitter end of the course i havent done your folders today so i dont know whether you will leave clean or not you will be happy to know that the two folders which were offered in lieu of the examination on one of them the whole courses auditing was delivered by john purcell in matter of one hour to very well done very amusing on that one the pre ot said when he went to the examiner and when i started it i didnt even know if i was straightwire release and on the other one and on the other one i knew bug existed on the case one way or the other and i handed it out with completely straight face and what needed to be done was the full four rundown and i knew very well the case needed repair action before it could be done the auditor did start the session and then suddenly realized he had better do repair so he ended off did another cs and carried on with it also to get well done so very good now lets see what number lecture is this eighteen lecture number eighteen the class viii course sea org and the date the last time i looked it was the what fourteenth fourteenth of oct ad 18 very good this lecture starts out with rewrite of the auditors code i apologise to those who have gone to great deal or trouble memorizing the auditors code but you must realize that the auditors code was many many many years out of date because it talks about flattening three comm lags of equal length and so forth whereas we have moved us into different strata of approach so the auditors code has to be realigned into the field and area of standard tech it now has the auditors code now has twenty five clauses and is in different form its in the form of an oath and its actually hcob or hco policy letter of 14 october ad 18 which will be in auditor 43 its for you and will be issued to you tomorrow and its to all auditors in the world since it doesnt just apply to class viiis and you having copy of this can drive it home bit so ill read it to you and take up its various points its the auditors code auditors code ad 18 in celebration of one hundred percent gains attainable by standard tech it begins and then it says i hereby promise as an auditor to follow the auditors code number one i promise not to evaluate for the preclear or tell him what he should think about his case in session now that clarifies that the other one you could tell fellow he needed auditing but the word evaluate is very often gets in the road of an academy trainee he doesnt quite know what its all about so he just passes it by give you an example of evaluation thats not the cognition you should have there its well god these things do happen you know i mean these things do happen somebody doesnt understand this and wild things happen i dont think that you have completed the list because you should put drug fiend on it in listing and nulling i have actually seen auditors sit and suggest items for pcs list now its quite one thing to make prepared list and if its it and if it isnt it it isnt it but its quite something else under listing and nutting to suggest that the preclear put down three or four more items hes listing who or what has suppressed you and the auditor says you should put your mother on the list and you should put so on and you should put so on i know it sounds absolutely impossible but it has happened in the pastthe usual reaction to this process is so and so so now you should the manifestation which youre exhibiting at this moment is normally considered insane it can get pretty damn wild now this is best understood as being an opposite to what was laughingly called psycho analysis developed in the late 20s along with other oddities and the psycho analyist he operated this way he would say after hed had the fellow talking for one hour or four hours week for year to find out whether or not he could help him why the fellow would finally remember somebody who had suggested some sexual action to him which was the whole target of the years conversation when he was three and just about the moment he would think of this the analyst was supposed to jump up and say that thats whats wrong with you and now this means this so and so and it means this and this and it means that and that and that now do you understand that now if youre very careful after this you will be perfectly sane thats all see now we can enter on the long one which is five years at four hours week im not joking that was standard procedure that went so far and entered into this and when i taught i think it was something like twenty one psychiatrists something about dianetics in washington dc they were leading psychiatrists of that area by the way in the nation these birds listened very avidly only they could never get past the introductory lecture they didnt they didnt know that they didnt know and they were in very astonished sort of state and they listened to this over and over and about the third lecture which was i was just giving the same introductory lecture every night and they were supposed to then have some dianeticists who were going to show them how auditing was done and how you ran engrams and how you really did this stuff but they never got to that they just got to this introductory lecture they were sort of frozen state of astonishment and finally after three or four lectures one of these birds psycho analyist he went back out of the lecture and he went back and he used it god knows he used it hed never seen an auditing session in his life see but he used it on this paranoid that he had been dealing with for years and he came back and he was madly enthusiastic boy this dianetics really worked i used that return mechanism you talked about and i actually got him returned to an area where he was lying in his crib and he had dirty diapers and his father wouldnt change his diapers and i could point out to him right at that moment that thats why he hated his father what im telling you is actually word for word verbatim an actual incident now that sort of thing can go on and people are so used to giving advice and telling people what to thing that the reverse is quite different from what was normal procedure so therefore it leads the line not to evaluate for the preclear or tell him what he should think about his case in session and it is very necessary bit if you ever want to see some preclear spin its its on that one he can spin and that is why by the way in psycho analysis one third of the patients in the first month of processing committed suicide and its probably just this evaluation plug and then the analyst said he came to too late that was his standard response to this they always came too late i think if theyd come at the year of one year old it would have been too late what is not generally known about older practices is they did not have the target of making somebody sane they didnt have any of these targets they didnt have the target of making somebody brighter or more sane they concluded that person once he had an iq he had an iq and it was never going to change and it never would change nothing could change it and you would ask these birds what they were doing all this for and they really didnt know so you therefore find its rather difficult to understand them and the point of difficulty in understanding is very simple one its because you are assuming that they have goal or target of making somebody sane or making somebody better and they dont have that goal what goals they have god knows i have interrogated them many times the only trouble is when i talk to them they generally go into an hypnotic report of some kind or another they go gong and so forth weird they another practice that was in that field is most of their practitioners came from institutions and they would take somebody who was an institutional case and he would become interested in the subject and then he would be trained and that is was it now you think im joking but that happens to be the truth i counted noses on them one time or another in certain area and found theyd all been institutional cases and many of them go back into the institution after theyve been practicing short time that was what psycho analysis and what they call psychiatry and so forth was all about it wasnt question of making anybody better i dont know it seems to have been some kind of dramatization perhaps dramatization of r6 cause there is psychiatrist in r6 but i will point this out to you about this particular area i will point this out that the word psychiatrist is misused and misnamed and has been borrowed falsely and is falsely used so is the word psychologist that is false false name which is improperly used because the word psyche means soul in any dictionary and psychologist is student of the soul and psychiatrist is one who treats the soul both of those groups using those two terms at this particular time alike say in psychology they dont know what it means thats fact thats in the textbooks they dont know what this word means and they do not treat the soul but in the next three minutes of play invalidate it it came in with professor wundt of many year ago 1879 leipzig germany that man was the whole modern psychology actually came in with this fellow wundt and he said man was an animal and he had soul and they called it psychology do you see so the word is complete misnomer and they have right to it similarly the word psychiatrist is complete misnomer they have right to it nowhere in the world is the title psychiatry legalized that is not legally held by anybody they hold the title by reason of medical doctor internship and in most laws anyone who is permitted to administer medicine is permitted legally to treat the insane so the medical doctor who administers medicine is the only one who is actually permitted to treat the insane these other fellows have to have medical certificate the medical doctor by the way would very happily get rid of all of these boys he doesnt want them that is actually the state of mental healing as it is now it shows you that we have to put this in an auditors code right up to the front of the line that there have been fantastic abuses in this particular field so therefore therefore an auditor in training should understand that thing pretty well and i have found auditors being trained at level zero and so forth who had been over it who had read it who didnt know how you could invalidate anybody or how you could evaluate anybody and these fellows these fellows were doing it one way or the other now one of the ways of evaluation is by an expression you can evaluate by expression you can hold your nose or something you know or frown in some peculiar way and the preclear now knows he isnt doing correctly now the second one is i promise not to invalidate the preclears case or gains in or out of session now invalidation is the think level of hitting if anybody has any idea of what invalidation means its think level of hitting and instead of hitting the fellow you invalidate him instead of taking maul to his skull you say you are bum so its not very difficult to understand but if you go around telling people their cases are bad they arent doing well because their cases are bad and that they havent had any gains and so on you can fold them up pretty badly ive seen them very very badly folded up and ive seen where invalidation of case coming up on later sessions was very heavy hold up on the case now you can find other things wrong with person rather than to invalidate his case yeah you say well the reason you arent doing well is because your case is in terrible condition and why dont you get it fixed up very often husbands and wives will get involved in what they call scientology fights and start using terminology and invalidation of this particular line and so on and if youre very wise dont do it but particularly thats something an auditor mustnt do now three is i promise to administer only standard tech to preclear in the standard way that puts you in the running now i decided id give you some big choppers you know some big teeth that you could come down with now four i promise to keep all auditing appointments once made now the reason that that is in there is i have seen some cases have very bad time of it and i know of one case currently that is having very very bad time of it simply because the auditor said he would be there to audit him at such and such an hour and he drifted in late and this guy started to self audit and all kinds of wild actions have occurred from that particular point forward it is bad code break after pc has sat around for half an hour waiting for the auditor his case is so damned stirred up that there isnt very much you can do about it very often hes hes impatient hes angry hes arc broken hes this and that well the reason he gets this way is he puts his sort of his case on time schedule alright its supposed to be its supposed to be nine oclock and the auditors supposed to be there at nine oclock and hes supposed to be there at nine oclock and so his case is all ready to fire at nine oclock see and then the auditor doesnt arrive still nine twenty and the case actually will be found at this moment on protest or on blow and theyre actually very hard to audit when appointments are not well kept but you notice it says appointments once made so the reverse of it of course is damn it dont make appointments you dont think you can keep alright number five i promise not to process preclear who has not had sufficient rest and who is physically tired now the background of this is one time i drew coordination back in the wichita dianetic foundation tremendous influx of institutional cases were being thrown at dianetic orgs way back when dianetic auditor of those days got so that he could process psychotic standing on his head it was easy as pie as far as he was concerned they all cut their teeth because for some reason or other great many institutional cases came in and there was proviso that they shouldnt be audited by dianetics at that time and so the foundation did audit them and it was very bad show and it messed things up most gorgeously it wasnt that the cases werent handled oddly enough those cases were handled left and right and center but very often they were sent in as bird dogs and they were sent in to spin they had already received some post hypnotic suggestion under drugs that they were to go to foundation and then when audited were supposed to spin this isnt talking through my hat thats what was supposed to happen to them and we had one case where the parents of the girl showed up about forty eight hours later expecting if the money had been accepted and that she was being processed and the girl had spun and that they could then you know lay it in with an egg an axe well they were so stupid as to send in the lawyers check as her payment and this girl came in and nobody could figure out where she came from and she was obviously spinning madly and so sign up was done of any kind whatsoever they put the money aside to be refunded and sent the girl off to motel or something like that to wait for somebody turning up because they figured somebody would turn up and in forty eight hours sure enough her parents turned up wrath you see what have you done to our daughter to drive her crazy well you see nobody had done anything to her daughter nobodyd touched the daughter but she had spun not because she was refused auditing but because shed been set up to spin dont think that post hypnotic suggestion and that sort of thing was not known to these guys they knew all about this and ive seen at least two or three cases directly attributable to this now therefore every once in while case like that will show up now the funny part of it is not that theyre bird dog type case just the psychotic and you dont detect it after all youre not supposed to be able to detect it and these next two are the only times ive ever seen them spin so ive done coordination ive done coordination and that one physically tired and six i promise not to process preclear who is improperly fed or hungry and those characters only spun when they either hadnt had anything to eat or when they hadnt had any sleep and that is the trouble with psychotic they cant eat and they cant sleep those are the two things they have great deal of trouble doing and if you process one of them when he hasnt eaten and he hasnt slept youll have very bad luck indeed im not saying you should ever process one but im just saying whereas if you can get them to sleep and you can get them to rest and you can get them to eat something oddly enough they can be processed they very often present more problem than other preclears people are worried about electric shock the only reason we say anything about electric shock electric shock cases coming in its not that we cant process electric shock cases theyve been given the old heave back into r6 where electric shock is gorgeously advertised the psychiatrist is supposed to electric shock people he does in r6 see and the societys just dramatizing this dont you see well its tended to put the bird into r6 to marked degree and the rest of it is is he is already under some tremendous mental duress of some kind or another and very often still while you are processing him unbeknownst to you still under treatment and you get the wildest bingbing of mixed therapies which is also in this and so on and there just isnt any therapy involved with it its just method of punishing somebody its like the fellow who was asked psychotic who was given prefrontal lobotomy and he was exhibited to medical convention and somebody asked him on the side well what have you learned all about they were just talking about what marvelous recovery it was the guy was screaming mad man you know all this and the psychotic who apparently hadnt been talking to anybody or other said out of the corner of his mouth in reply ive learned to keep my mouth shut so anyway it is the sleep rest is the time hell spin now if you want to really put length of time in session process perfectly sane person who hasnt had any sleep for about twenty four hours youre going to have long session because the body is sort of an electrical machine anyhow and it starts to drain down anything he can put out and its its hard fight its hard fight it lengthens the time in session if hes had sleep and also if hes ever going to get into any trouble or make an error in the session now hes likely to make an error in the session and so is the auditor why it goes in sort of deep and its very hard to repair so the wise thing to do is to size up your pc has he eaten has he slept you havent well very good come back some other day when you have and that way you keen it up and keen out of trouble probably all the trouble youll get into with pcs is right in those two insufficient rest and they havent eaten if you were to process somebody in the morning before hed had his breakfast or before hed had anything to eat at all youd find out his processing reactions were quite different processing has something to do with the electrical currents of the body or something like this and fellow who hasnt eaten apparently isnt doing enough with his oxygen or something its ties up with basal metabolism and you could get very technical about the whole thing actually theres way you can test one of these on one of these meters if you ask the guy to take long breath while hes holding onto the cans and if you then get long fall hes eaten but if he takes long breath and lets it out and the needle doesnt drop dont audit him he hasnt had anything to eat or hes very physically exhausted interesting huh its just an interesting phenomena its not that the machine accurately measures basal metabolism or something like that its that it does react in that fashion did you ever see preclear yawn and then see long fall thats why you should put yawn in your administration also cough naturally cough would fall because theres physical convulsion with regard to it but you dont often notice that the yawn produces fabulous amount of surge well if it produces large surge you know your pc has eaten and hes slept very well in spite of the fact that hes yawning theres somebody yawning now ok those two those two when i see those two violated and so forth my hair stands on end because it means that the auditor who violates those two is one of these fine days going to wrap preclear around telegraph pole and one day i noted in an auditing session that the auditor said at the end of the session which hed apparently known all along that the gains werent very good because the preclear had only had one hours sleep in the last twenty four hed apparently known this the whole session and it hadnt affected his judgement as to what gains to expect he shouldnt have expected any gains at all but what stood my hair on end is the person he was processing had just come to my attention as once upon time an electric shock case in an institution brother he didnt know it but that auditor was riding right along the edge of that cliff in motorcycle at ninety miles an hour the rocks falling down into the chasm with every spin of the wheel nuts so best way to stay out of trouble in that direction is has he eaten slept good fine now heres the next one i promise not to permit frequent change of auditors the funny part of it is that you will find that after youve been through about three auditors on preclear he may very well get sort of nervous and queasy and the lower the state of case the more nervous hes going to get and he well wag just starting out he would feel if you gave him on his first subzero levels if you gave this guy three auditors in row hed feel hed have to get anything he was going to say off to them all over again hed have to tell each one about himself all over again and itd make rather hideously anxious sort of session does this fellow know or doesnt he know and then he would also go so far as to think maybe he had to do all the processes over again too theres all kinds of kooky things happen so insofar as possible particularly the worse off the case insofar as possible keep the same auditor now this mostly gets violated in review now let show you this oddity review gets the worst cases its only the case thats messed up and in trouble that really gets into review right so he has review on monday with auditor tuesday with auditor b and thursday with auditor c well now if it was all on the same cycle of action more or less he would find he was very confused indeed youve actually impeded his case gain and once more if you did this to psychotic without knowing he was one and so on he would probably spin so it is actually better in review if youve got three auditors in review or something like this or more it is better to wait till that auditor it is better for the review receptionist to see who was auditing him last time and put him on that auditors schedule and know when that auditors going to be free and tell him to be there then not to backlog him cause it can be done in the same afternoon this is this is just good sense but its something you should caution receptionist or somebody who isnt used to scheduling people and so on that doesnt mean anything to them they just throw the folders around this way and that see its something to caution them about now its not good enough to maintain on duty one auditor who does one session week just because somebody started session last year and you cant change the auditor its not good enough reason not to give session because that auditors longer in the organization thats not its not good enough for that well what im talking about is is frequent frequent change of auditors every time the guy gets list why he gets some different auditor hes always being audited by different auditor and next time different auditor you can unstabilize him and actually your processing is so swift these days that its very simple to schedule the same auditors simple simple simple and the only reason youve been shifting auditors around in class and so on is to give one another practice and so on and to that degree its tolerated its actually been too much done too much right on this class so that was number seven number eight i promise not to sympathize with the preclear but to be effective notice this is changed now masked under that is custom and habit which saint hill gets into periodically saint hill does alright lots of the time but every once in while ive noticed that amongst the students all missed withholds become arc breaks they wont pull missed withhold on each other all theyll do is run arc breaks on each other in other words as students sort of their mutual rudiments go out dont you see so you can ive seen this go and happen and then be busted up and then happen again and then go again so many times that its natural sort of phenomenon certain group starts to get sympathetic its what they do see so they smash up each others cases actually mazie ann day after day has had this howling missed withhold from her instructor her supervisor see day after day she exhibits the manifestation of an arc break day after day the guy who is auditing her pulls an arc break because he sympathizes with her because he realizes that anybody should be mad at that supervisor its on you poor thing basis and will actually go on and continue to pull arc breaks but there isnt an arc break in the lot its missed withhold and the person doesnt recover now if you start theres lot of this on record if you start sympathizing with the pc about how badly his mother has treated him or something like this or sympathize with his hard lot youre actually admitting that you cant do anything about it because the three cycles of doing something for somebody who is having trouble are first and foremost be effective cure it up handle it well if you cant cure it up and handle it you can make him comfortable thats the second stage if you cant cure it up or handle it you can make him comfortable and if you cant make him comfortable you can sympathize with him its that low grade an action so instead of sympathizing with mazie ann about how bad off it all is and how shes being treated and so forth and so on be effective maybe she is being badly treated well dont stand around and sympathize with her make sure that the ethics is in better in that area and if if its her well make sure she gets audited and somebody pulls the missed withhold you know be effective dont stand around on the beautiful sadness of sympathy when auditors start that boy you can just kiss your gains goodbye and your students longer start making wins in the academy or at the class vi course pcs start going up in smoke actually its marvelous method of putting somebody at effect oh you poor thing same thing as saying youve been overwhelmed same thing as saying you are the effect do you see you are the effect alright number nine i promise not to let preclear end session on his own determinism but to finish off those cycles i have begun that means that if pc blows the session the auditor is remiss for not finding noting when it happened the arc break and not handling it before it resulted in blow not noting and finding the missed withhold that is going to make him blow do you understand those are the only reasons pc ends session on his own determinism but the same time that precludes that the auditors trs are going to be sufficiently smooth so that he can even be understood and so that he is auditing remember it is an auditors code its very bad thing to let pc end session on his own determinism actually you can see an arc break coming that is going to wind up in blow for as long as an hour and forty five minutes before it happens doesnt speak of very alert auditor certainly its detectable ten or fifteen minutes before it happens it never happens suddenly and its flagrant session arc break which is handled with the list 1 so what the hell i mean the auditor wouldnt be very effective if some preclear blew session and then when the preclear blows session hes just left parked right there and its either got to be picked up by somebody else or something effective has got to be done in some other quarter and so on once in while preclearll walk out of session just because he cant stand it anymore there are silly auditor errors pulled by some complete untrained bird like four auditing commands which are all different all spewed out in row with the pc trying to answer one or the other of them and then refusing to tell the pc which one hes supposed to answer i mean the outness of this kind of thing on very very unprofessional coaudit level and so on can be pretty kooky and sometimes preclear would end session just on matter of self preservation but this understands that the auditor has within his power the ability to continue to handle and continue the session and it is an auditors code not an amateurs ten i promise never to walk off from preclear in session now this is one of the serious things that has happened from time to time the auditor simply gets up and walks off leaves the preclear sitting in the middle of an engram or an unfinished cycle or something like that the auditor gets up and walks off yes it has happened eleven i promise never to get angry with preclear in session now that i have seen spin pcs and its about the only time ive ever seen pc spin the auditor became furiously angry with the preclear in session he must have been some auditor he was up in spokane or some place and this pc this pc traveled couple of thousand miles in total spin to get to the organization and get the thing handled and so on but all that had happened hed just gone into rage at her in session she wouldnt answer the auditing command and for reason at all he went into rage arc broke the auditor or something but it can have very serious consequences twelve and heres new one it is i promise to run every major case action to floating needle gone is your old three equal comm lags and so forth number twelve i promise to run every major case action to floating needle and thirteen i promise never to run any one action beyond its floating needle that catches it both ways and the middle doesnt it number fourteen i promise to grant beingness to the preclear in session it doesnt say i dont promise to go on tip toe around whenever im around the preclear when im out of session let read that one again fourteen i promise to grant beingness to the preclear in session its modified its in session but i have seen auditors treating preclears as though they were still in session when theyre out of session and ive seen preclears sort of hanging the auditor with the fact that theyre his pc out of session its unfair and goofy in both ways and so on ive even gone so far as to occasionally tell preclear who tried to continue the session after the end of session you are not now in session and they sometimes blink and say yeah thats right i didnt say bug off but i might have thats in session its in session sometimes you get pc hangs himself around your neck god help us fifteen and this is different and new one i promise not to mix processes the processes of scientology with other practices except when the preclear is physically ill and only medical means will serve boy that is open to lot of interpretation i imagine but the net result of all of this is that before you could have misunderstood it to the degree that the guy couldnt possibly have had his leg set if he was being processed you see an extremity of that character could happen youd better have arteries tied up and legs set because bodies are rather inhuman things it doesnt mean that when preclear is sufficiently ill and he wont recover that you shouldnt process him at all doesnt mean because hes being given medical treatment you should abandon him ill tell you something funny in this particular field the original experiments way back 1945 the original experiments on this line determined that function monitored structure in other words function ran structure that was big lesson actually endocrine compounds like hormones and so on could be given to somebody well thats physiological i mean you know you can give him hormones and so on well he should have responded in some fashion to this and then after they were mentally unburdened of their problems or troubles it would work but it wouldnt work in other words the wild variable was that hormones and certain preparations and by the way it was undertaken with people who were just released from jap prison camps who had been starved during the better part of world war ii in japanese prison camps and they were coming in to oak knoll naval hospital and it was very difficult to handle these boys because they were very badly deranged they had been subjected to brutality the like of which nobody ever heard of and they werent really treated as prisoners of war at all they were just absolutely inhumanly butchered and these fellows were carrying terrific amount of mental stress so that on some of them you would give them preparations like amino acids which is the acids of protein so maybe they could begin to digest their food again or something like that wouldnt work you know wouldnt work damn little to do with it because theres enough coordination there they could imagine that they were associated so this this is interesting this is interesting from this standpoint because it brings you up to this one the guys on penicillin but his lumbosis wont cure up hes got pneumonia he actually can be on penicillin and it isnt handling the thing he isnt getting any better or hes getting better very very slowly indeed now he was so ill before he went on any antibiotic that he couldnt stir but now that hes on the antibiotic he can stir around little bit do you follow now this magic can occur now that he can pay attention hes not running high fever or something like that but he isnt getting any better hes come up just that little bit and hes stuck rignt there you can audit the engram and the penicillin works ive seen this ive seen this and done some work with this its the most miraculous thing you ever cared to see i mean the feilows been hanging fire for three weeks and theyre starting to step up the penicillin to million units an hour or something like this you know he isnt getting any better he doesnt improve they continue this is all anything you know and then just run the engram of the illness or put in his ruds or something like this and all of sudden wham all cures up in about four hours so what it is is sort of penicillin assist its reverse flip you say well you shouldnt audit person under drugs you shouldnt audit person under soporifics which are sleep sleep drugs you shouldnt audit person under those that produce wild eupnoria or whee whee hey day you shouldnt process him when hes on that kind of drugs for the excellent reason that the processing probably becomes part of the trip so you try to process him later why then it restimulates this and he sets into sore of fog its wild its kind of mess he has sort of processing engram you know and hes somewhat hypnotic when hes on this stuff so that you say to him something or other something or other hes liable to come out the other end of the session without remembering single thing that happened in the session thats expressly the type of drug i have people came around and say mazie ann has been on tranquilizers for fifteen years and does she have to come off her tranquilizers because she has petit mal seizures so that you can audit her i often think the tranquilizers didnt do her any good they havent even got her tranquilized look at her man what the hells the difference youre talking about some tiny thing as far as penicillin is concerned or stomach pills or something like that forget it processing wont do anything with it or to it or apart from it or anything it doesnt have anything to do with processing at all because it doesnt produce an hypnotic state doesnt produce lowered thing that leaves you at the end of the session with sort of scientology engram you got it alright number sixteen is i promise to maintain communication with the preclear and not to cut his comm or permit him to overrun in session theres one for you that puts it right where it lives boy it doesnt say maintain two way communication with the preclear in session nobody really understood that anyhow cause that wouldnt make much of session but it says i promise to maintain communication with the preclear and not to cut his comm or permit him to overrun in session so an auditor reading that has to find the point where you stop his talking without cutting his comm and thats an interesting one to learn and it is thing there is an exact point where you do this and its very easily seen and very easily understood not very hard to but if its not pointed out in any way to the auditor hes not likely to have much of grip on it hes liable to cut his comm cut the preclears comm without knowing hes cut comm you see alright and permitting preclear to run on for another page and half after he has passed the fn is just the best way in the world to knock it in the head number seventeen i promise not to enter comments expression or enturbulance into session that distracts preclear from his case now that covers about it all you cant not supposed to enter comments like yeah boy thats sure great yeah youre really doing groovy anything you know expressions includes facial expressions or enturbulance that means dropping cans emeters auditing report pages opening and closing drawers looking for kleenexes and so forth and it also includes having odd objects on the auditing desk its distraction it aiso includes making the environment safe enough to audit in it so that you know that the environment is not going to be interruptive cause thats going to enter an enturbulance into the session and this is one of the main reasons for false auditing report you get an auditing report looks ok the preclear falls on his head two days later this has been what has happened thats been what happened thats very heavily the facts now number eighteen that is to say the auditors entered without putting it down hes entered comments expression or enturbulance into session that distracts the preclear from his case alright number eighteen i promise to continue to give the preclear the process or auditing command when needed i have seen in actual fact the maddest thing ill add to that in the session i promise to continue to give the preclear the process or auditing command when needed in the session now ive seen what that exactly means is i have actually seen an auditor give the orders to run back into an engram and then shut up ive actually seen this not just once i dont know why and i dont know what they do and they havent got any explanation for it at all the guy never comes through with the second command never says go through the incident something just some freeze you know they freeze somehow or another ive seen it couple of times and either the person just went blank or was himself sufficiently distracted or didnt know what he was doing but boy does it leave preclear to scramble for himself two minds put him down there and hes got to get back on one and its definitely very hard scene on pc nineteen i promise not to let preclear run wrongly understood command now if he answered it as wrong command and then you caught it and then you corrected it youd be in violation of number one of the code youd now be evaluating he thought he answered it right you told him it was answered some other way so therefore it means that the things have to be cleared and they have to be correctly cleared you say what is the definition of that and the individual then gives you some definition which is the wrong definition and then you turn around and give him the right definition you are going at it all backwards and upside down so i guess you jolly well better have little old slit of paper to hand him and have him read the definition now this auditing command im going to give you is arc breaks and is for affinity and that means youre going to have to go into the business of training some preclears itd be nice to have little book that explains all of these words wouldnt it this is what it means now when you catch up on your homework preclear i will audit you now the only difficulty with that is after the guy read the book he has some fns while he was reading it so youd have to check for it if that happened but that is one of the major sources of auditing gain pc didnt know what the hell he was being asked see he had the words and totally evaluated some other way they were weighted you know he had the weight of the words all different its like the childs dictionary comes up and says source is the starting place he couldnt run the process on that source is not the starting place it would be the point of origin or it would be the originator or where something was begun or dreamed up or mocked up and then guy could run it so source becomes thing that doesnt have starting place well thats race horse wandering around in the pasture he isnt at the starting gate dont you see its easy ok twenty so the way to get around that nineteen on the wrongly understood command and you notice its wrongly understood command is bring your preclear up right i wouldnt even bother to bring him up right in session id say study all these definitions so i can audit you now for years weve had to educate preclears only nobody ever admitted it have to educate him into whats going to happen what hes supposed to say what hes supposed to do and so on when you dont do this i see some of these preclears running around being psycho analytic subjects i have actually had i have actually had somebody sit down in the session and start to run psycho analytic session on not psychoanalytic session psycho analytic i dont know what the hell they call it orgy wing ding actually and they start to tell you about their not just even the words theyre using well when i was little child i did have an awful lot of trouble we had lot of hired men around and about the place and each one of them violated in turn there was joe bill pete tom oscar now you see now these and id say whats going on well dont you want to know all about this and so forth and id say i dont want to know anything about it have you ever told anybody else about these thing oh yes we always talk about these things whos we and my psycho analyst very good do you remember time when you first heard that you should have some psycho analysis thats very good what was the date of that very good alright now what is the duration of the period very good i never i never monkey with it boy i never monkey with it that is former therapy getting in your road and it would read on your seven resistive cases well you dont let anybody act like that in session either educate them or scan it out boy it does take the cooperation of the preclear i dont know if youve ever noticed that about auditing then there was the auditor who was the only one in session who ever got any gains laughter alright and heres another one i promise to estimate the current case state of preclear only by standard case supervision data and not to diverge because of some imagined difference in the case now im putting weepons weapons into your hands the weapons alright twenty two i promise never to use the secrets of preclear divulged in session for punishment or personal gain now you know the old one of that there is never use scientology for personal gain but id see auditors all over the place getting rich and everything and organization getting rich so it cant be well interpreted but this is what people worry about now you will probably see somewhere over in an ethics code appear another one person who knowingly waits until hes in session to divulge evidence of crime is culpable because then youll find nobodys ever confessing unless hes in session but anyway regardless of that this is what people worry about they worry about the world worries about this they think that if we have such power that we can get information out of people like this they actually have had reporters and things mention it to very recently what about all those hundred and thousands of cases you have at saint hill and all those tremendous secrets you have on people and all of this kind of thing so they worry about it they think people are entitled to their secrets in actual fact i wouldnt give you two bits for the whole collected lot you know man has lot of crime mixed up with vanity some pc see that comes in and boy he gives you this long criminal record and so on i feel like asking him sometimes are you bragging or confessing you know its the truth because its not worth all that its not worth all that only in their zone and area it is we have become more blase imagine though imagine though in the nineteenth century how fellow was made guilty his entire life because he had once seen photograph of lady who was naked to the waist this corrupted his entire life i dont know the main thing about it is see the value of the withhold is this and we could be jumped on for this so ive included it in the auditors code thats the only reason its there we actually dont do anything about it actually there was one hell of crime committed not too very long ago and it wasnt owned up to and it was admitted in session actually nothing happened to the fellow he was not punished for it in any way now goes the continued story he wasnt punished for it in any way nobody did anything to him and so on do you know that he went ahead and tried to knock himself off he then tried to mete out his own punishment in the thing and right this minute is in hospital having undergone an operation he didnt need he was getting well and it all traces back to waiting until he was in session to admit to crime punishment was given him of any kind whatsoever it was very heinous crime punishment was meted out so he started meting it out himself and thats what hes doing right this minute and there is other explanation to it its not guilt complex its bust hes making sure he gets his throat cut for it cause he knows dog gone well it should have been but it was handed out in session well the world worries about this what happens to this and i have actually seen pc actually made very very ill where his auditor suddenly trying to make him guilty in session for what hes doing and i have seen pc folded up for being charged for something which was divulged in session and it after all the auditors code is an attempt to maximize case gain we now know this we now know that it is only where tech is out that ethics has to go in you got it you get tech in on the guy why its silly to try to get in ethics why its reverse end to alright number twenty three i promise to see that any fee received for processing is refunded if the preclear is dissatisfied and demands it within three months after the processing the only condition being that he may not again be processed or trained now weve had this custom for some time but it might as well appear in the auditors code because lot of auditors are not bound by this its wild one actually because the truth of the matter is is every time that i have been around and somebody was talking about money being refunded not on any auditing i was doing but money should be refunded for the training or processing or something like that and you gave it back to them without even this last qualification that he may not be trained or processed again and so on its very very rare that the person will take it back ive stood around and gone to hell of fuss to make sure that somebodys money was refunded and it was almost impossible to do and when it was done and so forth why they went around sort of hang dog and sheepish about it and it made mess but this is something other profession could do this is something nobody else on the planet would dare do the manufacturer is forced to do it with his products but nobody in the field of healing has had enough answers so its total dare now if we have that in the auditors code we can start to insist that it be practiced in the field of medicine and we can hold it up as something wh ah is applicable to professional ethics in general and it could go so far as well if the patient dies there is reason why the family should receive medical bill of course it is fantastic propaganda weapon and the truth of the matter is youre far better off to do this youre far better off if you were individually practicing and some pc comes in and says that didnt do any good whatsoever youre probably practicing on somebody who is pts who is connected up messed up she or he is seven resistive case to begin with theyre not going to do you any good at all anywhere the best thing to do is just promptly say alright sign this waiver that youre not supposed to be trained or processed again anyplace good here is your dodo right now bong you find the persons wait minute in the first place they do it sometimes just trying to get even with you they got missed withhold or something of this sort so theyre trying to get even with you somehow and they dont mean it the number of people who would accept their money back on the condition they were never trained or processed again are so few but it is not something another profession could do they wouldnt dare all the moneyd have to be returned you actually can throw that down the throats of people legislatively when other professions are willing to adopt clause of this particular character then they can talk about being ethical until then they had better not talk about us defense line and if all auditors stood back of that as defense line it would be very good one indeed now twenty four i promise not to advocate scientology only to cure illness or only to treat the insane knowing well it was intended for spiritual gain thats actually not to get anybody off the hook and not to agree with any laws or anything else its boy do you go in the soup when you try to go any other distance than for gain for the individual himself ok and number twenty five is i promise to cooperate fully with the legal organizations of dianetics and scientology as developed by l ron hubbard in safeguarding the ethical use and practice of the subject according to the basics of standard tech that should straighten out lot of it so that is the new auditors code good bad or indifferent right now there is code of reform which is being put together but that would be the code of scientologist and i dont know what results are coming in on this on code of reform but it is very interesting project which will probably be adventured upon again somewhere up the line and the project is writing every prominent man or every professional man in the entire community giving him description of dianetics and scientology of the various things it has done and oppositions it has met and what it can do and asking him for his advice in the usages to which it could be placed and asking him for any recommendations hed have as reform of its practice and theres some fantastic number of these things being mailed out theres about oh i dont know theres about three million or something like that in the united states and some vast number in other areas and the net result of all of this will eventually be codified into code of reform but it will be the code of scientologist or in practices or organizations and very doubtful if anything would be added to the auditors code it just sort of blows the criticism thats been going around and at any time you find the subjects under criticism it is very good approach say ok what do you want changed nobody can complain about that the auditors code which you have been going by of course is fundamentally correct and as you see it has not actually been invalidated its been put in different form and it has been brought up to date so that the floating needle and so on is included in that alright so much for that i hope you agree wist that i very good now there is its one thing to freeze subject guy by the name of augustus whose real name was i think octavius whose real name was probably bastardus or who was kicking around about the time of cleopatra or something anyhow he was all mixed up with some jerk some epileptic by the name of caesar its all sort of confused in mind at the particular time because i wasnt in rome at the time but this bird augustus he called himself which meant top dog or something he froze the boundaries he froze the boundaries of the roman empire and he said rome hereafter must not expand and hes the man who killed rome all you have to do is say in this universe something may not expand and from that particular moment on it stagnates and will eventually fail and fall which was woeful fact actually he said every eldest had to serve in the footsteps of his father so that nobody could get out of any profession his father was in the boundaries of the empire must not expand any further than they are but we will hold it at that point of course immediately it started to crumble he had lot to say it is very very bad thing to totally freeze something in this particular universe now ill point out to you that what we know however we still know and that is that we know the basics as we come up the line it is absolutely amazing how little this auditors code has changed in fifteen years but here is this minor change it is adapted to the increase of technology the net result of an unchanging absolutely never to be varied situation is of course stagnation but something can continue all the way from standard basics in other words you can have certain standard basics and develop on top of those basics more can be found out about what you already know we have an already workable path that path is very workable it is very swift i reserve and i wish to impress this upon class viii student i reserve the right to release further advances of technology i can assure you that they are not going to invalidate the things you already know now because everything which has been developed has been developed forward along the exact lines which you see them in now but let give you an example this morning i was doing the research on 8 and i was very fascinated with horrible circumstance whicn took place and i immediately checked it up with two other auditors that i respect on the ship and i checked it up with these auditors as to whether or not theyd ever really seen this phenomena and all of sudden an explanation fell out of the hat about something and i found out they had both been wondering about this also and i collided with it because somebody sent new emeter and it is not new emeter in design it is simply that somebody changed the manufacturer and the new manufacturer before he can release or before they could accent this meter i of course have to give pass on it well i had actually already given pass on it i hadnt been able to detect any vast difference in this meter but i had noticed that the needle of the meter was tiny bit thinner and probably the movement of the meter itself might have been little bit smaller than in other meters but i had not noticed anything more than the fact that the meter was very lively it was lively its more lively than the original mark iv so i hadnt paid any attention to this and yesterday my meter ran down or had to get charged up or something like this and somebody put this other meter which is the prototype its not the meter which i would normally use anyway it was the prototype and they put up the prototype on my desk for my use for checking something out and what do you know i turned the thing on and i checked over something and i thought you know that should be release point of that action and i got an rs i got wild rock slam now i looked at this meter again and it wasnt tuned up in any peculiar way but i suddenly recognized why i hadnt been aware of it before id turned it on and used it that it had l terribly faint light very very thin needle which is off pattern dont you see and so i looked at this and i thought what am i looking at here why should i rs this is sort of mad and so i said i better check out if theres been an invalidation because rs invalidation they go together so i checked out and sure enough there was tremendous read on an invalidation and i thought thats really remarkable but if its tremendous read on the invalidation why doesnt it rs so i went and synthesized again the exact point and situation on the track which had made it rs and it held for moment and then it rsed again and i suddenly realized that invalidation would read of course it was float it was floating needle it was floating needle and the invalidation was id invalidated floating needle but on this very very light meter with this very light needle with my case section where it is ive stopped floating i rs i get hair dial wide rs and what it is is reverse rocket read the rs begins with rocket read which is backwards from right to left and i get backwards rocket read as it pops it pops like that and then pops the other way and thats all it is its just its quite remarkable but it took different meter to demonstrate the thing and so i asked one of the other auditors and he said oh yes and i said what cases have you seen something like this on and one was 3 and one was an ot 6 an ot 3 an ot 6 alright now the datum that suddenly emerges here this meter was tuned up rather more sensitive than meter normally is and was in itself much livelier meter so if you were to turn up standard meter to maybe one hundred and twenty eight on its sensitivity switch knob and then to tune it up to four or five or something in that particular range in the ot sections i think you will find out that you get your floats become reverse rocket reads and if youll watch this carefully there wont be any doubt in your mind about float in the upper sections now to give you little more data on this found out recently that auditors didnt seem to know that after an individual was clear that his thoughts read on meter and you notice its only recently that we have had to do anything about this the thoughts read on the meter you ask the fellow some question on the meter all he says you know on green form and all he says is to himself is i dont think that i says this to himself and you get long surge pow now an auditor who didnt know this but in auditing preot he would think the thing read so actually what you have to do on anybody above clear is you have to be wary of the fact is their thinks read matter what they think itll read particularly if theyre thinking against something if theyre thinking negative of some kind or another up against the bank or against the auditor or against the meter or something like this you will get read so that makes case above clear actually some cases down at grade four this lively but very few but lot of auditors would just keep on buying this you see from clear on up that every time they had read that was positive you could wreck cases that way so were having to teach people how to get in suppress and false and because auditors have done this in the past good thing to get in false reads and it cleans up lot of cases right alright now we have had case or two in the upper ot sections recently who have appeared before the examiner with wide wild rs and to show you how odd this is we have somebody who was comm eved because he rsed on something and in case was it an rs there is such thing as an rs but it is not what we think it is float at certain high case level with certain tune up of sensitivity actually behaves at an accelerated line it looks like an rs now the least you could tell about it even with an ordinary meter is the person should start rocket reading and reverse this is sort of pop the needle pops backwards from right to left and you can usually really tell if you tune up your meter right why your floats become absolutely unmistakable because they begin with pop now as the guy goes on up the lines this phenomenon begins to increase and if your meter is already set up to read this pop why if you were auditing somebody at ot 7 or ot 8 i can assure you that his float would be rock slam well in supervising your folders and so on i have learned some new things and so on ill continue to learn them ill continue to publish them and ill continue to make sure that you receive them i dont expect tumultuously changing future i do expect very successful one and as we move it on up in the line up we will undoubtedly have things which we notice which can be incorporated and when they work out uniformly to the better good of all cases they will themselves become standard tech very good thank you very much
