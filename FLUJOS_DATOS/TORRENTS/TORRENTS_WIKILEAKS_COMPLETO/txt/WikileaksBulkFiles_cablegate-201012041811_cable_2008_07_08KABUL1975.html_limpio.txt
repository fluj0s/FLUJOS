extaliban seek mediation role classified by acting political counselor jeremiah howard for reasons 14 b and d summary 1 c on july 29 president karzai gave the ambassador plan for negotiations with the taliban that he had received from taliban reconcilees septel in meeting arranged by the presidency at our request the next day prominent extaliban said they are wellplaced to mediate reconciliation with the insurgency but argued they are hampered from doing so by their inclusion on list 1267 in earlier discussions former taliban government officials told us they reject mullah omars fanaticism rigidity and alliance with qaeda but that they fear the taliban are in the ascendant and becoming more extreme they stressed they accept the current constitution in general but do want amendments to make clear the primacy of islam presidency wants to exploit extaliban as mediators 2 c on july 30 deputy national security advisor engineer ibrahim spinzada who is seeking us support in convincing russia to allow removal of names from united nations list 1267 responded to our earlier request to arrange meeting for political officers with reconcilees from the former taliban government he convoked to the meeting exforeign minister maulavi ahmad mutawakkil the taliban nominee for ambassador to the united nations abdul hakim mujadid note the taliban regime was never accepted as sovereign by preponderance of the world community exambassador to saudi arabia habibullah fawzi and exdeputy education minister and current afghan senator arsala rahmani 3 c the four extaliban mentioned the plan for negotiations that had been given to president karzai and without referring directly to its text emphasized several key points force alone cannot defeat the taliban in either afghanistan or pakistan but since the roots of taliban insurgency lie in afghanistan resolution of conflict here would undermine taliban rebellion in the fata and nwfp if the taliban are reconciled allied opposition groups including those led by gulbuddin hekmatyar or the haqqanis would disappear extaliban are an unused resource for president karzai and the international community since they alone have access to both political leaders and command levels of the insurgency and are willing to mediate in negotiations there should be preconditions for negotiations which could take place in the gulf or saudi arabia or in afghanistan in the presence of international forces negotiations should be an incremental process avoiding initially issues such as ceasefire or the prison at guantanamo and stressing instead the cessation of taliban attacks on ngos schools or roads government commitment to minimize civilian casualties and goodwill detainee releases reconcilees represent silent majority in the taliban who simply want to end the war and had publicly accepted the constitution though they would favor amendments to enhance the constitutional role of islam negotiations reconciliation and restoration of security can and should be followed by elections and some extaliban would like to be candidates only when key moderates are removed from the 1267 list will they have the credibility needed to convince insurgents they can guarantee agreements they broker with karzai or the international community extaliban moderates as an inchoate movement 4 sbu in the weeks leading up to our july 30 meeting we established contact with numerous senior extaliban we provide the paragraphs below to give sense of what they are thinking about how to end the insurgency and how best to achieve democratic but islamic governance 5 sbu former foreign ministry aide waheed mujda has written book on the taliban ahmed rashid wrote from the outside but i wrote from inside in the summer of 2001 he says he went to the us embassy in islamabad to warn that qaeda planned to use massive explosives to attack the us 6 sbu mujda repots that immediately after 911 the taliban began to fracture over the wisdom and morality of attacking civilians over lost economic opportunities if the taliban isolated itself from the west and over dangers to be faced if the us occupied afghanistan there was also concern about growing reliance on pakistans isi and deepening ties to qaeda mujda hoped at the time that the us would wait to attack the taliban since he predicted there would be within the year definitive split between urban intellectuals led by foreign minister mutawakkil and mullah omars villagebased obscurantists after the us installed karzai though he saw moderates chances evaporating while many lowerranking taliban with little commitment to either mutawakkil or mullah omar proved opportunistic waiting simply to see if the international community and karzai could govern 7 sbu mujda lamented that karzai named governors who harassed extaliban of all ranks rather than open dialog meanwhile mujda alleged international forces committed atrocities such as breaking down doors and searching women that even the soviets taught soldiers to avoid afraid of death or guatanamo some moderates concluded they had n alternative but to return to mullah omar wth the war ongoing he contends the taliban as expanded its original commitments to sharia security and territorial integrity to enompass an international dimension including demands that the us leave saudi arabia civilian casualties and hunger suicides 8 c the talibans attorney general maulavi jalaludin shinwari agrees the taliban is growing even more militant taliban ideologues have serious doctrinal competition he complained the karzaiallied ulema council is slow and inactive meeting only once year and thats in the presidential palace since moderates have limited effective intellectual or spiritual leadership the taliban and hardline mullahs in pakistan have commandeered the right to define jihad and channeled the jihadi impulse into radical and violent forms 9 c shinwari lambasted international forces for repeated civilian casualty incidents which make the talibans recruiting and ideological tasks easier these indiscriminate attacks enable the taliban to argue the us does not care about afghans or islam and that karzai is in complicity with the us or incapable of curbing us excesses as if this intense anger were not enough he sputtered there is also the despair of deepening poverty and inequality creating for the first time hunger suicides who kill and die either to collect taliban payment or simply to lighten the economic burden on their families by removing one more mouth to feed not loose cannon 10 sbu parliamentary deputy mullah abdul salaam rocketi whose name derives from his deft touch with rocketpropelled grenade launcher warns that the us has not carefully identified its enemies if the us continues to fight everyone including qaeda gulbuddin hekmatyar and both taliban radicals and moderates then he warns we cannot win and that pakistan iran or russia will dominate afghanistan 11 c rocketi counsels that karzai is lost feckless ally for the us whose cabinet he argues is driven by members separate and competing interests unconcerned by the publics needs on the infrequent occasions when karzai works up the courage or is forced to fire the thieves rocketi mutters he just replaces them with new thieves karzais failure he concludes is expanding the talibans once narrow doors of entry into wide gates the us must identify who within the taliban is moderate or amenable to dialog and work with them to seek peace and agree on how afghanistan is to be governed alternatives to mullah omar 12 sbu two figures generally recognized as heading the extaliban moderates are exforeign minister mutawakkil and exambassador to pakistan abdul salim zaef who spent four years at guantanamo and whom some see as the stronger of the two we talked to them separately in late july 13 c mutawakil said the us must realize there are two kinds of reconciliation one which he calls the us strategy is designed to entice insurgents into supporting karzai the other he distinguished is designed to end the war and achieve an understanding between the two warring afghan sides the war is being driven by foreign allies he explained but the us on one side and qaeda on the other have their own priorities mutawakil said he had advised karzai to carry out negotiations with the insurgency but to aim for incremental progress concentrating first on small resolvable issues further he had told karzai any negotiations must be conducted in private with interfering media coverage the mediators he halfjoked can be only those whom neither the government nor taliban want to be killed and who maintain impartial contact with both warring sides to make mediation possible zaef and mutawakkil agree 1267 restrictions must be lifted 14 c mutawakkil and zaef believe firmly that the international community is distancing itself irreparably from ordinary afghans mutawakkil argues that as the usled coalition intensifies military operations it drives the taliban to seek selfpreservation by attaching itself more closely to qaeda and the pakistani isi zaef warns that the us lacks cultural knowledge and sensitivity necessary to run afghanistan through karzai and that given the difficulty of running legitimate and credible elections it should allow the transfer of governing authority to loya jirga he warns that to be effective and bring peace the members of this jirga cannot be named by karzai or seen to be puppets of the us and that they should be named by prejirga representing tribal and religious leaders from the entire country he says there should also be jirga commission to discuss flaws in the current constitution 15 c mutawakkil elaborated on what the afghan constitution should be like democracy he stipulated is means to better and peaceful life and is not means in itself an islamic base can be built for better life and the talibans biggest mistake was in not understanding the need to avoid meddling in private lives the department for promotion of virtue and prevention of vice did not understand proportionality it used major force and applied severe punishments for even minor violations and in so doing lost public confidence 16 c the constitution mutawakkil continued is as it stands now piece of paper which even karzais nominal allies and opponents in parliament fail to respect he thinks the constitution should be amended to garner wider respect the primary article to be amended is the commitment to freedom of religion since islam must be acknowledged as paramount this would not affect the countrys hindus and sikhs there are afghan christians and only one jew who would continue to be allowed freedom of religion muslim though mutawakkil continued could be allowed to abandon islam without punishment in the form of prison or banishment wood
