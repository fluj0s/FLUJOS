performance of the armed forces of the united states in operations and provides the doctrinal basis for interagency coordination and for us military involvement in multinational operations it provides military guidance for the exercise of authority by combatant commanders and other joint force commanders jfcs and prescribes joint doctrine for operations and training it provides military guidance for use by the armed forces in preparing their appropriate plans it is not the intent of this publication to restrict the authority of the jfc from organizing the force and executing the mission in manner the jfc deems most appropriate to ensure unity of effort in the accomplishment of the overall objective 3 application joint doctrine established in this publication applies to the commanders of combatant commands subunified commands joint task forces subordinate components of these commands and the services b the guidance in this publication is authoritative as such this doctrine will be followed except when in the judgment of the commander exceptional circumstances dictate otherwise if conflicts arise between the contents of this publication and the contents of service publications this publication will take precedence unless the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff normally in coordination with the other members of the joint chiefs of staff has provided more current and specific guidance commanders of forces operating as part of multinational alliance or coalition military command should follow multinational doctrine and procedures ratified by the united states for

prevent deter preempt and respond to terrorism consequence management cm preparation for and response to consequences of terrorist incident and intelligence support collection or dissemination of terrorism related information taken to oppose terrorism throughout the entire threat spectrum force protection fp is an overarching concept and mission responsibility inherent to command within all military operations as discussed throughout this publication at in contrast is subelement of combating terrorism joint force commanders conduct fp in similar fashion to movement and maneuver intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance employing firepower sustaining operations operating in chemical biological radiological or nuclear environment and providing command and control during the execution of campaigns major operations and tactical engagements fp actions are to be accomplished by the services and by joint forces under joint command and control using joint doctrine fp can be applied at multiple levels of command from the strategic theater through the operational and to the tactical levelfor official use only for official use onlyixxexecutive summary jp 3072for official use only for official use onlythe at program is collective proactive effort focused on the detection and prevention of terrorist attacks against department of defense dod personnel their families facilities installations and infrastructure critical to mission accomplishment as well as the preparations to defend against and planning for the response to the consequences of terrorist incidents the minimum elements of an at program are risk management planning training and exercises resource generation and comprehensive program review terrorists continue to adapt to conditions and develop more aggressive and effective methods often incorporating multiple simultaneous attacks and suicide bombings their targets may be just as likely economic tourists financial networks or agricultural ones livestock crops as embassies or military forcesfacilities their goal is not just to win favor for their causes but to wage undeclared unconventional war at will the more common tactics employed by terrorist groups are assassination arson bombing hostage taking kidnapping hijacking or skyjacking seizure raids or attacks on facilities sabotage hoaxes use of weapons of mass destruction and environmental destruction threat analysis shall review the factors of terrorist groups operational capability intentions and activity as well as the operating environment within which friendly forces operate threat analysis is an essential step in identifying and describing the threat posed by specific terrorist groups andor individuals in terrorism threat assessment vulnerability assessment is an evaluation to determine the vulnerability to terrorist attack against an installation unit exercise port ship residence facility or other site in accomplishing this assessment it is important to consider the design basis threat to determine the facilitys design and structural requirements the threat assessment and vulnerability assessment are then utilized with the criticality assessment to provide the basis for risk management decisions commanders must determine which assets require the most protection and where future expenditures are required to minimize risk of attack or lessen the severity of the outcome of an attackthe department of defenses dods at program is one of several programs that fall under the overarching fp concept the general shift in tactics and methodologies among international terrorists focuses on producing mass casualties terrorism threat analysis is continual process of compiling and examining all available information concerning potential terrorist activities by terrorist groups that could target the dod components elements and personnelterrorist tactics threat analysisxiexecutive summaryfor official use only for official use onlystrategic wellplanned proactive systematic allsource intelligence and counterintelligence ci programs are essential the role of intelligence and ci is to identify assess deter disrupt and defeat the threat provide advance warning and disseminate critical information intelligence in usable form for the commander all command personnel may potentially contribute to information collection and analytical efforts effective intelligence and ci support requires effort to execute the intelligence process and to conduct effective operations and investigations against the threat the entire process is important in providing decision makers with information and timely warnings upon which to recommend fp actions commanders increase their capability to refine the local threat picture and shape their operating environment by appropriate coordination and interaction with local area residents whether inside the united states or at an expeditionary location effective communication and developed rapport among area leaders nongovernmental organizations businesses residents and military leaders support the defenseindepth concept and ensure the first layer of defense extends beyond the base perimeter local language and cultural training for appropriate personnel also contribute to rapport development commanders responsibility and authority to enforce security measures and to protect persons and property are critical during any level of conflict commanders should consult with their legal advisors often when establishing their at programs legal personnel should be members of all installation or unit at cells boards and working groups dod is the lead supported by other agencies in defending against traditional external threatsaggression against the us homeland however against internal asymmetric or nontraditional threats eg terrorism dod may be in support of the department of homeland security or another lead or primary agency when providing support to civil authorities dod will do so as directed by the president or the secretary of defense and consistent with laws presidential directives executive orders and dod policies and directives the following general principles apply to such supportintelligence and counterintelligence are critical in the development of an at program effective at efforts extend beyond the peerimeter commanders authority constraints and restraints on military support to civil authoritiesintelligence and counterintelligence legal considerationscommunity engagementxiiexecutive summary jp 3072for official use only for official use onlythe at program stresses deterrence of terrorist incidents through preventive measures common to all combatant commands and servicesexcept in the case of immediate response authority dod resources are provided only when response or recovery requirements are beyond the capabilities of local state and federal civil authorities and when they are requested by lead or primary agency and approved by the secretary of defense in certain circumstances imminently serious conditions resulting from either civil emergencies or attacks may require immediate response by military commanders responses to requests from civil authorities prior to receiving authority from the president or chain of command are made when immediate support is critical to save lives prevent human suffering or mitigate great property damage in order to be successful an at program must be implemented in methodical coordinated manner it cannot be stressed enough that the at program is the ultimate responsibility of the commander or in the case of dod agency the civilian equivalent who has the authority and responsibility to alter or add to the at program as deemed necessary to accommodate the local situation the minimum at program elements include risk management planning training and exercises resource generation and program reviews plans for cm and incident response are important adjuncts to an effective at program risk management is the process of systematically identifying assessing and controlling risks arising from operational factors and making decisions that balance risk costs with mission benefits the commander must decide how best to employ given resources and at measures to deter mitigate and prepare for terrorist incident while continuing the mission risk management has four key subelements criticality assessment threat assessment and vulnerability assessment the criticality assessment provides the commander with prioritized list of assets based on the necessity for mission completion the terrorism threat assessment is the tool that commanders use to determine the capability intentions and activity of terrorist organizations the vulnerability assessment is the determination of susceptibility to attack by the broad range of terrorist threats the risk assessment combines the criticality threat vulnerability and risk assessmentsantiterrorism programxiiiexecutive summaryfor official use only for official use onlyalthough the risk of terrorist aggression against us and multinational resources cannot be totally eliminated it can be reduced and managed through deliberate and effective risk management command planning and execution should include actions to implement at measures which are consistent with fundamental risk management principles through the application of the basic risk management principles of identification assessment risk avoidance loss prevention loss reduction and process evaluationreapplication most fp requirements can be met preventive and protective security measures should be taken by military units and individual service members to protect themselves and their ability to accomplish their mission during mobilization deployment employment sustainment and redeployment operations additionally rest and recuperation rr facilities and other facilities not located in traditional military installation also require close consideration these facilities are frequently vulnerable due to their location and generally easy access service personnel are at risk of lowering their guard while using these rr facilities the installation ship unit or port at plan provides the mechanism to ensure readiness against terrorist attacks while the unit performs its tactical mission during deployments the primary objective of incident response management is to mitigate the effects and number of casualties resulting from terrorist attack commanders develop response measures to save lives preserve health and safety secure and eliminate the hazard protect property prevent further damage to the installation and maintain public confidence in the installations ability to respond to terrorist incident cm is the preparedness and response to mitigate the consequences of an incident resulting from the use of chemical biological radiological nuclear and highyield explosives cbrne agents it includes mass alerting or notification capabilities disaster planning public health medical surveillance and other preparatory efforts commanders responsibility and authority to enforce security measures and to protect persons

official use only for official use onlyterrorism is an arm the revolutionary can never relinquish carlos marighella minimanual of the urban guerilla 1 general critical factor in understanding terrorism is the importance of the emotional impact of the terrorist act on an audience other than the victim this chapter provides an overview of issues dealing with the terrorist threat the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 marked dramatic escalation in trends toward more destructive terrorist attacks showed the vulnerability of the united states and the importance of preventing terrorism the new terrorist paradigm includes traditional state sponsored terrorism well organized networks of nonstate actors extremist groups and criminal networks moreover terrorists may act independently or in wellorchestrated offensive 2 terrorist tactics the general shift in tactics and methodologies among international terrorists focuses on producing mass casualties they have raised the stakes operating now with more fatalistic mentality and incorporating multiple simultaneous attacks and suicide bombings their target s may be just as likely economic tourists financial networks or agricultural ones livestock crops as embassies or military forcesfacilities their goal is not just to win favor for their causes but to wage undeclared unconventional war at will the more common tactics employed by terrorist groups are discussed below aassassination term generally applied to the killing of prominent persons and symbolic enemies as well as traitors who defect from the group barson less dramatic than most tactics arson has the advantage of low risk to the perpetrator and requires only low level of technical knowledge cbombing the improvised explosive device ied is the terrorists weapon of choice ieds can be inexpensive to produce and because of the various detonation techniques available may be low risk to the perpetrator suicide bombings however are common attack method advantages to these tactics include their attentiongetting capacity and the ability to c ontrol casualties through time of detonation and placement of the device announcing responsibility for the bombing or denying responsibility for the incident should the action produce undesirable results generates media interest and may lead to increased coverage of terrorist groups agenda activities dhostage taking this usually is an overt seizure of one or more individuals with the intent of gaining publicity concessions in return for release of the hostages or as human shieldsii2chapter ii jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyto increase their success in carrying out mission while dramatic hostage and hostage barricade situations are risky for the perpetrator ekidnapping while similar to hostage taking kidnapping has significant differences kidnapping is usually covert seizure of one or more specific persons in order to extract specific demands the perpetrators of the action may not be known for long time because of the time involved successful kidnapping requires elaborate planning and logistics because the perpetrator may not be known for long time the risk to the perpetrator is less than in the hostage situation fhijacking or skyjacking sometimes employed as means for escape hijacking is normally carried out to produce spectacular hostage situation or provide vehicle for carrying out lethal mission gseizure seizure usually involves building or object that has value in the eyes of the intended audience there is some risk to the terrorist because security personnel have time to react and may opt to use force to resolve the incident especially if few or innocent lives are involved hraids or attacks on facilities armed attacks on facilities are usually undertaken for one of three purposes to gain access to radio or television broadcast capabilities in order to make statement to demonstrate the governments inability to secure critical facil ities or national symbols or to acquire resources eg robbery of bank or armory isabotage the objective in most sabotage incidents is to demonstrate how vulnerable society is to terrorist actions industrialized societies are more vulnerable to sabotage tha n less highly developed societies utilities communications and transportation systems are so interdependent that serious disruption of any one affects all of them and gains immediate public attention sabotage of industrial or commercial facilities is one means of identifying the target while making statement of future intent military facilities and installat ions information systems and information infrastructures may become targets of terrorist sabotage jhoaxes any terrorist group that has established credibility can employ hoax with considerable success threat against persons life causes that person and those associ atedthe american soldier is symbol of us power and presence and is consequently target for terrorists

aircraft flight at cost to the terrorist repetit ive or an inordinate number of false alarms may dull the analytical and operational efficiency of key security personnel thus degrading readiness kuse of weapons of mass destruction wmd terrorists have employed chemical and biological weapons in the past and some terrorist organizations will seek to employ all types of cbrne weapons when they can obtain them these types of weapons which are relatively cheap and easy to make could be used in place of conventional explosives in many situations the potential for mass destruction and the deepseated fear most people have of chemical and biological weapons could be attractive to group wishing to make the world take notice although an explosive nuclear device is acknowledged to be beyond the reach of most terrorist groups chemical or biological weapon or radiological dispersion device using contaminants is not the technology is simple and the cost per casualty for biological weapons in particular is extremely low much lower than for nuclear explosives this situation could change as the competition for headlines increases increasing availability of cbrne material components and weapons raises the specter of terrorists using these weapons in an attack against civilian populations or military facilities many chemicalbiological weapons ingredients are commercially available terrorists have attempted to obtain industrial radiological source s to be used in dirty bomb scenario lenvironmental destruction although this tactic has not been widely used the increasing accessibility of sophisticated weapons to terrorists has the potential to threaten damage to the environment potential examples include intentional dumping of hazardous chemicals into theport facilities may be one target of terrorist attacks ii4chapter ii jp 3072for official use only for official use onlypublic water supply the destruction of oil tankers causing ecological harm destroying oil fields or poisoning nations food supplies the use of exotic insects animals or plants to poison or destroy the food supply or ecosystem is potential low cost terror weapon mmanportable air defense system manpads terrorists can use manpads to attack military or civilian aircraft terrorists have conducted such attacks previously incl uding an attack on dhl cargo aircraft at baghdad international airport in november 2003 3 terrorist groups terrorist groups selection of targets and tactics is also function of the groups affiliat ion level of training organization and sophistication security planners and terrorism analysts categorized terrorist groups according to their operational traditions national transnational and international national groups operated within the boundaries of single nation transnational groups operated across international borders international groups operated in two or more nations and were usually assumed to receive direction and support from foreign government historically terrorist groups have also been categorized by government affiliation to help security planners and terrorism analysts anticipate terrorist targets and their sophistication of inte lligence and weaponry three general terrorist group categories are shown in figure ii1 b while the three categories broadly indicate the degrees of sophistication that may be expected it is important to examine each terrorist group on its own terms the vast funds available to some narcoterrorists afford them the armaments and technology rivaling some nationstates religious cults or organizations have features from all three of the listed cate gories they may be nonstatesupported eg japans aum shinrikyo cult or alqaeda state supported eg extremist factions of hamas who believe violence serves their concept of religious categories of terrorist groups nonstatesupported terrorist group that operates autonomously receiving significant support from any government statedirected terrorist group that operates as an agent of government receiving substantial intelligence logistic and operational support from the sponsoring government eg hizballah organizationstatesupported terrorist group that generally operates independently but receives support from one or more governments eg popular front for the liberation of palestine figure ii1 categories of terrorist groupsii5terrorist threatfor official use only for official use onlyservitude or statedirected eg hizballah is both the party of god and religious organization that employs violence in support of both religion and politics c terrorism is essentially network of networks comprised of extremist organizations ideological motivated state and non state actors and other opportunists who cooperate because of self interests these opportunists including criminals organized criminal entities proli ferators rogue states insurgents and others are enablers to terrorists they may not agree explicitly with the terrorists or their goals but expect to achieve some benefit or profit from their cooperation with the terrorists 4 terrorist organizations terrorist organizations are not corporate or hierarchal nor are they confined to borders groups may share considerable resources or only ideological goals out of necessity the groups are generally resilient and adaptive to external pressures despite their diversity of motive sophistication and strength these organizations share conceptual structure as depicted in fi gure ii2 b at the base underlying conditions such as poverty corruption religious conflict and ethnic strife create opportunities for terrorists to exploit some of these conditions are real and some manufactured terrorists use these conditions to justify their actions and expand their base of support the belief that terror is legitimate means to address such conditions and effect political change is fundamental problem enabling terrorism to develop and grow passive supporters may not approve of terrorist groups activities but they do not get involved because of several possible reasons including lack of trust or confidence in the government fear of retribution complete apathy and lack of means for reporting activities confidentially structure pyramid of typical terrorist organization passive supportactive supportactive cadrehardcore leadership figure ii2 structure pyramid of typical terrorist org anizationii6chapter ii jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyc the international environment defines the boundaries within which terrorists strategies take shape porous borders as well as sympathetic governments provide terrorists access to havens capabilities and other support whether through ignorance inability or intent states around the world still offer havens both physical eg safe houses training grounds and virtual eg reliable communication and financial networks that terrorists need to plan organize train and conduct their operations once entrenched in safe operating environment the organization can begin to solidify and expand the terrorist organizations structure membership resources supporters and security determine its capabilities and reach d active support is the second largest and the most important level of terrorist organization active supporters are critical to terrorist campaigns any group can carry out bombing or kidnapping but in order to sustain campaign of bombings and kidnappings the group must maintain active support active supporters keep the terrorists in the field they maintain communication channels provide safe houses gather intelligence and ensure all other logistical needs are met this is the largest internal group in the organization the active cadre is responsible for carrying out the mission of the terrorist organization depending on the organizations size each terrorist in the cadre may have one or more specialties other terrorists support each specialty but the active cadre is the striking arm of the terrorist group f at the top of the structure the terrorist leadership provides the overall direction and strategy that link all these factors and thereby breathe life into terror campaign hardcore terrorist leaders manipulate ideologies and philosophies for their own benefit they selectively report information and disseminate news in order to instill sense of unity within the group embrace disenfranchised individuals throughout community and ultimately consolidate and advance individual and group power the leadership becomes the catalyst for terrorist action the loss of the leadership can cause many organizations to collapse some groups however are more resilient and can promote new leadership should the original fall or fail still others have adopted more decentralized organization with largely autonomous cells making our challenge even greater g while retaining this basic structure the terrorist challenge has changed considerably over the past decade and likely will continue to evolve ironically the particular nature of the terrorist threat faced today springs in large part from some of our past successes h alqaeda exemplifies how terrorist networks have twisted the benefits and conveniences of our increasingly open integrated and modernized world to serve their agenda the alqaeda network is multinational enterprise with operations in more than 60 countries its camps in afghanistan provided sanctuary and its bank accounts served as trust fund for terrorism its global activities are coordinated through the use of personal couriers and communication technologies emblematic of our era cellular and satellite phones encrypted email internet chat rooms videotape and cdroms compact disc readonly memory like skilled publicist usama bin laden and alqaeda have exploited the international media to project his image and message worldwideii7terrorist threatfor official use only for official use onlyi as the alqaeda network demonstrates the terrorist threat today is mutating into somethi ng quite different from its predecessors terrorists can now take full advantage of technology to disperse leadership training and logistics not just regionally but globally establishing and moving cells in virtually any country is relatively easy in world where more than 140 million people live outside of their country of origin and millions of people cross international borders daily alqaeda aka qaidat aljihad the base established by usama bin ladin in the late 1980s to bri ng together arabs who fought in afghanistan against the soviet

colombias involvement in the cocaine trade in colombia alqaedas profiting from the poppy fields in afghanistan or abu sayyafs kidnapping for profit in the philippines terrorists are increasingly using criminal activities to support and fund their terror in addition to findingii8chapter ii jp 3072for official use only for official use onlysanctuary within the boundaries of state sponsor terrorists often seek out states where they can operate with impunity because the central government is unable to stop them such areas are found in the americas europe the middle east africa and asia foreign terrorists also establ ish cells in the very open liberal and tolerant societies that they plan to attack 5 terrorism against the homeland terrorists have attacked within us borders ever since we gained our independence historically though the attacks were primarily committed by americans done infrequently and on generally small scale since the early 1990s the scale of the attacks has increased s has the presence of foreign terrorists eg world trade center in 1993 and the attacks of september 11 2001 securing the american homeland is challenge of monumental scale and complexity the 1995 bombing of the murrah federal building in oklahoma city and the attacks of 911 highlight the threat of terrorist acts within the us domestic terrorist groups transnational terrorist groups and special interest extremist groups continue to pose threat to the peace and stability of our country b terrorists choose their targets deliberately based on the weaknesses they observe in our defenses and in our preparations they can balance the difficulty in successfully executing particular attack against the magnitude of loss it might cause they can monitor our media and listen to our policymakers as our nation discusses how to protect itself and adjust their plans accordingly where we insulate ourselves from one form of attack they can shift and focus on another exposed vulnerability we must defend ourselves against wide range of means and methods of attack terrorists continue to employ conventional means of attack while at the same time gaining expertise in less traditional means such as attacks on computer banking nd utility systems other terrorists are working to obtain cbrne weapons for the purpose of wreaking unprecedented damage on america c terrorist groups can infiltrate organizations groups or geographic areas to wait watch and identify weaknesses and opportunities while it is much more difficult for us to do the same this trait is made even more relevant by our reliance on habitual processes such as repetitivenes s in training and in our daily lives d military commanders are responsible to ensure that dod resources are used as directed and consistent with laws presidential directives executive orders eos and dod policie s and directives see joint publication jp 326 homeland security for guidance in the conduct of homeland security operationsii9terrorist threatfor official use only for official use only6 asymmetric tactics techniques and procedures terrorists have used variety of tactics techniques and procedures ttp to attack us forces because terrorists groups usually cannot confront us forces directly they turn to asymmetric ttp although the exact enemy ttp are constantly evolving the national ground intelligence center identified some overarching asymmetric ttp while reviewing operation iraqi freedom oif operations in the spring 2004 however these tactics can be employed in both expeditionary and nonexpeditionary environments b asymmetric ttp used in the oif during the spring 2004 were based on denial and deception human shield tactics standoff attacks and io these ttp can be combined w ith conventional military tactics to serve as battlefield multiplier 1denial and deception dispersing and hiding dispersion and hiding in complex terrain such as cities deny us situational awareness and complicate targeting of precision fires urban are as offer excellent cover and concealment from us airpower because building interiors and subterranean areas are hidden from airborne observation and vertical obstructions hinder line of sight to ground targets c2 is often decentralized terrorist operations are nonlinear and dispersed b exploitation of sensitive infrastructure urban infrastructure such as buildings shrines and ruins can be sensitive for political religious cultural or historic reasons enemy forces deliberately occupy sensitive buildings under the assumption us forces will refrain from entering or returning fire c terrorists also use police cars taxis and ambulances to move couriers fighters and ammunition terrorist forces have used civilian vehicles configured as vehicle borne improvised explosive devices vbieds as technicals to maneuver and fight and as supply and transport vehicles in one example enemy forces reconfigured white van with red crescents painted on the front and sides into vbied which was detonated near local hotel 2human shields in their attacks enemy forces deliberately use noncombatants as human shields this tactic forces coalition forces to adopt more stringent rules of engagement roe and limit their heavy firepower capability b supply civilians to the area of operations in some areas enemy forces prevented civilians from evacuating likely engagement areas in order to ensure that source of human shields remained available elsewhere subversives closed down schools and orchestrated work strikes to produce crowds of civilians in potential battle areas attackers have also used peaceful demonstrations as cover and means of escape after execution of an attackii10chapter ii jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyc maneuver within crowds of civilians terrorists use crowds of noncombatants to cover and conceal their movements and to negate coalition movements in some cases children were used as human roadblocks d attack coalition targets from residential areas enemy forces have launched attacks from residential areas in order to invite coalition return fire into civilian homes 3standoff attacks in general enemy forces avoid or desire to limit their direct fire engagements with us heavy armored vehicles and prefer to conduct standoff attacks with ied bombs and indirect fire weapons standoff tactics permit the attack on target with enough intervening distance and time to allow for escape from the engagement area andor to avoid immediate overwhelming return fire by coalition units b mortar shoot and scoot tactics mortars are the primary weapon of choice by enemy forces for applying shoot and scoot tactics in urban terrain attackers have mounted mortars in truck beds and inside of automobiles by cutting holes in the roofs of the car to fire the weapon attackers fire few rounds from these systems before displacing or scooting to new location enemy forces have also left these systems for capture after firing sometimes the equipment left behind is rigged with bombs or is targeted by another indirect firing system to engage unsuspecting coalition units who have captured the equipment c mortars and their ammunition are available worldwide are relatively easy to maintain and are easy to employ they are easy to hide have high rates of fire and can quickly 107 mm rocket aimed at coalition forces ii11terrorist threatfor official use only for official use onlyrelocate mortars do not require large firing areas and they are ideal for urban attacks as their arcing trajectory can clear high buildings rockets require more planning and more setup time but they increase attacker survivability and deliver larger warhead d ieds enemy forces have employed ied bombs from the simple small devices to massive 100 kilogram bombs buried in the road some of the most complex devices have included artillery shells daisychained together to explode along section of the road over 100 meters long explosive charges have been placed in pipes boxes animal carcasses piles of rocks and any other innocuous object along the side of road decoys and small ieds have been used to draw coalition forces into kill zones for subsequent or secondary ied explosions conduct suicidebomber attacks many suicide bomb attacks use vbieds multiple vbieds have also been employed with the first vehicle explosion designed to open breach into hardened facility or perimeter barrier and second bomb to penetrate through the opening to attack the target 4io enemy forces have used io to disrupt popular support for coalition forces and to garner regional and international support for insurgent forces mainly from europe and the islamic worldvehicle borne improvised explosive device attack on coalition force s barely penetrated the perimeter but decimated the local neighborho od ii12chapter ii jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyb spread rumors on the street rumors have always been powerful force news from friends in marketplaces and cafes has always been used to offset the other official information enemy forces plant many rumors and initiate disinformation to discredit the coalition for example after terrorist bombing bystanders will often wave chunks of metal at film crews and claim they are shrapnel from us missiles and bombs one rumor in oif which took months to disprove was that the toys handed out by coalition soldiers caused deadly diseases in iraqi children c release favorable combat footage enemy forces rely heavily on video to distribute their propaganda for example crude digital video discs dvds containing footage of attacks on coalition forces wounded women and children and damaged local infrastructure appeared in regional marketplaces immediately after attacks dvds usually praised the bra very of residents who didnt submit to humiliation by the americans and include scenes depicting the bravery of fighters as they engage coalition troops d post video on the internet terrorist groups can use the internet to disseminate its message as quickly as events happen an immediate press release from web site is not only cheap but offers direct control over the content of the message sites are managed to manipulate images in support of the resistance and to create special effects or deception ensure media access to the battlefield enemy forces use sympathetic media to reinforce their io plan some media companies repeatedly display images of casualties massive collateral damage and the accusation that coalition forces use excessive force f attacks on local government officials and civilians this tactic avoids the strength of american military forces and concentrates on the various levels of the public servants and innocent civilians in the conduct of such attacks the terrorists are undermining the governments efforts to maintain stability and attempting to intimidate other individuals from supporting or assisting the government in the case of attacks on the civilians the murders can be filmed and distributed as mentioned abovechapter iii intelligence counterintelligence threat analysis and countersurveillance iii1for official

expenditures are required to minimize risk of attack or lessen the severity of the outcome of an attack to enhance this capability which requires the collection and analysis of informati on from many

military operations promotes coordination between all levels of the intelligence ci and communities and enhances timely distribution of information to the supported commander 1 several factors

the purpose of terrorist surveillance know what terrorists look for and know how they conduct surveillance operations with this basic knowledge commanders can then implement protective countermeasures comply with dod standardized reporting procedures and in the end deter detect disrupt and defend against future attacks bvulnerability assessment terrorists conduct surveillance to determine targets suitability for attack by assessing the capabilities of existing security systems and dis cerning weaknesses for potential exploitation terrorists closely examine security procedures such as shift changes access control and roving patrols citizenship of security guards models and types of locks presence of closedcircuit cameras and guard dogs after identifying weaknesses terrorists plan their attack options at the point or points of greatest vulnerability cterrorist surveillance techniques the basic methods of surveillance are mobile and fixed or static 1 mobile surveillance entails active participation by the terrorists or operatives conducting surveillance usually following as the target moves terrorists conduct mobile surveillance on foot in vehicle or by combining the two mobile surveillance usually progresses in phases from stakeout to pick up and then through follow phase until the target stops at this point operatives are positioned to cover logical routes to enable the surveillance to continue when the target moves again 2 terrorists conduct fixed or static surveillance from one location to observe target whether person building facility or installation fixed surveillance often requires the use of an observation point to maintain constant discreet observation of specific location terrorists establish observation posts in houses apartments offices stores or on the street mobile surveillance unit such as parked car or van can also serve as an observation post terrorists often park outside building facility or installation to observe routines of security and personnel coming and going terrorists also use various modes of transportation to include buses trains or boats or move by foot to approach and observe installationsiii10chapter iii jp 3072for official use only for official use onlydprotective countermeasures the incorporation of visible security cameras motion sensors working dog teams random roving security patrols varying size timing and routes irregular guard changes and active searches including xray machines and explosive detection devices of vehicles and persons at entry points will improve situational awareness and present robust force protection posture that dramatically inhibits terrorist surveillance efforts the emplacement of barriers roadblocks and entry mazes that are covered by alert security personnel will provide additional deterrence as these measures increase standoff and improve security personnel reaction time in the event of an attack the implementation of unannounced random security measures such as 100 identification of all personnel entering the facility installa tion conducting inspections and searches of personnel and vehicles and visible displays of vehicles mounted with crew served weapons will increase uncertainty and thus the risk of failure in the minds of terrorists esurveillance detection because terrorists conduct surveillance often over period of weeks months or years detection of their activities is possible regardless of the level of expertise terrorists invariably commit mistakes knowing what to look for and to be able to distinguish the ordinary from the extraordinary are keys to successful surveillance detection for these reasons overt surveillance detection in its most basic form is simply watching for persons observing personnel facilities and installations 1 the objectives of overt surveillance detection measures are to record the activities of persons behaving in suspicious manner and to provide this information in format useable by the appropriate or intelligence officials it is important to note that overt surveillance the emphasis of surveillance detection is on indicators and warn ings of terrorist surveillance activitiesiii11intelligence counterintelligence threat analysis and countersurveillancefor official use only for official use onlydetection emphasizes the avoidance of interpersonal confrontations with suspicious individuals unless exigent situations necessitate otherwise depending upon the circumstances or trends commanders and senior officials in coordination with intelligence experts through installati on threat working groups may determine the need for more specialized covert countersurveillance measures to assure installation protection 2 for surveillance detection efforts to achieve positive results military policesecuri ty personnel should immediately report incidents of surveillance and suspicious activities by providing detailed descriptions of the people the times of day the locations the vehicles involved and the circumstances of the sightings to their respective criminal investigative service s or counterintelligence elements for incorporation into reports such as air force talon or the naval criminal investigative service suspicious incident report the incident reports are important pieces of information that over time combined with other similar sightings allow investigators to assess the level of threat against specific facility installa tion or geographic region such reports should be submitted to the joint protection enterprise network within 24 hours of an event occurring 3 the emphasis of surveillance detection is on indicators and warnings of terrorist surveillance activities surveillance detection efforts should focus on recording then reporting incidents similar to the following multiple sightings of the same suspicious person vehicle or activity separated by time distance or direction b possible locations for observation post use c individuals who stay at bustrain stops for extended periods while busestrains come and go d individuals who conduct inordinately long conversations on pay or cellular telephones individuals who order food at restaurant and leave before the food arrives or who order without eating f joggers who stand and stretch for an inordinate amount of time g individuals sitting in parked car for an extended period of time h individuals who dont fit into the surrounding environment by wearing improper attire for the location or season i individuals drawing pictures taking notes in an area not normally of interest to standard tourist or showing interest in or photographing security cameras guard locations or noticeably watching security reaction drills and proceduresiii12chapter iii jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyj individuals who exhibit unusual behavior such as staring or quickly looking away from individuals or vehicles as they enter or leave designated facilities or parking areas k terrorists may also employ aggressive surveillance by false phone threats approaching security checkpoints to ask for directions or innocently attempting to smuggle nonlethal contraband through checkpoints clearly the terrorists intend to determine firsthand the effectiveness of search procedures and to gauge the alertness and reaction of security personnel 4 it is important to highlight that the above surveillance indicators are recorded overtly and while performing normal military policesecurity personnel activities the intent is to ra ise the awareness of our military policesecurity personnel to record and report the unusual during the course of routine and security duties freporting terrorist surveillance indicators implementing effective security countermeasures and employing overt surveillance detection principles will deter terrorist surveillance however regardless of the capabilities of facility or installation to resourc at protective measures good working relationships with local state and federal law enforcement agencies are essential to establishing cohesive timely and effective responses to t he indicators of terrorist activity commanders should coordinate and establish partnerships with local authorities ie installation threat working groups to develop intelligence and information sharing relationships to improve security for the installation and the military community at large for those occasions when the indicators of terrorist surveillance continue despite well executed overt security countermeasures the objectives should be to provide detailed reports of the indicators of surveillance to the appropriate agency or intelligence activity as reports of suspicious activity increase and the trends clearly indicate preoperational terrorist surveillance it may be necessary for commanders in coordination with senior and intelligence officials to implement more sophisticated uniquelytailored countersurveillance solutions and assets to investigate the circumstances specialized countersurveillance assets should be coordinated and vetted by forwarding requests through the chain of command via predetermined service or combatant command request procedures 4 threat levels discussions of threat level determination threat level assessments and threat warnings can be found in dod o200012h dod antiterr orism

comprehensive at program must be developed and implemented at every echelon of command the program applies wartime defensive mindset to foster protective posture at all times at programs are an integral part of cbt and fp and should be coordinated with dodd 302040 defense critical infrastructure program dcip planning coordination community cooperation and synchronization which is required for every service installation base ship unit and port acommand and control when terrorists attack dod property or personnel the national military command center becomes the operations center for the joint staff and the secdef the incident command control and reporting responsibilities for terrorist attacks on dod property or personnel belong to the geographic combatant commander within whose aor the attack has occurred for assets under the control of functional combatant commander eg commander united states special operations command the functional combatant commander will coordinate with the affected geographic combatant commander for an appropriate division of responsibilities combatant command reporting will use the national military command system bat program elements the at program stresses deterrence of terrorist incidents through preventive measures common to all combatant commands and services in order to be successful an at program must be implemented in methodical coordinated manner it cannot be stressed enough that the at program is the ultimate responsibility of the commander or in the case of dod agency the civilian equivalent who has the authority and responsibility to alter or add to the at program as deemed necessary to accommodate the local situation the minimum at program elements include risk management planning training and exercises resource generation and program reviews plans for cm and response are important adjuncts to an effective at program dodi 200016 dod antiterrorism standards provides the specific requirements for these elements

threat assessment dod through the undersecretary of defense for intelligence has developed defense threat assessment 3vulnerability assessment the va is the determination of susceptibility to attack by the broad range of terrorist threats see appendix c vulnerability assessment 4risk assessment the risk assessment combines the criticality threat and vulnerability rating given to each asset and unwanted event it uses the theory that in order for there to be risk each one of the elements criticality threat and vulnerability must be pres ent therefore risk criticality x threat x vulnerability risk is based on the value of the asset in relation to the threats and vulnerabilities associated with it risk is derived by combining the relative impact of any loss or damage to an asset criticality with the relative probability of n unwanted event threat x vulnerability see appendix d risk assessmentv4chapter v jp 3072for official use only for official use only5physical security physical

of basic personal protective measures against terrorism specific threats for the area they will operate in or transit and specializ ed training which their duty or position requires but the commander must also focus on the exposure of the troops to any special terrorist threat this requires particular attention to areas where troops will live work and conduct rr coordination between military intelligence ci and agencies and hn forces is critical the deployed military member must also understand the threat and required personal security measures 3 design basis threat design basis threat dbt is the threat against which an asset must be protected and upon which the protective systems design is based it is the baseline type and size of threat that buildings or other structures are designed to withstand the dbt includes the tactics aggressors will use against the asset and the tools weapons and explosives employed in these tactics dbt is defined in technical manual tm 5853 security engineering and the military handbook 101312 it is also included in ufc 401001 dod minimum antiterrorism standards for buildings b the dbt is used by engineering and facilities personnel to protect personnel and mission with proper design it is important that the threat used as basis of design be steady state threat and realistic this value is used as the beginning input to the design loads which the building structure will have to support or withstand during the life of the building c installations can determine the dbt by identifying the highest threat severity and tactic that they will likely face alternatively they can incorporate the dbt specified by higher hq if higher hq guidance does not provide dbt the installation should establish and incorporate dbt for use by

applicable onbase for locations such as vehicle parked next to building continue to be aware of the threat shift between onbase threat and offbase threat if the security measures at the acp change to allow the threat easy access to the installation 4 barrier planning the current environment is dynamic and terrorism is real evolving and continues to increase in frequency and lethality vehicle bombs have proven to be viable method of terrorist attacks the wide availability of bomb making material ability to conceal explosives in vehicles and ease of getting vehicles to target has made this successful tactic commanders must manage or mitigate the risk of vehicle bomb attack by hardening facilities or establishing standoff standoff effective and cost efficient is accomplished by effective facility barriers the barrier plan represents the interrelationship interdependency between threat required standoff and wall window or structure strength see figure vi6 similar to all triangles when one of these parameters changes the other sides must also change when any two of these are known the third can be solved using blast range to effect information b installations should develop barrier

facilities trained department of public works security engineering personnel would also facilitate development of the barrier plan c barrier plan developers should provide sufficient details in the barrier plan to ensure it can be effectively and efficiently executed the plan should be refined at least annually to incorporate lessons learned from previous efforts barrier plan execution should be resourced to include the time required for barrier placement and availability of sufficient working heavy equipment barriers must block vehicular access to buildings diagram showing barrier placement should also represent sufficient passive barriers as outlined in field manual fm 5114 and tm 58532 at increased fpcons detailed diagramsmaps should show entire building perimeter additional barriers may be required specific barrier placement and separation should also be included and will greatly facilitate correct plan execution one note of caution when using watersandfilled barriers is to include the time required to fill the barrier not just moving the barrier to the location d plans should include sufficient detail to allow efficient and proper positioning of barriers maps should show the exact location and spacing of barriers physical locations at each facilityvi16chapter vi jp 3072for official use only for official use onlycan be marked with paint to indicate exact position or ecp and eliminate any confusion standoff requirements should increase as threat increases therefore barrier plan that progresses through each fpcon should be developed the following considerations should also be included in facility barrier plan 1determine facility to be protected determining the assets to be protected and the level of protection with acceptable risk to assets is the first step in establishing barrier plan facilities with high exposure and high concentrations of personnel should be considered at higher risk next determine the value of the asset by evaluating four factors mission criticality to the military mission criticality to the user replaceability and relative value finally determine the type of aggressors likely to threaten the asset and the likelihood of attack apply this process to all assets on the installation to determine which assets need to be protected with barri ers 2determine building elements building elements include the layout and the structural design of walls windows roofs and framing systems necessary standoff distances can then be determined for each building based on the explosive effects and the desired levels of protectionfigure vi6 barrier planning relationshipsbarrier planning relationships threat standoff distancestructural strengthsbarrier planning relationshipsvi17preventive measures and considerationsfor official use only for official use only3select standoff zone types determination of required standoff is based on operational considerations related to type of building construction and size of explosive threat standoff zones must completely surround the facility access for entry into standoff zones is through the ecp aexclusive standoff zone controlled area surrounding facility into which only service and delivery vehicles are allowed vehicles must be searched and cleared at an cp before entry is allowed ecps need not be continuously manned if few vehicles are likely to be granted entry exclusive standoff zones are usually used for areas closest to vital facilities bnonexclusive standoff zone controlled area used in conjunction with an exclusive standoff zone that provides less restrictive land use than an exclusive standoff zone where nonexclusive standoff zone is employed it encloses an exclusive standoff zone cars but not trucks may be granted uncontrolled access to nonexclusive standoff zone trucks must be searched because of the greater capacity to carry explosives ecps must be continuously manned while the facility is in operation due to the large number of vehicles likely to be allowed entry requires additional manpower cfacility clustering where there are multiple facilities subject to vehicle bomb threats in the same general area these facilities may be clustered into common standof f zones to use land and guard manpower more efficiently 4determine required standoff distances standoff distances are selected based on building construction new existing expeditionary and temporary threat severity levels and the value and availability of land if required standoff is not available or achievable alternate means to mitigate threat eg harden facility build blast wall must be evaluated decis ion made to accept additional risk or restrict use at higher fpcons 5select perimeter barriers perimeter barriers define and maintain the boundaries of the standoff zones vehicle barriers are categorized as either active or passive an active barrier requires some action either by personnel equipment or both to permitdeny entry of vehicle active barrier systems include retractable bollards drum type barriers gates and act ive tire shredders passive barrier has moving parts passive barrier effectiveness relies on its ability to absorb energy and transmit the energy to its foundation jersey barriers static bollards or posts ditches and reinforced fences are examples of passive barriers barrier selection is different for either the stationary or moving vehicle bomb tactic and should be based on current ta amoving vehicle bomb tactic in this tactic an aggressor drives an explosive laden car or truck into facility and detonates it the aggressors goal is to damage or destroy the facility and kill people this is usually suicide attack the specific barrier sel ected for defending against this tactic must physically stop the kinetic energy mass times veloci ty of moving threat vehicle at whatever speed it can attain as it approaches the barrier if the barrier cannot stop that kinetic energy reduce the speed of vehicle with serpentine andor speed bumpsvi18chapter vi jp 3072for official use only for official use onlybstationary vehicle bomb tactic in this tactic an aggressor covertly parks an explosiveladen vehicle near facility the aggressor then detonates the explosives eithe r by time delay or remote control the aggressors goal is the same as the moving vehicle tactic with the additional goal of destroying additional assets within the blast area barriers are not required to provide physical resistance to stop vehicle for this tactic 6identify ecp requirements the standoff zone entrance and exit is an ecp vehicles and personnel are granted authorization to enter the standoff zone and are searched if necessary at the ecp ecp requirements are different for exclusive and nonexclusive standoff zones the ecp into an exclusive standoff zone generally requires only single entry lane because of limited traffic into the zone it also requires an active barrier to keep vehicles from passing through unhindered the ecp need not be continuously manned and can be operated remotely if some form of communication between the facility and the ecp exists so that drivers can request entry b nonexclusive standoff zone ecp will usually need to be continuously manned and will require some form of shelter for the guard it also requires active barriers determine the number of entryexit lanes required based on the anticipated peak hourly volume of vehicles that will enter the standoff zone c if an ecp will be used at night it will need lighting to support guard searches of vehicles and verification of vehicle and driver identification security lighting also acts as psychological deterrent to potential aggressors for exclusive standoff zones the lighting may be turned off except when guard needs light to process vehicle 7establish standard operating procedures sops sops explain how active barriers are employed operated control access and outline specific roe the roe should address activating

prevent catastrophic collapse such as occurred at the murrah building in oklahoma city the remaining curves represent varying levels of protection from injuries caused mainly by glass although injuries from building wall fragmentation are also included for facilities with limited glass c the rangetoeffect chart provides an installation the capability to self assess based on this information the commander can take appropriate action to implement procedures or changes to the base structures to reduce the weapons effectiveness for example increasing the standof f from the weapon to the target building by closing roads during higher fpcons would reduce the weapons effectiveness d another use for the rangetoeffect chart is an aid to the security operations center soc the soc could contain scale map of the installation during bomb threat the bombs location and estimated size could be plotted on the base map and the best evacuation plan determined the icons along the top of the

effect of flying glass debris however these panels plus lightlyanchored frames can still be expected to be blown into rooms potentially creating blunt trauma hazards proper application is critical to the performance of the film the recommended method of application is to install the film to the outside edge of the glazing material and extend the film minimum of 14inch inside the frame bite if this method is not possible then the film should be installed to within 116inch of the visible glazing edge known as the daylight method the limitation of the daylight installation method is that the glass

to breach the compound gate enabling another element to drive vehi cleborne improvised explosive device to preselected target on the installation where it was detonated various sources 2 suicide bomber threat all individual suicide devices are based upon the simple concept of using human being to deliver bomb to target generally the bomb will have the following characteristics simple switch for initiation consisting of pushbutton or toggle switch completing an electric circuit relatively small initiation devices reduce the chanc of discovery b fragmentation such as nails ball bearings or other small metal pieces dispersed fragmentation is the primary kill mechanism in individual suicide bombing attacksvi27preventive measures and considerationsfor official use only for official use onlyc devices are generally concealed within an article of clothing worn close to the body such as vest belt or jacket however there have been instances where the explosive device is disguised to look like common innocuous object d plasticized explosive as main charge usually homemade mixture although groups with access to greater resources utilize military grade explosives many devices have backup trigger system such as an electronic timer pager or boobytrap type switch if the attacker is killed apprehended or attempts to abort the attack secondary trigger system provides an alternative initiation method 3 possible indicators of suicide bomber are as follows an individual who deliberately ignores orders to stop or attempts to circumvent security checkpoint b an individual wearing too much clothing for the prevailing weather conditions c person with suspicious bulges in his or her clothing carrying packages bags wearing satchelsbackpacks or walking with unsteady gate d individuals may exhibit wide range of characteristics such as clean shaven with closely cropped hair exhibit unusual emotional demeanor such as blank stare grin unresponsive and may perspire or appear gaunt andor ill an individual handling wires switches an actuator or dead mans switch or using an overly intense grip on any object 4 vbied threat vbied is vehicle modified to conceal and deliver large quantities of explosives to target the motive behind such incidents is to cause many casualties and gross property damage possible indicators of vbied threat are as follows noticeable sagging of the vehicle on its springs caused by the heavy weight of explosives found in it ordinarily the explosives will be placed toward the rear of the vehicle causing it to ride lower in the rear however sagging springs are not normally characteristic of trucks being used for vbieds because these vehicles are designed to carry the weight b darkened or covered windows to conceal either the vehicles contents or the actions of the driver c unusual items inside the vehicle gas cylinders wires leaflets large bags or boxes and batteries besides the normal car batteryvi28chapter vi jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyd indications of triggering device eg switch radio transmitter timer wires or ropes passing from the front seat to the rear of the vehicle visible near the driver under the seat or within arms reach the presence of the vehicle in an area where it should not be perhaps illegally parked f holes made in the vehicle body to hide explosives and then crudely covered g evidence that an interior door panel has been removed to hide explosives h the presence of powder or prills small rounded granular material left when explosive material was loaded into the vehicle i recent painting of the vehicle to cover body alterations j additional fuel tanks used to secrete explosives or to provide additional gasoline to fuel the explosive event k unusual smells eg burning time fuse gasoline fertilizer l an additional antenna on the car for radiocontrolled devices m any disturbance to the undercoating or dirt on the bottom of vehicle n indications that drivers may be associated with vbied are as follows 1 driving erratically driving too slow or too fast 2 ignoring orders to stop attempting to circumvent security checkpoint or attempting to maneuver too close to coalition assets 3 wearing inappropriate dress or grooming for the vehicle type 4 signs of nervousness sweating shaking or unusual speech patterns 5 the presence of lone driver in the vehicle this is standard for vbied operations however there could be any number of people in the vehicle if the vbied is being driven by an unsuspecting person 6 inability to operate the truck or equipment properly 7 atypical appearance terrorists may be uncharacteristically cleanshaven and have very short haircuts cutting the hair is part of the purifying ritual that many follow prior to an attackvi29preventive measures

have been determined to be as follows 1 compact sedans can carry up to approximately 500 pounds 227 kilos of explosive this gives lethal blast range of approximately 30 meters and fragmentation hazard of 381 meters 2 fullsize sedans can carry up to approximately 1000 pounds 455 kilos of explosive this gives lethal blast range of approximately 38 meters and fragmentation hazard of 534 metersvi30chapter vi jp 3072for official use only for official use only3 passenger or cargo vans can carry maximum of 4000 pounds 1818 kilos of explosive this gives lethal blast range of approximately 61 meters and fragmentation hazard of 838 meters 4 small box vans 14 ft can carry maximum of 10000 pounds 4545 kilos of explosive this gives lethal blast range of approximately 91 meters and fragmentation hazard of 1143 meters 5 box van or waterfuel trucks can carry maximum of 30000 pounds 13636 kilos of explosive this gives lethal blast range of approximately 137 meters and fragmentation hazard of 1982 meters 6 semitrailer can carry maximum of 60000 pounds 27273 kilos of explosive this gives lethal blast range of approximately 183 meters and fragmentation hazard of 2134 meters the following ttp may prove effective deterring disarming or mitigating pedestrian suicide bomber attacks 1 visual observation remains the primary method of detecting suicide bombers screening methods can also be employed such as having suspects open their coats or lift shirts at safe distance before approaching checkpoint thermal images have proven effective for standoff detection of concealed weapons on personnel provided that external clothing is not too heavy these items serve as heat sink ie block radioactive emissions and therefore are rendered as distinct spots on thermal images this technique may prove effective for detecting concealed explosives but has not been tested in this role 2 if bomber is identified orders should be issued to evacuate the area immediately minimum of 50 meters away and to take cover behind substantial barrier safe distances depend upon the mass of explosive carried by the bomber and the amount and type of fragments used distances will necessarily be constrained in urban conditions but safety zones must be considered when selecting checkpoints or establishing gate operations it should always be assumed that fragments are part of the charge as safe standoff distances are greater for fragments than for blast 3 if bomber is identified security personnel should train weapons on the bomber and maintain eye contact from behind cover ensure fields of fire have been identified and rehearsed to avoid fratricide and endangering innocent bystanders 4 separate the subject from the ied warn target that failure to comply will result in the employment of deadly force order the target to remove outer garments place them on the ground and then stand with hands raised have subject move safe distance away from clothing and then handcuffvi31preventive measures and considerationsfor official use only for official use only5 assume fail safe cell phone or radiocontrolled initiator could be used in the event that the bomber is incapacitated or hesitates this tactic would normally involve cond suspect with view of the bomber consider surveillance detection efforts to monitor the environment and deter enemy observers near the checkpoint or gate 6 if deadly force is employed bullet impact may initiate the explosive charges therefore firing on the suspect should be undertaken from cover and not be aimed at midbody 7 if the suspect is neutralized and there is explosion do not administer first aid the explosive charge should be rendered safe by authorized eod personnel only f the following are ttp to consider to mitigate the vbied threat at high risk vehicle checkpoints 1 elements headquarters element to ensure command and control b security element to provide early warning and observe flow of vehicles approaching the checkpoint c traffic sentry to operate stop point forward of and controls traffic leading to checkpoint signs in the local language should be used to communicate instructions for negotiating barriers leading to search location d search team to halt vehicles conduct searches and direct cleared vehicles onward one member should search the vehicle while the other team members provide over watch an assault element in fortified positions to overwatch checkpoint this element should be prepared to engage consistent with roe any vehicle that attempts to force its way through or poses danger to the checkpoint 2 checkpoints should present robust security posture in order to discourage threats consider employing armored vehicles and crew served weapons in overwatch positions to support dismounted troops consider an antiarmor capability for security elements serpentine vehicle maze barriersfreeway dividers can be used to slow vehicles approaching the search area vehicle maze will enable security personnel more to react to vehicle attempting to run or attack the check point as well as channel threat vehic in escape lanes to predetermined location for engagement b hasty checkpoints should take advantage of terrain featuressurrounding obstacles bridges highwayroad intersections reverse slope of hill just beyond sharp curve to slow vehicles as they approach the checkpoint deliberate checkpoints may require engineersvi32chapter vi jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyor other support to emplace obstacles and barriers to channel traffic deliberate checkpoints should include holdingsearch areas with appropriate blast protection for personnel conducting searches 3 suggested procedures instruct passengers to get out of the vehicle at predesignated and well marked search area b all passengers should be instructed to come out with arms above their heads once out of the vehicle instruct male passengers to lift their shirts in order to enable security personnel to observe waist if there is doubt have them strip c instruct one passenger to open all doors hood and trunk d consider that women and children have also carried out attacks and ensure they are disarmed as well when available use female us militaryhn security personnel to search females preferably in separate closed area if any member or personnel at the checkpoint has any doubt about the vehicle back everyone off and call for assistance 4 suggested equipment the following are mission enhancing tools at high risk checkpoint loud speaker team with linguist when linguists are not available consider using recorded audio warnings time permitting prepare and emplace signs in the local language instructing drivers what to expect and do at the checkpoint b explosive detector dog teams c use of metal detector wands for physical searches if possible in addition to crush and feel search d stingerscaltrops device that can be dragged across the road to puncture tires vehicle control and blast mitigation barriers f separate search areas for small and large vehicles consider using trenches large enough for vehicles to enter so they may be searched vehicles can pull into the ditch and open all doors prior to searchvi33preventive measures and considerationsfor official use only for official use only10 airfieldspecific threats aairfield security and local area assessments should be conducted to identify the areas of vulnerability to direct fire indirect fire and shoulder launched surface to air missile threats in terms of possible launch sites to include the airfield arrival and departure corridors thorough assessment should include the capabilities of security personnel intelligence ci and operationa l personnel as well as localhn authorities 1 criteria to identify possible direct fire indirect fire and shoulder launched surface to air missile launch sites include but are not limited to cover and concealment the ability of an object to conceal and prevent detection by friendly forces and to provide protection for the adversary from return fire b providing unobstructed view of the target c exposure time the amount of time the intended target is vulnerable from an operational attack d distance to target and the range of the adversarys weapons systems as well as target recognition for the adversary to positively identify the intended target set up time required for an adversarys fire team to assemble into an attack position f the amount of time it takes to detect an adversary fire team once their weapons are exposed 2 because potential launch sites may be located some distance outside the existing base or installation fenceline base commanders and area commanders share the responsibility to protect airfields from attack both must coordinate defensive efforts and allocate resources to detect deter and destroy this threat to airfield operations and personnel 3 the preferred method would be to deny an attacker access to potential launch sites however that may not always be possible develop and exercise contingency plans for responding to an incident of direct fire indirect fire or shoulder launched surface to air attack rapid reaction plans will facilitate the immediate capture of terrorist team even post attack to deterprevent future attacks and ease concern for air travel safety by the public at large bdirect and indirect fire threats 1 vulnerability assessments should be conducted to identify the areas from which direct and indirect fire threats can attack lucrative ground targets such as mass gathering areas parked aircraft or vehicle motor poolsvi34chapter vi jp 3072for official use only for official use only2 consider dispersal of parked aircraft to reduce damage from direct or indirect fire attacks such as rocket propelled grenades cshoulder launched surface to air missile system threats 1 the defense intelligence agencymissile and space intelligence center has flight path threat analysis simulation fptas software that allows the local commander to quant ify the areas of greatest shoulder launched surface to air missile threat fptas uses aircraft performance flight path data missile characteristics and digital terrain elevation data to generate maps depicting area from which shoulder launched surface to air missile could engage us and allied aircraft commanders have used these maps to identify flight paths with minimum exposure to the shoulder launched surface to air missile threat and have adjusted take offlanding patterns to limit their exposure and utilize areas readily secured by ground troops this software can be downloaded at the following web site httpmsicdiasmilmilms_home_pagefptas 2 air mobility command amc amc intelligence maintains database with current intelligence and operations information on select countries and airfields to include shoulder launched surface to air missile ta this assessment is used to determine the re quirement for aircraft defensive systems to counter the shoulder launched surface to air missile threat and on more basic level to determine whether nondefensive system equipped amc military and commercial aircraft will be permitted to operate into those countries or airfields this inform ation can assist the air component commander in making their own policy decisions for aircraft operations at those same locations 3 there are two areas where commanders and at officers should employ mitigation measures to counter the shoulder launched surface to air missile threat airfieldsinstall ation defense and reducing aircraft inflight susceptibility the following are points to consider in developing at plans in regards to airfieldinstallation defense and the shoulder launched surface to air missile threat 1 once an analysis of possible launch sites is accomplished prime shoulder launched surface to air missile launch sites and vulnerable areas can be isolated by expanding the airfield area of control and reducing areas of vulnerability the following mitigation measures may require coordination with localhn authorities increased physical presence at prime launch sites visual observation of security teams is strong deterrent b focused and random patrols of potential launch sites incorporate random patrols into the installation random at measures program c employment of technical equipment to detect and respond to the various threatsvi35preventive measures and considerationsfor official use only for official use only2 ensuring personnel are educated on the shoulder launched surface to air missile threat to include component recognition areas of vulnerability and reaction plans develop and provide shoulder launched surface to air missile awareness training for security force personnel and localhn authorities develop shoulder launched surface to air missile awareness program for neighborhood watch groups and local businessinstallation facilities in close proximity to airfields or along flight paths the defense intelligence agency missile nd space intelligence center has web site in their operation enduring freedom section with shoulder launched surface to air missile link that is good source of information on shoulder launched surface to air missile systems httpmsicdiasmilmilms_home_pa gessam sd_home_pagehtml b to reduce aircraft in flight susceptibility due to the shoulder launched surface to air missile threat consider the following when developing at plans 1 establishing airfield specific procedures for the use of aircrew tactical countermeasures andor tactics development and dissemination may require coordination with localhn authorities ensure aircrew awareness of launch identification and the possible ef fects of shoulder launched surface to air missile on their aircraft ensure aircrews and flight operations are tied into the amc intelligence combined risk assessment database to obtain current inform ation on airfield security assessments 2 varying arrival and departure times of aircraft stagger the arrival times of normal scheduled missions to make arrival departure and ground times harder to predict for the adversary 3 randomly change approach and departure routes as deterrent in accordance with current federal aviation administration guidelines 4 limit or discontinue use of landing lights within identified threat zones to reduce heat producingtargeting options 5 in high threat areas or when intelligence has indicated high alert status coordinate develop and practice plans for enginerunning offloads to minimize ground time 11 information operations io are part of the fp concept and complement at efforts especially in locations outside the continental united states b io are actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems while defending ones own information and information systems they apply across all phases of an operation the range of military operations and at every level of war properly managed io offer dynamic at benefits by creating an information environment around the installation that recognizes and negates enemy propaganda or activities facilitates trust and interaction wit h the community and ultimately increases and assures effectiveness of c2 effortsvi36chapter vi jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyjp 313 information operations provides doctrine and detailed discussion of io 12 community engagement historically an adequate at posture meant an established perimeter guarded acces s points random antiterrorism measures and other defensive actions consistent with the at program complementing these measures and related to information operations community engagement is tool that can be employed at the tactical level outside the perimeter by both garrison and forward deployed commanders see figure vi12 community engagement is the result of lessons learned by troops deployed to iraq afghanistan and the balkans essentially when deployed us forces become part of the local community and local interaction at various levels can either improve or decrease the force protection posture of the forces community engagement is means to acknowledge the local nationals role and standing in their own neighborhood and demonstrate the discipline confidence and professionalism of us forces the concept of community engagement grew from the traditional tactical practice of establishing listeni ng observation posts lpops when in the defense once the community and us roles are established and the informal relationship and mutual respect emerges the community will serve as informal lpops for the us location community engagement is defined as the process of increasing figure vi12 community engagementcommunity engagement patterns of normal

use onlythe commanders capability to define the local threat picture using improved situation awarene ss of the surrounding area and developing defense in depth community engagement is never the mission it is tactical an enabler that facilitates both force protection and accompli shment of the primary mission under appropriate conditions b the principles of community engagement strategy are planning training intelligence and local community interaction they are interdependent and mutually supporting 1 planning focuses on how best to apply the principles and methods of engagement with the resources available threat environment host nation agreements risk assessment and mission objectives planners should draw on the range of players in the local community to include representatives such as ngos igos and any multinational partners all of these organizations can be leveraged to help the commander develop more robust threat assessment built upon fusion of national theater and local formal and informal intelligence by planning the commander is preparing not only to shape but also to respond better the the environment through interaction with the host nation population in order to counter threats more effectively 2 training is the cornerstone of community engagement training starts with garrison or predeployment activities oriented to the region people culture history and conflict once deployed training continues to refine knowledge of the operational area based on threat and local changes 3 intelligence is integral to performing detailed threat analysis the threat analysis will assist commanders in determining which methods of community engagement are most appropriate to perform sufficient threat assessment we must recognize that intellige nce provided from national and theater levels may not provide sufficient detailed localized information that supports daytoday decision making the commander must fuse national intelligence information with information garnered through local community engagement key to the intelligence principal is the premise that every military member is part of the intellige nce effort effectively employing the force to develop an accurate intelligence picture requires supporting analysis and fusion but provides the commander with mechanism that is highly sensitive to shifts in the environment every time us personnel enter the community they must be aware of the information requirements understand the message theme or perception the commander is intent on transmitting to the local populace 4 local community interaction is the point where the us force enters the community and puts planning training and intelligence preparation to the test it is also the principal under which unit individuals build rapport with formal and informal community and entity leaders it is through community interaction that threat entities are denied complete freedom of movement crises are avoided or mitigated and critical information is gathered allowing commander to shape and respond better to the environment as interaction with the community matures measure of force protection is gained c methods of community engagement increased access to and insight within the local community is self reinforcing providing greater opportunities to engage and understand thevi38chapter vi jp 3072for official use only for official use onlylocal environment byproduct of improved situational awareness is an improved at posture that allows commanders to effectively shape the environment methods of improving interaction and establishing rapport with the local populace may include but are not limited to 1 limited unit language and cultural awareness training 2 developing area study material 3 establishing focal point for fusion of national intelligence with local information 4 developing theme or goal for local interaction which is consistently portrayed all assigned troops are the most important means and venue of communication for this message 5 improving methods of synergizing ngoigo and civil authority actions with us forces objectives 6 development of venue radio channel telephone line note box email address for locals to report issues such as inadvertent damage followup to meetings suspicious activity the same line could be used as an anonymous tip line 7 distribution of disposable cameras 8 public community meetings to discuss current events local needs us local intentions etc d by pushing into the area surrounding us locations and developing positive informal relationships with local inhabitants the terrorist freedom of movement is reduced and the probability of detecting threat movement is increased community engagement better enables us forces to recognize and counter terrorist information operations the alternative is to keep us forces restricted to confined perimeter away from local populace and perpetually portrayed as foreign occupant not member of the community by confining the us military presence to given perimeter garrison or ship the surrounding battlespace is surrendered to the enemy overall community engagement increases mutual understanding reduces uncertainty deters aggression increases rapport and helps relieve sources of instability before they become military criseschapter vii incident response and consequence management vii1for official use only for official use onlyif historical experience teaches us anything about revolutionary guerrilla war it is that military measures alone will not suffice bgen sb griffith usmc introduction to mao tsetung on guerrilla warfare 1961 1 general aincident response management is sequence of command staff and first responder actions to respond to terrorist natural disaster or other manmade accident or incident or other unique event and restore at capability the primary objective of incident response management is to mitigate the effects and number of casualties resulting from terrorist attack commande rs develop response measures to save lives preserve health and safety secure and eliminate the hazard protect property prevent further damage to the installation and maintain public confidence in the installations ability to respond to terrorist incident homeland security presidenti directive5 mandated the use of national incident management system nims using the incident command system ics bconsequence management is the preparedness and response to mitigate the consequences of an incident including the use of cbrne agents it includes mass alerting or notification capabilities disaster planning public health medical surveillance and other preparatory efforts c commanders responsibility and authority to enforce security measures and to protect persons and property is utmost in importance during any level of conflict as such it is incumbent upon the commander to plan for and be capable of reacting to terrorist attack attacks employing cbrne weapons may produce massive casualties or widespread destruction which can quickly overwhelm organic resources this situation is covered in more detail later in paragraph 5 of this chapter d the focus of incident management is on the organic assets of an installation ship or unit and the ability to cope with the situation using organic assets until outside assistance rrives dodi 200016 dod antiterrorism standards requires all commanders to prepare installation wide terrorist incident response measures and include them in the at plan the terrorist incide nt response measures should include procedures for determining the nature and scope of incidence response procedures for coordinating security fire and medical first responders and steps to reconstitute the installations ability to perform at measures to be effective incide nt response measures must be fully coordinated exercised and evaluated dodi 200018 department of defense installation chemical biological radiological nuclear and highyield explosive emergency response guidelines provides the specific requirements for response to cbrne incidentsvii2chapter vii jp 3072for official use only for official use onlye there are an unlimited number of potential terrorist incidents requiring response developing separate courses of action for each is an unrealistic task to prepare for the most probable or likely threats at plans should address at an absolute minimum each potential threat identified through the threat assessment process at plans should also maximize the us of existing plans and not reinvent sops for instance existing procedures for fire response operation center management disaster response cbrnhazardous materials hazmat response security operations and other related activities can be referenced in the document and do not need to be reproduced the goal is to have useable document that provides reference to needed information 2 incident management planning the establishment of mechanism to respond to terrorist incident is an essential ele ment of the dod at program normally the installation ship or unit commander identifies an office or section or designates personnel from various sections who act as the principal planning agency for special threats and who comprise the emergency operations center eoc see paragraph 3d during an actual crisis one effective method for determining what areas should comprise the planning and execution of the response is to use the wmd response functions b there is requirement to have separate incident management plan however dodi 200016 dod antiterrorism standards requires that the t plan address terrorist incident response measures 3 initial response aonset of terrorist incident the onset of terrorist incident begins with the detection of an unlawful act of violence or threatened violence detection may result from routine surveillance performed by an installation or facility intrusiondetection system guard or security force or an unusual incidence of an infectious disease in the case of bioterrorism an unusual incidence of an infectious disease may be an indication of terrorist activity once detection of criminal act occurs first responding security or personnel must perform an initial assessment binitial response force 1 the initial response force consists of the forces identified in the installations ships terrorist response plans with onscene command relationships and chain of command clearly established in the same sources at facilities controlled by the dod agencie s the initial response force may be under the control of senior civilian security official or dod official or senior fire official once the initial response force has responded to the incident and determined the circumstances the installation commander should activate required forces and begin notification procedures for military and civilian authorities 2 the initial response force should immediately identify and report the nature of the situation isolate the incident and contain the situation until relieved by the reaction force commander initial response fo rce actions are critical all installationsships must have trainedvii3incident response and consequence managementfor official use only for official use onlypersonnel who are aware of the threat and are capable of reacting promptly to any new development 24 hours day 3 for example if the attack is bombing ambush assassination or firebombing the terrorists may escape before additional forces arrive in these cases the initial response force should provide medical aid seal off the crime scene and secure other potential targets in case the initial attack was diversionary tactic if the event is hostagebarricade s ituation the initial response force should seal off and isolate the incident scene to ensure one enters or leaves the area the initial response force must also be prepared to locate witnesses and di rect them to safe location for debriefing the initial response force must also be prepared to interface with local or emergency service personnel hn police or military forces responding to the incident in accordance with existing hns moas andor sofas cinstallationbase commander the installationbase commander depending upon established sops should activate the installations eoc additionally the comma nder should notify specialized response forces and immediately report the incident to the appropriate superior military command eoc military investigative agency fbi civilian authorities and if foreign incident to hn authorities and the us embassy as required demergency operations center 1 the eoc coordinates information and resources to support terrorist incident response eocs should include the following core functions coordination communications resource dispatch and tracking and information collection analysis and dissemination eocs may also support multiagency coordination and joint information activities include in the eoc sops how communications are established immediately with the initial response forc at the incident site and how specially trained operational response forces preparing to take over or augment the initial response force and other critical participants are incorporated into the eoc planning decisions 2 the eoc should distribute responsibilities into four basic functions operations responsible for first responders fire security and medical hazmat bioenvironmental engineering safety and public affairs b logistics responsible for service communications power food and support shelters supplies etc c planning responsible for amending and developing plans to address the changing circumstances planning integrates wide spectrum of interagency information and intelligence data into the overall effort d administration responsible for tracking personnel casualties or fatalities notifications report and contracting services as necessaryvii4chapter vii jp 3072for official use only for official use only3 eoc emergency support function personnel should utilize available subject matter experts via reachback capability one source is the dtra operations center oc this oc provides first responders and warfighters with information on cbrne threats through online assistance including hazard analysis and prediction modeling and provides wideband infrastructure for user support the dtra oc is manned 247 and has the requisite links to act as the single point of contact for online assistance and dispatching of other dtra resources as required econfirmation 1 since jurisdiction depends on whether the incident is terrorist related it is important for the response force to identify the type of incident as quickly as possible if the fbi or hn assumes control then the response force must be prepared to coordinate the operational handover and assist as needed 2 the initial or specialized response forces may be required to provide outer perimeter security as well as be prepared to manage the entire event they must also be prepared to turn over responsibility for resolving the incident to hn security personnel if overseas or the fbi if within the united states and in the event the fbi seeks to exercise jurisdiction over the contai nment and resolution phases of the incident these installationbase forces must always prepare for the most resourcedemanding contingency this level of readiness requires considerable sustainment training f dod installation military commanders and civilian managers have responsibility and authority for initial response containment and resolution of criminal incidents that occur on dod facilities under their control prior to relinquishing that authority to the appropriate jurisdictional lead agency in all cases however command of military elements remains w ithin military channels for detailed discussion on jurisdiction authority responsibilities and other legal considerations concerning response to criminal incidents see chapter iv legal considerations and appendix k jurisdictional authority for handling terrorist incidents 4 followon response the response to terrorist incident varies depending on the nature and location of the incident generally there are four distinct phases through which an incident may evolve although many incidents do not develop beyond the first phase aphase i locally available resources phase i is the commitment of locally available incident response force irf emergency first responders and resources civilian contract guard services should not be used as part of an initial response force for terrorist incident unless there is federal law enforcement available civilian contract guard services should generally be restricted to perimeter security duties traffic control and crowd control activities all i nitial responders such as fire and medical personnel must understand and be trained to protect the incident location as crime scene within established protocols ideally ensure all or s ecurity personnel are familiar with local sops for terrorist incidents and have practiced these proceduresvii5incident response and consequence managementfor official use only for official use onlyas part of their unittraining program they must be prepared to secure contain and gather information at the scene until the beginning of phase ii while securing and containing the incident scene response forces must be alert to the fact terrorist incidents often include diversi onary tactics and secondary attacks or devices with the desired purpose of harming first responder personnel the evacuation or shelterinplace of threatened areas is high priority function bphase ii augmentation of initial response force this phase begins when the eoc is activated phase ii is the augmentation of the initial response force by additional emergency responder or specially trained response forces such as special reaction teamemergency servic team fbi hostage rescue teams hazmatcbrne containment teams or hn units on many installations the irf obtains its augmentation force from within or other personnel trained to augment the irf its during this phase that the fbi or the hn may assume jurisdictional control over the incident if that occurs installation command and the incident commander must be ready to support the operation military assets will remain under the authority of the responsible military commander the installation specially trained followon response forces must be rea dy for employment terrorist incidents conducted outside the continental us oconus against dod installations facilities or units the dos and the us embassy play the key role in coordinating the usg and host country response cphase iii commitment of counterterrorist resources phase iii is the commitment of specialized team from the fbi dod uscg or hn counterterrorist force in this phase steps are taken to terminate the incident incident termination may be the result of successful negotiations assault or other actions including the surrender or killing of the terrorists becausebasic firefighting and hazardous material response considerations sh ould be integrated with incident and consequence management planning vii6chapter vii jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyidentifying the terrorists as opposed to the hostages may be difficult it is important that the capturing forces handle and secure all initial captives as possible terrorists the mariti environment provides additional factors for consideration in phase iii threat response due to the complexities of national and international boundaries the challenges of the open ocean from the shore to the forward approaches and the positioning of us response resources the united states navy and united states coast guard have both the support and response infrastructure to address most terrorist threats when other forces are either not available or outside their capabili ty dphase iv exploitation critical to the success of ct operations is exploitation exploitation is the collection analysis and interrogation of materiel and personnel with the expectant result of gaining information and intelligence which will lead to additional at and ct operations either regionally or globally exploitation is complementary and not to the exclusion of evidentiary requirements for prosecution of terrorists or their supporters 5 initial response to chemical biological radiological nuclear and high yield explosives attack installations are required to establish an immediate response capability to ensure crit ical mission continuity and save lives during cbrne incident and to mitigate the situation in accordance with dodi 200018 department of defense installation chemical biological radiological nuclear and highyield explosive emergency response guidelines national level responders may not be immediately accessible or available to respond to an installati onsproper

emergencies vii7incident response and consequence managementfor official use only for official use onlyneeds therefore each installation must plan for the worstcase scenario by tailoring its response for each functional area based on its organic resources and available local support through moasmous the situation may dictate that the installation not only conducts the init ial response but also sustains response operations b in the event of terrorist cbrne incident the commander should direct the following complementary sets of actions 1 activate mass notification telling personnel to shelter in place evacuate or take other appropriate action 2 activate the installations initial response elements and local moasmou s 3 initiate the dod notification process 4 request resources to augment the installations response capabilities c installation commanders are responsible for ensuring their first responders have plan and are equipped trained and exercised on the plan for

appropriate investigative agency it is also imperative to record every action that occurred during the incident gafter action reporting conducting comprehensive reviews after an incident is as critical as conducting reviews or lessons learned evaluations after an exercise information from all levels of the command concerning positive negative and neutral factors that contributed to the

subjective assessments but are not specifically tailored for at assessments while the msharpp and carver processes are optional methodologies for those who area2appendix jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyfamiliar with their use both have design limitations and are best used only as an adjunct to the risk assessment combination of the criticality threat and vulnerability assessment ra tings and management methodology d the purpose of the criticality assessment process is to identify and prioritize all asse ts on an installation assets include personnel equipment stockpiles buildings or transportation systems that are deemed critical as defined by dodd 302040 defense critical infrastructure program there are many different types of assets critical to mission accomplishment and it is important not to exclude some assets because they are not necessarily missionessential or physically located on the installation for example telephone switching facility locate d off base may be essential to communications if alternative systems are not identified the re may also be assets on the installation which are not critical to the direct operation of the insta llation but are critical to dod it may also be useful to link identified threat attack means to specific time period or location for example terrorist group operating in the proximity of the installation may typically target areas such as schools or the commissary andor exchange that contain large number of people at certain times f when determining asset criticality use of the following criteria shall assist in st andardizing the process 1 importance measures the value of the area or assets located in the area considering their function inherent nature and monetary value 2 effect measures the ramification of terrorist incident in the area considering the psychological economic sociological and military impacts 3 recoverability measures the time required for the function occurring at that area to be restored considering the availability of resources parts expertise and manpower and redundancies even if dod asset is injured damaged or destroyed it may have future value in the accomplishment of other dod missions or be of great symbolic value to dod the us government and the american people consideration should therefore be given to the resources that must be expended to recover an asset and in some cases repair it for return to service with dod in the future 4 mission functionality measures key positions special facilities specialize d equipment etc used to fulfill assigned missions 5 substitutability are there substitutes available for personnel facilities or mate riel can assigned missions be performed using substitutes if the substitutes are less capable can the mission still be accomplished successfully 6 repairability if dod asset is injured or damaged can it be repaired and rendered operable how much would it cost could repairs be accomplished in timely manner woulda3criticality assessmentfor official use only for official use onlyrepairs degrade asset performance and if so can the mission be accomplished in the degraded condition 3 suggested methodologies installation commanders are encouraged to use risk assessment tool that is simple yet has some quantifiable logic to help in decision making assessment teams shall use the methodology to determine terrorist options against specific targets and use them as examples of protection strategies discussed in this appendix the suggested tools each have their strengths and weaknesses with regard to their applicability to particular threat situation use the t ool most appropriate to your particular environment as an example carver is not specifically tailored for at assessments although it can be used likewise msharpp is targeting nalysis tool geared more closely to assessing personnel vulnerabilities assessment team mem bers should be cognizant of potential gaps when choosing one methodology over another the use of the joint staff cv amp shall assist commanders and tos in managing their commands vulnerabilities and associated funding requirements b msharpp 1 the purpose of the msharpp matrix is to analyze likely terrorist targets consideration is given to the local threat likely means of attack available to the enemy and variables affecting the disposition eg attractiveness to enemy potential psychologica l effect on community of potential targets this section provides an example of how to use msharpp 2 after developing list of potential targets use the msharpp selection factors to assist in further refining your assessment by associating weapontactic to potential tar get to determine the efficiency effectiveness and plausibility of the method of attack and to identi fy vulnerabilities related to the target after the msharpp values for each target or component are assigned the sum of the values indicates the highest value target for particular mode of attack within the limits of the enemys known capabilities 3 mission mission focuses mainly on the threat to the situations activities capabilities and resources on an installation that are vulnerable to terrorist attack the mission components consist of the equipment information facilities andor operations or activities that are necessary to accomplish the installations mission when assessing points in this area determine whether or not an attack on mission components shall cause degradation by assessing the components 1 importance importance measures the value of the area or assets located in the area considering their function inherent nature and monetary value 2 effect effect measures the ramifications of terrorist incident in the area considering the psychological economic sociological and military impactsa4appendix jp 3072for official use only for official use only3 recuperability recuperability measures the time required for the function occurring at that area to be restored considering the availability of resources parts expertise and manpower and redundancies b mission criteria scale assess points to the target equipment information facilities andor operations or activities scale of 15 5 being worst in this area based upon the degree of mission degradation if attacked by terrorist 1 one destroying or disrupting this asset would have effect on the ability of the installation to accomplish its mission 2 two the installation could continue to carry out its mission if this asset were attacked albeit with some degradation in effectiveness 3 three half of the mission capability remains if the asset were successfully attacked 4 four ability to carry out primary mission of the installation would be significantly impaired if this asset were successfully attacked 5 five installation cannot continue to carry out its mission until the attacked asset is restored 4 symbolism consider whether the target represents or is perceived by the enemy to represent symbol of targeted group eg symbolic of us military religion government authority assess points in this area based upon the symbolic value of the target to the enemy symbolism criteria scale one low profile or obscure symbol demonstrates strength or capability not common knowledge b two low profile direct symbol local publicity demonstrates new capability or willingness c three symbolic achieves limited global publicity demonstrates new capability or willingness d four prominent symbol global publicity demonstrates previously unconfirmed capability or willingness five high profile direct symbol sustained global publicity demonstrates previously unknown capability or willingnessa5criticality assessmentfor official use only for official use only5 history do terrorist groups have history of attacking this type of target while you must consider terrorist trends worldwide focus on local targeting history and capabilities history criteria scale one little or history of attacking this type of asset b two difficult to recognize under any condition requires training for recognition limited open source information architecture or signage exists c three recent credible threats against this type of asset d four historically common target attacks against this asset has occurred in the past general threat against this type of asset five favored target recent attacks within the local geographic area credible threat against this type of asset 6 accessibility target is accessible when an operational element can reac h the target with sufficient personnel and equipment to accomplish its mission target can be accessible even if it requires the assistance of knowledgeable insiders this assessment entails i dentifying and studying critical paths that the operational element must take to achieve its objecti ves and measuring those things that aid or impede access the enemy must not only be able to reach the target but must also remain there for an extended period one not accessible without extreme difficulty attempted surveillance is extremely difficult or easily detected b two protected perimeter defense in depth and detection capability not easily surveilled few hostile surveillance locations and little open source information exis t perimeter penetration required c three protected perimeter limited defense in depth and detection capability easily surveilled hostile surveillance locations and open source information exist d four limited perimeter protection defense in depth and detection capability easily surveilled multiple hostile surveillance locations and open source information five perimeter protection defense in depth or detection capability surveillance can be conducted at will 7 recognizability targets recognizability is the degree to which it can be recognized by an operational element andor intelligence collection and reconnaissance asset under varying conditions weather has an obvious and significant impact on visibility friendly and enemy rain snow and ground fog may obscure observation road segments with sparse vegetation and adjacent high ground provide excellent conditions for good observation distance lighta6appendix jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyand season must be considered other factors that influence recognizability include the size and complexity of the target the existence of distinctive target signatures the presence of mas king or camouflage and the technical sophistication and training of the enemy recognizability criteria scale one cannot be recognized under any conditions except by experts little useful or open source information architecture or signage exists b two difficult to recognize under any condition requires training for recognition limited open source information architecture or signage exists c three difficult to recognize at night or in bad weather or might be confused with other targets requires training for recognition limited open source information architecture or signage exists d four easily recognizable and requires small amount of training for recognition some open source information architecture or signage serve to reveal the nature of the asset 8 population population addresses two factors quantity of personnel and their demography demography asks the question who are the targets depending on the ideology of the terrorist groups being member of particular demographic group can make someone or some group more likely target one people present or infrequently populated by very few people contains people that the terrorist group considers desirable to avoid harming b two sparsely populated prone to having small groups or individuals little target value based on demographics of occupants c three moderate number of people known target group may be present special segment necessary for mission accomplishment 9 proximity is the potential target located near other personnel facilities or resources that because of their intrinsic value or protected status and fear of collateral damage afford it some form of protection eg near national monuments protectedreligious symbols that the enemy holds in high regard one asset is adjacent to assets that are undesirable to attack or damage b two asset is isolated access to other assets c three asset is isolated however access to this asset would allow acces s to other assetsa7criticality assessmentfor official use only for official use only10 in an msharpp worksheet values from 1 to 5 are assigned to each factor based on the associated data for each target five represents the highest vulnerability or likelihood of attack and 1 the lowest accordingly the higher the total score the more vulnerable the target because this analysis is highly subjective some analysts prefer simple stoplight chart s with red yellow and green markers representing descending degrees of vulnerability the msharpp analysis must consider both the present fp posture and enhanced postures proposed for escalating fpcons specific target vulnerabilities must be combined with exploitable perimeter c ontrol vulnerabilities if access routes are well protected and not deemed exploitable an otherwise vulnerable building becomes less likely target c carver 1 carver is very useful tool for determining that your critical assets might indeed offer an enemy good or soft target if you employ the very same carver analysis to every asset it shall yield good estimate as to the attractiveness of those assets to an nemy specifically commanders shall then know which targets require hardening or otherwise increased protection 2 the acronym carver represents the following criticality the importance of system subsystem complex or component target is critical when its destruction or damage has significant impact on the output of the targeted system subsystem or complex and at the highest level on the units ability to make war or perform essential functions criticality depends on several factors 1 how rapidly shall the impact of asset destruction affect the units essential functions 2 what percentage of output and essential functions is curtailed by asset damage 3 is there an existence of substitutes for the output product or service 4 what is the number of assets and their position in the system or complex flow diagram 5 criticality asks the question how critical is the asset to your mission accomplishment b accessibility the ease that an asset can be reached either physically or by standoff weapons an asset is accessible when terrorist element can physically infil trate the asset or the asset can be hit by direct or indirect fire as reminder assets can be people pla ces or things the use of standoff weapons should always be considered when evaluating accessibility survivability of the attacker is usually most related to targets accessibility accessibility asks the question how easily can an enemy get access to or have their weapons reach the asseta8appendix jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyc recuperability measure of time required to replace repair or bypass the destruction or damage inflicted on the target recuperability varies with the sources and ages of targeted components and with the availability of spare parts the existence of economic embar goes and the technical resources of the installation shall influence recuperability recuperabili ty asks the question how long would it take you to repair or replace the asset d vulnerability measure of the ability of the terrorist to damage the target using available assets people and material target asset is vulnerable if the terrori st has the means and expertise to successfully attack it vulnerability depends on 1 the nature of the construction of the target 2 the assets available manpower transportation weapons explosives and equipment to defend the asset 3 vulnerability asks the questions is the asset literally hardened or guarded are measures in place to mitigate any threat effect on the population the positive or negative influence on the population as result of the action taken effect not only considers the public reaction in the vicinity of the target but also considers the domestic and international reaction as well will reprisa ls against friendlies result will national psychological operations psyop themes be contradicted or reinforced will exfiltration and evasion be helped or hurt will the enemy population be alienated from its government or shall it become supportive of the government effect is often neutral at the tactical level effect asks the question what is the effect on the l ocal population be it terror or demoralization and associated mission degradation f recognizability the degree that target can be recognized under varying weather light and seasonal conditions without confusion with other targets or components 1 factors that influence recognizability include the size and complexity of the target the existence of distinctive target signatures and the technical sophistic ation and training of the terrorists 2 recognizability asks the question can the enemy recognize the target for what it truly is and its importance 3 target selection requires detailed intelligence and thorough planning and is based on the carver factors identified above the carver matrix is decision tool for rating the relative desirability of potential targets and for wisely allocating attack resources tw rules of thumb apply for completing the matrix for strategic level analysis list systems and subsystemsa9criticality assessmentfor official use only for official use onlyb for tactical level analysis list complexes or components of subsystems and complexes keep in mind that the scale can be adjusted such as one to ten or 10 to 100 provided that consistency is observed 4 after completing the matrix for all assets total the scores and then rank order those totals to prioritize vulnerabilities 5 the following are basic mitigation tips to address four of the six carver components reduce criticality as practicable have backup device system or tested plan to afford mission accomplishment without the asset create redundancy either physically or operationally have tested and viable coop plan and have fallback site for conducting the same mission from another location b reduce accessibility reduce access both physical and cyber as applicable use barriers other barricades carefully controlled pedestrian and vehicle movement andor access and parking and use fences remote motion sensors and remote video surveillance c reduce vulnerability harden the structure andor immediate environment to include window treatment to prevent glass shards structural reinforcement and shatterproof and fireproof building materials move vehicle parking and access sufficiently away from personnel massing facilities d reduce recognizability delete location and purpose of facility from all base maps and remove building signs that describe function or give title of unit in facility instruct telephone operators to not give out number or existence of facility use plant cover including trees and bushes to partially conceal facility particularly from roads 4 criticality assessment matrix the purpose of criticality assessment matrix is to determine the criticality of ea ch asset which shall also help to prioritize them for each asset the assessment team shall assign values for each criteria based on scale such as one to ten the assessment team must det ermine what criteria to use b once all asset values are tallied they can be rankordered such that highest score is most critical and lowest score is least critical however it is important to emphasize that not all assets in the matrix shall be essential for mission accomplishmenta10appendix jp 3072for official use only for official use

threat to dod personnel and facilities the at ta is used to identify the terrorist threats posed to dod as sets andor the threats that could be encountered in executing mission 2 threat assessment the ta system is vital to developing and disseminating terrorism warnings specific warning information time date place those involved and method of attack is rarely voluntarily provided by terrorists careful threat analysis is required to detect and correctly evaluate preincident indicators of terrorist attack so timely warning messages can be iss ued b threat analysis provides the intelligence officer with information upon which to base warnings c threat information for at programs is diverse and includes foreign intelligence open source materials domestic criminal information and information from federal state and local governments d standardized format for the defense threat assessment dta has been promulgated by the office of the undersecretary of defense counterintelligence

terrorist groups the annual ta seeks to identify the full range of feasible terrorist capabilities weapons tacti cs techniques and methods of attack that could reasonably be used against the installation or its personnel even in the absence of current known threat group an assessment is necessary input to the required annual va and for planning physical and procedural countermeasures annual tas should include all likely or feasible wmd including cbrne threats cthreat matrix although not required one tool that may assist in the preparation of the ta and at plan is the threat matrix preparation of the annual ta requires careful analysis of known local threats together with estimates of relevant national and transnational threat capabilities locally derived opensource information regarding the availability of weapons and component materials in the area is also necessary in developing the range of threats threat analysts preparing the assessment should differentiate threats likely to be used inside the pe rimeter from those more likely to be used outside the perimeter to aid in the va and development of countermeasures the threat matrix unambiguously establishes the range of specific threat capabilities that shall be used to analyze vulnerabilities and plan countermeasures the threat matrix is planning tool which ensures that security and procedural countermeasures are economically designed to counter specific threats or mitigate specific vulnerabilities nd that the risk remaining is well understood by commanders making risk acceptance decisions d both installation and unit commanders shall assess the terrorist threat for probability and severity of occurrence probability is the estimate of the likelihood that threat shall caus an impact on the mission or hazard to the installation severity is an estimate of the threat in terms of the degree of injury property damage or other missionimpairing factors by combining estimates of severity and probability an assessment of risk can be made for each threat matrix may be used to assist in identifying the level of risk the outcome of this process is prioritized list of threats the highest priority threat is the one that poses the most serious ris k in terms of likelihood and severity this list of prioritized threats shall be used to evaluate the acceptability of certain risks and which risks for which to make decisions concerning the employment of resources and other actions that reduce vulnerability this assessment should be recorded as recordbaseline and updated regularly as the threat changes services and combatant commanders may develop separate more complete methodologies for assessment if installation and unit commanders do not have the resources to assess the threat for probability and severity of occurrence they should coordinate with their next higher echelon to assist with this requirement tas of specific operations missions or events may also be conducted to identify specific threats to the conduct of those activities f in addition to preparing an annual ta commanders must also continuously assess local threat information so appropriate fpcons can be set

introduction as discussed in chapter v antiterrorism program installation base ship unit and port the risk assessment ra combines criticality threat and vulnerability assessm ents in order to provide more complete picture of the risks to an asset or group of assets this appendix describes the methodology commanders and civilian equivalents can use to assess risk 2 risk assessment methodology the ra is logical stepbystep method and shall require the participation of the entire staff in starting the ra process commanders should examine three elements threat critical ity and vulnerability 1threat the threat is determined through proper and thorough ta the ta should identify the likelihood and severity of the terrorist to inflict injury to person or damage to facility or asset by considering terrorist capability intent and objectives to enable commanders to focus their analysis the ta should also specify the type of weapons or acts the terrorist shall use to initiate the event assassination bomb etc 2asset criticality critical assets are determined by both the term and the measure of importance to the installations mission areas that encompass multiple critica l assets are referred to as critical areas the criticality assessment provides information to prioriti ze assets and allocate resources to special protective actions 3vulnerability thorough v shall highlight the susceptibility of person group unit facility or asset to damaging incident vas should also address the capabilities of re sponse elements to plan those activities that support the installations ability to either ter andor respond to terrorist threats and incidents for example v might reveal weaknesses in an organizat ions security systems financial management processes computer networks or unprotected key infrastructure such as water supplies bridges and tunnels there may be several vulnerability assessments conducted on an installation eg water vulnerability cbrne vulnerability the findings of these functional area vulnerability assessments must be included in the overall installation assessment b during the ra process the commander must consider all of the aforementioned elements to make wellinformed decisions when planning fpcon measure implementation and terrorist incident response measures the ra and management process described here does not dictate how to conduct the assessment nor does it discuss how to identify deficiencies and vulnerabilities it outlines what type of information to collect and how to organize and display that information for decision making if the installation does not have the resident expertise to conduct an at ra consider using jsiva andor combatant commander or service at assessment reportsd2appendix d jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyvulnerabilities and deficiencies gathered from these useful reports can be plugged directly into the methodology outlined in this appendix c given the resourceconstrained environment in which installations now operate installation commanders or their civilian equivalents require method to assist them in ma king resource allocation decisions to protect the installation from possible terrorist threats fp measure implementation and other mitigation efforts and to most effectively respond should terrorist incident occur response measures risk management is the process of identifying assessing and controlling risks arising from operational factors and making decisions that balance risk costs with mission benefits the risk management process allows installation com manders to use representative operational risk as one of the principal factors in their decisionmaking process in this context representative risk shows the relative impact on an installations ssets given stated attack representative risk is not prediction that terrorist incident sha ll occur d the example below shall focus on vulnerabilities of critical assets this same met hodology can be applied to other areas of interest such as response capability it is also important to emphasize that this methodology is merely tool to assist commanders and civilian equivale nts in assessing and managing risk 3 assessing risk practical exercise this example presumes that commander has completed the threat criticality and v as the process begins by creating an asset ra table in addition to isolated assets areas can be assessed in terms of the criticality of the assets located within it and its vulnerabil ity to specific threats the installation assessment team shall rate each asset for every type of thre at identified in the ta b to complete the ra table begin by determining the asset to be examined create and label the row with the asset and label each column as illustrated in figure d1 1attack means method by which the asset would be attacked different groups may present several different attack methods based on what weapons they possess and the methods they use sample attack means include small arms fire cartruck bomb chemical weapons biological weapons etc use the information from chapter v antiterrorism program installation base ship unit and port 2criticality obtained from the information gathered in chapter vi preventive measures and considerations 3vulnerability obtained from the information gathered in chapter vii incident response and consequence management c an example consider command post located in building on military installation the building is constructed of 12 inch concrete walls has windows and the ventilation systemd3risk assessmentfor official use only for official use onlyis not filtered redundant command post exists however several hours would be required before it could be fully operational because the command post is necessary to carry out the mission criticality is 9 out of 10 the vulnerability is 1 from small arms fire because small arms are unlikely to penetrate 12 inches of concrete and windows exist to shoot into the vulnerability from cartruck bomb is higher because there is traffic flow control around the building the chemical warfare and biological warfare attack means are both high vulnerabilities because the ventilation system is unfiltered d it is important to note that this rating system is not meant to be precise science it is one method of quantifying subjective decision in order to generally prioritize areas in terms of risk 4 risk assessment figure d1 gives the final ra for each asset the assets can be prioritized based on the ra the decision maker is required to determine the maximum amount of risk that is acceptable b the risk can also be represented graphically using the ra graph figure d2 the graph shall combine the criticalityvulnerabilityattack means the xaxis and the threat p robability the yaxis to represent the risk the representative risk is an expression of the relative impact on an asset or planning and response element given stated attack means representative risk does not attempt to forecast risk eg assign predictability or likelihood c standard methodology exists for establishing risk levels and their determination shall vary from installation to installation based on the commanders judgment although this process is subjective commanders can focus their decision on where to establish the minimum risk by considering the following questionsfigure d1 example asset risk assessment tableelbattnemssessaks irtessaelpmaxe tsopdnammoc tessa snaemkca t ta cy t i l ac i t i rc 011 v t i l i ba r l uv 011y t i l i babo rpt ae r

installation va 3 where are the nearest available resources that could augment the installation should an incident occur does the commander have tasking authority for those resources v 5 completing the process risk management the end products of the above process shall be the identification of areas and assets that are vulnerable to the identified attack means and the development of associated assessment tables from the information developed from all assessments criticality threat vulnerabil ity and risk and the ra graph the commander shall make decision on how best to employ given resources and force protection measures to deter mitigate or prepare for terrorist incident installation commanders should document their risk management methodology b there are several ways to reduce risk the decision maker does not easily control two of those methods reducing the threat and reducing the criticality the one method that is controllable is reducing the vulnerability of an

the above example and considering only the command post it is apparent that the highest risk is from cartruck bomb what are some ways of reducing the vulnerability 1 set up barriers to control traffic flow around the command post the further away prospective cartruck bomb detonation the less impact it will have on the intended target another alternative is to control the traffic coming onto the installation if several buildings exist that require protection from cartruck bombs then cars and trucks can be searched more thoroughly at the entrance to the facility if bombs arent allowed to enter the facility then the risk is greatly reduced 2 determine why it takes several hours to place the redundant command post in full operation this may only require simple policy change or prepositioning of equipment but the result shall be less vulnerability due to redundancy d at the end of the ra and risk management process the commander must engage and concur with the entire assessment in order to focus the next steps in risk management process taking action the use of cv amp shall assist commanders and atos in this effortd6appendix d jp 3072for official use only for official use

planningexecution assumptions all critical assumptions used as basis for this plan assumptions are those factors unlikely to change during the implementation of the at plan and that must be addressed in order to continue to plan they can range from the installations troop strength to addressing the local politicalsocial environment example s follow 1 the installation is vulnerable to theft pilferage sabotage and other threats the installation is also vulnerable to wmd attack 2 an act of terrorism involving wmd can produce major consequences that will overwhelm almost immediately the capabilities of the installation 3 security personnel both military and civilian may be insufficient to provide total protection of all installation resources therefore the principal owner or user of facility resource or personnel must develop adequate unit awareness and safeguard measures 4 single unit on the installation possesses the expertise to act unilaterally in response to attacks 5 if protective equipment is not available responders will not put their own lives at risk 6 local nonmilitary response forces will arrive within time of notification 7 units specializing in wmd response will arrive onsite within number of hours based on installation location of notification 8 the hn is supportive of us policies and will fulfill surge requirements needed to respond to wmd incident in accordance with moasmous fintelligence the person staff or unit responsible for intelligence collection and dissemination the installation commander must have system in place to access curre nt intelligence this can be included in annex b intelligence nationallevel agencies comba tant commanders and intelligence systems provide theater or country threat levels and threat assessments in the us and its territories local installations must obtain the local terrorist threat information by querying the fbi through the installations law enforcement liaison local law enforcement or other federal agencies obtain these assessments as they will serve as baseline for the installations tailored assessment the installation should have proc ess in place for developing the installations tailored threat assessment or local threat pict ure the installations tailored threat assessment should be continuously evaluated updated and disseminated as appropriate and as directed by the installation commander the commande re4appendix jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyshould determine the frequency and the means of dissemination of the installations tailored at product note commanders cannot change the threat level which is developed at the national level although they can declare higher fpcons than the baseline 2mission clear concise statement of the commands mission and the at purpose or goal statement supporting the mission the primary purpose of the at plan is to safeguard personnel property and resources during normal operations it is also designed to detect and deter terrorist threat enhance security and at awareness and to assign at responsibiliti for installation personnel 3execution acommander s intent commanders vision on how heshe sees the execution of the units at program refer to service planning doctrine for assistance bconcept of operations how the overall at operation should progress this plan stresses deterrence of terrorist incidents through preventive and response measures common to all combatant commands and services during daytoday operations the installation should stress continuous at planning and passive defensive operations this paragraph should provide subordinates sufficient guidance to act if contact or communications with the installation c hain of command is lost or disrupted 1 the installations at concept of operations should be phased in relation to pre incident actions and postincident actions at planning and execution requires that staff eleme nts work with much greater degree of cohesiveness and unity of mission than that required during the conduct of normal base sustainment operations the at mission and the unpredictability of its execution requires very specific how to implementation instructions of dod fpcon measures and in what manner these actions must be coordinated this how to element is not normally included in the concept of operations paragraph however the necessity to provide how to guidance in the at plan requires different manner of data presentation to ensure brevity and clarity the implementation instructions are put into the form of action sets and can be displayed in the form of an execution matrix preincident action set matrix 2 in postincident planning the installation should focus on its response and reconstitution responsibilities upon notification of terrorist incident and the procedures for obtaining technical assistanceaugmentation if the incident exceeds the installat ions organic capabilities nationallevel responders federal emergency management agency fema red cross and fbi may not be immediately accessible or available to respond to an installations needs therefore each installation must plan for the worstcase scenario by planning its response based on its organic resources and available local support through moamous 3 the situation may dictate that the installation not only conduct the initial response but also sustained response operations many installations do not have onboard wmd officers or response elements this paragraph will include specific implementation instructions for l operational areas and the

needed in basic barrier planning without background threat vulnerability criticality and mission information it is difficult to determine spe cifically why certain areas of this fictitious base are protected at different times or why they do not need more barriers at different fpcons barrier plan considerations and research requirements listed in chapter vi preventive measures and considerations have been considered elsewhere the complete barrier plan would have tabs for each fpcon which provide more detail and specify exact barrier locations 2 example in this example the first page figure g1 gives an overview of the base with all areas identified the various areas buildings and facilities have been identified and each has individual requirements based on the fpcon the overview slide also provides point of contact and outlines basic resource requirements to accomplish the effort b the second page figure g2 is tab to the overall plan and shows detail for protecting area s the premise in

response to terrorist threat to us military facilities and personnel as directed by dodd 200012 dod antiterrorism at program these security measures are approved by the joint chiefs of staff and are designed to facilitate interservice coordination and support of us military at activities they re outlined in dod o200012h dodi o200016 dod antiterrorism handbook appendix 3 dod fpcon system when installations adapt these measures for their sitespecific circumstances they should account for as minimum combatant commanderservice requirements local laws and sofas per dodi 200016 dod antiterrorism standards fpcon measures are for official use only an at plan with complete listing of sitespecific at meas ures linked to an fpcon shall be classified as minimum confidential when separated from the at plan specific measures and fpcon measures remain for official use only b the fpcon system is the principal means through which military commander or dod civilian exercising equivalent authority applies an operational decision on how to best guard against the threat these guidelines shall assist commanders in reducing the effect of terrorist and other security threats to dod units and activities c creating additional duties andor watches and heightening security enhance the commands personnel awareness and alert posture these measures display the commands resolve to prepare for and counter the terrorist threat these actions shall convey to anyone observing the commands activities that it is prepared and an undesirable target and that the terrorists should look elsewhere for vulnerable target d the dod system is generally not applicable to dod elements for which the com has security responsibility and may have limited application to dod elements that are tena nts on installations and facilities not controlled by us military commanders or dod civilian exe rcising equivalent authority still commanders of us elements on nonus installations can execute many fpcon measures that do not involve installation level actions at least to limit ed degree the terminology definitions and specific recommended security measures are designed to facilitate interservice coordination and support for the cbt efforts of the dod components 2 force protection conditions there are five fpcons supporting measures for each condition are listed in appendix 3 of dod o200012h the circumstances that apply and the purposes of each protective posture are as follows fpcon normal applies when general global threat of possible terrorist activity exists and warrants routine security postureh2appendix h jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyb fpcon alpha applies when there is an increased general threat of possible terrorist activity against personnel or facilities the nature and extent are unpredictable alpha asures must be capable of being maintained indefinitely c fpcon bra vo applies when an increased or more predictable threat of terrorist activity exists sustaining bra vo measures for prolonged period may affect operational capability and relations with local authorities d fpcon charlie applies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely prolonged implementation of charlie measures may create hardship and affect the activities of the unit and its personnel fpcon delta applies in the immediate area where terrorist attack has occurred or when intelligence has been received that terrorist action against specific location or pers on is imminent normally this fpcon is declared as localized condition fpcon delta asures are not intended to be sustained for substantial periods 3 force protection condition responsibilities geographic combatant commanders shall ensure that fpcons are uniformly implemented and disseminated within their aor 1 all military commanders and dod civilians exercising equivalent authority are responsible for ensuring that their subordinates fully understand fpcon declaration procedures and fpcon measures 2 while there is direct correlation between threat reporting and fpcons such information assists commanders in making prudent fpcon declarations existence of threat reporting in and of itself should not be the only factor used in determining fpcons fpcon declaration should be based on multiple factors that may include but are not limited to threat target vulnerability criticality of assets security resource availability operati onal and physiological impact damage control recovery procedures international relations and planned us government actions that could trigger terrorist response b the fpcon system allows all military commanders and dod civilians exercising equivalent authority the flexibility and adaptability to develop and implement at measures tha t are more stringent than those mandated by higher authorities whenever fpcons are invoked each set of fpcon measures is the minimum that must be implemented when change in local threat warrants change in fpcon or when higher authority directs an increase in fpcon authorities directing implementation may augment their fpcon by adding measures from higher fpcons as necessary 1 military commanders or dod civilians exercising equivalent authority may implement additional fpcon measures from higher fpcons on their own authority developh3force protection condition systemfor official use only for official use onlyadditional measures specifically tailored for sitespecific security concerns or declare higher fpcon for their operational areainstallation 2 subordinate military commanders or dod civilians exercising equivalent authority at any level may not lower an fpcon or implement measures that are less rigorous than those appropriate for the declared fpcon waivers for not complying with prescribed fpcon measures may be obtained by following the procedures in paragraph 6 below 3 it is essential for military commanders and dod civilians exercising equivalent authority to implement formal analytical processes that result in set of operational area or localityspecific terrorist threat indicators and warnings for use when transitioning from lower to higher fpcons threat credibility and if known duration operational environment both hn and dod asset criticality mission impact and measures in place that contribute to mitigating the current threat are but few of the important elements commanders should consider when calibrating fpcon postures such processes and measures should be harmonized to the maximum degree possible taking fully into account differences in threat vulnerability criticality and ri sk of resources requiring protection 4 military commanders dod civilians exercising equivalent authority and their staffs shall examine the threat physical security terrorist attack consequences and ssion vulnerabilities in the context of specific dod activities and the declared fpcon when fa ctors are combined and the collective terrorist threat exceeds the ability of the current physical sec urity system barriers surveillance and detection systems security personnel and dedicated response forces to provide the level of asset protection required then implementation of higher fpcons or additional measures is appropriate 4 force protection condition management and implementation implementation of fpcons does not come without adverse effects on daytoday operations the additional costs can be measured and described both quantitatively and qualitatively the dod fpcon system acknowledges cost as significant factor bearing on the selection and maintenance of fpcons fpcons alpha and bravo include measures that can be sustained for extended periods consistent with the terrorist threat 5 random antiterrorism measures management and implementation commanders and dod civilians exercising equivalent authority should randomly change their at ttp so that they ensure robust security posture from which terrorists cannot easily discern patterns or routines that are vulnerable to attack an effective ram program shall enable security to appear not only formidable but also unpredictable and ambiguous to instill uncertainty in terrorist planning the basic approach for rams program is to select security measures from higher fpcons as well as other measures not normally associated with fpcons command developed measures or locally developed sitespecific measures that can be employed in random manner to supplement the basic fpcon measures already in place using variety of additional security measures in normal security posture prevents overuse of security personnelh4appendix h jp 3072for official use only for official use onlyas would be the case if higher fpcon were to be maintained for an extended period of time selected rams offer an alternative to full implementation of higher fpcon level this is particularly important when terrorist threat estimates suggest that lower fpcons may not for the moment be adequate in view of the risk vulnerability and criticality of dod assets at the installation or facility b to enhance the overall effectiveness of given fpcon unit commanders shall develop and implement rams program as an integral part of their at program rams should be implemented in strictly random manner never using set time frame or location for given measure rams should be visible to confuse surveillance attempts and should involve the command as whole not just the security personnel to be effective tenant and transient units must be fully integrated into and support the installation or facility ram program advantages of implementing rams include but are not limited to 1 enables commandersdirectors to maintainsustain lower fpcon without compromising security effectiveness also it maximizes scarce security resources nd minimizes security force burnout and degradation in command at awareness 2 makes it more difficult through variations in security routines for terrorists to target important assets build detailed descriptions of significant routines or predict activi ties by specific asset or within targeted facility or installation an installations t actical deception plan can be bolstered by the use of rams 3 helps mask our capabilities to respond to and defeat terrorist attacks through unannounced unpredictable and visible security measures 4 increases at awareness for dod personnel their family members visitors and neighbors 5 provides additional training and increases alertness of assigned security personnel and other participants through mental stimulation by changing their routine 6 validates the installation or facilitys capability to execute individual measure s from higher fpcon 7 provides means to test the procedure utilizing various methods resources and personnel to ensure it can be effectively implemented in an emergency 8 enables commandersdirectors to more rapidly transition between fpcons c in summary commandersdod civilians exercising equivalent authority and their at officers should keep the following tenets in mind when developing and executing their ram programh5force protection condition systemfor official use only for official use only1 the installation ato is in charge of the ram program not the provost marshal or security officer if separate entityindividual however the ato should coordinate with the provost marshalsecurity officer regarding rams that require utilization of security personnel the ato should monitor track and analyze ram implementation efforts 2 ram program is part of proactive and dynamic at program 3 rams should include visible actions in order to confuse surveillance attempts and should involve the command as whole not just the security personnel 4 to be effective tenant and transient units must be fully integrated into and support the installation or facility ram program 5 rams should be used throughout all fpcon levels and should include other measures not normally associated with an fpcon level such as command developed measures or locally developed sitespecific measures 6 to confuse terrorist surveillance attempts rams should be implemented in strictly irregular fashion never using set time frame or location for given measure 7 local rams should assess local threat capabilities and identify effective rams countermeasures b mitigate installationfacility vulnerabilities c be conducted both internally to the installation and externally in coordination with local authorities d be compatiblecoordinated with ongoing approved surveillance detection and security measures not be limited to security force personnel f incorporate analysis of time and space considerations to allow security personnel to maintain sufficient standoff while determining hostile intent d dynamic and proactive ram program visibly communicates commands resolve to prepare for and counter the terrorist threat ram program shall make it difficult for terrorist planners to discern security and defense and operational patterns the terrorists should be compelled to look elsewhere for more static and therefore more vulnerable targeth6appendix h jp 3072for official use only for official use only6 deviations from directed force protection conditions if it is determined that certain fpcon measures are inappropriate for current operations or for proper threat mitigation military commanders or dod civilians exercising equivalent authority may request waiver the first generalflag officer

official use only1 introduction the following matrix see figure l1 is provided as tool that could be used to categorize organize and analyze threat information relevant to an antiterrorism program it is similar to an intelligence collection plan but is intended for use on installations if an intelligence colle ction plan is already active on the installation or base the ato should endeavor to have at efforts integrated with ongoing efforts 2 organization matrix the basic premise of this organization matrix is that there are several key questions pirs that the command needs to answer in order to keep the installation better protected or aware of potentially developing terrorist activity these pirs have supporting components or related questions irs individual indicators suggest when the ir is active the indicators are then divided into their core elements specific information requirements sirs that installati on staff members or coordination agencies need to report or record similarly for given incident such as stolen identification card that information can be traced back to bigger question and suggest that someone is conducting surveillance on the base or nearby base b the sirs should be given to the staff members who would likely observe or see the types of information suggested for instance gate guards should be given the sirs to report unauthorized access attempts item 132a column d row 28 but the installation information technology office would be responsible for reporting computer viruses unauthorized attempts to access the network etc items 116a 116b the organization plan also assists the ato in explaining to coordinating agencies exactly what information is expected c there is requirement to use this or other threat information organization models but if used should be modified to fit specific commander and installation requirements agreements and efforts d within the us intelligence oversight regulations remain in effect at officers and analys

detecting identifying and quantifying cbrn hazards in air water on land on personnel equipment or facilities this capability includes detecting identifying and quantifying those cbrn hazards in all physical states solid liquid gas sense is the key enabler to help emergency responders assess and understand cbrn hazards 1 sense procedures should detect and identify immediate cbrn hazards in the air on missioncritical work areas and equipment on personnel in water food or soil on equipment or facilities 2 sense procedures should determine the extent of the hazard based on available sensing equipment support protection and mission planning decisions and confirm operationally significant hazards have been removed reduced or eliminated figure m1 chemical biological radiological and nuclear

particularly during increased threat conditions selec tive cbrn sensor use though may be smarter than continuous aroundtheclock monitoring b shape provides the ability to characterize the cbrn hazard for the force commander shape supports command decisions to protect personnel and continue critical missions 1 develop clear understanding of the current and predicted cbrn situation 2 collect query

critical sense shield and sustain end states preparation for operations 6 visualize the sequence of events that moves the force from its current state to those end states c shield protects the force from harm caused by cbrn hazards by preventing or reducing individual and collective exposures applying prophylaxis to prevent or mitigate negative physiological effects and protecting critical equipment the installation commander 1 prevents or reduces cbrn casualties by reducing the threat reducing operational vulnerability and avoiding exposure 2 provides appropriate levels of physical protection medical treatment or evacuation procedures to minimize casualties as possible given equipment and treatment available 3 must prepare to continue critical missions while minimizing potential cbrn hazard exposure 4 relies on emergency responders through rapid response assessment and initial recovery operations 5 takes steps to safeguard personnel from continued hazards to control contamination and to initiate steps to restore the area to its preincident conditions 6 must coordinate with local state and regional emergency agencies to coordinate mutual assistancem3chemical

possible 1 depending on the operational impact of cbrn incident installation recovery efforts might be delayed in order to restore critical missions or essential operations 2 crime scene and epidemiological investigations may also be needed 3 eventually the installation should be restored to preincident operation capability levels 4 emergency response thorough decontamination longterm remediation and recovery and mortuary affairs must be coordinated with local state federal or hn emergency response agencies installation commanders should integrate capabilities from external agenc
