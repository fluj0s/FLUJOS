terrorism abroad quick look at applicable federal and state laws charles doyle senior specialist american law division summary terrorists attacks on the world trade center the pentagon the murrah federal building in oklahoma city and the american embassies in kenya and tanzania have stimulated demands that the terrorists responsible and those like them be brought to justice american criminal law already proscribes many of these acts of terrorism and there have been proposals to expand that coverage ordinarily crime is proscribed by the law of the place where it occurs but more than few american criminal laws apply to terrorism committed outside the united states the power to enact such laws flows from the constitution and is usually limited by little more than due process notice practicality and reluctance to offend other nations have traditionally limited american exercise of such authority to instances where there is discernible nexus to the united states yet where there is clear connection to the united states american criminal law primarily federal law generally permits prosecution of terrorism committed overseas this report and companion crs report rs21033 terrorism at home quick look at applicable federal and state criminal law are abbreviated from portions of crs report 951050 terrorism at home and abroad applicable federal and state criminal laws stripped of its footnotes and appendices constitutional considerations the constitution governs when the congress may pass laws applicable overseas it neither explicitly permits nor forbids the passage of terrorism laws with extraterritorial reach it does give congress broad general authority over other matters such as the power to define offenses against the law of nations to regulate interstate and foreign commerce and over foreign affairs under which such laws may be enacted nevertheless these powers are not without limit the limits most often suggested in cases of extraterritorial jurisdiction flow from due process at some point it is contrary to due process to punish citizen of foreign country who is reasonably unaware of the extent to which american law regulates his conduct citizen might be expected to know the laws of their own nation seafarers to know the law of the sea and consequently the laws of the nation under which they sail everyone should be aware of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21034crs2 laws of the land in which they find themselves and of the wrongs condemned by the laws of all nations of course terrorists would presumably be hard pressed to argue that they were unaware that threats or acts of violence might subject them to criminal prosecution on the other hand the application of american law to an alien in foreign country where the conduct is not unlawful such as monetary support or computer trespassing in some countries for instance might evidence lack of notice sufficient to raise due process concerns statutory construction given the broad grant of constitu tional authority and limited constitutional restrictions the question of the extent to which particular statute applies outside the united states has generally been considered matter of statutory rather than constitutional construction general principles of statutory construction have emerged which can explain if not presage the result in given case the first of these holds that statute will be construed to have only territorial application unless there is clear indication of some broader intent second states that unless contrary intent is clear congress is assumed to have acted so as not to invite action inconsistent with internat ional law third principle of construction used primarily in the case of criminal statutes runs contrary to the first two in simple terms it states that the nature and purpose of statute may provide an indication of whether congress intended statute to apply beyond the confines of the united states particularly if extraterritorial application offends principles of international law and the first indication of an intended extraterritorial application may be the absence of any geographical tether such as found in the criminal statutes made applicable within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states united states v bowman 260 us 94 9798 102 1922 the final principle encompasses misconduct overseas which has an impact within the united states the supreme court has painted this external force principle with broad brush man who outside of country willfully puts in motion force to take effect in it is answerable at the place where the evil is done ford v united states 273 us 593 623 1927 international law international law guides rather than directs decisions in the area of the overseas application of american law neither congress nor the courts are bound to the dictates of international law when enacting or interpreting statutes with extraterritorial application yet congress looks to international law when it evaluates the policy considerations associated with legislation that may have international consequences for this reason the courts interpret legislation with the presumption that congress or the state legislature unless it indicates otherwise intends its laws to be applied within the bounds of international law to what extent does international law permit nation to exercise extraterritorial jurisdict ion the question is essentially one of national interests the most common classification of these interests dates to 1935 harvard law school study which divided them into five categories involving 1 the regulation of activities occurring within the territory of country 2 the regulation of the conduct of its nationals 3 the protection of its nationals 4 the regulation of activities outside country which have an impact within it and 5 the regulation of activities which are universally condemned legislation may reflect more than one interest or principle and there is little consensus of the precise boundaries of the principleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21034crs3 present crimes congress has enacted laws containing express provisions for extraterritorial jurisdiction in four groups of statutes 1 those enacted to conform to our obligations under an international agreement to which the united states is party 2 those enacted to apply within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states or the special airspace jurisdiction of the united states 3 those passed pursuant to congresss authority to regulate foreign commerce 4 those involving offenses which congress felt merited an unmistakable assertion of extraterritorial jurisdiction congress recently added another category when in the exercise of its powers to regulate the armed forces it extended to those accompanying the armed forces of the united states the felony proscriptions which apply within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states 18 usc 32613267 an inventory of the federal criminal laws covering acts of terrorism abroad either explicitly or by operation of the law announced in bowman ford and their progeny might be roughly summarized as follows it is federal crime to kill or physically assault an american for terroristic purpose anywhere in the world regardless of the nationality of the terrorist or the means used 18 usc 2331 2332 matter what the purpose or where in the world the crime occurs or the nationality of the offender or the means used it is federal crime to kill beat or kidnap the president members of congress members of the us diplomatic corps any other federal officer or employee including members of the armed forces or anyone assisting them because of or during the performance of their duties 18 usc 1751 351 1114 111 1201 terrorist or anyone else who takes hostages or commits an act of violence at an international airport 18 usc 37 sabotages 18 usc 32 or hijacks an airplane 49 usc 46502 anywhere in the world is subject to federal prosecution and to capital punishment if anyone is killed during the course of the crime as long as either the offender or one of the victims is an american or the offender is later found in the united states by the same token overseas crimes involving the weapons of mass destruction 18 usc 2332a biological weapons 18 usc 175 chemical weapons 18 usc 229 or nuclear materials 18 usc 831 may be prosecuted in the united states when either the victim or the offender is an american and regardless of the nationality of the victim or offender the overseas use of explosives to damage or destroy federal property may be prosecuted in this country and carries the death penalty if anyone is killed foreign terrorists who flee to the united states are subject to the federal laws which outlaw the use of perjury false statements or other schemes to gain unlawful entry into the united states even when committed within another country circumstances which permit federal prosecution of an act of terrorism committed abroad will also support prosecution of various auxiliary or piggyback offenses like conspiracy aiding and abetting an act of terrorism harboring or otherwise assisting another after the commission of such an offense or possession of firearm or explosive during the commission of the offense inter alia federal criminal law features special category of piggyback offenses for overseas terrorism conduct in the united states made criminal because of its relationship to terrorism abroad the earliest example may be the walker act 18 usc 960 whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21034crs4 prohibits launching military or naval expedition against friendly nation from the united states more contemporary prohibitions ban conspiracies in this country to commit murder kidnapping or mayhem abroad 18 usc 956 providing material assistance to terrorists 18 usc 2339a or terrorist organizations 18 usc 2339b engaging in financial transactions with countries that support international terrorism 18 usc 2332d past federal prosecut ion of acts of terrorism committed abroad have rested on combination of jurisdictional foundations some explicit and others implied for instance the terrorists who bombed the american embassies in kenya and tanzania were charged with violations of 18 usc 930 murder while unlawfully in possession of bomb within federal facility 844fmurder resulting from the bombing of federal building 844hpossession of bomb during the commission of federal felony 844nconspiracy to violate section 844 1114 murder of federal officers and employees and 2155 destruction of national defense materials united states v bin laden 92 fsupp2d 189 192 sdny 2000 extraterritorial application of all of these depends on bowman prosecution of terrorists for air piracy and related offenses on the other hand have not tended to rely exclusively on an implied jurisdictional base state criminal laws are less likely to apply overseas state law produces fewer instances where statute was clearly enacted with an eye to its application overseas and fewer examples where frustration of legislative purpose is the logical consequence of purely territorial application the constitution seems to have preordained this result when it vested responsibility for protecting american interests and fulfilling american responsibilities overseas in the federal government the states have chosen to make their laws applicable beyond their boundaries in only limited set of circumstances and ordinarily only in cases where there is some clear nexus to the state some of which may be relevant in terrorism context perhaps the most common state statutory provision claiming state extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction is one which asserts jurisdiction in cases where some of the elements of the offense are committed within the state or others are committed outside it another common claim is where an individual outside the state attempts or conspires to commit crime within the state still others define the states extraterritorial jurisdiction to include instances where the victim of homicide fatally wounded outside of the state dies within it or vice versa
