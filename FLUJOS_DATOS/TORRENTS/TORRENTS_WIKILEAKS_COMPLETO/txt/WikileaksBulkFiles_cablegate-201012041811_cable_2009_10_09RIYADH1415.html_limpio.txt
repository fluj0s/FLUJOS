10212019 tags sa pk af prel pgov subject pakistani ambassador on military operations in fata saudi relations riyadh 00001415 0012 of 002 classified by ambassador james b smith for reasons 14 b and d summary 1 c during an oct 20 courtesy call with the ambassador pakistani ambassador umar khan alisherzai highlighted the success of recent military operations in pakistans tribal areas lamented strains on the saudipakistani bilateral relationship discussed other regional issues affecting pakistan and offered his advice on countering extremism in rural tribal regions end summary waziristan reasonable resistance but not as much as we expected 2 c alisherzai described the pakistani military operations in waziristan as progressing well adding that they had encountered reasonable resistance but not as much as we expected the army faced difficult terrain in the region he continued but had already killed over 100 militants alisherzai described the extremists as group of chechens saudis uzbeks and others who had come across the border from afghanistan and sought refuge with the local population although tribal tradition required the pakistanis to offer them shelter he explained these people turned out to be monsters and the local population turned against them swat valley success story 3 c alisherzai pointed to the militarys advances against the taliban in the swat valley as one example of success in the region the cooperation of the local people was decisive factor as they provided the most effective intelligence to the military after realizing that the militants were not interested in islam at all in addition the military and police in swat provided weapons to local tribes when pressed about conditions in swat alisherzai admitted that the pakistani military still faced challenges due to their limited resources he said that 10000 soldiers had been relocated from the indian border to swat and that 100000 new soldiers were placed there as well however alisherzai was quick to point out that the 100000 new soldiers were inexperienced 4 c while upbeat that pakistans military and civilian leaders were truly working in tandem for the first time alisherzai was disappointed that action was not taken sooner all of this would have been easier if done under former pakistani president musharraf he concluded we need more arms ammo and planes 5 c in response to the ambassadors question about support from centcom alisherzai replied that the us does lot for pakistan however it was not enough to fight this problem all of nato was fighting the battle in afghanistan he complained while pakistan alone was standing up to the extremists within its borders for this reason he insisted that pakistan needed more material support from the us in the form of arms ammo and planes rebuilding old relationships 6 c when asked about the saudipakistani relationship alisherzai admitted that it had been strained since pakistani president asif ali zardaris election alisherzai blamed the problems on the saudi perception that zardari was proiranian and proshia which made them apprehensive about working with him we have been punished by saudi arabia because our president talks to the iranians alisherzai lamented he claimed that his access to saudi leadership was good but that he would have to continue to work hard to rebuild pakistans relationship with the sag alisherzai opined riyadh 00001415 0022 of 002 that the saudis were more concerned with their own internal problems than with the problems of pakistan iran 7 c alisherzai accused russia of fully supporting the iranians nuclear program adding that all shia communities in the region supported this program he described iranian nuclear ambitions as move to consolidate domestic political power and stated multiple times they will not leave this subject india we are not expecting anything good 8 c alisherzai blamed india for helping to train and fund extremist groups fighting against the government of pakistan he said that india also helped support the taliban in pakistan explaining they india will never let chance to harm pakistan go alisherzai summed up his feelings about india by saying we are not expecting anything good from them the root of the problem 9 c asked how to stop terrorism and extremism in pakistan alisherzai said that the people living in the tribal areas dont know the value of life he blamed this on their lack of education and knowledge of the outside world and said that they only know fighting and dying in his view investment in education and development was the only way to help the tribal areas and said that years of bad luck had redirected development funds from the tribal areas to the urban population centers he reiterated his support for military operations but insisted that program to educate young boys in the region must also be implemented he noted that this program should be funded by nato and added i am only here today because of my education perhaps i would have been alqaeda too if not for my education comment 10 c alisherzai is from the kurram agency one of the seven tribal agencies that make up the federally administered tribal area fata along the afghanistan border as such he is able to offer an insiders view of life along the pakistaniafghan border his observation that intelligence and support provided by the local population has been essential to the success of pakistani military operations is worth noting as are his suggestions as to how we might counter the growth of extremism in the region however his insights about larger regional issues ie iran india saudi arabia appear to be much more limited end comment biographic note 11 c alisherzai grew up in the fata bordering the afghanistan provinces of khowst and paktya his father served in the british military and insisted that his attend school alisherzai says that at the age of five he walked 8km to school everyday he has six children all living in the us and all graduates of george mason university smith
