from jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject bullet debate number 1 date wed 15 feb 2006 114617 0700 cc eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno tosbornueaacuk xflowed hi keith and eystein we need your opinion thanks for the quick response i think it easier imagining the mess of email that could result if we focus on one bulletemail so ill start w the first and hope that eystein can also weigh in with regard to the first one below i agree that we can leave statistics out of it good point but i think we must at least address susans concern to do otherwise would be counterproductive she makes sense i think your mwp results is quite appropriate they were published in science and in my reading of the paper you are convincing if its in the chapter it makes sense to draw on it for the exec summary please defend more convincingly or suggest an alternative way to deal with susans concern what is the significance not statistical of this one record being warmer we need to say it if you really want to leave as is please write your response in way that i can forward to susan we cant ignore he comment in this case because other at least think it makes sense so we have to convince her too this is big stuff for the ar4 and will be in the tsspm we cant be as vague as the current bullet is and as for the mwp box fig i think it should be as you suggest combine the existing fig w the new one from tim and your paper i think tim might already be working on it sorry to be tough guy but this bullet needs to be more clear thanks peck peck do not think you will like what i say here but i am going to give straight answers to your questions first the new draft says enough in the text now about farlessaccurately dated and lowresolution proxy records that can not be rigorously calibrated in relation to this paper moberg et it is not appropriate to single the one series out for specific criticism in the summary the use of the word only implies we do not believe it mike manns suggestion begs lot of questions about what constitutes significantly warmer you need to have null hypothesis to test if you mean would the estimates in moberg and the other reconstructions during medieval time show significantly different means using ttest then of course not but this tells us nothing other than they are not likely samples from totally different populations an almost impossible test to pass given the wide uncertainties on all reconstructions incidentally we do not have formal calibration uncertainties for moberg anyway just bootstrapped uncertainty on the average lowfrequency curve i think the vagueness is necessary suggests slightly and is appropriate i would not call out the results of tim and my paper either it is just an aside in the medieval box at present perhaps with figure to accompany the original if you agree but without more text in the chapter which i do not consider appropriate it should not be highlighted as bullet jonathan t overpeck director institute for the study of planet earth professor department of geosciences professor department of atmospheric sciences mail and fedex address institute for the study of planet earth 715 n park ave 2nd floor university of arizona tucson az 85721 direct tel 1 520 6229065 fax 1 520 7928795 httpwwwgeoarizonaedu httpwwwispearizonaedu xflowed
