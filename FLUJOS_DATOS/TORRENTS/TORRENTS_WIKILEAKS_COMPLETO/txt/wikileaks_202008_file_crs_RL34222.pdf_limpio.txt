nominating system which has avoided wholesale change despite criticism every four years from voters the candidates and the press after several decades of debate observers are divided on the best approach to reform the lack of consensus for reworking the primary system is due partly to its complex design which frustrates pursuit of simple obvious solution and par tly to the political parties pursuing their own variable interests concerning their dele gate selection rules the states further complicate the process by independen tly scheduling primary election dates congress political commentators and academics have offered various reform proposals over the years but many impor tant dimensions of reform depend on whether the parties are willing to change th system for choosing

reforms dopted in the early 1970s for the preceding 120 years state delegations to the national party conventions had been largely chosen by party leaders or in closed caucus meetings that vested control in the party hierarchy although the primary was introdu ced by progressive reformers just after the turn of the century it did not replace party control of the process for choosing delegates to the conventions for many decad florida was the first state to adopt version of the primary in 1901 but wisc onsins 1905 law was the first to provide for the use of the primary in presidential nominations2 by 1916 at least 20 states had presidential primary in some form however many states quickly abandoned the method when the progressive moveme nt faded and the number of primaries dropped in the years following the first world war the number of primaries began to incr ease again after world war ii but they initially had little effect on winning the mination candidates often chose one or more specific state primaries in which to compete to demonstrate their potential electability but the primary process did not usually determine the selection of delegates and did not threaten party cont rol of the state delegations in the 1952 democratic race for example senator estes kefauver tn prevailed in 12 of the 15 primaries held captured 64 of the vote na tionally but failed to win the nomination instead the convention chose governor ad lai stevenson who had won 16 of the primary vote nationwide3 pressure to change the nominating system mounted in the turbulent political climate of the 1960s due to the percepti on that the process was undemocratic transforming event occurred at the demo cratic convention in 1968 where violent confrontations between war protesters nd the chicago police outside the convention hall and bitter credentials disputes inside spurred democrats to completely change the partys nominating rules the new ru transferred the power of choosing delegates from party leaders to ranka ndfile voters opening the process to widespread popular participation for the fi rst time many stat parties switched to primaries to comply with the newly dopted national party rules the republican party also modified its rules in the early 1970s subsequently as shown in figure 1 the number of party primaries in the states rose steadily between 1968 and 1992 the number of states with democratic party primaries increased from 15 to 40 stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34222crs2 4 although 32 republican primaries were sche duled only 27 were actually held five were

of secretaries of state the reforms of the 1970s fundamentally ch anged the structure of the nominating system and in turn led to changes in th dynamics of nominati on politics under the old system the drama of choosing the part ys candidate occurred at the convention where party leaders who controlled blocs of delegates would broker the choice of nominee reform redirected the suspense of the nomination contest to the states where presidential candidates sought suppor t directly from voters in primaries and caucuses with the media highlighting th results this new dynamic boosted the importance of the earliest events in iowa and new hampshire and set off trend toward rescheduling in other states in or der to better attract candidate and media attentionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34222crs3 5 while republicans have small number of au tomatic delegate slots reserved for party or elected officials the term superdelegate is generally used only with respect to democratic party delegates 6 president carter entered the 1980 convention with slim lead in delegate support for the first time in party history the convention was considering rule to require delegates to be bound to their preference on the first ballot forces for senator edward kennedy who finished second in primary and caucus voting soug ht to defeat the rule and attempt to throw open the voting on the first ballot the rule was upheld and carter was renominated on 2123 to 1150 vote see for example congressional quarterly national party conventions 18312000 washington cq press

nomination contest for both parties does not include an incumbent president or vice president crowded field of republican and democratic candidates entered the race as result despite fastpaced primary and caucus calendar that was expected to narrow the field quickly that has not been the case on the democratic side some observers have suggested that an inconclusive primary season could result in brokered convention whereby the nominee is chosen at the convention based on dealmaking and bargaining speculation about such an outcome has fo cused attention on the superdelegates category of automatic unpledged delegates who are not required to declare presidential candidate preference5 the last democratic nomination contest to feature questionable convention outcome was in 1980 before the creation of the superdelegate category6 the 1984 democratic convention was the fi rst to include superdelegates who were added in response to rule changes that had sharply reduced the influence of party leaders and democratic office holders on the nominating process see preceding section of this report following presid ent carters defeat in 1980 the party added superdelegates as counterba lance to the influence of rank and file voters the superdelegates were introduced to promot party cohesion and to rally support for future nominees among party professionals and democrats in the congress it was believed that party leaders and elected officials given their own political experience and knowledge could also help with evaluating and selecting nominees7 initially the superdelegates were approximately 14 percent of all conven tion delegates they will account for 20 percent of thos who attend the 2008 convention the following categories comprise the superdelegates all members of the

changes to the calendar over the last two decades resulted from state legislatures scheduling earlier primary or cau cus events either individually or as part of collective effort within single regi on of the country in the 1970s attempts to organize regional primary events in ne w england the midwest and the pacific northwest were unsuccessful but in 1988 march regional primary was successfully organized in 14 southern stat this southern super tuesday regional primary however failed to bolster the regions political strength in the nominating process and by 1996 seven states had aba ndoned the event none of the changes displaced iowa and new hampshire from their prominent role as the first caucus and primary respectively but they have furt her contributed to perception that the system is confusing and unorganized8 the 2000 calendar was the most frontloade d ever with respect to the number of delegates at stake but not with resp ect to the number of primaries california moved its primary from the last tuesday to the first tuesday of march and new york also advanced its primary by two days to the same date march 7 ohio also moved up its primary to the first tuesday in march resulting in crowded schedule of 16 primaries and caucuses that spanne d the country and vastly increased the number of delegates to be lected with the addition of california new york and ohio on march 7 between 70 and 80 of the delegates needed to claim the nomination in either party were allocated as result of voting on that date as it happened the contest for the nomination on bot h sides was declared over in the press by march 7 by which time voters in fewer than half the states had cast ballotshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34222crs5 9 the four exceptions to the specified period fo r

2008national party changes after the 2000 elec tion led to an earlier start in 2004 the most frontloaded calendar to date in terms of the num ber of primaries republican task force approved plan to set dates for primaries and caucuses first for party that traditionally has deferred to the states on such matters the change required approval at the na tional convention in august 2004 and would have gone into effect for 2008 known as the laware plan it woul d have created fourmonth calendar with the smallest stat voting first in february followed by group of larger states in march with the

meanwhile democrats appr oved allowing states to hold contests on the first tuesday in february month earlier than in 2000 with an exception for iowa and new hampshire in 2006 the democratic national committee dnc again revised its rules for the 2008 primary schedule creating calenda r with the earliest start and the most frontloaded ever with the approval of two new exceptions to the dnc rule for holding primaries and caucuses during the specified window9 the nevada caucus was scheduled for january 19 five days af ter the iowa caucus the new hampshire primary was next on january 22 while th south carolina and florida primaries followed week after new hampshire because florida january 29 and michigan january 15 were not among the states granted an exception to the timing rule the democratic national party has announced that the fl orida and michigan delegations will not be seated at the 2008 convention if the respective primary results are used to determine the selection of delegates10 republicans have already began evaluating the performance of the nominating process in 2008 and democrats are likely to follow once the primaries conclude on june 3 the republican partys rules committee approved plan that would impose new system for choosing national conven tion delegates known as the ohio plan for the 2012 election11 under the plan iowa and new hampshire could vote during the first week of february followed by south carolina and nevada any time after new hampshire beginning the third week of february small states the territories and puerto rico could begin voting followe d by separate groups of larger states onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34222crs6 three successive dates the order of the larger state groupings would rotate every four years to be adopted for 2012 the plan will need to be adopted by the republican national committee the rules committee of the national convention and the convention itself according to pre ss reports republicans plan to seek the cooperation of democrats in putting the plan in to place in the states as they did prior to the 2000 election evaluating the primary system most state primaries were adopted fo llowing rules changes of the early 1970s to reform the arguably undemocratic process used to select nominees however other complaints about the system c ontinue to arise in add ition to frontloading complaints include low leve ls of participation the pr edominance of iowa and new hampshire dissatisfaction with the field of candidates who enter the race the length of the season either too short or too long the role of the media and confusion about the complex rules that govern the process some of these perceived problems stem from the design of the nominating system such as calendar length and could be addressed jointly by the na tional parties if cooperation benefitte d democrats and republicans alike but some complaints about low turnout for example apply to elections generally and it is unlikely that nominating reforms would resolve such fundamental problem also the role of the media and the field of candidates who choose to run are third category of comp laints that stem more from the current political culture than from electoral structure changes to the nominating system even wholly new method of choosing pa rty candidates would arguably do little to diminish these and other nonstructural complaints despite longstanding complaints the existing primary system routinely accomplishes its fundamental task the lection of general election candidates according to the voting results in the states and territories or insular areas the system is indirect relying on elected delegates ra ther than the popular vote to determine the nominees however it differs markedly fro m the system of years past when party leaders dominated the process because majority of delegates is required for nomination rankandfile voters are usua lly willing to rally around the candidate chosen at the convention even in years ma rked by internal party division finally since the reforms of the 1970s presidential elections have been marked by strong twoparty competition for the presidency republican nominees have won six general elections and the democrats have won three in generally close elections with few notable exceptions the primary system has produced generally competitive candidates for the fall election to be successful any system arguably would need to retain the link between popular participation and ca ndidate choice and also address at least some of the problems attributed to the primary system as long as the major parties continue to win the presidency however one party or the other is likely to have vested interest in pres erving the process that produced victorious general election candidatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34222crs7 12 congress has never approved legislation to reform the nominating process although more than 300 such bills have been introdu

hearing on s 1905 on september 19 200716 although congress has author ity to regulate the t iming of congressional and presidential elections arguably including presidential primaries some observers maintain that congressional efforts to prescribe the methods of choosing national convention delegates may be restricted by the parties constitutional rights of free association17 for nearly two centuries the par ties have determined their methods of choosing nominees without federal oversight and might resist system imposed by congress also legislative action may not achieve the expected results were congress to establish regional primaries or national primary for example state parties whose interests were not served by the new system might switch to the caucus method in an effort to circumvent congress alternately federally designed system might succeed in imposing order on complex and controversial system federally mandated calenda r for primaries might be resisted for variety of other reasons first elections are expensiv and states often hold their presidential primary together with their state primary to save money second some states schedule primaries to accommodate state legislative sessions or to meet other scheduling needs third some states have traditional primary date that determines the election cycle for candidates at all vels of government federally mandated primary date which might be subject to change every four years could create ongoing scheduling problems in states that hold single combined primary complaints about the nominating system usually peak just after the election season has concluded when obs ervers assess how well the sy stem functioned in this climate proposed changes tend to ddress the perceived problems recently encountered the longterm implications of such adjustments often receive less debate notably victory in the general election often tempers the views of party activists who criticized the process in the spring and summer revision and experimentation with the presidential nominating system continues building upon the reforms of the 1970s this continual revision which sometimes causes confusion none theless demonstrates the flexibility of the system and at least in theory promises resu lt that stems from competition and evolution it is an open question however whether new system could better accomplish the task of selecting candidates who are the c hoice of most party voters even more in doubt is the extent to which such changes would alleviate broa der complaints about the presidential nominating process rnout the negative perception of the medias role in the process the influence of organized interest groups the high cost of campaigns and the reluctance of pot ential candidates to enter the contest
