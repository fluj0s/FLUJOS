system was established in 1913 by the federal reserve act pl 6343 congress created the federal reserve popularly known as the fed as an independent entity to attend to the nations credit and monetary needs without undue influence from political pressures today the feds monetary policy operations are intended to promote stability in the nations economy its supervisory and regulatory functions are intended to provide safer more flexible banking system and its work as fiscal agent for the government and clearinghouse for private sector financial transactions promotes efficiency in the overall banking system in keeping with its independence within the federal government the system operates without appropriations from congress its income derives primarily from interest on government securities acquired through monetary policy operations and fees for banking services with any excess income returned to the treasury the current structure of the system has three major components established by the original act first board of governors oversees the whole system and has responsibility for monetary policy second there are 12 regional federal reserve banks which carry out supervision and examination of commercial banks that are fed members the member banks all national banks and all statechartered banks that choose to be members of the system make up the third component g4g152g138g155g141g561g152g143g561g9g152g159g142g155g151g152g155g156g561 the board of governors of the federal reserve system was established as federal government agency the administration

of the senate the term of service for both leadership offices is four years an office holder may be reappointed these terms do not coincide with that of the president or each other while the board chairman is considered quite powerful each governor has one vote on the board when selecting governor the president is required by law to give due regard to fair representation of financial agricultural industrial and commercial interests and geographical divisions of the country more than one governor can be selected from any one federal reserve district the members of the board of

responsibility of the board of governors of the federal reserve system is the formulation of monetary policy in broad terms monetary policy involves influencing the monetary and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of maximum employment stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates1 in addition when the federal reserve was established it was given the role of lender of last resort to the nations financial system the federal reserve acting in this capacity has initiated unprecedented steps to manage and contain the current financial crisis 2 the federal open market committee fomc is the policy making body for open market operationsthe principal means through which monetary policy is conducted the seven board members plus five of the 12 federal reserve bank presidents make up the fomc the president of the federal reserve bank of new york new york fed is permanent member because the new york fed executes the federal reserves monetary policy decisions through open market operations the remaining four seats are filled by the other 11 presidents on rotating basis for oneyear terms all of the presidents participate in the fomc meetings and contribute their views but only the five members vote the committee elects chairman and vice chairman traditionally the chairman of the board of governors is elected chairman and the new york feds president is elected vice chairman open market operations involve the purchase and sale of government securities in the secondary market by the federal reserve the operations are conducted to keep the federal funds rate close to target rate that is set by the fomc the fe deral reserve systems portfolio is composed of us treasury securities federal agency securities and bankers acceptances the federal reserve bank of new york holds the portfolio and through its trading desk conducts open market operations pursuant to directives of the fomc two less often used monetary policy instruments may be employed by the federal reserve legal reserve requirements and the discount window depository financial institutions are required by law to set aside reserves in certain proportions against demand deposits what is held in reserve affects the availability of loanable funds an increase in the requirement would mean banks and thrifts would have less money to lend and would tend to restrain credit conditions alternatively lowering the requirement would increase the proportion of deposits that could be lent and would tend to ease credit conditions reserve requirements are rarely changed because as monetary policy tool they are considered too blunt an instrument the discount window is the federal reserve facility for lending to eligible depository institutions an institution may borrow funds for short periods from federal reserve bank to augment its reserve balances for interbank transactions the discount rate is the interest rate charged for this shortterm loan the rate is set by each bank subject to approval by the board of governors over time it has become common practice for the rate to be uniform for all 12 reserve banks higher rate discourages borrowing and in turn lending by banks and thrifts currently the

balance between assuring independence for the systems operations and making the agency accountable for its actions attention to federal reserve accountability has resulted in increased disclosure by the fed and dialogue between the fed and congress on monetary policy and the agencys operations overall avenues of communication and oversight both formal and informal have developed over time aside from its appointment role congress exercises oversight in variety of ways the federal banking agency audit act pl 95320 was enacted in 1978 to enhance congressional oversight responsibilities the law gave the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office the authority to audit the board of governors the reserve banks and branches such audits are limited however as gao is prohibited from audi ting monetary policy operations foreign transactions and the fomc operations congressional oversight on these matters is exercised through the requirement for reports and through semiannual monetary policy hearings the federal reserves recent policy re sponses to the ongoing financial turmoil could result in additional oversight hearings during the current congress

fed is frequently called upon to testify on wide range of issues affecting the economy and the banking industry in addition monetary policy reporting system accomplished through hearings was made matter of legislative mandate in the federal reserve reform act of 1977 pl 95188 the process was modified by prov isions embodied in pl 95523 the humphrey hawkins act of 1978 the provisions are designed to enhance the dialogue on monetary policy between congress and the federal reserve through more detailed reporting and evaluation process than existed earlier further the provisions are intended to contribute to the ability of congress to take coordinated look at governme nt economic policies the two goals are sought through system of regularly scheduled oversight hearings at which the federal reserve reports to the banking committees on its policy intention the banking committees in turn report to their respective houses the statutory requirements for semiannual monetary policy reporting the boards annual report and several other reports would have been discontinued by provisions of the 1995 federal reports elimination and sunset act pl 10466 provisions contained in pl
