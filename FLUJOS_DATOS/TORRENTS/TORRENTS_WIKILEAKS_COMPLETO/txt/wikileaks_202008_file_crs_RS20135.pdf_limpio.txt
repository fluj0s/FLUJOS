notable improvements and frustrating setbacks eighteen months ago much about th relationship appeared desti ned to improve its prospects clinton administration officials continued to emphasize dialogue and engagement with chinese leaders and they believed that china had made important shifts in its willingness to abide by internationa l agreements such as in its decision to minimize nuclear cooperation with iran hon g kongs reversion to c hinese rule anticipated with trepidation occurred without incident on july 1 1997 and despite the devastating financial crisis that affected all major asian countries beginning in late 1997 china appeared to be weatheri ng the crisis relatively wellhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20135crs2 on february 25 1999 china used its security council veto to halt the extension of1 the peacekeeping force in mac edonia in country since 1993 the vote was retaliation for macedonias recent diplomatic recognition of taiwan and was applauded by american officials for not devaluing its currency the renminb i rmb taken in microcosm these developments suggested that greatly improve d atmosphere was possible and they helped bring about the resumption of uschin summitry suspended since 1989 chinas president jiang zemin made state visit t washington in october 1997 and this was swiftly followed by president clintons state visit to china in june 1998 but concurrent with these positive developments unexpected challenges have also plagued the relationship and these appear to have intensified throughout 1998 and 1999 us officials ar concerned about new chinese crackdown against political dissidence begun late in 1998 about reported buildup of missiles along the chinese coast facin g taiwan and about the increasing us trade deficit with china chinese officials object strongly to us proposal s involving theater missile defense tmd system in asia and they have warned of serious consequences if proposed tmd system should includ defense of taiwan which beijing considers to be part of china disturbing report s surfaced in the american press suggesting darker aspect to the relationship on involving illegal chinese contributions to american political campaigns allegations that american aerospace companies may have illegally transferred sensitive satellite launc h information to china and charges that china has conducted espionage in the unite d states problems also persist in the international arena while administration official s defend the engagement policy by referring to the benefits of chinese cooperation on north korea pakistan and india china is seen to be less cooperative in the securit council on issues such as involvement in kosovo and macedonia 1 it appears that both us and chinese officials are seeking ways to reduce tensions and reach accord on issues of mutual interest but while the willpower may be there given the significant constraints imposed by the current poli tical environment many people are uncerta in that meaningful agreement on substantive issues can be reached durin g zhus official visit in addition to disagreements with the united states over tmd chinese officials have strongly criticized the us decision in february 1999 to deny for security reasons export licenses t the hugh electronics corporation for 450 satellite intended for launch in china for its part the united states remains critical of china s human rights record particularly in light of widespread recent reports about ne w crackdown against democracy activists in their efforts to form an independent politica l party us officials are also dealing with evidence that lax security procedures at us national science labs in the 1980s may have contributed directly to significan t improvements in chinas nuclear weapons capabilities charge which chinese officials have denied the area most often mentioned as potential basis for accord is some type of forward movement on chinas application to join the world trade organization wto china is thought t have made its entry into the wto top priority and is frustrated tha t negotiations on its wto access have been going on for 13 years the united state s contends

chinas wto accession for the foreseeable future 2 chinas goals and constraints china is now in the midst of decidedly ambitious 5year program for achieving series of sweeping reforms in economic and fiscal policy and in bureaucrati c infrastructure among other things chinas leadership last year committed itself t keeping annual growth high and inflation low at 8 and 3 respectively reforming3 closing or privatizing c hinas moribund stateownedenterprises soes and its frail and nearly insolvent state banks requiring t he peoples liberation army pla to divest itself of its nonmilitary profitmaking corporate interests and reducing the bloated stat bureaucracy including the number of government employees by as much as 50 although clearly such n ambitious reform program must have the active support of the senior leadership it is premier zhu rongji who is most closely associated with th reform agenda zhu has long had reputation for advocating the kinds of forwardlooking economi c and structural reforms that american specialists have said china greatly needs in order to ensure its economic development goals often described as blunt spoken his directness and candor along with his willingness to hold live press conferences an d take questions from reporters are generally perceived by americans as refreshing change from the usual staid approach taken by chinas senior leaders as premier position to which he was elevated in march 1998 for one 5year term zhu actively presides over and directs chinas state council bureaucracies thus he is not only considered the chie f architect of china s ambitious reform agenda but is also in charge of its implementation his position as head of the government bureaucracy gives him wideranging jurisdiction nevertheless he is most strongly associated with an econo mic portfolio and is often given the moniker of chinas economic czar although zhu in recent weeks has discussed number of the thornier issues in us china relations including tmd and taiwan he is thought to have placed chinas wto accession at the top of list of issues to discuss in washington according to chines press reports zhu is putting together series of economic and trade measures that h hopes will result in an agreement with the united states on chinas accession to th wto although he has not gone into specifics about what these measures may be in

1998 p 17 midmarch 1999 press conference during which he discussed broad range of issues i n uschi na relations zhu was quoted as saying that china was prepared to make th largest possible concessions for wto access this would be possible he said largel because continued economic reforms had given chinese leaders greater ability t supervise and regulate chinas economy us trade experts have speculated tha t5 these concession s would include further reduction of tariffs on imports but according to zhus wn statements chinese leaders also may be considering measures to allo w direct foreign investment in key domestic m arkets that hitherto have been closed or highly restricted such as the telecommunications and electronics sectors banking services and possibly the agricultural sector only by encouraging competition in such sectors t o6 quote zhu will there be ultimate benefit to these and othe r outdated and inefficient sectors in chinas economy 7 even though zhu rongji may be willing to make significant concessions to assur chinas wto accession the more important question is whether he will be able to make them although he still appears to be in strong posi tion politically at home the domestic reforms zhu has pushed for are painful c utting across wide group of constituencies that have vested interests in the status quo zhu remains potentially vulnerable to resistance and criticism from these groups many of whom are potential victims of the kind f international competition that wto obligations could bring almost exclusively th entities with something to lose from wto accession are part of the official state sector the private nd entrepreneurial parts of the chinese economy already competitive stand to be the chief beneficiaries of wto membership this official concern about the state sector is serious complication in premier zhus efforts to gain support for substantive and meaningful economic concessions on wto zhus support for decision requiring the pla to sell off its moneyearning corporat interests for instance has won h im few friends in chinas military establishment indeed key military leader vicechair of the crucial central military

these perennial concerns chinas potential wto12 membership is clearly also on the minds of us policymakers us trade officials have made number of trips to china w ithin the last few weeks seen to be

chinas wto accession senators jesse helms and fritz hollings stressed human rights and security issues saying the human rights situation in china has degraded significantly additionally we remain troubled by the allegations regarding the possible illegal transfer of technology to china as well as lingering questions over chinese espionage and involvement in us elections any trade agreement with china would be premature before these issues are resolved in floor debate on sim ilar motion ultimately tabled by the senate senator hutchinson stressed common congressional themes skept icism about chinese promises doubts about whether china had made enough market reforms to fulfill wto obligations and objection to lowering the bar for china on terms of membership 15 prospects despite the low profile being taken by us officials the frequency and apparen t intensity of uschina talks over the last two months suggest that both sides believe they are close to an agree ment on at least the basic framework for chinas future accession to wto membership how that agreement is viewed in the united states is likely to depend on whether the united states is perceived to have backed off of its insistence that china be admitted on commer cially viable terms some have suggested that wto agreement could be made more palatable if it were followed by other agreements or understandings designed to appeal to unhappy constituencies on either side these could includ understandings involving taiwans swift accession to the wto widely supported within16 congress and on chinas receipt of permanent mostfavorednation trade status mfn now officially known as ntr or normal trade relations something long sought b beijing and supported by some members of congress although failure to reach n understanding on wto during zhus visit something which chinese spokesman has said china is mentally prepared would not necessaril mean further erosion in us china relations it would indicate that agreements on far more fundamental differences in the relationship are not likely in the foreseeable future
