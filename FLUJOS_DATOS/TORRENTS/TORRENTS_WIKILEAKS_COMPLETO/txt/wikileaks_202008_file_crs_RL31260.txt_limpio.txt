resources science and industry division digital television an overview summary digital television dtv is new television service representing the most significant development in television technology since the advent of color television dtv can provide movie theater quality pictures and sound wider screen better color rendition multiple video programming or single program of high definition television hdtv and other new services currently being developed the nationwide deployment of digital television is complex and multifaceted enterprise successful deployment requires the development by content providers of compelling digital programming the delivery of digital signals to consumers by broadcast television stations as well as cable and satellite television systems and the widespread purchase and adoption by consumers of digital television equipment the telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 provided that initial eligibility for any dtv licenses issued by the federal communications commission fcc should be limited to existing broadcasters because dtv signals cannot be received through the existing analog television broadcasting system the fcc decided to phase in dtv over period of years so that consumers would not have to immediately purchase new digital television sets or converters thus broadcasters were given new spectrum for digital signals while retaining their existing spectrum for analog transmission so that they can simultaneously transmit analog and digital signals to their broadcasting market areas congress and the fcc set target date of december 31 2006 for broadcasters to cease broadcasting their analog signals and return their existing analog television spectrum to be auctioned for commercial services such as broadband or used for public safety communications however the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 allowed station to delay the return of its analog spectrum if 15 or more of the television households in its market did not subscribe to multichannel digital service and did not have digital television sets or converters given the slowerthan expected pace at which digital televisions have been introduced into american homes and given the impetus to reclaim analog spectrum for commercial uses and public safety the 109th congress enacted the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 which established date certain digital transition deadline of february 17 2009 key issue in the congressional debate over the digital transition continues to be addressing the millions of american overtheair households whose existing analog televisions will require converter boxes in order to receive digital signals when the analog signal is turned off pl 109171 established digitaltoanalog converter box program administered by the national telecommunications and information administration ntia of the department of commerce that will partially subsidize consumer purchases of converter boxes specifically

representing the most significant development in television technology since the advent of color television dtv can provide movie theater quality pictures and sound wider screen better color rendition multiple video programming or single program of high definition television hdtv and other new services currently being developed dtv can be hdtv or the simultaneous transmission of multiple programs of standard definition television sdtv which is lesser quality picture than hdtv but significantly better than todays television the rationale often cited for the digital transition is that aside from offering superior broadcast quality to consumers dtv will allow overtheair broadcasters to offer the same kinds of digitallybased services such as payperview currently offered by cable and satellite television providers additionally it is argued that digital television uses the radiofrequency spectrum more efficiently than traditional analog television thereby conserving scarce resource bandwidth that can be used for other wireless applications there are three major components of dtv service that must be present in order for consumers to enjoy fully realized high definition television viewing experience first digital programming must be available digital programming is content produced with digital cameras and other digital production equipment such equipment is distinct from what is currently used to produce conventional analog programming second digital programming must be delivered to the consumer via digital signal digital signals can be broadcast over the airwaves requiring new transmission towers or dtv antennas on existing towers transmitted by cable or satellite television technology or delivered by prerecorded source such as digital video disc dvd and third consumers must have digital television product capable of receiving the digital signal and displaying digital programming on their television screens role of congress and the fcc congress and the federal communications commission fcc have played major roles in the development of dtv starting in 1987 the fcc launched decadelong series of proceedings exploring the potential and feasibility of transition from conventional analog televisions to advanced television systems while the original term used to describe the new television system was high definition television hdtv the fcc used broader term advanced television atv referring to any television technology that provides improved audio and crs2 video quality after it became clear that atv would be using digital signal transmission the fcc began in 1995 to use the term dtv synonymous with atv to describe the new service more accurately in december 1996 after lengthy debate between television manufacturers broadcasters and computer firms the fcc adopted standard for dtv signal transmission based on recommendations of the advanced television system committee atsc1 the atsc standard allows for 18 different video formats of which four have subsequently been adopted for commercial use2 meanwhile the telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 provided that initial eligibility for any dtv licenses issued by the fcc should be limited to existing broadcasters broadcasters would be issued dtv licenses while at the same time retaining their existing analog licenses during the transition from analog to digital television the act provided that broadcasters must eventually return either their existing analog channel or the new digital channel also in the 104th congress major debate took place over whether to direct the fcc to conduct auctions for the spectrum allocated for dtv the fcc estimated the commercial value of the dtv spectrum to be between 11 billion to 70 billion legislation was enacted however and the fcc did not obtain the authority to auction the dtv licenses in 1997 the fcc adopted rules3 to implement the telecommunications act and granted dtv licenses to some 1600 full power incumbent television broadcasters4 1 fcc fourth report and order in the matter of advanced television systems and their impact on existing television service mm docket 87268 fcc 96493 released december 27 1996 2 four video formats are being used commercially by us television producers and manufacturers these four formats are described by the number of lines they produce per each picture frame and whether they use interlaced i or progressive p scanning techniques these are 480i and 480p suitable for sdtv broadcasts and 720p and 1080i hdtv the progressive scan video format is more compatible with pc displays while the interlaced scan is more compatible with analog television receivers 3 fcc fifth report and order in the matter of advanced television systems and their impact on existing television service mm docket 87268 fcc 97116 released april 21 1997 4 provision in the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 pl 107188 hr 3448 hrept 107481 addresses the digital conversion of full power television stations that received their analog licenses after the fcc allocated digital spectrum to existing analog stations in 1997 section 531 requires the fcc to allot digital channel to any requesting fullpower television station that had an application pending for an analog television station construction permit as of october 24 1991 and which had its application granted after april 3 1997 any station receiving digital spectrum under this provision is required to complete construction of its digital facility within 18 months without the possibility of an extension stations are also prohibited from operating an analog signal on its designated digital channel the bills conference report states that this provision will allow recent broadcast licensees to foster digital audience during the transition period to digital television without having to terminate analog service and that without this change those stations would be denied the flexibility to operate an analog and continued crs3 the dtv licenses consist of 6 megahertz mhz of unused spectrum within the vhf and uhf frequency bands because dtv signals cannot be received through the existing analog television broadcasting system known as ntsc5 the fcc decided to phase in dtv over period of years so that consumers would not have to immediately purchase new digital television sets or converters thus broadcasters were given 6 mhz of new spectrum for digital signals while retaining their existing 6 mhz for analog transmission so that they can simultaneously transmit ntsc and dtv signals to their broadcasting market areas6 the simultaneous broadcasting simulcasting of the same programs in both digital and analog modes was intended to allow viewers who have not yet purchased dtv sets or converters to continue to receive television programming during the transition to dtv the ruling required television stations receiving the dtv licenses to build their dtv facilities according to schedule determined by the size of their markets the fcc has granted extensions to licensees unable to meet the schedule due to unforeseeable or uncontrollable circumstances such as an inability to secure tower locations for new antennas the fcc set target date of 2006 for broadcasters to cease broadcasting the analog signal and return their existing analog television spectrum licenses to be auctioned for other commercial purposes during the 105th congress the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 made the 2006 reversion date statutory providing that broadcast license that authorizes analog television service may not be renewed to authorize such service for period that extends beyond december 31 2006 however the act required the fcc to grant extensions for reclaiming the analog television licenses in the year 2006 from stations in television markets where any one of the following three conditions exist if one or more of the television stations affiliated with the four national networks are not broadcasting digital television signal if digitaltoanalog converter technology is not generally available in the market of the licensee or if at least 15 of the television households in the market served by the station do not subscribe to digital multichannel video programming distributor including cable or satellite services and do not have digital tv sets or converters in the 109th congress the 2006 deadline for the digital transition was extended the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 signed by the president on 4 continued digital facility simultaneously in the near term especially in major markets 5 the national television systems committee ntsc was the industry group that developed the currently used us television standards 6 using digital technology the dtv frequencies can be placed in the vacant portion of the same spectrum band currently allocated for analog ntsc television without interfering with analog television broadcasts crs4 february 8 2006 sets hard digital transition deadline of february 17 2009 meanwhile since the beginning of the digital transition the fcc has continued to monitor the status of the dtv conversion of both commercial and noncommercial broadcast stations7 on august 6 2007 the fcc released the final assignment of digital television channels to be used post dtv transition for over 1800 stations8 on december 31 2007 the fcc released the third periodic review of the commissions rules and policies affecting the conversion to digital television in this report and order the fcc adopted procedures and rule changes necessary to ensure that broadcasters meet the statutory transition deadline and complete construction of their final posttransition facilities while maintaining the best possible television service to their viewers9 fullpower television stations are required to file status reports with the fcc detailing their transition status additional steps necessary and time line for making those steps in order to meet the february 17 2009 deadline status of the dtv buildout the nationwide buildout of digital television is complex and multifaceted enterprise successful buildout requires the development by content providers of compelling digital programming the delivery of digital signals to consumers by broadcast television stations as well as cable and satellite television systems and the widespread purchase and adoption by consumers of digital television equipment creation of digital programming digital programming is created with digital cameras and other digital production equipment digital content tends to favor more visual types of programming such as sports events or movies which take full advantage of the highdefinition viewing experience the amount of available digital programming is gradually becoming widespread among broadcast and cable networks delivery of digital signals currently there are three ways digital programming is being delivered to consumers digital signals are 1 broadcast over the airwaves 2 transmitted over channels provided by satellite television systems and 3 provided via digital cable service in growing number

public broadcasting digital signals in 211 markets10 this represents about 95 of the nations approximately 1700 fullpower television stations the 211 markets currently receiving digital transmissions cover over 99 of us tv households television stations must construct new facilities and purchase new equipment in order to transmit digital signals according to nab costs range from 810 million to fully convert station to digital operation11 nab has estimated that the total cost of the transition for broadcasters is 10 to 16 billion12 as of october 10 2007 the fcc has granted construction permit or license to 1706 stations about 99 of the total number of dtv allotments13 approximately threequarters of the 1240 fullpower commercial stations did not meet the may 1 2002 conversion deadline total of 843 commercial stations requested from the fcc an extension of the may 2002 deadline in order to complete construction of their dtv facilities so far 772 have been granted and 71 have been admonished of those stations granted extensions 602 filed requests for second extensions of this number 535 extension requests have been granted 67 have been dismissed and the rest remain pending third extension was requested by 141 stations 104 extensions were granted action was deferred for 30 satellite stations and 7 stations were admonished meanwhile 214 noncommercial educational

the past several years prices for dtv monitors and receivers have dropped markedly as the market for dtvs expands prices are expected to decrease further according to the consumer electronics association cea approximately 50 of us households owned digital television by the end of 200717 the average retail price of dtvs was projected to be 819 in 2007 224 drop from 200618 policy issues surrounding the digital transition the goal of the fcc and congress is to complete the transition to dtv as quickly as possible so that ntsc analog spectrum can be reclaimed and reallocated for other purposes some of the ntsc spectrum will be auctioned for commercial wireless services and some of it will be used for new public safety services the fcc has already designated some of the analog tv spectrum for public safety use the key issue for congress and the fcc has been what steps if any should be taken by government to further facilitate timely efficient and equitable 15 many cable and both dbs commercial services are digital however digital cablegenerally refers to technology which converts analog programming to digital signal which is transmitted to the consumer and then converted back to analog form for television viewing digital cable allows cable companies to provide more channels as well as high speed broadband internet service however the digital signals transmitted over cable systems use different digital standards than the dtv standard used by broadcasters and current dtv sets therefore current digital cable services currently cannot be directly received by dtv sets

interoperability digital conversion of public broadcasting stations digital conversion of low power television stations public interest obligations of dtv broadcasters and others activities in the 108th congress number of bills were introduced into the 108th congress relating in some way to digital television some urged congress to require broadcasters to return the analog spectrum on date certain under this approach spectrum would be freed up for other uses among legislation in the 108th congress the hero act hr 1425 and within 911 commission omnibus bills hr 5024 hr 5040 and s 2774 would have prohibited any delay in reassigning the 24 mhz for public safety purposes and required those frequencies to be operational by january 1 2007 during march and april 2004 another digital transition proposal was informally circulated by the media bureau of the fcc under this proposal the transition deadline would be moved from 2006 to 2009 cable and satellite providers would be required to carry broadcasters digital signal only but could if the broadcaster so chooses downconvert the digital signal to an analog signal that cable or satellite customers could watch on their analog televisions under this scenario according to the media bureau proposal cable and satellite tv households watching downconverted digital signals on their analog sets would be counted toward the 85 statutory threshold required in order for broadcasters to return to the government their valuable analog spectrum which can then be auctioned andor assigned for other purposes the commercial broadcasting industry expressed strong opposition to the media bureaus proposal20 according to the commercial broadcasters the proposal would discourage the development of digital television services such as hdtv and 19 for uptodate information on the current policy debate in the 110th congress see crs report rl34165 the transition to digital television is america ready by lennard g kruger 20

consumers to purchase dtvs additionally they argue if analog spectrum is reclaimed under the media bureau proposal tv households that are exclusively overtheair many of whom are economically disadvantaged would lose their television service altogether unless they purchased dtvs converter boxes or cable or satellite television subscriptions in response to these criticisms kenneth ferree former head of the media bureau argues that the development of digital services will not be adversely impacted because market forces will ensure that popular stations will likely be carried by cable and satellite tv providers in both digital and analog form by 2009 additionally suggests ferree economically disadvantaged overtheair households could receive federal subsidies derived from reclaimed spectrum auction proceeds for example for purchasing converter boxes thereby ensuring that these households will continue to receive television service21 during the summer of 2004 congress held three hearings on the digital television transition on june 2 2004 the house energy and commerce committee subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet held hearing on the ferree proposal advancing the dtv transition an examination of the fcc media bureau proposal june 9 2004 hearing held by the senate committee on commerce science and transportation entitled completing the digital television transition also examined the ferree proposal and other digital transition issues including the possibility of consumer subsidies for converter boxes finally the house subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet held another hearing on july 21 2004 looking specifically at lessons learned from berlin germany which successfully underwent transition to digital television in 2003 the hearing entitled the digital television transition what we can learn from berlin featured the release of general accountability office gao report entitled german dtv transition differs from us transition in many respects but certain key challenges are similar the gao identified three elements responsible for berlins successful digital transition implementing extensive consumer education providing subsidies to lowincome households for converter boxes and setting nearterm widely recognized shutoff date for analog tv service22 on july 22 2004 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission released its final report the commission recommended that congress support legislation which provides for the expedited and increased assignment of radio spectrum for public safety purposes in response to this recommendation on september 21 2004 senator john mccain introduced s 2820 the save lives act s 2820 would change the digital transition deadline from december 31 2006 to december 31 2008 spectrum for public safety would be freed for use by first responders and other spectrum would be available for commercial uses proceeds from the auctioning

transition program administered by the secretary of commerce which would subsidize consumers who continue to rely exclusively on overtheair broadcasts with analog televisions the program would give priority to lowincome households and would provide assistance for purchasing digitalto analog converter boxes or other technologies which would allow consumers to continue receiving television signals s 2820 also required labeling of analog televisions with the label stating it is unable to receive digital signals without converter box directs the department of commerce in consultation with the fcc to submit report to congress recommending consumer education program on the digital transition and requires the fcc to issue final decisions on its proceedings regarding dtv mustcarry and public interest obligations during the september 22 2004 markup of s 2820 in the senate committee on commerce science and transportation an amendment was offered by senator conrad burns which sets digital transition deadline december 31 2007 only for spectrum that has been designated for public safety and provides that the fcc may waive the deadline in given market to the extent necessary to avoid consumer disruption while ensuring the ability of relevant public safety entities to use such frequencies the burns amendment was subsequently adopted by the committee on september 29 2004 senator mccain offered modified version of s 2820 as an amendment to the national intelligence reform act of 2004 s 2845 as in committee senator burns offered modifying amendment to the mccain amendment at the request of senator mccain the senate approved by unanimous consent the mccain amendment as modified by the burns amendment the final version adopted into s 2845 sets the digital transition deadline of december 31 2007 only for spectrum that has been designated for public safety language regarding the fccs authority to waive the deadline to avoid consumer disruption was modified to read only if all relevant public safety entities are able to use such frequencies free of interference by december 31 2007 or are otherwise able to resolve interference issues with relevant broadcast licensee by mutual agreement23 the senate passed s 2845 on october 6 2004 other provisions of s 2820 relevant to digital television are retained within the senatepassed version of s 2845 however the sections regarding the digital transition consumer assistance fund and the 1 billion in consumer digital transition subsidies are moot because the legislation limits the digital transition deadline only to public safety spectrum and does not authorize auctions of commercial spectrum currently used for analog television broadcasts also labeling requirements would only go into effect if the fcc acts to set hard deadline for the return of analog spectrum the housepassed version of s 2845 passed on october 16 2004 contained nonbinding provision section 5011 expressing the sense of the congress that the 85 penetration test should be eliminated and that broadcasters should be 23 for more information on this issue see crs report rl32408 spectrum policy public safety and wireless communications interference by linda k moore crs10 required to cease analog transmissions by december 31 2006 in order that analog spectrum can be returned for public safety and commercial uses the conference report version of s 2845 contained digital television provision similar to the house language section 7501 states that it is the sense of congress that congress must act to pass legislation in the first session of the 109th congress that establishes comprehensive approach to the timely return of analog broadcast spectrum as early as december 31 2006 and that any delay in the adoption of such legislation will delay the ability of public safety entities to begin planning to use this needed spectrum the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 was signed into law on december 17 2004 activities and issues in the 109th congress during the first session of the 109th congress lawmakers debated when and how hard date for the dtv transition might be implemented thereby freeing reclaimed analog spectrum policy questions included should the thenexisting statutory digital transition deadline of december 31 2006 be implemented by modifying or removing the 85 digital penetration threshold requirement or would later and redefined transition deadline be more appropriate should the reclaiming of analog spectrum for public safety uses be singularly designated or should it be included as part of comprehensive approach to returning all of the analog spectrum appendix b in this report provides listing of dtvrelated legislation introduced into the 109th congress aside from ensuring that consumers enjoy the benefits of digital television reclaiming the analog spectrum was prime motivation in the desire of congress and the fcc to complete the digital transition as soon as possible portion of reclaimed analog spectrum will be allocated for first responder communications while the rest will be auctioned to the private sector for development and use of innovative telecommunications technologies such as wireless broadband budgetary considerations were also an important factor auctioning the analog spectrum could raise revenues in the billions of dollars estimates of possible crs11 auction revenues varied from 10 billion24 to 28 billion25 to 50 billion26 all or part of these auction proceeds could be used to reduce the federal budget deficit27 key issue in the debate was addressing the millions of american overtheair households whose existing analog televisions will require converter boxes in order to receive digital signals when the analog signal is turned off many policymakers asked whether should some form of financial assistance subsidies or tax credits for example should be provided by the federal government to enable overtheair households to purchase converter boxes or digital televisions should such assistance be provided to lowincome households exclusively or to all households should subsidies if warranted be financed by proceeds garnered by auctioning the analog spectrum and finally how much funding would subsidy program require and how much revenue is likely to be raised by auctioning the commercial portion of the reclaimed analog spectrum at the request of the house committee on energy and commerce the government accountability office gao conducted television characteristics survey involving 2471 randomly selected american households based on the survey gao found that 19 or 21 million households rely exclusively on overthe air television 57 or 64 million households rely on cable and 19 or 22 million have subscription to dbs satellite television additionally gao found that low income nonwhite and hispanic households are more likely to rely on overtheair television broadcasting28 gao estimated that if subsidy were needed only for overtheair households the cost could range from about 460 million to 2 billion depending on the cost of the settop box from 50 to 100 per box and whether subsidy recipients are limited to lowincome households under this scenario gao is assuming that cable and satellite providers would convert broadcasters digital signals to analog at the head 24 congressional budget office cost estimate digital transition and public safety act of 2005 october 24 2005 cbo estimates revenue of 125 billion from auction of spectrum vacated by analog broadcasters over the period 20062010 however cbo estimates that offering this new spectrum for auction will lower anticipated receipts by 25 billion for other spectrum already authorized for auction under current law thus auctioning spectrum released by the digital transition would increase net spectrum auction receipts by 10 billion 25 the brattle group 700 mhz band spectrum auction could yield 28 b analysis says

transition february 17 2005 available at httpwwwgaogovnewitemsd05258tpdf crs12 end such that cable and satellite tv consumers with analog sets would be able to receive the signal without converter box under different scenario gao assumed that cable and satellite providers would deliver highdefinition signals to the home thereby requiring consumers with analog sets to purchase converter boxes gao estimated that if subsidies were available to cable and satellite subscribers as well as to overtheair households the cost would range from 18 billion to over 10 billion again depending on the cost of the converter box and the use of means testing the gao estimate assumes subsidy for one converter box per household it should be noted that the vast majority of television households have more than one overtheair analog television each analog television set would need its own converter box to be able to receive digital signal the gao cost estimates also do not include the cost of implementing subsidy program nor do they take into account what form subsidy might take be it voucher tax credit rebate government supplied equipment or other means on may 26 2005 gao testified before the house energy and commerce committee on the administrative challenges that could arise in implementing subsidy for dtv equipment29 house activities on february 17 2005 the house energy and commerce committee subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet held the first of series of hearings on the digital transition at the february 17th hearing entitled the role of technology in achieving hard deadline for the dtv transition witnesses discussed the need for hard deadline and the possible costs of subsidizing overthe air analog viewers other issues discussed at the february 17th hearing included whether labels warning of possible analog signal shutoff should be required on new analog televisions purchased by consumers another key issue discussed was whether digital signals should be

analog spectrum in the range of channels 52 through 69 would be recovered and analog television service that is broadcast over the air would cease the december 31 2008 deadline would be hard deadline the legislation repeals the provision in current law allowing broadcasters to retain their analog spectrum indefinitely if 15 or more of television households are unable to receive digital signals the legislation also directs the fcc to release final digital channel assignments to all fullpower broadcast television stations by december 31 2006 and to issue six month status reports on coordinating

the digital transition unless connected to digital tuner digitaltoanalog converter box or cable satellite or other multichannel video services similar warnings are required to be posted in stores by retailers and run as public service announcements by broadcasters and cable and satellite providers finally the fcc and the ntia are required to engage in public outreach program to educate consumers about the deadline for termination of analog television broadcasting and the options consumers have after such termination to continue to receive broadcast programming preserving and expediting tuner mandates the legislation would move up the deadline by which all televisions with screens of 13 to 24 inches must contain builtin digital tuners the fccs current deadline is july 1 2007 the draft legislation would set an earlier deadline of march 1 2007 additionally the draft legislation prohibits the fcc from further revising its existing schedule for mandatory dtv reception capability digitaltoanalog conversion and must carry the legislation requires cable operators with capacities over 550 mhz and satellite television providers to offer to their customers broadcaster signals in both digital and analog formats for five years after the transition the legislation which allows cable and satellite providers to convert broadcaster signals at the headend would permit crs15 these providers to convert digital broadcasts to standard definition format which occupies less bandwidth than high definition signal if they so choose senate activities on july 12 2005 the senate commerce science and transportation committee held hearing on the dtv transition while consensus emerged on the need for hard deadline for digital conversion there was considerable disagreement among witnesses over the issue of cable and satellite carriage of multicast broadcast programming and whether congress should mandate which local broadcast stations might receive dual carriage both digital and analog signals by cable providers s 1932 digital transition and public safety act of 2005 on october 20 2005 the senate commerce science and transportation committee approved dtv legislative language

to the department of transportations essential air service program because the legislation was designed specifically for the budget reconciliation process specifics are included on how the converter box subsidy program would be framed or administered the legislation also does not contain language on the issues of cable carriage of multicasted digital signals and downconverted analog signals it is anticipated that separate dtv bill not attached to the budget reconciliation may be introduced in the future to address those and other issues not directly related to the budget reconciliation process

coupon program to mitigate the switchover costs to consumers with analog televisions the preeminent issue for congress is ensuring that american households are prepared for the february 17 2009 dtv transition deadline thereby minimizing scenario whereby television sets across the nation go dark specifically congress is actively overseeing the activities of federal agencies responsible for the digital transition principally the fcc and the ntia while assessing whether additional federal efforts including enhanced coordination and leadership are necessary particularly with respect to public education and outreach32 the congress is also monitoring the extent to which private sector stakeholders take appropriate and sufficient steps to educate the public and ensure that all americans are

digitalto analog converter boxes in the nprm ntia proposed that up to two 40 coupons 33 for information on spectrum issues related to the digital transition see crs report rs22218 spectrum use and the transition to digital tv by linda k moore crs20 will be available to households with analog televisions that exclusively rely on over theair broadcast signals cable or satellite television households would not be eligible even if they also happened to contain overtheair analog televisions not connected to cable or satellite systems ntia proposed that applying households would selfcertify that they only receive overtheair signals using an analog television ntia also asked for comments on whether economic need should determine whether household is eligible for the program and if so how economic need should be determined ie means testing34 in the nprm ntia also asked for comments on consumer education given that the deficit reduction act allocates more than 5 million for consumer education concerning the digital transition and the converter box program ntia noted that considering the costs of media production and paid advertising time the 5000000 limit necessitates that ntia carefully leverage the programs consumer education spending by collaborating with and complementing the consumer education efforts of broadcasters equipment manufacturers retailers consumer groups and others with stake in successful and timely transition to digital television broadcasting35 acknowledging the difficulty in reaching households most likely to rely solely on overtheair television ntia asked for ideas and comments on how best to reach those households on november 16 2006 representative john dingell and nineteen other democrats on the house committee on energy and commerce sent letter to ntia expressing concerns regarding the converter box program specifically the letter urged ntia not to restrict eligibility for converter box coupons to exclusively over theair households and instead to make coupons available also to any cable or satellite television households which may contain an overtheair analog television the letter also opposed means testing arguing that determining economic eligibility imposes too many administrative burdens on consumers urged performance standards for converter boxes which would ensure picture and audio quality and the ability of converter boxes to be updated modified or repaired and stated that 5 million for consumer education was inadequate urging ntia to target especially lower income households and other vulnerable groups36 on march 12 2007 ntia released its final rule implementing the converter box program37 the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 initially allocates 990 million for the converter box program and may subsequently

contingent period of the program the additional 510 million the rule also sets forth procedures and requirements for manufacturers and retailers who wish to participate in the converter box program manufacturers must submit test results and sample converter boxes to ntia for approval approved devices must meet prescribed technical specifications that are intended to ensure an affordable stateoftheart converter box additional permitted features include smart antenna interface connector and program guide features that would disqualify converter box from being covered by the coupon program include video recording playback capability or other capabilities which allow more than simply converting digital overtheair signal38 meanwhile retailers must receive certification from ntia in order to participate in the converter box coupon program certified retailers must agree to have systems in place capable of processing coupons electronically for redemption and payment track every transaction and provide reports to ntia train employees on the purpose and operation of the coupon program with ntiaprovided training materials use commercially reasonable methods to order and manage

available in local retail outlets consumer education with the february 17 2009 deadline for the digital transition approaching and with the public launching of the converter box program in january 2008 congressional concern is focusing on the adequacy of efforts to inform the public of the digital transition primary goal is preventing analog overtheair households from losing television service in the event that these households do not purchase converter box or take other measures to ensure the ability to receive digital broadcasts after february 17 2009 survey conducted by the national association of broadcasters nab found that 56 of overtheair viewers have never seen heard or read anything about the digital transition that only 10 were able to guess the right year when analog broadcasts will cease and that only 1 to 3 knew that the transition would be complete by february 200940 subsequent survey conducted by the association of public television stations apts in august 2007 found that 513 of americans were unaware of the dtv transition previous apts survey in november 2006 found the percentage of americans unaware of the dtv transition at 61241 two federal agencies

government accountability office gao stated that difficulties remain in implementing consumer education programs gao testified that because private sector dtv outreach efforts are voluntary government cannot be assured of their extent and that given the different interests represented by industry stakeholders messages directed at consumers vary and might lead to confusion46 as requested by the house committee on energy and commerce gao is performing an ongoing assessment of public and private sector dtv consumer education programs and is planning series of consumer surveys leading up to the transition date major component of any dtv public education campaign is likely to be the airing of public service announcements psas the national association of broadcasters nab is preparing psas to be delivered to local broadcasters by december 2007 it will be up to local broadcasters to decide when and how often to air the psas on october 15 2007 the nab announced 697 million consumer education campaign including dtv spots crawls and 30 minute educational programs47 meanwhile in september 2007 the national cable telecommunications association ncta began running on cable channels 200 million english and spanish language advertising campaign on the digital transition ncta will continue the advertising spots through february 200948 in its nprm the fcc states its belief that psas are the most effective and efficient way to reach overtheair television viewers about the digital transition the fcc is proposing to require television broadcast licensees to conduct onair consumer education efforts and is asking for comments on the content of such psas when and how often they should be run whether similar requirements should be imposed on all broadcasters and other related questions49 digital multicasts and downconversion digital multicasting refers to the ability of broadcasters to divide their 6 mhz of digital spectrum into separate and discrete streams of content thus for example broadcaster could transmit alternate channels of programming such as weather news or foreign language for example in addition to its primary digital video broadcast on february 10 2005 the fcc affirmed its prior decision that cable operators are not required to carry more than single digital programming stream from any particular broadcaster at issue is whether must carry requirements should be expanded such that cable operators would be required to carry any or all additional multicasted channels transmitted by commercial broadcasters 46 government accountability office testimony

diminished if they have guarantee that cable systems will carry that programming cable providers counter that their decision whether or not to carry additional programming streams from broadcaster should be dictated by the market rather than mandated in the 109th congress hr 5252 as reported by the senate committee on commerce science and transportation did not explicitly address multicast must carry and to date multicast mustcarry legislation has been introduced however fcc chairman kevin martin has publicly stated his support for requiring multicast mustcarry and suggested the possibility of reconsidering the fccs 2005 decision which was issued under the previous fcc chairman michael powell50 two of the fcc commissioners who voted against multicast mustcarry michael copps and jonathan adelstein stated that they may be willing to reexamine the issue if public interest obligations of broadcasting multicast signals are also addressed51 an attempt to require multicast mustcarry at the fccs june 2006 meeting was withdrawn by chairman martin when it became clear that the order lacked votes necessary for passage52 related issue is the extent to which cable providers may be permitted or required to carry downconverted analog signals after the digital transition takes place many cable households will likely continue to use analog televisions which cannot receive digital signal cable companies might offer or lease converter boxes to these customers or customers may be required to purchase their own converter box as an alternative it is possible that cable providers might seek authority from congress to downconvert the digital signal of selected local broadcast stations to analog format to serve customers with digital televisions cable providers would continue to provide digital signals as well in other words dual carriage under this scenario key issue is whether and if so how congress should mandate which local broadcast stations would receive the benefit of dual carriage to cable customers in the 109th congress hr 5252 as reported by the senate committee on commerce science and transportation contained language that would require satellite carriers and cable operators with capacities of greater than 550 megahertz to offer through february 17 2014 mustcarry locally broadcast digital signals in formats viewable on both analog and digital televisions cable operators with capacities of 550 megahertz or less would be required only to offer those signals in analog format through february 17 2014 while maintaining the option of offering digital signals as well cable operators and satellite carriers would have the option of providing standard definition digital signals in lieu of high definition signals and 50 martin backs broadcasters on

5252 allowing cable operators and satellite carriers to provide digital signals in standard definition format was opposed by broadcasters and the consumer electronics industry they argued that permitting conversions of broadcasters signals to standard definition format removes the incentive for consumers to purchase high definition television sets while also giving cable and satellite providers the opportunity to offer their own programming in higher quality format ie high definition than what they might offer for broadcasters digital programming cable companies asserted that the legislation provides seamless digital transition for the majority of consumers who have not yet purchased high definition sets53 on april 25 2007 the fcc adopted second further notice of proposed rulemaking nprm54 asking for comment on proposals to ensure all cable subscribers including those with analog tv sets can view mustcarry television stations on cable systems after the transition to digital television occurs on february 17 2009 in the nprm the fcc pointed out that about 50 of all cable subscribers approximately 32 million households are analog cable subscribers additionally many digital cable subscribers have one or more television sets that only receive analog cable service55 by statute cable operators must ensure that all subscribers are able to view all mustcarry local broadcast stations in the nprm the fcc proposes that cable operators must either 1 carry the signals of all mustcarry stations in an analog format to all analog cable subscribers or 2 for alldigital systems carry those signals only in digital format provided all subscribers have the necessary equipment to view the broadcast the fcc also reaffirmed that cable systems must carry high definition broadcast signals in hd format and asked for comment on whether the commission should move from subjective to an objective measure of what constitutes material degradation56 on september 11 2007 the

by july 1 2005 all consumer electronics devices capable of receiving an overtheair dtv signal would have been required to be manufactured to incorporate content protection technologies that would limit the redistribution of digital television content when the broadcast flag is recognized however on may 6 2005 the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia struck down the fccs

fccs authority is not limited with respect to approving technologies that allow for the redistribution of digital broadcast content within the home or similar environment finally broadcast flag could not be used to restrict the distribution of news and public affairs programming of which the primary commercial value depends on timeliness the fcc would allow broadcasters to determine whether that timeliness criteria is met such determination by broadcasters would be subject to fcc review under certain conditions meanwhile on november 3 2005 the house committee on the judiciary heard witnesses in support and opposition to draft legislation that would require consumer electronics devices such as digital video recorders to incorporate technology designed to prevent unauthorized copying and distribution of digital content obtained through the analog hole the draft legislation was the basis for the digital transition content security act of 2005 hr 4569 introduced by house judiciary committee chairman james sensenbrenner and ranking member john conyers on december 16 2005 crs29 appendix background on selected policy issues digital must carry under the must carry provisions of the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 cable tv providers are required to transmit local analog programs to their customers this decision was based on the reasoning that since cable tv has predominant position in the market without mandatory carriage provisions the economic viability of local broadcast television and its ability to produce quality local programming would be jeopardized59 the commercial broadcasters primarily the smaller networks and independent stations represented by the association of local television stations but also the national association of broadcasters believe that the same principles and conclusions of the 1992 act should apply to dtv services leading to mandatory carriage of the dtv programming by cable operators broadcasters argue that because most americans receive their tv via cable the carriage of dtv programming by cable providers is essential for consumers to purchase dtv receivers the cable companies led by the national cable television association ncta oppose any must carry requirements for cable operator carriage of dtv programming arguing that it would be an unlawful taking of their property and that they should be able to decide what content they provide on their own networks ncta points out that unlike the commercial broadcasters who were given free spectrum licenses for dtv cable operators must build their own infrastructure to be able to transmit dtv signals cable operators say they will carry commercial broadcasters dtv programming as soon as consumer demand warrants it cable television services provide finite number of channels to consumers and any mandate to provide dtv programming would require cable companies to remove other nonbroadcast channels many cable operators are investing in the upgrades needed to provide dtv although the video transmission standards adopted by cable operators may not be the same as those used by the broadcasters this could mean that different home equipment may be necessary for cable services than for overthe air tv reception in addition hdtv programming will require cable operators to build more robust transmission ie greater bandwidth capability than is required by sdtv and some cable operators may want to offer sdtv but not hdtv services the cable industry also contends that mandating carriage of all dtv broadcast transmissions will financially devastate many smaller cable operators responding to the debate between the broadcast and cable industries over whether cable tv providers should be required to transmit dtv programming in 59 ibid p 5 satellite television is also subject to must carry requirements see crs report rs20425 satellite television historical information on shvia and local by marcia s smith crs30 july 1998 the fcc initiated proceeding on the matter60 on january 22 2001 the fcc announced its adoption of rules for cable carriage of digital tv signals most notably the fcc ruling did not require cable systems to simultaneously carry both the analog and digital signals dual carriage of local tv stations the fcc tentatively concluded that such requirement appears to burden cable operators first amendment interests more than is necessary to further substantial governmental interest61 while not approving dual carriage mandate the fcc did rule that digitalonly tv station whether commercial or noncommercial can immediately assert its right to carriage on local cable system additionally tv station that returns its analog spectrum and converts to digital operations must be carried by local cable systems cable systems must carry primary video defined as single programming stream and other programrelated content the fcc continued to examine the mustcarry issue through 2004 of particular interest was how mustcarry rules would ultimately apply to digital multicasting which refers to the ability of broadcasters to divide their 6 mhz of digital spectrum into separate and discrete streams of content at issue is whether cable operators should be required to carry any or all additional multicasted channels transmitted by commercial broadcasters as part of their 6 mhz digital allotment on january 31 2005 the national cable television association ncta and the association of public television stations apts announced an agreement under which cable companies would provide dualcarriage both analog and digital of at least one public television station in market during the transition as well as carrying up to four multicasts of public stations after the transition under the agreement apts will longer lobby the fcc or congress for government must carry mandates on february 10 2005 the fcc affirmed its prior decision that cable operators are not required to carry more than single digital programming stream from any particular broadcaster the fcc also affirmed the previous tentative conclusion not to impose dual carriage requirement on cable operators mandating digital tuners after the digital transition existing analog television sets will not be able to receive digital signals unless they are attached to converter box however it is possible to manufacture analog televisions with digital tuning capability already built in such televisions would not require separate converter box in order to receive overtheair broadcasted digital signals on august 8 2002 the fcc adopted phasein plan requiring most new television sets to contain digital tuners by 2007 specifically the fccs second report and order and second memorandum opinion and order fcc 02230 requires all television sets

and antitax groups the cea citing the scant percentage of households relying on overtheair television reception argued that the mandate is multibillion dollar tv tax on american consumers and called instead for an fcc mandate on cabledtv compatibility standards62 this position was countered by the national association of broadcasters who argued that the mandate is necessary to hasten the dtv transition and ensure the survival of free overtheair broadcasting which nab says is currently received by roughly one third of all tv sets in use63 subsequently the agreement between the consumer electronics and cable industries on cabledtv interoperability standard dampened ceas opposition to the digital tuner mandate because the circuitry enabling plug and play compatibility between digital televisions and cable systems could be modified to receive digital overtheair signals at an incremental cost64 however in november 2004 the cea along with the consumer electronics retailers coalition cerc petitioned the fcc to eliminate the deadline of july 1 2005 for digital tuners in 50 of televisions in the 25 to 36 inch midsized screen size range alternatively cea and cerc proposed that the digital tuner deadline for all 100 of televisions in that size range be moved up from july 1 to march 1 2006 on february 14 2005 the fcc announced notice of proposed rulemaking to consider whether to

digital televisions and cable systems are necessary in order for consumers to be able to watch digital programming over their cable systems traditionally interoperability has been achieved via the proprietary settop box leased to the subscriber by the local cable company given the absence of national interoperability standard consumers had been unable to purchase dtv products from consumer electronics stores which can be directly connected to cable systems without the use of settop box two separate entities the consumer electronics industry including manufacturers and retailers and the cable system operators have embarked on an often contentious process of determining the specific technical details of how dtv devices might achieve nationwide compatibility and interoperability with cable systems section 304 of the telecommunications act of 1996 directed the fcc to adopt regulations to assure the commercial consumer availability of navigation devices ie settop boxes remote control units without jeopardizing the rights of cable provider to protect its signal from theft currently proprietary settop boxes are integrated with two overall functions security and navigation ie allowing the subscriber to flip from channel to channel 1998 order adopted by the fcc fcc 98116 required the cable operators to separate the security functions from non security functions and to make available by july 1 2000 modular security components to the consumer electronics industry74 allowing time for transition the fcc order permitted cable operators to continue to provide integrated

fcc stated that it would entertain requests for waivers of the prohibition as the july 1 2007 deadline approached many cable providers sought waivers from the fcc urging that the july 1 2007 deadline be extended by two years cable providers argued that imposing the ban would raise the costs to consumers of leasing the new cablecard enabled boxes without adding any new functionality and divert industry resources from developing lowcost digital settop boxes needed for the digital transition cable companies also argued that next generation network architect security downloadable security will likely be available in 2008 or 2009 rendering cablecard technology obsolete the consumer electronics industry on the other hand argued that if the july 1 2007 deadline was extended the value of cablecard technology to consumers would be further diminished thereby making it more likely that consumers would not purchase plug and play digital sets with integrated tuners and continue to opt for sets which rely on the settop boxes supplied by cable providers ultimately the fcc granted some waivers for small cable operators experiencing difficulty obtaining new equipment as well as for operators pledging an alldigital conversion by february 17 200976 large cable operators such as comcast and time warner have not been granted waivers and must comply with the july 1 2007 deadline

as direct broadcast satellite dbs or internet protocol ipbased video services digital conversion of public broadcasting stations the fcc set deadline of may 1 2003 for public television stations to convert to digital unlike commercial broadcasters public television broadcasters were not opposed to an early deadline for returning analog spectrum provided that mechanism was put in place which would ensure that converter boxes are made available to exclusively overtheair households public broadcasting stations view digital television as an opportunity to enhance and expand services to their local communities for example public television stations are using multicast channels to provide programming streams dedicated to formal and childrens education workforce development public affairs

may not exceed 3 kilowatts for vhf channels or 150 kilowatts for uhf channels and must not cause interference in the reception of full service television stations concerns have arisen that many lptv stations will lose their licenses in the transition to dtv while the fccs february 1998 modification to its table of allotments for dtv licensees did provide for some lptv licensees to be relocated to new frequencies many would still lose their licenses under fcc digital transition plans to provide some relief for lptv licensees the community broadcasters protection act of 1999 was enacted as part of the intellectual property and communications omnibus reform act of 1999 pl 106113 this law established class status to qualifying lptv licensees giving them measure of protection from fullpower tv stations in the transition to dtv the act directs that class licensees be accorded primary status as television broadcasters prescribes the criteria lptv stations must meet to be eligible for class status and outlines the crs41 interference protection class stations must provide to other television stations to implement the act in april 2000 the fcc established rules for class lptv licensees to facilitate the acquisition of capital for lptv stations to continue to provide free overtheair programming to their communities80 in accordance with the 1992 cable act 47 usc 534 cable television providers are required to transmit to their audiences the locallygenerated programming of all fullpower tv broadcasters that request carriage provision known as mustcarry under the 1992 act some lptv stations are entitled to mustcarrystatus if they meet certain criteria81 the fccs april 2000 ruling did not address the question of whether class licensees should be entitled to the mustcarry provision as are fullpower broadcast tv stations petition filed with the fcc argued that class licenses should be granted the same mustcarry status as fullpower broadcasters the fcc subsequently ruled that class stations do not have the same must carry rights as full service television stations82 on august 6 2003 the fcc adopted notice of proposed rulemaking83 to seek comment on rules for digital low power television and digital television translator stations on september 9 2004 the fcc adopted rules to allow for the digital conversion of lptv and translator stations while requiring the conversion to digital operation the fcc did not set digital transition deadline for lptv and translator stations the final transition date on which analog operations will cease will be considered in the fccs third dtv periodic review proceeding84 the conference report accompanying the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 hrept 109362 clarified that only fullpower stations not lowpower stations must cease analog broadcasting by february 18 2009 lowpower stations may continue analog broadcasts after that date subject to future decisions by the fcc on how to complete the digital transition for lowpower stations the conference report stated that lowpower stations other than class stations may continue broadcasting above channel 51 subject to fcc decisions so long as those stations 80 fcc report and order in the matter of establishment of class television service mm docket 0010 fcc 00115 released april 4 2000 81 those criteria 47 usc 534 include among other requirements that the

served by the cable system and that the lptv station provides the only news coverage in its community of license 82 fcc memorandum opinion and order on reconsideration in the matter of establishment

telecommunications and information administration of the department of commerce85 on october 29 2007 ntia announced the start of the lptv digitaltoanalog conversion grant program that will help lowpower television stations continue analog broadcasts the program will provide funds to eligible lowpower stations that must purchase digitaltoanalog conversion device to convert the incoming digital signal of fullpower television station to analog for transmission on the low power stations analog channel applications are being accepted between october 29 2007 and february 17 2009 the lowpower television and translator upgrade program which will reimburse the costs of upgrading lptv and translator analog stations to digital will be announced at future date86 growing issue of concern to lptv and class stations is the capability of digitaltoanalog converter boxes to pass through broadcasted analog signals in addition to receiving and converting digital signals lptv stations are not subject to the february 17 2009 digital conversion deadline and will continue to broadcast analog signals household that receives both fullpower and lptv broadcast signals and that installs converter box in order to receive the fullpower stations digital signal would not be able to receive the lptv stations analog signal unless the converter box is equipped with an analog signal pass through capability ntia permits but does not require manufacturers to install an analog signal pass through capability in certified converter boxes arguing that such requirement could raise the cost of the boxes and pose possible interference problems for the digital signal the community broadcasters association cba representing lptv and class stations has filed complaint against the fcc asserting that the ntiacertified 85 for more information on these grant programs see the ntia website at httpwwwntiadocgovotiahomedtvlptvdigital_070622_filesframehtm 86 for further information on

for ancillary or supplemental services the telecommunications act pl 104104 states that if dtv licensee offers ancillary or supplemental services for which they receive subscription fee or other compensation the fcc shall establish program to assess and collect from the licenseean annual fee or other schedule or method of payment the act further states that the collection of fees shall be designed i to recover for the public portion of the value of the public spectrum resource made available for such commercial use and ii to avoid unjust enrichment through the method employed to permit such uses of that resource88 congress is overseeing the fccs actions regarding implementation of this law public interest groups have also maintained pressure on the fcc to establish fee program arguing that commercial broadcasters should compensate the american people for the use of the dtv spectrum and that fees should be required out of fairness to those who paid for spectrum at fcc auctions such as licensees for personal communications services in november 1998 the fcc adopted rules to require broadcasters to pay 5 of their gross revenues from ancillary or supplementary uses of dtv spectrum for which they charge subscription fees or other specified compensation89 these include subscription video software distribution data transmissions teletext interactive materials aural messages paging services and audio signals home shopping channels and infomercials are not subject to fees because the fcc did not consider them new services the fcc has initiated separate proceeding to determine how much noncommercial stations can use the dtv spectrum for revenuegenerating services and whether they should have to pay spectrum fees some consumer groups say that the fccs spectrum fees are not heavy enough on commercial broadcasters arguing that most revenue will come from home shopping and infomercials they also warn that public broadcasters should not be over regulated arguing that too heavy burden placed on public broadcasters could impair their longterm viability on october 11 2002 the fcc ruled that noncommercial stations are required to use their entire digital capacity primarily for nonprofit noncommercial educational broadcast services however the fcc also ruled that the statutory prohibition against advertising on noncommercial broadcasts does not apply to any ancillary or supplementary services presented on an excess dtv channels that does 87 community broadcasters association petition for declaratory ruling in the matter of compliance of digital

further ruled that public stations must pay fee of five percent of gross revenues generated by ancillary or supplementary services provided on their dtv service90 public interest obligations of dtv broadcasters in march 1997 president clinton established an advisory committee on public interest obligations of dtv broadcasters to make recommendations on how dtv licensees should compensate the public for their licenses committee members were selected from government the broadcasting industry academia and consumer interest organizations after series of public meetings in 1997 and 1998 the committee submitted set of recommendations to vice president gore in december 1998 the recommendations consist of mostly voluntary actions by broadcasters including providing five minutes per night of air time for candidatecentered discourse in the 30 days prior to an election some panel members wanted to recommend mandating the free air time as well as other committee proposals the white house referred the report to the fcc which on december 15 1999 opened notice of inquiry noi proceeding to solicit public comment on public interest obligations of tv broadcasters as they transition to dtv mm docket 99360 after reviewing public comment the fcc in september 2000 issued the dtv public interest form notice of proposed rulemaking nprm which sought to require television broadcasters both digital and analog to disclose on quarterly standardized form how they are serving the public interest also in september 2000 the fcc issued the childrens dtv public interest nprm mm docket 00 167 which focused on the obligation of broadcasters to provide educational and informational programming for children and the requirement that licensees limit advertising in childrens programs the fcc has not yet issued any decisions in those proceedings given the significant amount of time that has passed the second periodic review of fcc rules and policies affecting dtv conversion issued on january 27 2003 has asked for further comment on the public interest obligation issue91 on august 4 2004 the fcc adopted report and order fcc04192 which implements several steps identified in the second periodic review however action was taken regarding public interest obligations on september 9 2004 the fcc adopted report and order92 addressing childrens programming obligations for digital television broadcasters the fcc issued guidelines on the obligation to provide educational programming for children and the requirement that children are protected from excessive and inappropriate

requirements for multicast digital television channels s 616 introduced on may 12 2005 by senator rockefeller sought to require broadcasters providing digital television multicasts to increase educational and informational programming for children hearings held in the 110th congress have addressed the issue of public interest obligations of dtv broadcasters on february 1 2007 the senate committee on commerce science and transportation held hearing on the communications marketplace at which all five fcc commissioners testified in response to questions on public interest obligations of broadcasters two opposing views emerged according to commissioner michael copps we have to really get serious about determining what those public interest obligations are going to be were going into the digital age now were giving the right to use that spectrum to broadcast six or if you have duopoly 12 program streams in the community and weve done well on the mechanics of that but the big question is what do the american people have right to expect from them cant they get more community affairs local affairs and the things youre talking about we ought to complete the proceedings that have already been begun weve had since 1999 pending proceeding on the public interest obligations of dtv broadcasters and weve done the childrens programming out of that but all the other things are lying fallow so we really need to tee that up and get done with that so i absolutely share your sense of urgency theres higher priority i think that the commission has94 on the other hand fcc chairman kevin martin expressed reservations on placing certain obligations on broadcasters well you know i guess i would say im hesitant to actually put specific requirements on the type of programming that theyve got to put on there have been lot of proposals that have been put forth for example that we should be requiring individual broadcasters to put free air time specific amount of free air time available to political candidates and thereve been those who have come forward with this repeatedly in the context of the digital transition saying 93 for more information see httphraunfossfccgovedocs_publicattachmatch doc251972a1pdf 94 federal news service inc transcript of hearing of the senate commerce science and transportation committee the communications marketplace view from the fcc february 1 2007 crs46 we should make digital television broadcasters provide free air time to political candidates and im hesitant about saying that were going to require broadcasters to provide that kind of free air time95 similarly in response to questions from the house energy and commerce committee both commissioners copps and adelstein called on the fcc to move forward on the dtv public interest obligation proceedings96 however at the fcc oversight hearings held by the house energy and commerce committee on march 14 2007 fcc chairman martin maintained that many of the rules that were part of that proceeding such as childrens programming have already been addressed by the fcc chairman martin stated that the one issue thats remaining is whether were going to require minimum quantities of certain kinds of broadcasting im not convinced that thats necessary97 tower siting one obstacle to the broadcasters ability to offer dtv services has been the opposition from state and local communities over the building of new signal transmission towers98 in most cases dtv antennas can be built on top of existing towers used for analog tv broadcasting if new towers are required however they must be constructed before the stations can transmit dtv signals in august 1997 the fcc released an nprm fcc 97182 to consider the preemption of state and local zoning restrictions on the siting placement and construction of dtv broadcasting facilities in its january 18 2001 report and order the fcc concluded that while some stations are facing problems with tower availability andor local zoning issues such problems do not seem to be widespread at this time99 95 ibid 96 responses of fcc commissioners jonathan adelstein and michael copps to questions from
