from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re why are the temperature data from hadley different from nasa date thu 16 oct 2008 130059 0400 cc judith lean jleanssd5nrlnavymil yousif k kharaka ykharakausgsgov thanks philthis all makes sense ill be intrigued to hear more about how the melting sea ice issue is going to be dealt with question there is lot of warming going on up there hope to see you one of these days mike on oct 16 2008 at 652 am phil jones wrote hi mike judith and yousif mike has basically answered the question the giss group average surface t data into 80 equal area boxes across the world the uk group crumohc grid the data into 5 by 5 degree latlong boxes as does ncdc these griddings dont allow so much extrapolation of data extrapolation beyond the small grid box the us groups also calculate the globe as one domain whereas we in the uk use nhsh2 this also makes some difference as most of the missing areas are in the sh and currently the nh is warmer than the sh with respect to 196190 our rationale for doing what we do is that it is better to estimate the missing areas of the sh which we do by tacitly assuming they are the average of the rest of the sh from the rest of the sh as opposed to the rest of the world the arctic is problem now with less sea ice we are getting sst data in for regions for which we have 196190 averages because it used to sea ice so had measurements we are not using any of the sst from the central arctic in summer so we are probably underestimating temperatures in the recent few years were working on what we can do about this there are also more general sst issues in recent years in 1990 for example almost all sst values came from ships by 2000 there were about 20 from buoys and drifters but by 2008 this percentage is about 85 were also doing comparisons of the drifters with the ships where both are plentiful as it is likely that drifters measure tenth of one degree c cooler than ships and the 196190 period is shipbased average new version of the dataset coming in summer 2009 all the skeptics look at the land data to explain differences between datasets and say urbanization is responsible for some or all of the warming the real problem is the marine data at the moment attaching recent paper on urbanization and effects in china cheers phil at 2208 15102008 michael mann wrote hi judith its nice to hear from you been too long several years my understanding is that the differences arise largely from how missing data are dealt with for example in jim et als record the sparse available arctic data are interpolated over large regions whereas phil an co either use the available samples or in other versions eg brohan et use optimal interpolation techniques the bottom line is that hansen et j05 i believe weights the highlatitude warming quite bit more which is why he gets warmer 05 while phil and co find 98 to be warmer but phil can certainly provide more informed and complete answer mike ps see you at agu this year on oct 15 2008 at 503 pm judith lean wrote hi yousif many apologies for not replying sooner to your email but ive only just returned from travel and am still catching up with email unfortunately i am simply user of the surface temperature data record and not an expert at all so cannot help you understand the specific issues of the analysis of the various stations that produce the differences that you identify i too would like to know the reason for the differences fortunately there are experts who can tell us and i am copying this email to mike mann and phil jones who are such experts mike and phil hi hope you are both well can you please please help us to understand these differences that yousif points out in the giss and hadley center surface temperature records see two attached articles many thanks for even brief answer or some reference judith on oct 8 2008 at 150 pm yousif k kharaka wrote judith i hope you are doing well these days ok would be good at work and personally can you help to understand the huge discrepancy see below between the temperature data from the hadley center and giss any simple explanations or references that i can read on this topic i certainly would appreciate your help on this best regards yousif kharaka yousif kharaka research geochemist phone 650 3294535 u s geological

subject why are the temperature data from hadley different from nasa 18link david and all one advantage or great disadvantage if you are very busy of membership in gccc is that you are forced to investigate topics outside your areas of expertise for some time now i have been puzzled as to why global temperature data from the british hadley centre are different from those reported by nasa giss especially in the last 10 years giss reports that 2005 was the warmest year see first attachment on record and that 2007 tied 1998 for the second place the hadley group continues reporting 1998 strong nino year as having the highest global temperature and then showing temperature decreases thereafter the two groups report their temperatures relative to different time intervals 19511980 for giss 19611990 for hadley but much more important is the fact that giss data include temperatures from the heating arctic that are excluded by others see second attachment if you are interested in the topic of sun spots the 11year irradiance cycle and solar forcing versus aghgs see the first attachment for what nasa has to say we may need help on this complex topic from true climate scientists such as
