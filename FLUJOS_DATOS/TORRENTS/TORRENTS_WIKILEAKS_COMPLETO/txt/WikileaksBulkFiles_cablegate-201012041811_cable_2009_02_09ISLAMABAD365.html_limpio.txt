to washington classified by anne w patterson for reasons 14 bd 1 s summary chief of army staff coas general ashfaq kayanis february 2027 visit to washington comes on the heels of the governments loss of control over swat continued pakistani armyfrontier corps operations in the tribal areas and stillsimmering indopak tensions in the wake of the mumbai attacks we expect kayani will request increased intelligence sharing realtime sigint and isr help to modernize his helicopter fleet increased support for civilian law enforcement and financial compensation for pakistanis displaced by combat he likely will complain about delays in coalition support fund payments suggest that us policy on strikes in the tribal areas be amended and request information about plans for us troop surge in southern afghanistan 2 c we should recognize growing pakistani casualties in the fight against militants praise kayanis support for the civilian democratic government in islamabad reiterate the longterm us commitment to support pakistan and thank him for agreeing to send his intelligence chief and director of military operations to the holbrookeriedel uspakistan strategic review meeting in washington we should also thank kayani for the gops effort to ensure that usnato continues to deliver fuel and dry goods through pakistan for our forces in afghanistan 3 c but we need to lay down clear marker that pakistans armyisi must stop overt or tacit support for militant proxies haqqani network commander nazir lashkaretaiba we should preface that conversation with an agreement to open new page in relations kayani who was isi chief from 20042007 does not want reckoning with the past given the gop surrender of swat to local taliban we need to press kayani to commit his now reluctant army to retake the area after the peace deal inevitably fails 4 c we should press for pakistani prosecution of the mumbai suspects encourage expanded usg training of army and frontier corps forces raise the prospect of embedding us military observersadvisors with the frontier corps support prioritized needsbased fmf request that builds coin capability ask kayani to explain how pakistan plans to back us efforts to stabilize afghanistan and probe for what indian action would allow him to redeploy troops from his eastern front to support increased combat in the pakafghan border area suggested talking points and bio are included at paras 2830 end summary supporting democratic governance 5 c the civilian government headed by prime minister yousaf gilani elected one year ago is now stable president zardaris elected position is politically secure and gilani has majority in parliament the pakistan peoples party ppp and its coalition allies rule in three of the four provinces and effectively control all three branches of federal government opposition leader nawaz sharif is by far the most popular politician in pakistan with an 83 approval rating compared to zardaris 20 in the latest iri poll but he does not have the votes to bring down the government 6 c zardari is cementing leadership alliances so he can avoid another election until he receives international assistance to address food and fuel inflation electricity blackouts and high unemployment pakistan has met its firstquarter targets under 67 billion imf standby agreement but the economy remains too weak to support the pakistani militarys appetite for expensive weapons systems particular f16s 7 c president zardari and kayani are the key decisionmakers in pakistan they have developed respectful if not entirely trusting working relationship kayani has gone out of his way to publicly defer to zardari because he needs political support to wage successful military islamabad 00000365 002 of 006 operations after eight years of military rule under musharraf zardari is reshaping civilianmilitary relations in the shadow of pakistans history of repeated military coups it is in usg interests for the zardarigilani government to complete its full fiveyear term and we should praise kayanis efforts to support civilian democracy 8 c kayani may advocate for pending legislation kerrylugar in the us congress to triple nonmilitary assistance to pakistan and robust usg support for an imfworld bank donors conference to provide 4 billion in social safety net programs to compensate for imfimposed budget cuts we anticipate that special representative holbrooke will attend donors conference in april kayani may request additional us support for civilian law enforcement in addition to the over 40 million of equipment and training delivered to the frontier corps we are providing 15 million in additional equipment for the northwest frontier province nwfp police and are working to reprogram another 55 million in fy2009 there is fy2009 supplemental request pending for another 95 million for the police 9 c kayani will request cash to assist more than 300000 internally displaced persons idps who have fled fighting in the federally administered tribal areas fata and swat nwfp through usaid stateprm and dod we already have provided over 10 million in assistance and are preparing to respond to new unhcricrcworld food program appeals for pakistan of particular interest will be us plans to continueexpand the delivery of 2 million in cerplike assistance from dod through the frontier corps to idps in support of kayanis counterinsurgency strategy 10 c security concerns are limiting our ability to operate but today usaid contractors are building schools and wells hiring workers for shortterm jobs training teachers and increasing the capacity of the fata secretariat to deliver services that demonstrate the writ of government in fata the big strategic questions 11 s zardari and gilani agree that pakistans biggest threat comes from growing militant insurgency on the pakafghan border the military and isi have not yet made that leap they still view india as their principle threat and afghanistan as strategic depth in possible conflict with india they continue to provide overt or tacit support for proxy forces including the haqqani group commander nazir gulbaddin hekmatyar and lashkaretaiba as foreign policy tool 12 s the single biggest message kayani should hear in washington is that this support must end it is now counterproductive to pakistans own interests and directly conflicts with usg objectives in afghanistanwhere haqqani is killing american soldiers and afghan civiliansand the regionwhere mumbai exposed the fruits of previous isi policy to create lashkaretaiba and still threatens potential conflict between nuclear powers 13 s kayani will want to hear that the us has turned the page on past isi operations he was isi chief from 20042007 we should ask for his views on what political end state in afghanistan would convince him to end proxy support for militants and probe for what would be required by india to allow him to redeploy forces from the indian border for the fight in fata the reality is that without redeployment he does not have the forces however poorly trained to combat the insurgency in fata pakistani will 14 c the good news is that the armyfrontier corps are engaged in combat in bajaur and mohmand fata zardari is committed to the fight he knows that osama bin laden has publicly targeted pakistan and admits the militants are islamabad 00000365 003 of 006 after and my job the bad news is that the militants increasingly are setting the agenda 15 c the governments antiterrorism strategy is based on dialogue deterrence and development however it lacks the military capacity to deter militants and the financial resources to develop the fata and nwfp its historic fallback has been to play for time by conducting negotiations with militants disastrous tactic that only has made the extremists stronger the government insists it will negotiate with tribal leaders but not with militants 16 c however in the latest agreement in swat once tourist resort approximately 90 miles from islamabad the provincial government agreed to negotiate for peace in exchange for imposition of sharia law with the taliban this was recognition of defacto taliban control which produced beheadings closure of girls schools growing exodus of terrified citizens and the desertion of outgunned and outmanned police hamhanded military tactics which included indiscriminate artillery bombardment have further alienated population that simply wants the fighting to end under international pressure zardari has not yet signed off on the deal pending assurances it really will deliver peace similar negotiation in 2008 failed 17 c kayani who supported the swat deal will argue that he does not have the forces to battle on multiple fronts so he is picking his battles and negotiating to preserve later options we should push back hard noting that it will be difficult for international donors to support government that is not prepared to go allout to defend its own territory vs capability 18 s now absorbing combat losses against formidable militants pakistans frontier corps fc and military finally have begun to accept more usg training and assistance in support of counterinsurgency coin kayani will appreciate us recognition of the casualties his men have suffered and this is an opening we should exploit to press for expanded fc and special forces ssg training kayani remains leery of too large usg military footprint in pakistan but to win he must be able to fight without creating the level of civilian casualties his forces blind artillery and f16 bombardments are now producing we are responding to pakistan air force requests for close air support training to improve the precision of f16s they are using in fata we should probe for the possible introduction of us military observersadvisors to improve the coin capability of this 1940s force 19 s kayani will repeat his requests for increased intelligence sharing notably sigint in support of ongoing military operations in fata pakistan has agreed to build additional tripartite border coordination centers bccs and this month we will expand realtime tacticaltargetfocused intelligence sharing through the torkham bcc we continue to work on delivering intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr aerial capability two b350ers that kayani has raised with all his highlevel visitors 20 c the bush administrations commitment to provide pakistan with 300 million annually in fmf expires in 2009 and we need to come to agreement with pakistan on how to restructure its fmf program to meet its longterm coin needs the pakistan military has requested 1b per year for five years fy1014 in fmf 21 c kayani may request additional us support for pakistans f16 program the flagship symbol of post911 reengagement we are about to send to congress notification for an additional 142 million in fmf support for one part of this complex program but we do not believe pakistan can afford to complete 2 billion plus program to buy 18 new f16s upgrade 35 older aircraft upgrade new base and fund munitions package given the funding and production islamabad 00000365 004 of 006 line implications of either bailing out the gop or canceling the program us agencies are reviewing our options 22 c we could not agree more with kayani on the need to modernize pakistans helicopter fleet on any given day they have perhaps 23 attack helos flying in support of coin operations we now are delivering spare parts for their cobra and bell 412s overhauling and upgrading their mi17s and assessing ways to improve overall helicopter maintenance us strikes 23 s as recent media reports indicate the us has eliminated 10 of the top 20 alqaida operatives in pakistan over the last year however the strikes have put increasing political pressure on the pakistani government which has struggled to explain why it is allowing an ally to violate its sovereignty the gop so far has denied recent media reports alleging that the us is launching the strikes from bases in pakistan kayani knows full well that the strikes have been precise creating few civilian casualties and targeted primarily at foreign fighters in the waziristans he will argue however that they undermine his campaign plan which is to keep the waziristans quiet until the army is capable of attacking baitullah mehsud and other militants entrenched there in recent meetings with special representative holbrooke variety of pakistani interlocutors and now the press suggested that the us work jointly with pakistan and target mehsud or other militants who are killing pakistanis afghanistan 24 c pakistannatoafghan cooperation and coordination across the border has improved dramatically in recent months this includes exchanges of tactical intelligence that allows nato forces to block passes in support of pakistani operations and has helped lower attacks on usnato forces in recent meetings with isaf commander mckiernan kayani raised concern about the effect of us troop buildup in southern afghanistan which could push militants and refugees across the border into balochistan and prompt an influx of foreign fighters pakistan currently has only one army brigade and perhaps 15 frontier corps wings stationed along the vast and largely unpopulated pakafghan border in balochistan 25 c following embarrassing militant attacks on usnato convoys last year pakistan has made efforts to secure khyber agencytorkham gate through which usnato trucks deliver 30 of the fuel and 80 of the dry goods for our forces in afghanistan the troop surge will require us to send additional supplies through the chaman balochistan border crossing in afghanistan centcom is now evaluating ways to improve delivery of supplies through pakistan india 26 c indopak tensions are still simmering but to avoid potential indian military strike the gop needs to continue to show progress on prosecuting those lashkaretaiba let operatives responsible for the mumbai attacks india has welcomed the gop decision to file formal charges against the key masterminds of mumbai islamabad now awaits an indian response to requests for additional information forensics ballistics reports etc from new delhi to support prosecution nukes 27 s although he has remained silent on the subject kayani does not support zardaris statement last year to the indian press that pakistan would adopt first use policy on nuclear weapons despite increasing financial constraints we believe that the military is proceeding with islamabad 00000365 005 of 006 an expansion of both its growing strategic weapons and missile programs pakistans strategic assets are under the control of the secular military which has implemented extensive physical personnel and command and control safeguards our major concern has not been that an islamic militant could steal an entire weapon but rather the chance someone working in gop facilities could gradually smuggle enough fissile material out to eventually make weapon and the vulnerability of weapons in transit despite court decision to free nuclear proliferator aq khan the gop continues to assure us he remains under significant travel and media restrictions 28 srel pak suggested talking points srel pak what is in the past is behind us what we seek going forward is an allencompassing bilateral relationship based on what we can accomplish for the future we recognize your sacrifices and are wellaware of the trustdeficit that exists on each side we must both work to overcome it crel pak we appreciate your efforts to support stable civilian democracy in pakistan and are working to provide democracy dividend that improves both economic conditions and the law and order situation srel pak we must succeed in afghanistan what is your vision for what constitutes an acceptable outcome srel pak we want more pakistani forces deployed to the western border to fight the militants what conditions are necessary for you to reposition forces from the eastern to the western border srel pak it is time to cut your ties to extremist groupsproxy forces and urge the permanent severing of ties such ties hinder trust and our ability to move forward together srel pak our security relationship must move beyond the provision of equipment and we seek opportunities to expand training throughout the military srel pak our ability to deliver sustained security assistance also depends on the administration securing congressional approval congress is likely to prioritize assistance to counterinsurgencyrelated equipment and training as well as align its support with pakistani performance in the field srel pak strikes in the fata are succeeding in eliminating the enemy senior leadership and collateral damage has been minimal we are working to provide you with tactical battlefield intelligence to support your operations in fata bio notes 29 u general ashfaq
