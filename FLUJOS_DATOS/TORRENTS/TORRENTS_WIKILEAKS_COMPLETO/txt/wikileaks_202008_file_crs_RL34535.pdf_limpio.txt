taxpayer has negative taxable income an nol can be used to obtain refund for taxes paid in the past andor to reduce future tax obligations the process of using an nol to refund previously paid taxes is known as an nol carryback whereas the process of using an nol to reduce future taxes is known as carryforward under current law there is 2ye ar carryback period and 20year carryforward period for most business taxpayers recently the american recovery and reinvestme nt act of 2009 hr 598 and s 1 introduced in the 111th congress would provide taxpayers with an opportunity to extend the carryback period for up to five years for nols incurred in 2008 and 2009 under hr 598 taxpayers nol would be reduced by 10 if the taxpayer elected the extended carryback period both bills would suspend the 90 alternative minimum tax limitation on deductions for nols incurred in 2008 and 2009 in addition hr 598 and s 1 would prohibit companies receiving aid under the troubled asset relief program tarp from electing the extended carryback period in the 110 th congress legislative attention also focused on temporarily extending the twoyear carryback period early versions of the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 hr 3221 included proposals that would have extended the carryback period to up to four years the final version of hr 3221 that became law pl 110289 left the carryback period unchanged the small business stimulus act of 2008 s 2552 and s 2553 would extend the carryback period to five years for losses incurred in 2007 and 2008 the midwestern disaster tax relief act of 2008 s 3322 and hr 6587 proposes to extend the twoyear nol carryback period to four years for qualified disaster areas affected by recent severe weather in the midwest the intent of the nol carrybackcarryforward provision is to give taxpayers the ability to smooth out changes in business income and therefore taxes over the business cycle extending the carryback period would enhance the ability of fi rms to smooth income by allowing losses to be offset against longer period of past profits rather than having them carried forward the extension would however increase revenue losses to the federal government economic theory suggests that under certain conditions extending the carryback period indefinitely could minimize the distorting effects taxation has on investment decisions and in turn increase economic efficiency this result stems from the observation that the majority of the tax burden falls on risky investments the government by allowing nol carrybacks effectively enters into partnership with taxpayers when losses are allowed to be carried back sharing both the return to investment tax revenue and the risk of investment revenue loss extending the carryback period indefinitely would reduce the tax burden by reducing the private risk associated with investing further gains in economic effici ency are possible if the government can spread risk better than can be done in private markets those gains however come at the expense of lost federal revenue this report explains the current law and proposed legislation regarding the tax treatment of nols in addition this report highlights number of policy considerations relating to the extension of the nol carryback period this report will be updated in the event of legislative changes

business income is negative the year in which an nol occurs is called the nol year or loss year taxpayers have tax liability in the year that they experience an nol an nol can be used however to obtain refund for taxes paid in prio r years andor to reduce future tax liabilities using an nol to refund past taxes paid is known as an nol carryback applying an nol to future tax liability is referred to as an nol carryforward or carryover according to the joint committee on taxation the intent of the nol carrybackcarryforward provision is to give taxpayers the ability to smooth out changes in business income and therefore taxes stemming from the business cycle and unexpected financial losses1 in the 110th congress legislative attention has focused on temporarily extending the

years following the nol year 2 an nol may not be used to offset more than 90 of taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income amti in any one year the internal revenue code lists several exceptions to the general 2year carryback20year carryforward provision3 for example losses as result of casualty theft or presidentially declared disaster are eligible to be carried back three years farming losses may be carried back five years the portion of an nol due to specified liability loss may be carried back to the 10 years preceding the loss year 4 real estate investment trusts reits are not allowed to carry an nol back but are entitled to carry loss forward up to 20 years current law stipulates that an nol is to be first carried back to the two years preceding the loss year beginning with the earliest year first if the carryback does not fully exhaust the nol the remaining portion is then carried forward to the 20 years following the loss years to take advantage of an nol taxpayer must file either an amended income tax return or an application for tentative refund 5 the taxpayer would use the appropriate form to first recalculate his or her tax liability for the earliest eligible carryback year this calculation involves claiming the nol as part of that years tax deductions the taxpayer then receives as refund the difference between 1 us congress joint committee on taxation

liability resulting from the nol carryback6 although the procedure is for an nol first to be carried back to the earliest carryback year and then applied to each successive year taxpayer may irrevocably waive the carryback period the nol is then carried forward in manner similar to the one described above taxpayer expecting to be in considerably higher tax bracket in the future may find it beneficial to only carry an nol forward in general however taxpayer will prefer to carry back an nol rather than carry it forward carryback allows an immediate benefit of the amount of the refunded tax payment whereas carryforward reduces future taxes whose value must be discounted to the present the need to discount future tax reduction due to an nol carryforward results in the present value of an nol carryback exceeding the present value of an nol carryforward 7 carryback additionally provides certain tax refund whereas carryforward reduces tax liability at some potentially uncertain time in the future g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g6g142g159g142g149g152g153g150g142g151g157g156g561 the current regime of 2year carryback period and 20year carryforward period was instituted in 1997 with the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 prior to that time nols were subject to 3year carryback and 15year carryforw ard the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 increased the nol carryforward period from 7 to 15 years since 1997 changes to the carryback period have either involved temporary extensions or targeted provisions for example in the 105 th congress the tax and trade relief act of 1998 pl 105277 permanently extended the nol carryback period for losses relating to farming to five years the 107th congress temporarily extended the nol carryback period from 2 to five years for losses incurred in 2001 and 2002 as part of the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107147 the extension designed to provide tax incentives for economic recovery also allowed nol carrybacks and carryovers to offset up to 100 of businesss amti the 109 th congress passed the gulf opportunity zone act of 2005 pl 109135 in response to the destruction caused by hurricanes katrina rita and wilma the act extended the carryback period from two to five years for qualified losses occurring in the gulf opportunity zone or go zone in addition the act expanded the list of acceptable deductions used for determining nols in the go zone effectively increasing the amount of losses taxpayer could recover in the 110 th congress number of bills have been introduced that would extend the nol carryback period early versions of the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 hr 3221 included proposals to extend the carryback period to up to four years the final version of hr 3221 that became law pl 110289 left the carryback period unchanged 6 practical illustration is useful to show how an nol carryback works one can be found in appendix 7 the present value of future cash flows reflects the time value of money ie why dollar received today is more valuable than dollar received in the future appendix b explains the concept of present values also contained in appendix b is an example computing the present value of an nol carryback and an nol carryforward

would promote income smoothing by allowing taxpayers to fully recover current losses now as opposed to in the future in addition extending the carryback period would enhance the ability to smooth income by allowing losses to be offset against longer peri od of past profits rather than having them carried forward the extension would however increase revenue losses to the federal government as previously mentioned carrybacks are more valuable than carryforwards due to the time value of money ie dollar today is more valuable than dollar in the future economic theory suggests that under certain conditions extending the carryback period indefinitely would minimize the distorting effe cts taxation has on investment decisions and in turn increase economic efficiency 10 this result stems from the observation that the majority of the tax burden falls on risky investments the government effectively enters into partnership with taxpayers when losses are allowed to be carried back sharing both the return to investment tax revenue and the risk of investment revenue loss extending the carryback period indefinitely would reduce the tax burden by reducing the private risk associated with investing further gains in economic efficiency are possible if the government can spread risk better than private markets the need to minimize revenue losses introduces some practical limitations that prevent the indefinite carryback of nols some economists believe that allowing indefinite carrybacks would result in large negative revenue effect particularly during an economic downturn 11 others have noted that encouraging investors to undertake risky investments is generally highly desirable except in periods of acute economic boom12 it could be argued that in an extremely expansionary period investors are already making sufficiently risky investments and that adding further incentives to take on more risk is unnecessary although an indefinite carryback period may be practically infeasible most economists agree that the nol carryback period must be long enough to allow for adequate income smoothing and an efficient degree of investmentrisk reduction over the business cycle since world war ii the duration of the average bus iness cycle has been approximately six years extending the nol carryback period to at least the length of the typical business cycle would arguably allow for more income smoothing and risk reduction income smoothing and risk reduction could also be enhanced by paying interest on losses carried forward 13

apply their losses over longer profitable period in the past resulting in more immediate refund of taxes paid than would have otherwise been possible the refund could provide businesses that are unable to raise capital in financial markets with enough extra cash to pursue profitable investment opportunities the current lack of available credit stemming from events in the subprime mortgage market that have spilled over into other segments of the financial markets could be one reason why it may be difficult for some to secure investment financing other economists have argued that some businesses are unable to raise capital needed to make new investments because profitable investment opportunities are limited as result of the recent slowdown in economic activity firms could be in clined to hold onto any increase in cash resulting from larger nol carryback refunds if rewarding investment opportunities do not appear uncertainty over the current path of the economy may further exacerbate the desire of some firms to hold cash and invest it at later date it has been noted by some that an extension of the carryback period would tend to benefit older businesses over newer businesses 14 older businesses that are currently experiencing losses but that have been profitable in the years included in the proposed extended carryback window will receive an immediate and certain tax refund new firms on the other hand do not necessarily have long past of profitable years to which nols can be carried back these younger firms can therefore only carry losses forward but carryforwards are valued less than carrybacks because carryforward must be discounted and also because its benefit depends on the realization of income at some uncertain point in the future thus the benefits of the proposed carryback legislation would tend to accrue to older businesses g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 policy makers face number of tradeoffs when addressing the desirability of an extension of the nol carryback period longer carryback period would reduce the tax burden on business taxpayers by reducing private risk and promoting income smoothing and as result increase economic efficiency on the other hand the revenue effect on the federal budget will be larger the longer losses are allowed to be carried back in the shortrun extending the nol carryback period will provide some business investors with an influx of cash but it does not guarantee that these taxpayers will use the cash to pursue new stimulative investment opportunities if attractive investment opportunities exist in the economy then allowing businesses access to previously paid taxes may result in the undertaking of new investment on the other hand if there is large degree of economic uncertainty businesses will likely hold on to any nol tax refund in this case the stimulative effects would diminish another issue is determining the optimal carryb ack and carryover period lengths twoyear carryback period is relatively short compared to the average post world war ii business cycle of around six years longer carryback period may increase the ability to smooth income over the business cycle however it is also important to keep in mind the tradeoffs previously discussed 14 benzion barlev and haim levy loss carryback and carryover provision effectiveness and economic

for smoothing of income table a1 illustrates two firms whose total business income costs and taxable income are similar over twoyear period the firms differ however in the timing of their annual income and costs it is assumed that both firms face 35 corporate income tax firm as taxable income in each year is 25 million therefore each year firm pays 875 million in corporate income taxes for total twoyear tax liability of 175 million firm has nol in either year so its tax liability with and without nol carrybacks is the same firm b has taxable income equal to 75 million in year one but incurs an nol equal to 25 million in year two firm b must pay 2625 million in taxes in year one if firm b is not permitted to carryback its yeartwo nol its total twoyear tax liability will equal taxes paid in year one 2625 million on the other hand if firm b is allowed to carryback its yeartwo nol it will be able to receive partial refund for taxes paid in year one to receive the refund firm b will recalculate its yearone tax liability by subtracting its 25 million nol in year two from its 75 million yearone taxable income and applying the 35 corporate income tax rate the recalculated yearone tax liability is found to be 175 million 50 million 35 firm b is then entitled to receive as refund in year two the difference between its taxes actually paid in year one and the new recalculated tax liability the refund paid to the firm in year two as result of its nol is calculated to be 875 million 2625 million 175 million allowing firm b the opportunity to carry back its nol allowed it to smooth income as result both firms had the same total twoyear tax liability inline with both firms having the same total twoyear taxable income t able a1 net operating loss example in millions of doll

g18g155g142g156g142g151g157g561g24g138g149g158g142g156g561 the concept of present value is essential to understanding the time value of money ie why dollar received today is more valuable than doll ar received in the future money received at different points in time is valued differently because of the opportunity to earn return on money received earlier as result taxpayers will usually prefer to carry back an nol and receive income in the present year rather than carry it forward and wait to receive income in the future to see this consider taxpayer that must decide between an nol carryback and an nol carryforward for simplicity it is assumed that the taxpayer can either receive tax refund today equal to 10 million from carrying back the nol or reduce taxes owed next year by 10 million by carrying the nol forward it is also assumed that the annual rate of return on investment is 10 by choosing to carryback the nol the taxpayer receives 10 million today which could be invested to earn 10 return on the other hand the taxpayer forgoes the opportunity to such return if they choose to carry the nol forward thus the taxpayer will prefer to carry the nol back rather than carry it forward an economist would say that the present value of the nol carryback is greater than the present value of the nol carryforward the formula for calculating the present value pv of x to be received n years in the future is pvx rn 1 where r is the return on investment eg an interest rate when the rate of return is 10 the pv of 10 million carryforward tax rebate that is to be received in one year is pvmillion rmillion 10 9111 therefore 10 million received in one year is equivalent to 91 million received today but the present value of 10 million carryback tax refund which is received today is simply 10 million thus it is preferable to carry back an nol in order to receive money today rather than to carry it forward to reduce future taxes

should earn interest this could benefit taxpayers unable to fully exhaust their nols through carrybacks as mentioned previously in the report new firms may not have enough years of past profitability to fully take advantage of an nol carryback allowing interest to accrue on carryforwards could reduce the discrepancy between the nol tax treatment of new and old firms continuing with the previous example assume that taxpayer can either receive tax refund today equal to 10 million from carrying back an nol or reduce taxes owed next year by 10 million by carrying an nol forward again it is assumed that the rate of return on investment is 10 now however assume that the government pays interest on carryforwards equal to the taxpayers rate of return on investment thus 10 million rebate from carryforward that earns 10 interest will be worth 11 million in one year recall that the formula for calculating the present value pv of x to be received n years in the future is pvx rn 1 where r is the interest rate when the interest rate is 10 the pv of 10 million carryforward tax rebate that earns 10 interest and will be received in one year is pvmillionmillion 10 10110 1101 therefore 10 million carryforward that earns 10 interest and that will be received in one year is equivalent to 10 million received today recall that the present value of 10 million carryback tax refund which is received today is simply 10 million thus when nol carryforwards earn interest they will have the same present value as carryback in this example taxpayers will be indifferent between carryback and carryforward the example above assumes that firms rate of return on investment is equal to what the government would pay in interest it is likely the government would use treasury rate to determine the interest paid on nol carryforwards the present value of an nol carryforward would be less than an equal nol carryback if the interest rate paid on carryforwards by the government were less than the firms rate of return on investment on the other hand the present value of carryforward would exceed that of an equal carryback if the governments interest rate were greater than the firms rate of return on investment
