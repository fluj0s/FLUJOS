from the apa rtheid era although south africa has relatively high levels of health care expendit ure as percentage of gdp compared to other middleincome countries it still has relatively worse health status indicators this is due to other social and economic determinants such as unhealthy life style such as smoking alcohol abuse risky sexual behaviours that fuel hivaids and other sexually transmitted dis eases and the increasing chronic illness burden various forms of injuries also contribute to worse health outcomes key to differential access to quality heal th care and hence poor health outcomes is the maldistribution of human financial and physic resources between the public and private sectors the majority of financi and human resources for health services are located in the private health sector serving minority section of the population largely those who are medical schem members who constitute about 15 of the population in contrast the public health sy stem continues to struggle to meet the health care needs of the majority of the population with extremely limited resources achievements since 1994 2 since 1994 the government scored several public policy successes which include inter alia expansion of primary care revitalisation and refurbishment of hospitals scalingup art rollout improvements in the pharmaceutical logistics cha in medical research maintaining and growing health professional training nd combating smoking and piloting innovative publicprivate partnerships furthermore significant progress has been made in establishing legisla tive and regulatory framework for the medical schemes industry 3 the anc health plan of 1994 was an informed transformation process w hich began with the integration of the fourteen 14 departments of health of t he apartheid era into single health system consisting of central ministry and nine 9 provincial departments of health the principle here was to create unified national health system integrating the public and private sectors wit h the objective of reducing inequities and expanding access to essential health care for all 4 much has been achieved beyond the establishment of structures and development of policies and strategies the focus on primary health care phc resul ted in the re prioritisation of budgets and resources to bring about an equitable redistributi on between phc and sophisticated curative and tertiary care an sential phc package was formulated which sets the norms for the provision of comprehensive primary care services to increase access to these services user fees for public phc and all fees including at hospitals for pregnant women and children under the age of 6 years were removed to support the expansion of these services 1 800 clinics and community health centers were built since 1994 today 95 of the populat ion of south africans can access health care within five kilometres radius of their homes 5 hospital infrastructure was also improved significantly beginning with t he hospital revitalization programme which focused on the improvement of infrastructure equipment management and quality of care to date 250 hospitals have been revitalised and 18 new hospitals built of which three are teaching hospitals 6 in order to remedy shortages in the number of health professionals in rural areas the government recruited cuban doctors in the immediate post1994 period introduced compulsory community service for recent medical graduates introduced scarce skills and rural allowances for health professionals and more re cently developed strategy for the retention of skilled workers occupation spe cific dispensation for specific occupational categories such as nurse doctors and others 7 to make medicines affordable the state introduced comprehensive national drug policy in 1996 one of the main pillars of which was the essential drug list edl for the public sector it provided for much more rational drug prescribing and the introduction of generic prescribing throughout the health system however there i s need to review this policy to evaluate its impact and to improve where necessary 8 the government also introduced many targeted health care programmes incl uding those focusing on women children and diseases such as hivaids t b alcohol and tobacco use malaria control mental health and nutrition 9 notwithstanding these achievements there are many challenges facing the health care system challenges facing the public health sector 10 south africa has twotiered health system with large private sector serving the higher income minority while the public sector serves the majority of t he population about 40 of total health care funds in south africa flow via public sector financing intermediaries primarily the national provincial and loc departments of health while 60 flows via private intermediaries m edical schemes are the largest financing intermediaries accounting for nearly 46 of health care expenditure although medical schemes are private intermedia ries they are also funded by government through tax subsidies provincial health departments follow as the next largest intermediary with 38 of all he alth care funds flowing via them households outofpocket payments directly to health c are providers also account for sizeable contribution at nearly 14 of all hea lth care expenditure 11 one of the major challenges that has faced the public health sect or since the 1994 democratic elections is the stagnation in funding allocations for the publ ic health sector in real per capita terms government expenditure on health decli ned consistently from the mid 1990s until 2002 and only returned to its 1996 level s in 2005 mcintyre et 2007 this was largely due to the constrained government expenditure associated with the growth employment and redistribution gea r policy since 2005 there have been some increases in real per capita public health budgets inability to treatment people with tb 12 according to the department of health and the who south africa is one of the 22 high burden countries that contribute approximately 80 of the total global burden of all tb cases it has the seventh highest tb incidence in the world as result of the double burden of disease related to coinfection with h iv south africa has seen rise in the incidence of tuberculosis in the adult population with threefold increase in the numbers of people with tb from 109000 in 1996 to 341165 in 2006 or 269 cases of tb cases per 100000 to 720 per 100000 population this has resulted in increased morbidity mortality and poor performance on the mdg 2015 targets 13 drug resistant tb arises as result of failures of the public and private health system to adequately deal with patients who have tb according to the medical research councils drug resistant surveillance mrc 20012002 the proportion of people with extrapulmonary tb trebled to around 15 and the proportion of people who were coinfected with hiv in 2002 was around 55 tb patients who are hiv positive need to commence arvs early in addition 900 cases of extensive drug resistant tb were reported between 2004 and 2007 although the cure rates and treatment success have gradually increased from over the last five years with 66 in 2000 to 70 in 2004 the defaulter rates remain high this has created hurdles in achieving the targets for treatment s uccess and cure and has increased the probability for drug resistance 14 the most critical component in the management and eradication of tb pertains to addressing the social determinants of tb these include poverty eradicat ion nutrition housing and improvement of living and working conditions however effective public health as well as clinical interventions is als critical in ensuring adequate and effective management and eradication of tb and its complications t this effect the department of health developed the draft tuberculosis strategic plan for south africa 20072011 the financial barriers to seeking health care at the early and lat ent stages of tb mean that significant number of household and others are infected before diagnosis of tb has been made inequities in the health sector 15 inequities in access to health care remain key challenge tha t should be addressed in fundamental way 16 major access dimension that has posed problems for south africans i s that of the affordability of health services in population survey undertaken in 2005 166 or 52 million people indicated that they experienced difficulties in accessing health care including medicines shisana et 2007 17 furthermore inequities in the publicprivate health care mix have incre ased government expenditure on health care per person dependent on the public health sector has barely kept pace with inflation while real medical sc heme expenditure per beneficiary has doubled in the past decade with excessive cost increases in key parts of the private health sector at the same time despite pol icy efforts public sector health services continued to face severe budget constraints and still fall significantly short of the goal of unified comprehensive equitable and int egrated national health system 18 the mismatch of resources in the public and private health sectors relative to the size of the population each serves and the inefficiencies in the us of available resources has contributed to the very poor health status of south africans particularly in the lowest income population we have far higher infant nd child mortality rates and far lower life expectancy than other countries w ith similar levels of economic development this is not only attributable to the hivaids and tuberculosis epidemics confronting our country but also due to the massive inequalities in the distribution of income and health and other social services human resource challenges 19 there is serious maldistribution of health workers in the country with 60 of the nurses and 40 of the doctors serving 85 of the population using the public health sector most of the health workers work in urban areas while there is serious shortage in the rural areas this disproportionate distribution obtains by province with the western cape and gauteng having high numbers of doctorto population ratios when compared with the rest of the provinces 20 nurses form the backbone of the health care system and yet they are i n short supply this is largely due to number of factors including cuts in the provincial budgets and the closure of nursing colleges which has resulted in fewer nurses being trained but even those who were trained do not all go on to pract ice in this country for example it is estimated that about 67 of nurses who trai ned in the period 1997 to 2005 do not appear on the south african nursing council sanc register breier et 2008 some leave the country to seek greener pa stures in countries that pay them higher salaries such as saudi arabia oman united kingdom united states of america canada and australia 21 another indicator of staff shortage is the vacancy rate persal data suggest that the vacancy rate was between 315 in 2006 to 36 in 2007 hst 2007 which translates to 25 701 nurses that would be needed for different positions brei er et 2008 good measure of shortage is failure to fill vacant posts followi ng advertisements researchers at the human sciences research council hsrc found that the vacancy fill rate for registered nurses and midwives was 56 suggesting that there is shortage of nurses in general some of the rea sons given by employers for the failure to fill the vacant posts were that nursing i s not well paying job that it has low recognition low promotion potential and long unsoc iable hours of work that nurses run the risk of contracting hiv and that many grate to other countries cited in breier et 2008 major concern is tha t 16 of health workers are living with hiv shisana at 2004 and 189 of the hiv pos itive workers are classified as eligible for arv therapy connelly et 2007 22 linked to the issue of nurses is the shortage of medical practitioners and other allied professionals access to quality health care for the majority of south africans using the public health sector is negatively affected by inadequate supply of medical practitioners and allied professionals many migrate to developed countrie s in the north in 2001 the oecd estimated that 8921 south african doctors were in t hese countries reasons advanced for migration of these doctors include crime deteriorating public education better pay abroad deteriorating conditions in the public sector and active foreign recruitment these are challenges t hat the state must address if south africa is to retain the doctors that it trains at high cost of r780 000 per doctor breier wildschut 2006 23 the shortage of key health professionals is being experienced at tim when the size of the population dependent on public health services has been increa sing and the burden of illhealth among the population primarily due to the hivai ds and associated tb epidemics is increasing this has placed incredible strain on public sector health services and on the staff who work in public sector facilities 24 professional assistants or midlevel workers are relatively new cadre of semi skilled health care workers in the health sector in south africa this cadre of workers improves access to health care to all sectors of the populati on based on the primary health care approach irrespective of geographical location by maki ng up for the scarcity or absence of professionals such as doctors dentists pharmacists physiotherapists or nurses etc professional assistants play particul arly important role in staffing rural health centres primary health facilities and distric t hospitals to bridge the gap between the urban and rural divide and well resourced and unde r serviced areas access to medicines 25 another challenge facing the public health sector is the shortage of drugs at public health facilities especially aids drugs and the ability to acc ess medicines at lower prices the private sector on the other hand actually has an oversupply of pharmacists resulting in pharmacies being located in close proximity to one another in urban areas the rural populations on the other hand have little or ccess to pharmacies this maldistribution is the result of the disproportionate hea lthcare financing system despite government efforts to reduce the prices of medici nes in the private sector they remain unaffordable to the majority of south afric ans private insurance members often exhaust their medicines benefit before the end of each year and have to access their drugs through out of pocket payments or waiting in the long queues in the public sector challenges in the private sector26 in contrast to the public sector expenditure in the privat sector has continued to increase at annual rates far exceeding the inflation rate since the 1980s membership of medical schemes has become increasin gly unaffordable for south africans as expenditure increases so d the contribution rates or premiums that are charged by medical schemes in the late 1980s and early 1990s contribution rates were increa sing at between 25 to 30 per year in real terms mcintyre et 1995 t he rate of annual contribution increases has reduced dramatically in recent years but the average annual real increase in contributions of 7 b etween 2000 and 2005 is still of concern although medical scheme membership i ncreased from about 65 million in the early 1990s to 69 milli on by 1997 the absolute total number of beneficiaries decreased in some years therea fter and had only remained at 69 million by 2005 medical scheme membe rship has declined considerably as percentage of the populatio n from 17 of the population in 1992 mcintyre et 1995 to less than 15 in 2005 council for medical schemes 2006 27the main cost drivers of medical schemes expenditure have been private hospitals specialists and medicines administration and b rokers while in the 1980s and first part of the 1990s expenditure on medi cines was increasing more rapidly than other categories of medical schemes expenditure expenditure on private hospitals rapidly incr eased in the latter part of the 1990s and the 2000s mcintyre and doherty 2004 real per beneficiary expenditure on specialists increased by 53 betwe 1997 and 2005 while that on hospitals increased by 74 over th is period very little of the hospitals expenditure was directed to public sector hospitals spending on private hospitals accounted for 985 of all medical scheme expenditure on hospitals in 2005 council for medical scheme s 2006 medical scheme expenditure on hospitals per beneficiary in creased three times more than inflation between 1997 and 2005 mcintyre et 2007 28 the current expenditure subsidy for medical schemes was estimated to be in the range of r10billion of foregone revenue in 2005 or 20 of the public health sector budget this tax policy has major flaws firstly i t is inconsistent with the principles of access efficiencies and equity th current tax expenditure subsidy on medical schemes deduction has not cont ributed to increased access by low income earners in medical scheme membersh ip nor improved the rising costs of the industry those in the h igh income tax brackets continue to benefit more from the subsidy than the middle and low income groups furthermore the workers including the informal workers not covered by medical schemes do not benefit from the tax bsidy at all secondly even when low income earners get tax subsidy they would not be able to afford adequate coverage leaving them with modest benefits and high cost sharing that will often make health care unaff ordable 29there are range of reasons for the large increases in medical scheme expenditure including the feeforservice reimbursement mechanism which encourages providers to supply more services than may be strictly necessary from clinical perspective there has also been growing imbalance in the relationship between purchasers medical scheme s and providers this is particularly the case with private hosp itals where three large hospital groups own about 84 of all private hospi tals van den heever 2007 low bed occupancy 30 whilst hospital beds in the public sector have declined the number of private hospitals and clinics continues to grow the private sector has added lmost 7 000 beds between 1998 and 2006 the 20072008 council for medical schemes cms annual report indicates that there are presently 28000 private beds in south africa with an additional 4000 added between 2004 and 2008 the bed occupanc rate in the private sector is currently at 65 and the bed oversupply is roughly 10000 bed occupancy in the private sector increased slightly from 6209 to 6452 between 2006 and 2007 the mining industry also provides its own hospitals and has 60 hospitals and clinics around the country with surplus capacity 31 the 20072008 cms annual report reflects increases on the total amount spent on healthcare in the private sector by schemes schemes paid r202 bil lion 360 as of total spent to hospitals this translates to 125 unadjusted increase or 53 real increase in expenditure on private hospitals when adjusted for inflation 32 the cms annual report also indicates that specialists are the key drivers of increased hospital utilization and costs as they are the professi onals who predominantly admit patients in private hospitals specialists genera around 70 to 80 of hospital costs incurred aside from their own professional fees and costs private hospital cost increases could also be result of the exce ssive issuing of licensing for acute beds and expensive technology by provincial health administrations challenges in publicprivate health sector mix 33 another significant challenge facing the south african health system is the need to address the inefficient and inequitable distribution of resources between t he public and private health care sectors relative to the population served by ach table 1 summarises the disparities that exist between these two sectors in relation to hospital beds and human resources as mentioned earlier there is more t han twice as many hospital beds per beneficiary of private sector hospital servic as there are for those dependent on the public sector the disparities are even greater in relat ion to health professionals each pharmacist in the public sector serves 12 to 30 times and each generalist doctor in the public sector serves 7 to 17 tim more people than those in the private sector there is sixfold difference in the number of people served per nurse and 23 times difference in the number of people served per specialist doctor working in the public and private sectors in south africa table 1 distribution of health care resources between public and private sectors 2005 item private sector public

numbers from health systems trusts south african health review 200506 34 what is of concern is that publicprivate mix disparities have deteri orated remarkably over the past decade see figure 1 below while real expenditure per medical scheme member health care benefits and administration and other management costs were about three times greater than government healt h care expenditure per person who is not medical scheme beneficiary in 1996 the difference in expenditure was about six times greater on medical schem beneficiaries by 2006 this is due to the fact that real per capita expenditure in the public sector was relatively stagnant over this period while medical scheme contributions and expenditure have been growing at rates far exceeding overall inflation throughout the period this pattern of diverging public and private sect or expenditure patterns was seen throughout the 1990s as wellfigure 1 trends in real per capita health care expendi ture in public sector and medical

financing and service benefits in south africa 35 the disparities in health care financing and service benefits allude d to above can best be illustrated through comprehensive financing incidence and benefit incide nce analyses financing incidence analysis determines which socioeconom ic groups bear what burden of funding health services benefit incidence analysis determines what benefit expressed in monetary terms different socioec onomic groups derive from utilising health services these analyses enable one t assess how equitable health system is financing is regarded as equitable if contributions to funding health care are according to ability to pay and health s ervice use is regarded as equitable if benefits are distributed according to need for health care 36 figure 2 shows the distribution of the burden of health care financing acros s socio economic groups it shows that the poorest 20 of the population quintile 1 contribute almost 6 of their household income towards funding health care this is mainly through making outofpocket payments eg fees at public hospitals or payments to private gp or pharmacy and through tax contributions in the l owest income households this mainly takes the form of indirect taxes such as vat excise duties fuel levies etc this is similar for the next t wo quintiles the richest 20 of the population contribute about 18 of their household income towards health care with most of this in the form of contributions to medical schemes their contributions to health care funding in the form of outofpocket payments and general tax payments is less than 8 of their income the second richest 20 of the population contributes just over 10 of their average househol d income to health care payments with nearly 6 being in the form of outofpocket payments and general tax paymentsfigure 2 incidence of health care financing in south africa 2006 02468101214161820 quintile 1 quintile 2 quintile 3 quintile 4 quintile 5health payment as of consumption expenditure outofpocket payment tax health medical insurance source ataguba mcintyre 2009 37 the information depicted in figure 2 clearly indicates that payments towards the cost of health care are progressive in south africa ie payments to he alth care as percentage of household income increases as the level of income increase s however it should be noted that almost all of the progressivity of heal th care funding is attributable to medical scheme contributions as it is only t he richest groups which contribute to medical schemes however it is also only those who contribute to medical scheme who benefit from funds in medical schemes the distribution of health care funding in the form of outofpocket payments and general tax payments is relatively evenly distributed across socioec onomic groups although general tax payments are progressive they are only slightly so with the poorest 80 of the population quintiles 1 to 4 bearing very similar burden of funding these payments 38 the fact that large share of health care funding is attributable to medical schemes contributions and that only small share 14 of the south african population benefit from the services funded by these schemes heavily influences the distribution of benefits from health care utilisation across socioeconomi c groups figure 3 shows that benefits are heavily concentrated on the richest 40 of the population who receive about 60 of the health care benefits this is pa rticularly due to the use of private providers by this group but also due to this group derivi ng the greatest share of benefits from the most highly specialized public hospitals figure 3 comparing total benefit incidence with levels f health care need 0102030405060708090100 need total benefits share of needbenefits q1 poorest q2 q3 q4 q5 richest source ataguba mcintyre 2009 39 what is even more striking is that health care benefits are not dis tributed in line with need for health care services the benefit incidence of healt h care in south africa is very prorich with the richest 20 of the population receiving 36 of total benefits despite having health need share of less than 10 while the poorest 20 receive only 125 of the benefits despite having health need share of more than 25 40 in summary there is lack of crosssubsidies in the overall healt h system in south africa although health care financing is progressive this is largely due to the richest groups bearing the burden of medical scheme funding however the richest groups are the exclusive beneficiaries of these funds it is indisputable that benefit incidence in south africa is inequitable benefits from health care are not distributed according to the need for health care ataguba mcintyre 2009ii towards new financing strategy and accelerated health system reform 41 to address these imbalances in access and utilisation of hea lth services as well as health outcomes the health care system requires fundamental transforma tion through the introduction of the national health insurance system nhi that enables an integrated prepaymentbased mechanism and ensures the realisation of the right to health care for all 42 the introduction of national health insurance system has been on the agenda of government since 1994 the key objective of such system is to address the problems of the dual health system by promoting social solidarity in order to achieve universal coverage despite considerable debate over the past tw or more decades progress has been made in transforming the health system ong these lines 43the case for change in health care financing in south africa t hrough the introduction of mandatory nhi health is both strong and urgent the c ase for change should also be considered in the light of the lack of achievement of the millennium development goals mdgs for health and the stagnati on and even deterioration in mortality rates and life expectancy 44 this policy outlines the essential elements required for comprehensi ve transformation of the health system through the introduction of national h ealth insurance nhi support for the implementation of nhi will also require llel efforts to improve the public health services system with the major focus on improved infrastructure human resources for health and management the nhi is therefore being developed within the context of intensified health system reformrationale for the establishment of national health insurance in s outh africa 45 the status quo in the south african health system as described bove cannot continue the rationale for introducing national health insurance is that it would provide mechanism for improving crosssubsidization in the overall health system whereby funding contributions would be linked to an individuals abilit topay and benefits from health services would be in line with an i ndividuals need for care this would be achieved through having single funding pool public and political support for the national health insuran ce 46 there is public and political support for the establishment of the nationa l health insurance as means to increase access to good quality health c are for all and to promote social solidarity 47 recent national household survey conducted in 2008 shows that there is good support for nhi amongst the general public there is good understanding of the need for prepayment to ensure financial protection from the costs of health care with 76 of all respondents agreeing with the statement i would gree to pay small amount each month so that if i get sick health care wi ll be free even if i am not sick now more than twothirds of respondents 67 agreed with the statement i would join publicly supported health insurance schem if my monthly contribution was less than for current medical schemes importa ntly an even greater number of medical scheme members 71 agreed with this s tatement strongly suggesting that there is widespread dissatisfaction with the high costs of medical scheme membership another important finding of this survey is t hat despite reported widespread concern about the quality of care in public ctor facilities 73 of south africans agreed with the statement i would join publicly supported health insurance scheme if i could use public health services for free mcintyre et 2008economic rationale for introducing the national health insuran ce 48 not only will public spending on the health sector contribute to economi c growth through improving the health status and hence productivity of the population but also through employment creation for healthcare professionals the health sector is very human resource intensive and it is well documented that the south african health system particularly the public sector is significantly unders taffed relative to what is required to address the health care needs of the population the nhi through its integrated funding pool and costcontainment benefits see later will provide the financial resources to fill currently vacant posts within the publ ic health sector and open new posts in addition additional employment opportunities will be created for trainers of health professionals in tertiary education i nstitutions including nursing colleges given the urgent need to increase health profes sional training outputs 49 an economic benefit of the nhi will be costcontainment within the health sector as indicated in figure 1 the medical schemes sector is experienc ing expenditure increases that far exceed inflation despite serving small share of the population that is not increasing this is largely because of increases in fe levels charged by health care providers that are not matched by health service outputs and outcomes furthermore the mismatch in the balance of power between large num ber of fragmented purchasers medical schemes and concentration among health c are providers especially in the forprofit private hospital market exacerbates t he situation the system of single nhi purchaser has been shown int ernationally to contribute greatly to cost containment in the health sector 50 there are two major benefits from such costcontainment firstly the health sector will be more efficient contributor to the south african economy by ensuri ng healthier and productive individuals secondly there are concerns about the potential of nhi increasing the cost of labour but this supposes productivi ty increases the nhi contribution will not impose greater burden on em ployers than the current medical scheme contributions more importantly the inherent cost containment mechanisms within the single funder nhi model that is propos ed here will ensure that employers are not faced with annual contribution increase s that are far above the inflation rate as currently occurs with medical scheme contributions 51 while there are other economic benefits of the proposed nhi the abovementi oned examples illustrate the positive economic gains that are likely to be yielded when the nhi is fully implemented 52 at present funding for health services in south africa is fragmented on number of different legislative and policy planes which leads to inefficient ut ilisation of resources wasteful duplication of health cover and unnecessary overlapping of functions between various agencies people continue to fall between the cracks in the current health system with the result that their constitutional rights to human dignity and access to health services are being adversely compromised therefore it is necessary to create single focus for the funding of health care s ervices that respects the rights of the wealthy the poverty stricken and all those in between alike 53 the constitutional mandate of government to ensure the progressive realizat ion of the right of access to health services requires the most efficient nd effective utilization of resources in order to ensure such access for south afric ans and permanent residents there are urgent health care needs for example those of the elderly the indigent and very young that are not being adequately met due in part to the continued fragmentation of the current health system combined with hi storical inequities within this system 54 the rationale for introducing nhi system is that it would provide m echanism for improving crosssubsidisation in the overall health system whereby fundi ng contributions would be linked to an individuals ability to pay while bene fits would be in line with an individuals need for care health services would be acce ssible to all on an equitable basis on the principle of nondiscrimination it shoul d be noted that increases in contribution rates in national health insurance s ystem are subject to changes in the implementing regulations of the core legislation 55 the introduction of national health insurance system is aimed t strengthening the underfunded and overworked public sector and pooling resources in both sectors in order to progressively realise the right of all to access quality health care services the introduction of national health insurance system will go long way towards establishing health care system in compliance with our constitutional rights the right to health as human right 56 the south african constitution is transformative and progressive one in that it seeks to transform the inequitable economic and social conditions inherited from the apartheid era to more equitable one where human dignity equality and advancement of human rights and freedoms nonracialism and nonsexism form the founding values of the constitution it is also one of the few constitutions in the world that includes socioeconomic rights in the bill of rights these inc lude the right to access health care services as well as the underlying det erminants of health such as the right to clean drinking water the right to adequate housing the right to clean and safe environment the right to sufficient food nutrition and social security for person to enjoy good health it is therefore essential that the underlying social determinants of health are also enjoyed in other words these rights are indivisible and interdependent and that the government is obliged to take steps to ensure that everyone has access to quality health careiii principles and goals of nhi the core principles on which the proposed nhi will be established include 57the right to health the state must take reasonable legislative and other measures within its resources to achieve the progressive realisation of the ri ght to access health care services key aspect of ensuring access to healt h care is that services must be free of any charges at the point of use 58social solidarity and universal coverage there is commitment to social solidarity in the south african health system which means that mandatory contribution by south africans to funding health care according to their ability to pay given the massive income inequalities progre ssive funding mechanisms will be used there should be universal access to health services that meet est ablished quality standards so that everyone is able to use health services ac cording to their need for health care and not on the basis of their ability to pay 59public administration mandatory national health insurance system that is structured as single funder public entity supports the strategies to ac hieve economies of scale promote redistribution of health resources and cost containment 60 the goals of the national health insurance include providing universal coverage for all south africans irrespective of whether they are employed or notequity and solidarity among the population through the pooling of risks and funds accelerated national health system reform especially in the publi c health sector increased strength of the health purchaser in negotiations with providers for both supply of services rational provider payment levels with quality assurance creation of one public fund with adequate reserves and funds for high cost care health promotion and prevention and appropriate research and documentation on the development on national health insurance promoting efficient and effective service delivery in both public and privat sectors and assurance of continuity and portability of national health insurance wit hin the countryiv key proposals for national health insurance the key proposals for national health insurance policy are as follows creation of national health insurance fund 61 at the core of the proposed health sector reforms is the reconfiguration of the institutions and organisations involved in the funding pooling purchasing and provision of health care services in the south african health system an nhi fund will be established within the provisions of the appropriate laws and re gulations including regulations and guidelines on the shortterm investment of reserves the main responsibility of the nhi fund will be to receive funds pool t hese resources and purchase services on behalf of the entire population the fund will be publicly administered as single purchaser with subnational offices at the provincial levels to negotiate and contract with the health care providers 62 single payer system is effective in collecting revenue distributi ng risks through one large risk pool and offers government high degree of control over total expenditure on health evidence from other countries has shown that single payer is administratively more efficient with costs around 3 percent than multipayer system single payer system is better able to negotiate prices purchase commodities in bulk and more importantly control utilization using various methods 63 at national level the nhi fund will be managed by chief execut ive officer ceo who will directly report to the minister of health the ceo will be supported by an executive management team and specific technical comm ittees including the technical advisory committee audit committee pricing committee remuneration committee benefits advisory committee bac and others 64 the nhi fund will be advised by committee made up of representa tives of the relevant government authorities the health care providers and representatives of civil society 65 the minister of health will remain responsible for oversight of nhi fund the development of national health insurance policy and any amendments that impact on the nhi fund to meet changes in the countrys health care needs as determined through changes in population demography epidemiological profile and health technology development 66 of necessity and supported by international practice and experience t he fund must be an independent body for it to effectively perform its core functions revenue collection and pooling and most importantly purchasing of services the n ational department of health will continue to play its overall stewardship role of the health care system and also remain major provider of services through its national provincial and district level structures and facilities in addition t he ndoh will continue to provide nonpersonal services including overall responsibility for infrastructure development for which it receives budget it remains critical that the responsibility of coordinating the development of overall health plans including personal services reside with the ndoh the only function that the ndoh will capitulate is the purchasing function for personal services since the nhi fund will contract and directly reimburse both public and private providers however the fund will only purchase personal services in accordance with approved plans by the ndoh coverage 67 the nhi fund will cover all south african citizens and legal re sidents the cover will entitle individuals and households to defined comprehensive package of healthcare services provided through appropriately accredited and contracted public and private health services providers nhi healthcare benefits 68 the nhi fund will provide comprehensive package of health services whi ch includes all levels of care namely primary secondary and tertiary qua ternary health care services will remain the responsibility of the ndoh 69 the comprehensive package of services covered by the nhi fund will be ba sed on the national department of healths comprehensive package of services tha t includes the following components primary care and preventive services inpatient care outpatient care emergency care prescription drugs appropriate technologies for diagnosis and treatment rehabilitation mental health services the full scope of dental services other than cosmetic dentistry substance abuse treatment services chiropractic services basic vision care and vision correction other than laser vision correc tion for cosmetic purposes hearing services including the provision of hearing aids 70 list of pharmaceutical medical supplies and devices will be linked to the essential drug list edl and updated on regular basis by the ba c emphasis will be placed on primary health care with referral to specialists and inpat ient care through defined allocation of the nhi fund revenues the national health insurance benefits will include personal preventive services in accordance with developments in the disease burden in the covered population 71 though the nhi benefits will be comprehensive because it will cut ac ross all levels of the health system it will exclude medically unnecessary services the exclusion list will be regularly reviewed at agreed intervals by the bac taki ng into account number of factors including the populations epidemiological and demographic profiles and the emerging evidence of health technology development locally and internationally provision of health care benefits 72 public and private health care providers will be accredited according t criteria to be developed as described below the criteria will specify the mini mum range of services provided by primary second tertiary and quaternary health care fac ilities providers will then be classified according to these levels as indicated earlier the nhi fund will contract accredited providers both public and private to provi defined comprehensive package of services at each appropriate level of the referral hierarchy namely primary secondary tertiary and quaternary health services in addition referral process will be defined for services within and outsi the district and province to assure continuity of care and effective cost containment 73 at the primary care level existing private general practitioners gp s can be accredited if they work in multidisciplinary practices which inc lude primary health care nurses and range of allied health professionals however in are as where there are human resource constraints gps will be allowed to provide nhi services and will be encouraged to develop multidisciplinary practices all south africans can then choose which primary health care provider which would generally include number of different public sector clinicscommunity health centres and accredited multidisciplinary practices in the district they would like to register with and utilise health services 74 the successful implementation of the nhi system will rest on the accelerated visible and sustained improvements in the provision of quality services to all both public and private facilities will be accredited by an independent na tional office of standards compliance using agreed national norms and standards the independent status of the national office of standards compliance will be establi shed through the appropriate amendment of the national health act of 2004 and will play the role of ensuring that all health care facilities are appropriately li censed and accredited the osc office just like sars which reports to the nister of finance will report directly to the minister of health based on clearly defined terms of reference it needs to operate with flexibility in order to rapidly help in identifying areas where facilities do not meet the standards that are to be addressed by the department of health and speed up the accreditation the ai m is to accredit at least 25 of all facilities annually until all facilities are fully accredited during five year phased period 75 the accreditation process will be supported by quality improvement and qua lity assurance programmes to make sure that all facilities reach accredi tation status see section on quality improvement below in addition providers will be reimburse d on the basis of their willingness to accept negotiated payment leve ls as agreed to with the nhi and the need for such providers within particular areasources of revenue and pooling functions 76 the main sources of revenue for the nhi fund will be general taxation and mandatory contribution see figure below additional funding from other sources such as road accident fund raf compensation for occupational injuries and diseases act coida and others will considered at later sta ge all of these funds will be combined in the nhi fund from which all services covered by the nhi system will be purchased 77 funding of the health sector from general tax revenue should be significantl increased at present the total government budget devoted to the health s ector is insufficient to adequately meet the health needs of the country since all citizens will be entitled to benefit from nhi services coverage is not dependent on employment status or whether or not one contributes via the mandatory contribution conceptually universal coverage is achieved because government makes contributions via the allocations from general tax revenue to the nhi on flow of funds under nhi the insured nhifmandatory contribution gen tax revenueidnhi cards copaymentsno copayments health services payments medical claims accredited providersbehalf of those who are unemployed poor and earning below the taxable income threshold 78 allocations from general tax revenue will be supplemented by mandatory payrollrelated contribution this mandatory contribution will be progressively structured and it will be collected by the south african revenue servi ces sars everyone earning above the income tax threshold adjusted annually would be required to make this contribution ie one may optout of the nhi whic h will be shared between employers and employees 79 this mandatory contribution will not cover the full costs of the nhi but it is to supplement allocations from general tax revenue the main rationale for introducing such mandatory contribution is to establish link betwee n contributions that individuals make to public funds and the health service be nefits to which they will be entitled under the nhi importantly it provides mechanism for cementing social solidarity in the health system through incomere lated contributions to single pool of funds that will benefit all 80 additional funding for the nhi system will include the elimination of the current taxdeductions for medical scheme contributions and channelling these funds to the nhi fund to provide additional funds into the nhi system 81 as there will be charges at the point of service use for the insured under the nhi for the defined benefits to be covered by nhi outofpocket payments are not see n as source of funding health care for services covered by nhi 82the exact level of mandatory contribution to be introduced and the magnitude of general tax funding required for the proposed nhi are still being refined and discussed however at this stage it is n ecessary to indicate that policy commitment to considerable increase in public fu nding of health services through an appropriate mix of general tax allocations and progressive mandatory contributions is required to reach fund ing level consistent with the needs of publicly funded health system provider payment mechanisms 83 changing provider payment mechanisms is critical to ensuring effective c ost containment and the future sustainability of the nhi the provider payment arrangements that the nhi fund will use to reimburse all accredited providers will be riskadjusted per capita payments ie capitation and global budgeting the annual capitation amount will be linked to target utilization and c ost levels facilities that do not meet the requisite standards will continue t get the global budgets until such time they meet requisite standards through support for give n period 84 this applies to public and private providers in each category of service provision the provider payment mechanisms must assure incentives for the health worke rs in the public sector through supplements for specific tasks or sessional paym ent it is also important to consider the implementation of performancebased paym ent mechanisms 85 at district level the capitation payment could be shared between health centres and district hospital with defined allocation for referrals to tertia ry care providers this would be determined by the supply and level of providers in each dis trict and province 86 while capitation should be maintained as one of the basic forms of provi der payment adjustment should be made in its application with the follow ing recommendations the capitation amount should be uniform amount for the defined levels of providers regardless of public or private ownership the capitation amount should be linked to an appropriate index such as cpi the public and private health providers contracted by the nhi fund will be assisted in controlling the expenditure through recommended formula and corresponding to protocols for the treatment of common diseases this wil l be necessary to assure the appropriate level of service provision and avoid unde r servicing in capitation payment system high costs care for services excluded from the list of benefits under ca pitation will be reimbursed from separate allocation of the nhi 87 there will be copayments or outofpocket payments to accredited providers t the point of health service use outofpocket payments and other direct feefor service charges to providers will apply only to the noninsured such as touri sts or for health services excluded from the list of nhi benefits 88 during the transitional phase budget allocations to the health care provi ders through the provincial allocations will continue to be used for both primary care and hospital level providers in the public sector until such time that the minimum range of facilities primary and secondary health services in the speci fic district have been accredited and contracted with the nhi fund in the transition phase the budgets will nonetheless be calculated on the basis of riskadjusted capitation formula taking into account key factors such as population age and gender distributions allocation of nhi fund revenues 89 the allocation of health insurance revenues should facilitate the provis ion of the covered health care benefits with improved quality recognized incentives to recruit and retain qualified health workers attention to special health and health system issues and reasonable level of reserves 90 it is important that administrative costs are kept to minimum s existing registration and existing contribution collection mechanisms will be used for significant proportion of the population covered in the initial years and until analysis of the actual utilisation and cost information it is proposed that needs based formula for the allocation of resources be developed implemented nd regularly monitored and evaluated the information systems training acti vities and nhi fund promotion will need to be adequately budgeted for in the initi stage to help ensure effective implementationregistration of the population 91 the registration of the national population will be based on health facility approach using the green barcoded identity document or equivalent legal document people will be registered for the nhi system and eventually be issued with an nhi card that will be used to keep their health i nformation history which allows for ease of access to patient information and for the portabili ty of health services 92 nhi cards for all population sectors regardless of their contributory sta will be the same to avoid the stigma of subsidised households information systems and quality assurance 93 the nhi fund will contribute to an integrated and enhanced national health information system nhis that is based on an electronic patient re cord platform this will enable any person who visits health facility in any province or health district to be allocated unique identifier and have their medical history recorded and stored electronically on an electronic health record that is l inked to the nhi to ensure that all eligible citizens and permanent residents have access to the defined comprehensive package of health care services people wi ll be registered with the nhi fund the nhi card will include h ealth information history which allows for ease of access to patient information and for th portability of health services if more than one accredited provide r is available close to the area of residence of the members they wil l be enabled to select the provider of choice members will be entitled to request changes in their provider selections only once yearcard this system will be crucial for the implementation of the n hi system and the portability of services for the population 94 the information systems of the nhi fund will be developed to support monitoring of the extension of coverage in all population sectors all the financial and management functions utilization of health care benefits by the nhi members quality assurance programmes for the health care providers production of reports for health facilities and health system management and research and documentation to support changes as the health care needs of the population change 95 to the extent possible the nhi funds information system will be com puterized with linkage between the nhi fund membership data base with update d contribution status and the accredited health care providers promotion of the nhi system 96 through transparent communications programme proactive social marketing approach will be taken to increase knowledge and understanding of the nhi funds functions and activities including the health benefits that members of the national population are entitled to the sensitisation and promotion activitie s at national provincial and district must include awareness raising among politicians and community leaders at all l evels to enlist their active support for the nhi development and updating of brochures and posters detailing the contributions benefits enrolment procedures and entitlement to benefits development of audiovisual material for regular display at relevant sites development of materials on rational health seeking behaviourprominent placing of the nhi fund logo in contracted health centres nd hospitals indicating accreditation and affiliation tv broadcasts by senior level politicians and officials regular radio and tv spots and newspaper articles on progress with respe ct to nhi implementation and proposed changes the future role existing medical schemes 97 while the nhi calls for mandatory membership for all south africans through mandatory contributions and social solidarity it is up to the general publi c to continue with voluntary medical schemes cover after they have contributed to the nhi fund v concurrent health system strengthening plan 98 the improvement expansion and revitalisation of public healthcare infrast ructure is critical to realising the principle of universal coverage and reducing ine qualities of access therefore parallel health systems strengthening plan has been developed to assure infrastructure maintenance improvement and expansion capital c osts and service provision recurrent costs 99 the health system strengthening plan has several key components as outl ined below general infrastructure inventory and development 100the plan proposes that detailed inventory of both public and private facil ities including infrastructure human resources and technology in all parts of the country must be done in order to establish the stock and distribution of these facilities the inventory will serve dual purpose firstly as an assessment of the current capaci ty of the national health system to provide services at different levels nd where this capacity is located and secondly to identify gaps for expansion and fa cilities that require refurbishment subsequent facilities refurbishment and expansion plan will be developed in line with the existing health care facilit ies revitalisation programme strengthening of district health councils 101capacity to deliver quality primary health services under nhi sys tem is premised on revitalised and adequately financed district health system t meet the needs of the catchment population district health councils dhcs throughout the count ry will be strengthened by improving political governance managerial oversight and accountability structures the focus on strengthening the dhcs will primarily be on improving service integration the quality of services offered within facil ities and outreach programmes efficiency and effectiveness as well as communi ty participation developmental and multisectoral approaches significant nd sustained improvements in managerial capacity will be fundamental to achi eving all this 102the district level offices will assist to manage the flow of funds from the nhi fund to providers based on agreed plans and using combination of agreed payme nt mechanisms increased autonomy of public health care providers 103as part of the concurrent health systems strengthening plan actions wil l be taken to create concrete mechanisms for increasing the efficiency of public health facilities particularly of hospitals by increasing managerial autonomy in public health care facilities in order to improve decision making and acc ountability at the same time the current efficiency in the use of provincial allocat ions will be reviewed to assure reduction in duplication and optimal use of the locations procurement and supply functions will also be revised where necessary and improved development of human resources plan for health 104changing the financial arrangements of the health sector without dealing w ith the human resources for health hrh challenges will not yield the desire d results it is for this specific reason that the nhi plan proposes set of compre hensive strategies for increasing the supply quality distribution and retention of various categories of health workers in the country 105data on the employment of health professionals indicates that there has been growth in professional registrations across most health professions see tabl 2 below and fairly substantial increases in public sector

disillusionment with the public sector see breier et in press and also that many health workers are themselves infected with hiv therefore the planning for human resources for health outputs will have to account for the i mpact of the hivaids and tb epidemics in terms of training numbers to fi ll the existing vacancies and to meet the needs of the future generation with regards t healthcare services human resources for health norms and standards 107human resources are critical to the accelerated and effective ivery of quality services for all as part of strengthening the district health

the face of an hiv and aids epidemic rampant tuberculosis malaria childhood diarrhoea and malnutrition varies from excellent to extremely poor similarly the capacity to et community needs varies from institution to institution and by district and province poverty substance abuse violence and related trauma also seriously impacts on the capacity of the public health services 110although poor infrastructure and lack of resources is often blamed for the provision of poor healthcare the attitude of staff towards their work and to their patients associated with poor skills and corruption is equally if not more important 111in general the capacity of south african healthcare services to et the needs of the citizens is impaired by lack of management skills lack of induction and inservice training failure to act on identified deficiencies delayed response to quality improvement requirements unsatisfactory maintenance and repair services poor technology management ineffective supply chain management systems inability of individuals to take responsibility for their actions poor disciplinary procedures and corruption and the significant problems in clinical areas related to traini ng and the poor attitudes of some of the staff112to address the significant patientcare problems within the south africa n public health system carefully planned organised articulated and documente d quality improvement and quality assurance plan is required it should be systema tic and incorporate the setting of priorities for improvement through performance assessment process that uses reliable methodology 113this should be followed by the implementation of quality improvement ctivities that are based on regular assessments key activity in sust ained improvement of the health services is formal structured process to maintain im provements that have been achieved and to improve upon them over time 114it is essential that the quality improvement approach be organisationwi involving both clinical and nonclinical managers and their functions the improvement processes should be collaborative using an interdisciplinary cross functional approach organised around the flow of patient care and involving all departmentsservices settings and disciplines 115this multidisciplinary approach should be guided by multidisciplinary sta ndards that provide blueprint for quality service provision the management and staff should be actively involved with the multidisciplinary team of mount importance is capacity building and skills transfer at all levels of the organisation to entrench both quality improvement and quality assurance in the national health system and to ensure their sustainability the quality improvement plan for south african public healthcare facilities 116the types of facilities included in this quality improvement plan re hospitals clinics ambulance services and art sites in both the public and private sectors117the proposed quality improvement approach utilises continuous collaborative participatory systems approach integrating quality improvement into routine management functions this approach regards quality improvement as progressive and gradual process that relies on the guiding principles of teamwork syste ms and processes patientcenteredness and measurement 118the plan outlines how quality improvement support and development may be carried out most effectively in south african public healthcare facilities nd focuses on developing local capacity within the national departme nt of health to support and monitor the quality improvement work in the provi nces developing capacity within provinces and health institutio ns to develop and maintain continuous quality improvement programmes providing training to healthcare facilities in quality im provement methodology and monitoring and evaluation using an ap propriate information system the importance of peer review and benchmarking as the mecha nisms to share best practice which is essential if variations across f acilities district provinces and the country are to be reduced the systems required to provide coordinated hospital care th include managerial clinical clinical support and hotel systems sim ilar systems modified as necessary are set for primary healthcare and ambul ance services standards are set for the component departments and rvices within each system institutions are required to develop human resources performan ce improvement plans that focus on workplace skills which ind icate priorities for training plans will be collated into district and provincial plans to contribute to sector skills plans developed by the health and welfare sector training authority hwseta development plans will be based on identified competency gaps of individuals the national office of standards compliance and the standa rds and norms development process 119the national office of standards compliance will meet internationally accredited standards set for accreditatio n agencies by an approved evaluative agency facilitate the development of multidisciplinary organisat ional standards for healthcare facilities using principles set by the interna tional society for quality in healthcare isqua for standard development evaluate the compliance of standards in health care facilitie s use customised computerised information system to collate and integrate data calculate performance indicators and genera deficiency reports that can form the basis of quality improvement programme s have the ability to report on the progress of quality improvement programmes aimed at achieving standard compliance accredits facilities that meet agreed quality standards provide certification to participating facilities that have n ot met accreditation requirements to recognise degrees of progress made since entering the accreditation programme 120the national office of standards compliance will have to employ sufficie nt and appropriately qualified staff in the following categories doctors with experience in community medicine and other disciplin professional nurses with experience in both primary and secondary care paramedical staff with experience in range of healthca re sectors and disciplinesproject managers administrative support staff and training staff with experience in information systems 121efforts will be made to identify existing accreditation and quality improvement organisations with proven track records that meet the above requirements these organisations will be evaluated to determine whether they have the com petence and capacity to assist the national office of standards compliance wit h the implementation of the accreditation process in south africa and where necessary will be contracted to augment its activities and functions standard development 122the development of standards requires formal approach and consists of normative phase where experts give input as to what should ideally be in place this is followed by an empirical phase when normative standards are tested in practice and thereafter there is consensus phase in which standards that are reliable understandable believable measurable and achievable are developed 123during this process the principles developed by the international society for quality in health care isqua in collaboration with over 40 countrie s will be used to guide the content and structure of the standards 124the underlying philosophy of the standards is based on the principles of quality management and continuous quality improvement and aims to accommodate legal and ethical aspects 125standards are grouped to provide specific indicators of performance which can be used as points of reference in evaluating actual performance compared to targeted objectives126in order to expedite the implementation of the quality improvement and accreditation programmes required to improve the performance of healthcare organisations standards currently in use or in development that meet t he above principles and requirements will be identified and utilised with modi fications if necessary assessing standards compliance and introducing quality improvement interventions 127at the facility level healthcare organisations hospitals primary he alth clinics and ambulance services will be surveyed against the appropriate standards to obtain baseline assessment of the facility 128deviations from the standards will be prioritised according to the impact they have on quality and patient and staff safety based on the detailed ana lysis of prioritised deficiencies an integrated quality improvement programme for the facili ty will be developed with inputs from the multidisciplinary team 129all quality improvement interventions will be formally monitored timefram and responsible people will be clearly identified for ease of monitoring and evaluation database will be established and will be regularly referred to for the identification of when timeframes are met and not met when not met remedial actions will be speedily taken to reestablish the quality improvem ent programmes objective of achieving facilitywide standard compliance trainers of the quality improvement plan 130all training will be provided using trainthetrainer methodology to nhance rapid skills and knowledge transfer at provincial level quality assura nce units will be trained by quality experts to understand multidisciplinary qual ity standards quality data collection and analytical systems131at facility level cascading trainthetrainer approach will be used whereby dedicated trainers will be identified to receive training and they in turn will train staff members in basic quality improvement techniques these trained staff will be empowered to pass on their acquired skills as part of the induction proc ess when new colleagues enter services in the facility 132four expert centres will be identified in each province to be centres of learning for the province these will incorporate hospital and three primary care facilities 133the expert centres will be the focal point for training to address identifi ed skills deficiencies such as management and leadership quality improvement t echniques evaluation and monitoring skills as well as additional skillsbased training for supply chain hotel technology and maintenance staff this approach can be used for hospital services primary health care services and ambulance service quality assurance monitoring system 134a secure webbased information system that provides access via the int ernet to current standard compliance scores and other related information is an i mportant monitoring component of the plan 135the monitoring of ongoing quality improvement initiatives in facility partments and services will enable management to make informed decisions and pri oritise their interventions 136to facilitate this process staff will be trained to evaluate their facility against the set standards input their standard compliance data into the information system extract the resulting information from the database via the web and then use it to manage their facilities better 137monitoring of the standard compliance scores of facilities can be carri ed out on individual or grouped facilities using this process national and regional staff will be in position to use the information to monitor the performance of ny facility that falls under their jurisdiction and to encourage staff to improve the ir clinical performance on continual basis 138determining the outcomes of the quality improvement process 139at the end of the standard implementation phase facilitywide surveys are carried out against the standards facilities are awarded certificates according to the vel of standard compliance achieved facilities that achieve substantial compliance with the standards are awarded an accreditation certificate 140facilities that do not achieve accreditation will be encouraged to continue their efforts towards achieving overall standard compliance through graded certification programme based on the recognition of improvements achieved 141an example of the system to be used is shown in figure 2figure 4 the quality assurance monitoring system quality information system that provides continuous access to current standard compliance data allows facilities to input their own data and monitor their own performance supports ongoing quality improvement programmes enables management at all levels to make informed decisions assists facilities to reach and maintain accreditatio n standards is tool for the ongoing monitoring of performance indicators adverse events monitoring 142patient safety in the hospital environment has become global and regiona l issue of immense importance in both first and third world contexts about 50 of healthcare errors are considered preventable with an estimated avera ge of 10 of all inpatient visits resulting in some form of unintended harm the overa ll costs of adverse events can be considerable as well as causing avoidable human suffering the financial and opportunity costs to health services are estimated at between 5 and 10 of health expenditure 143in may 2002 the world health assembly passed resolution wha5518 whic h urged countries to pay the greatest possible attention to patient safety 144a number of provinces in south africa have introduced pilot adverse event monitoring and management programmes over the past three to four years one of the most far reaching of these is the research project set up to i nvestigate the feasibility of establishing an adverse event management system in the free state the project is beginning to produce useful results that may lead the wa to developing national reporting and learning programme patient safety is challenged by the complexity of care processes and culture of denial and blame this has resulted in inconsistent reporting and learning that has prevente d the collection and dissemination of information in any meaningful way the free state has introduced just culture approach that has shown to significantly improve the level of incident reporting goals of the national quality improvement plan objective 1 quality improvement within facilities 145to provide the technical expertise to enable the national department of health and provincial health services to bring
