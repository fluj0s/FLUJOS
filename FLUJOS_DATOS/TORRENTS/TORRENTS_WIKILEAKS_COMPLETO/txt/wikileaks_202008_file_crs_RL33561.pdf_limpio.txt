not meet nsg guidelines on the first the president cited the constitutions commitment to the presidency of the authority to conduct the nations foreign ffairs on the second the president raised the

us exports to the nuclear suppliers group however us officials including secretary of state rice have formally told congress multiple times that the united states government would abide by nsg guidelines the presidents signing statement also noted that the executive branch would construe provisions of the act that mandate regu late or prohibit submission of information to the congress an intern ational organization or the public such as sections 104 109 261 271 272 273 274 and 275 in manner consistent with the presidents constitutional authority to prot ect and control information that could impair foreign relations national security the deliberative processes of the executive or the performance of the executives constitutional duties this could suggest that the executive
