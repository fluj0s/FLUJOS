109th congress summary on july 13 2005 department of homela nd security dhs secretary michael chertoff released an assessment of depar tmental functions known as the second stage review or 2sr the recommended change s planned for imple mentation on october 1 2005 include one to dismantle the emer gency preparedness and response epr directorate of dhs also referred to as the federal emergency management agency fema fema would remain within dhs but become smaller entity reporting directly to the secretary and would be responsible for cons equence management the secretarys recommendation is consistent with mission shifts and gaps evident since the establishment of dhs and epr in 2003 certain functions and tasks of epr are longer administered in the directorate some authorities originally transferred into epr have few resources in short epr has administered portfolio of authorities more limited than authorized by congress by congressional direction and tradition femas mission comprises four broad areas preparedness response recovery and hazard mitigation secretary chertoff identifies response and recovery as the core operations of fema that will be retained in the agency preparedness f unctions would be transferred to new directorate information is availa ble concerning plans for the disposition of hazard mitigation activities congress might elect to evaluate the administrations 2sr proposal by reviewing whether authorities set out in the homeland security act for epr title v of pl 107296 should remain the focus of one dhs entity or be integrated into other dhs units as proposed by the secret ary congress might also broaden the debate by considering the sc ope and reach of federal aut horities that are missions for entities other than dhs options that might be considered in clude strengthening eprfema endorsing the secretarys proposal or reassessing th range of homeland security missions and emergency authorities in departments or agencies other than dhs congress would have to amend the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107 296 if all aspects of the secretarys recommendation were to be implemented several bills pending before congress might serve as legislative vehi cles hr 1817 which would authorize appropriations and establish new preparedness authorities might be considered appropriate legislation for such changes hr 3477 would direct

new legislation in the wake of the tragic events at the end of august 2005 that occurred after hurricane ka trina for example s 1615 the text of which is not currently available would establish fema

securityan undersecretary for protection and preparedness5 if implemented the secretarys recommendations will lead to significant changes in dhs operations and lines of authority under the secretarys propos the emergency prepar edness and response epr directorate of dhs would be dismantled with preparedne ss functions moved to new preparedness directorate the federal emergency management agency fema currently part of and synonymous with epr would become separate dhs entity that would report directly to the secretary fe ma would retain respons ibility for consequence management after catastrophes occur in testimony before house co mmittee the secretary presented the rationale for r ealigning femas functions as follows what the restructuring proposes to do is to take out of fema couple of elements that were really not related to its core mission that were more generally focused on the issue of preparedness in way that i think was frankly more of distraction to fema than an enhancement to fema ob viously femas expertise as response and recovery agency and as an operational agency is very very important to our preparedness effort as is the expertise of number of our components like secret service or coast guard which are also goin g to be obviously working very closely with our preparedness component but we wanted to make sure that fema was as an operational agency capable of focusing on its core mission that it was dir ect report to the secretary so it gets the direct attention that it needs and we want ed to make sure the leadership of fema was not torn between its need to focus on the fema role and these additional rather more strategic preparedness functions which we think that we are now seeking to unify and put together in coordinated fashion6 through the 2sr process secretary chertoff is seeking to build more unified and focused department the proposed transf er of preparedness and certain response functions from epr and the elimination of the directorate arguably is one means of achieving that goal the proposal to eliminat epr retain fema as smaller entity with fewer responsibilities and cr eate two new organizational components the office of operations coordination ooc and the preparedness directorate pd would according to the secretary result in more focused alignment of organizations and missions under the secretarys proposal fema woul d report directly to the secretary and would continue to administer federal response and recovery authorities after catastrophes occur ooc would provide the secret ary with improved cr isis and operational management tools and include the homeland security operations center hsoc the staff of which monitors threats and incide nt management operati ons the preparedness directorate would

of the secretarys reorganization authority by stephen r viñaemergency preparedness authorities title v of the hsa identifies the mission and authority of epr but actions ta ken by the administration and by congress since the establishment of dhs have resulted in mismatch whereby the statutory authority does not match the mission carried out by directorate officials the following subsection provides background information on the preparedness authorities currently assigned to epr in the statute and tr acks the transfer of responsibilities from the directorate prior to its incorporation into dhs fema administered preparedness responsibilities through offices and directorates such as the plans and preparedness directorate generally from the inception of the agency through the early 1980s during the carter administration national preparedness and planning entities during the reagan administration the late 1980s through 1992 the preparedne ss training and exercises directorate the mid1990s during the clinton administration and the office of national preparedness the early years of the geor ge w bush administration throughout femas existence emergency preparedness has been an integral component of the agencys functions the bush administration sought to maintain preparedness function including terrorism preparedness in fema as part of its initial plan for dhs however during congressional debate on the hsa terrorism emergency preparedness missions were separated from fema and br ought under the jurisdiction of the office for domestic preparedness odp within the border and transportation security directorate21 this action proved precursor to subseque nt decisions to decrease the emergency preparedness mission of epr on march 26 2004 the secretary of dhs reorganized the department and transferred odp to the office for state and local government coordination and preparedness slgcp within the office of the secretary22 as part of this consolidation and as approved by

the government nd finance division crs contributed to this sectionmetropolitan medical res ponse system mmrs23 in addition to the transfer of grant authority to slgcp congress and the administration agreed to transfer three other preparedness missions from epr first as noted on page 4 of this report congress re versed the hsa provision that brought the strategic national stockpile which includes the preparation of pharmaceuticals vaccines and medical supplies ready for deployment into epr and returned the authority for the stockpile to hhs second the 108th congress removed the fema director as coordinator of the national earthquake haza rds reduction program by tran sferring that authority to the national institute of standards and t echnology in the depa rtment of commerce24 third reduction occurred with enactment of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 the hsa originally authorized the under secretary of epr to develop comprehensive interoperable co mmunications technology program and ensure that first responders obtain the technology the first element of that function development of program has shifted to odp as result of provision included in the intelligence reform act the 2004 statute does retain authority in epr to ensure that first responders acquire the technology25 in summary since enactment of the hsa 11 preparedness functions or authorities have been transferred from epr the 2sr recommendation to transfer the remaining preparedness authorities out of epr arguably is not radical shift in policy and continues recent practices of congress and the bush administration to reduce the preparedness mission of eprfema what might be mo re significant however are two other emergency preparedness functions that i nvolve epr those involving contingency planning for the continued operation of th government and hazard warning systems continuity of government operations authorities governing arrangements for the continued operation of the federal government in the ev ent of national emergency or catastrophe are specified in law policy and plans some of which are not public information given their sensitive and

matters reviewed above members of c ongress might elect to consider the impact of the 2sr reorganization on the response functions secr etary chertoff has indi cated that response and recovery will remain as the functions to be administered by fema compared to the seemingly constant criticism veled at fema in the 1980s and early 1990s the disaster response efforts of fema were generally praised after initial difficulties encountered in the early years of the agencys existence fema gained reputation for being successful coordinator and pr ovider of response and recove ry operations however in 2004 questions were raised about aspects of th response to the four hurricanes that struck florida38 these concerns however pale in co mparison to the questions being raised about the response to hurricane katrina in the gulf states secretary chertoffs pronouncement that response and recovery missions represent th core elements of fema might arguably reflect viewpoint that the agency is primary provider of relief after the president issues major disaster or emergency declaration and exercises lesser role in other emergenc management fields since enactment of the hsa some chan ges have taken place in the epr response functions and questions might be raised about others th following subsections review two issues associated with the response authorities of epr the development and

assigns responsib ilities for activities should the president issue major disaster or emergency declaration under the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act the stafford act40 or determine that an incident of national significance has occurred41 according to secretary chertoffs announcement on august 30 2005 hurricane katrina resulted in the first d eclaration that an incident of national significance had occurred the nrp was released by secretary ridge in december 2004 after period of consultation with federal and nonfederal officials while the hsa authorized the epr under secretary to assume responsibility fo r development of the national response plan nrp42 reports indicate that other dhs executives reportedly exercised leadership in this matter43 despite the congressional mandate in title v of the hsa that development of the nrp would be an epr fema responsibility the exact role of directorate officials in the national plan might be subject to question members of congress might elect to investigate the compliance of dhs officials with the statutory requirement concerning the development of the nrp and whether other dhs officials who exercised leadership in the development of the plan might be tasked under the reorganization with its implementation for example one might ar gue that the proposed office of operations coordination ooc could ex ercise role in the implementation of the nrp emergency response entities in contrast to the disagreement in 2002 over whether terrorism preparedness activities would remain in fema the 107th congress and the administration agreed to keep response ac tivities in fema it might be argued that congress intended to more fully integrate federal response capabilities in epr the statute transferred the functi ons and assets of the nationa l domestic preparedness office ndpo the domestic emergency support team dest the office of emergency preparedness oep and to limited exte nt the

security missions and would also be very useful for postconflict operati ons overseas and would also be used for theater support operations overseas86 also as documentation plans and strate gies for

and economical department remains one of dhs biggest challenges91 comments reportedly ma by other former as well as current dhs officials members of congress and analysts indicate general agreement on the need to meet this challenge overview of preparedness issues some would agree with secretary chertoffs recommendation that preparedne ss and emergency operations functions should be taken from epr and consolidated into the proposed preparedness directorate pd new preparedness directorate would ensure that planning training simulations and funding are administered together as summarized by the secretary we believe that preparedness and respondertrain ing functions should be integrated into dedicated organization92 at hearing held in the opening days of the 109th congress an author of the heritage report that reportedly stimulated much of the 2sr process spoke to the separation of homeland security prepare dness activities from response as follows i would argue for clear division of responsibilities between operators and supporters preparedness and response i thin k is one of them response is clearly an operational function you want the guy w hos in charge of response to be ready to respond to be thinking about res ponding and have that be the sole focus of the organization commission preparedness on the other hand you could argue is support function93 one might argue that an important aspect of the proposal is that preparedness functions would continue to be vested in one department pursuant to the mandate of congress set out in the hsa and in presidential directives issued by president bush since september 2001 the proposed transfer of pr eparedness functions fro m epr is consistent with actions taken by congress and the ad ministration since the establishment of

level others however would disagree with the secretarys proposal and the argument of the heritage author some may argue that the proposed transfer of functions from epr will wrongfully continue to separate emergency management missions that many have long sought to collect in one administrative unit they contend that the decisions to transfer preparedness functi ons from epr should be reconsidered because emergency preparedness activities should be administered in proximity to the response functions to ensure that funding technical assistance nd administrative decisions are coordinated and administered efficiently as noted by the acting inspector general for dhs at the beginning of the 109th congress he had reservati ons about segregating femas preparedness function from its response and recovery responsibilities disaster preparedness response and recovery are inte grally related each relying on the other for success the proposal should be studied very carefully

mistake we tried that before and it was disaster said mr baughman who is now the director of alabamas emergency management agency95 these and others speaking against the plan disagree with the secretarys contention that preparedness is distraction from the core mission of epr and fema in letter to members of congress the president of the national emergency management association nema the pr ofessional association of state emergency management officials argued against the proposed paration of preparedne ss functions from those associated with consequen ce management as follows these functions are closely related response and recovery operations are based on plans created by the preparedness function plans are revised based on input from the response and recovery function an effec tive disaster response is predicated upon planning training and exer cise any unnecessary separation of these functions will result in disjointed response and adversel impact the effectiveness of

far reaching congressionally mandated mission to accomplish wide range of respons ibilities this mandate it may be argued is consistent with the principles first t out in 1978 an allhazards orientation that includes all four cem phase s of preparedness respons recovery and mitigation some may contend that the 2sr proposal abrogates the cem framework the secretary would appear to disagree in testimony before the house homeland security committee the secretary confirmed that fe mas responsibilities are not limited by the type of event that results in catastrophe cl early fema has to be an allhazards agency and traditionally it has been the lead actor in really the core mission of making sure we are capable of responding to all zards including obviously hurricanes103 during the same hearing the secretary appeared to indicate that even if separated the four cem functions are bound together as follows w hat our preparedness directorate will do is it will bring to the table all of these very cr itical functions which are part of preparedness efforts prevention protecti on and response and recovery104 this perspective was emphasized in hearing held on th fy2005 budget for the

white house official s to improve the capabilities of the nations first responders are generally c onsistent with the allhazards requirements set forth in the directives issued by president bush106 the elimination of epr and the separation of the preparedness function and possibly mitigation from fema might be considered insignificant as long as dhs ensures that policy implementation within dhs proceeds in almost seamless fashion some congressional discussion ensued shor tly after release of the 2sr proposal107 additional debate is likely to occur congre ss might elect to debate not only the effect of the 2sr recommendation on the operations and mission of dhs but also whether existing federal missions related to homeland security functions including those assignedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33064crs39 to federal entities other than dhs might be reconsidered the following information and related questions are inte nded to assist members as they consider elements of that debate questions and responses in the process of evaluating the 2sr recommendation issued by secretary chertoff congress might debate the eitheror options either congress approves the s ecretarys recommendation or it does not in the course of this debate members might consider the intent of congress in creating epr in 2002 examine whether the organizations efforts have conformed to congressional intent and place the 2sr recommendation in the perspective of the full reach of federal homeland security related policies primary question before members of congress is whether the 2sr proposal to eliminate epr and modify the mission of fe ma is an appropriate response to the challenges and questions facing the nation the history of femas establishment the struggles encountered by that new agencys administrators in the 1980s and early 1990s and the shifts in emergency activities to and from epr indicate that congress and executive branch officials have long wrestled with the need to improve the administration of federal emergency authoritie s whether consolidated into fema in 1978 or into epr in 2002 some authorities remained outside the jurisdiction of the unit putatively identified as responsible for comprehensiv all hazard management therefore in considering whether the 2sr proposals rega rding epr should be implemented several broad questions and general responses might be posed in light of the core principles followed by dhs in preparing the 2sr initiative first principle dhs must base its work on priorities driven by risk question does the proposal to move the remaining preparedness functions out of epr represent si gnificant action that could decrease risk or would it adversely affect the ability of dhs to perform its mission response the proposed transfers arguably follow on similar actions that have been taken by congress and the administration since establishment of dhs critics c ontend that separa ting preparedness activities from response and recovery would inhibit feedback and interaction among emergency manageme nt units the secretary contends that the transfer would enable fema to focus on response and recovery in light of the proposed transfer of some response functions out of fema the role of other federal ag encies in providing response and recovery assistance and the need to exercise consequence management coordination at the highest levels of government it appears that the proposed transfer would likely have some but not significant impact if communication and feedback mech anisms are adopted within dhs to ensure that lessons learned from simulations and actual events are coordinated it is not possible to assess whether this proposal would lead to reduction or increase in risk second principle our department must drive improvement with sense of urgency our enemy constantly changes and adapts so we as department must be n imble and decisive question would the proposed reorganization result in more flexible department response the large number of dhs entities that directly report to the secretary arguably implies less nimble or fl exible organization on the otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33064crs40 108 maintaining effective relations with nonfed eral partners involved in the delivery of homeland security and emergency management services may be one of the paramount elements of the debate as noted in appendi x b of this report dissatisfaction of state officials with the reorganization plan devel oped by president nixon in 1973 led to calls for new approach that culminated in the estab lishment of fema in 1978 see page 55 of this report 109 legislation before the 109th congress hr 3477 would di rect the dhs secretary to report to congress on plan to establish cons olidated and colocated regional offices throughout the nationhand the delegation of authority to under secretaries would arguably result in more decisive flexible and nimble entity third principle dhs must be an effective steward of public resources question would the elimination of epr and the other elements of the 2sr initiative promote priority setting improve financial management and facilitate the measurement of performance response it is not possible to assess the degree to which the proposal would increase efficiency and economy it could be argued that the centralization of preparedness author ities in one directorate might reduce duplicative assignments and redundant activities the reorganization however would likely increase administrative burdens because staff charged with carrying out responsibilities in offices other than fema will have to increase efforts to communicate information within dhs fourth principle effective security is built upon network of systems that span all levels of govern ment and the private sector question would implementation of the propos facilitate in teractions among governmental and nongovernmental entities responsible for preparing for easing the consequences of responding to and recovering from catastrophes response the degree to which the proposed reorganization would improve the inte ractions of dhs with its partners outside the federal government woul d depend upon the ability of officials with new responsibility to build upon established relationships108 the identification of dhswide regional offi ces would be factor in building these relationships109 also large universe of federal emergency management and homeland security authorities falls outside the jurisdiction of dhs insufficient information exists to determine how the reorganization would affect dhs re lationships with other federal agencies in addition to these broad questions memb ers might elect to consider the following questions that more specifically address concerns associated with the proposal the homeland security act hsa directs that fema maintain an all hazards orientation that includes terrorist attacks except preparedness activities natural disasters and hazardous ma terials incidents this approach to homeland security s decadeslong history involving emergency management authorities federal statutes

federal policymaking take legislative action the transfer of prep aredness functions and the existence of minimally funded or supported authorities within epr arguably serves as justification for the recommendation of secretary chertoff that the directorate be reduced if not eliminated implementation of that recommendati on however would require legislation since epr was blished through the hsa by taking legislative action congress would in effect oppose the secret arys recommendation nd maintain epr as directorate within dhs should congress decide that the mission of epr requires further reconsideration resour ce allocation decisions made through appropriations could serve as the vehicle for change place reconstituted fema in the executive office of the president in the wake of the tragedy associated with the response to hurricane katrina and the long term recovery issues that seem apparent it may be argued that consequence management after certain catastrophic disasters requires ac tion and oversight at the highest level of government congress could agree with the 2sr recommendation that preparedness assistance would be separated from femas mission and might cons ider the separation of mitigation assistance as well the immediate and longterm coordination efforts required arguably could be vested in fe ma director who reports directly to the president or the

dealing with biological threats response and recovery is very very important element of our defense strategy give that ownership to one pe rson or one set of people and particular individual who i think the president has nnounced his intent to nominate is someone who actually has background as an emergency room physician122 while many recognize dhs accomplishments in coordinating federal emergency medical authorities some have identified areas for improvement123 for example one research center reported at the end of 2004 that responsibility for federal biodefense activity is dispersed among more than dozen government agencies the report concluded that the existing array of authorities presents particular challenges to efforts to design implement and ove rsee coherent coordinate d

evaluating wh ether certain emergency authorities should be transferred to dhs members might consid er the following questions in developing criteria for legislation that would further consolidate authorities in dhs does the function require considerab or ongoing coordination between dhs and other federal tities not just at the time catastrophe strikes and femas response and recovery mission is needed does the function require technical knowledge skills or resources that are an inherent part of another agen cys or departments mission would the generalist emergency management skills of fema or other dhs officials have to be supplemented w ith the technical skills that are part of the other department or agency base mission would the incorporation of the func tion into the mission of dhs reduce the number and therefore the complexity of federal agencies with responsibility for similar activities do the nonfederal entities involved in providing services associated with the function have longstanding connections with federal entities other than dhs how would the transfer to dhs affect the ongoing review of regional offices another approach to consolidating these authorities would be to expand legislation before the 109th congress hr 1817 already approved by the house this bill which would authorize appropriations for dhs woul d require the preparation of terrorism prevention plan and amend the homeland security act hsa to establish national terrorism exercise program title iii of the b ill would require that such program be established in odp in order to test and evaluate

that all three of the major agencies concerned with civil emergency preparedness after june 30 1973 maintained their own separate regional offices consequently state officials were required to deal with at least three sets of federal regional officials on often closely related substantive program issues it is probably fair to say that state and local dissatisfaction with the fragmentation of federal emergency preparedness organizational arrangements grew substantially after the 1973 reorganization147 through series of discussions and studi omb officials developed new policy framework that consolidated emergency management functions into fourpart policy framework comprising preparedness respons recovery and mitigation missions this amalgam of policies was referred to as comprehensive emergency management cem148 building upon the work of an interagency reorganization team and using the cem framework president carter proposed th at certain emergency operational and coordination functions previously dispersed throughout the federal government be brought under the jurisdiction of one independent agency adminis tration officials recommended that new federal entity be established to administer many of the federal policies related to the management of emergencies through reorganization plan submitted to congress in 1978 president carter advocated the blishment of fema based on the following four fundamental principles first federal authorities to anticipat prepare for and respond to major civil emergencies should be supervised by one official responsible to the president and given attention by othe r officials at the highest levels second an effective civil defense syst em requires the most efficient use of all available emergency resources third whenever possible emergency responsibilities should be extensions of the regular ssions of federal agencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33064crs56 149 us president carter reorganization plan 3 of 1978 h

federal hazard mitigation activities should be closely linked with emergency preparedness and response functions149 under the second principle an all hazards approach was perceived to be needed to ensure that civil defense resources and syst ems for warning evacuation and preparedness would be available for any disaster regardle ss of cause in order to achieve the most efficient use of all available emergency res ources the allhazards principle advocated by the carter administration paralleled gislation previously approved by congress150 equipment plans procedures and policies n eeded to prepare for and respond to one type of catastrophe eg natural disaster can under the allhaza rds concept be applied to emergency management tasks associated with other cat astrophes such as terrorist attacks151 the third reorganization principle enuncia ted in the reorganization plan advocated the retention of emergency re sponsibilities in agencies as ex tensions of their regular missions as detailed in the plan this w ould be achieved by authorizing fema to coordinate and plan emphasis added for the emerge ncy deployment of resources that have other routine uses there is need to develop separate set of federal skills and capabilities for those rare occasi ons when catastrophe occurs152 in summary the office of management and budget study that d to the creation of fema advocated the centralization of res ponsibilities within the new agency but perceived the need to spread operational responsibilities across the government to regula and manage specific types of hazards153 commensurate with the third principle and with the absence of legislative action some emergency management functions were not transferred to fema in 1978 for example disaster loans for small businesse s and agricultural producers continued to be administered by the small business administration and the department of agriculture hazardous materials nd oil spills remained part of the preparedness and response missions of the environmental protection agen cy and the us coast guard rather than build redundant programs and ac tivities in the new agency the carter administration and

fema resolved some problems however the retention of parallel authorities elsewhere complicated efforts by the new leadership for more than decad after the agencys establishment fema officials struggled to develop the agency nd bring coherence to the range of federal authorities and missions viewed by many to be muddled and inefficient the task of coordinating these activities was formidable due in part to the essential role exercised by state and local governments as well as nongovernmental organizations154 some of femas federal partners did not readily cede authority and even units within the agency reportedly showed signs of poor cooperation the low point may have been reached in the late 1980s and in 1992 after cr itics claimed that the responses to hurricanes hugo 1988 and andrew 1992 were faulty some called for femas abolition other legislation would have significantly reformed the agency155 in the end significant administrative changes not legislative were made in the 1990s and guided fema to reputation amongst some as model agency156 issues that challenged femas leadership over the first decade of the agencys existence included the following inconsistent access to the president and lack of administrative strength to force other federal administrators to share authority as the fema director was not member of the ca binet and headed relatively small independent agency with limited budget the integration of different culture s and missions fire safety civil defense insurance environmental ma nagement into one agency with broad new and undefi ned

haza rds that touched upon the missions of other federal agen cies and departments one explanation among others for the st ruggles fema administrators encountered to accomplish its missions rests with the discre pant second and third principles set out in president carters 1978 reorganization plan as originally envisioned fema officials were expected to meet the full range of emergency management needs associated with the cem framework for all hazards this is arguably the broadest mandate possible which might cover events before and after incidents from complex national security threats industrial accidents that c ould threaten hundreds or t housands of lives nuclear power plant malfunctions and public health thr eats and emergencies to relatively minor incidents such as storms that resulted in some damages and losses the mission of fema was potentially as broad as an federal policy area fema progressed in wobbly steps due to the difficulties of balancing the two potentially conflicting principles of administering its comprehensive allhazards mission and meeting the visible and public challenges of helping communities stricken by catastrophes while being constrained by parallel or convergent authoritie s of other federal agencies in short the theoretically wideranging emergency management polic mission for fema had to be squeezed between the regular missions of other federal agencies one might contend that the success of the ag ency in the 1990s was due in large part to the focus on natural disasters and the limited need to be concerned with other threats such as those stemming from terrorist attacks or industrial accidents the complexity of the latter types of incidents arguably might have challenged the abilities of the small independent agency157 some recognized that femas focus on natural disasters and the dispersed authority for aspects of emergency management among federal agencies created gaps in emergency management capabilities for example in the winter of 2001 the us commission on national security21st century also know n as the hartrudman commission reported on the lack of preparedness for catastrophic rrorist attacks involving weapons of mass destruction the commission recommended establishment of national homeland security agency nhsa based largely on fe mas allhazards mission in order to better coordinate fe deral policy158 also the perspective of st ate and local officials who sought preparedness assistance from federal agencies was summarized by one analyst roughly year before the 911 attacks as process of interagency jockeying this complaint appears reminiscent of complaints raised in the 1970s that led to the establishment of femahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33064crs59 159 smithson and levy ataxia the

resources than they were coordinating their efforts the equipment grant programs of the defense health and human services and justice departments all had varying timelines and requirements slightly different goals and conflicting views on pr iorities regarding how to accomplish cerain response tasks another byproduct of the lack of federal coordination was the creation of roughly ninety terrorism prepar edness courses firefighters alone could get training from three federal agencies headlined by the armys domestic preparedness program159 the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and perhaps more even more significantly the tragedy associated with hurricane katrina have refocused attention on the deficiencies in federal emergency management policies and administrative functions while not agreeing with all of the co mmissions recommendations congress acted upon some of its findings following the 911 attacks enactment of the homeland security act of 2002 hsa established the

president carter with the consent of the 95th congress consolidated missions into fema in 1979 president bush and the 107th congress passed the hsa in 2002 to more fully integrate and coordinate federalemergency preparedness and response missions 160 however the authorities that brought fema into existence in 1979 did not cons olidate all federal emergency management authorities and as result the reorgani zation resulted in an imbalance between the perception that fema could exercise broad au thority and the reality of constraints faced by agency officials similarly the hsa di d not centralize all federal emergency functions within fema or the epr directorate nd also did not consolidate all pertinent authorities into dhs the imbalance remains as fema and other dhs officials
