banks and other financial institutions have been reluctant to lend or otherwise engage with other institutions for fear of exposure to the bad assets of troubled counterparties that is relatively healthy bank is afraid to sign contract with other institutions because of the fear that the other institution will not be able to fulfil its obligations for similar reasons banks that need to raise capital have had trouble doing so because potential investors are afraid that the full extent of damage to banks assets has not yet been revealed furthermore the possibility that future intervention by the government will dilute shareholder value might also deter private investors from recapitalizing banks under these conditions it is difficult for people who depend on regularly accessing credit markets to get loans which in turn can affect the broader economy often this lack of confidence in other financial institutions expresses itself in wide spreads between market interest rates and the yield on treasury securities these spreads have been relatively wide for the past year they spiked following recent interventions intended to prevent disorderly bankruptcies an indication of significant loss of confidence 1

of market confidence can be proxied by spreads in interest rates between treasury securities and riskier assets of similar maturities these spreads first spiked in august 20072 although spreads declined following policy responses by the federal reserve the treasury and the passage of the stimulus package the spreads did not return to their preaugust 2007 level the persistence of historically wide spreads during 20072008 suggests that full confidence has not been restored

residential mortgage borrowers sparked the initial loss in financial market confidence3 reasonable people will continue to disagree as to the initial cause of rising defaults and how these defaults were multiplied through the financial system some believe that low interest rates and loose monetary policy caused housing bubble that was bound to burst when interest rates rose 4 others place more emphasis on loose lending standards that may have been fostered by lack of regulation of nonbank lenders and lack of market discipline by mortgagebacked securities issuers who sold the loans to other investors5 another group places the blame on the failure of officials to regulate relatively recent innovations 1 crs report rs22956 the cost of government financial interventions past and present by

given dollar reduction in the value of their assets they must either raise additional capital or reduce their lending by multiple of the loss6 second banks have become less transparent because of changes in accounting and risk management this lack of transparency has made it more difficult for banks to raise additional capital as an alternative to reducing lending or selling assets third the use of financial derivatives that should have reduced risk in the banking system may have had the effect of increasing leverage and making it even harder to identify sound counterparties

are disproportionately located in areas that had previously experienced rapid price appreciation this includes florida california arizona and nevada in addition subprime loans are disproportionately

directly affected by financial market turmoil are investment bankers and investors these people may lose their jobs and livelihood business firms are also affected because their cost of financing

policymakers have responded in several ways the tools of standard macroeconomics have been used to try to stimulate the broader economy the tools of banking and financial regulators have been used to try to restore order in financial markets congress has given treasury and housing finance regulators additional tools to stabilize mortgage markets and address troubled financial assets many modern

the government can provide expansionary fiscal policy by spending more than it collects in taxes as it did with the stimulus package10 these expansionary macroeconomic policies have not prevented further financial turmoil in addition to pursuing both of these responses financial regulators have tried to restore order in the financial sector using existing authority liquidity was increased by expanding the range of collateral accepted at the federal reserves discount window and by holding regular liquidity auctions 11 the federal reserve and treasury have also tried to help arrange buyers of distressed firms as it did for bear stearns and lehman brothers even though the government was unwilling to also provide funding to facilitate purchase of lehman brothers similarly the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic has sought buyers for distressed banks in addition the fdic and the department of housing and urban development hud have tried to help organize loan servicers through the hope now program the securities and exchange commission sec and internal revenue service irs have issued rules clarifying the ability of loan servicers to modify loans held in securitized trusts 12 congress gave hud and the newly created federal housing finance agency fhfa additional authority to address mortgage markets the h ousing and economic recovery act hera pl 110289 contains voluntary plan to allow banks to write down the balance of existing loans so that borrowers can refinance into fha to avoid foreclosure 13 the act also provided some community development block grant

troubled asset relief program tarp that allows treasury to purchase up to 700 billion of assets from financial institutions although the plan was originally discussed in terms of purchasing assets from financial institutions similar to the resolution trust corporation rtc some policymakers argued that it would be preferable to purchase stock in banks similar to the reconstruction finance

either as firm issuing bonds or as person selling good without suffering firesale prices an adequate capital level is generally determined as relation between assets and liabilities all of firms assets can be completely liquid cash but the firm can remain undercapitalized if small losses can reduce its capital to near insolvency these concepts are related even if firm has liquid assets it may have difficulty accessing credit markets to borrow more funds because it is too close to insolvency to be perceived as good credit risk complexities of mortgagerelated securities have made it difficult to ascertain their value thus those assets have become less liquid furthermore investors know that some banks have suffered loan losses that reduced their capital but the complexities of the mortgagerelated assets have made it difficult to identify which banks are undercapitalized as result the liquidity of mortgagerelated assets has been reduced and the liquidity of financial firms has been reduced the federal reserve has taken steps to increase the liquidity of particular assets for example by expanding the categories of assets that it will accept as collateral for loans but the federal reserve has not restored bank capital
