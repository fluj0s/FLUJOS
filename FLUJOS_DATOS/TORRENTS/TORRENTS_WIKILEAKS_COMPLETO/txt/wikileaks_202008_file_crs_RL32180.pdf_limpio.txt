companies the report then provides brief history of the federal income tax treatment of life insurance companies prior to 1984 when congress enacted the current tax provisions life insurance companies were taxed in manner that reflected two major policy decisions first significant co mponent of life insurance company profits was untaxed second congress sought to achieve an acceptable balance between the tax burden borne by life insurance comp anies owned by their shareholders and the mutual life insurance companies that were owned by their policyholders these provisions of prior law led congress to act internal revenue code sections 809 and 815 which have attracted legislative attention in recent years which are discussed in this report next the current tax provisions applicable to life insurance companies including an overview of the general appro ach to taxation are examined in general life insurance companies include all of their receipts in income and may deduct their general business expenses in addition speci alized provisions that apply to insurance companies make certain that these companie s are not overtaxed as compared to other financial intermediaries these specializ ed provisions are discussed specifically 1 the special deductions for small life insurance companies that effectively reduce the tax rate applicable to these companies from 35 to 14 2 the limitation enacted to prevent life insurance companies from deducting inappropriate expenses that are attributable to generating taxexempt income 3 the complex provisions that govern the deductions allowed with respect to life insurance companys reserve liabilities and 4 the limitation on the amount of policy holder dividends that mutual life insurance companies are allowed to

life insurance companies introduction life insurance companies are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to other business corporations life insuran ce companies compute their taxable income however under set of intern revenue code irc pr ovisions that apply only to life insurance companies these provisions reflect several distinct policy and political concerns first life insurance companies sell life insurance annuity and pension contracts these arrangements combine two elements not frequently bundled together in other financial instruments fr equently life insurance produc ts protect their customers from the risk of financial loss arising from uncertain events for example life insurance may provide financial resources to substitute for the earnings following an insured individuals death similarly an nnuity may provide financial payments that will continue until the death of an annuitant or pension plan beneficiary the contingent obligation to pay benefits is one distinguis hing characteristic of life insurance and annuity contracts second many life insurance products re quire premium payments that occur years before the life insurance compan makes the corresponding payments of benefits to beneficiaries in these ci rcumstances special tax rules are needed to calculate the insurance companys income for any taxable year third for many years the life insuran ce industry was characterized by the presence of two sizable camps within the industry large customerowned mutual companies and the more numerous investo rowned stock companies over the years congress has enacted special tax provi sions that reflect this division one of these provisions remains in effect even though few large life insurance companies now operate as mutual organizations fourth congress has histori cally designed the tax provisions that affect life insurance companies with the goal of generating predetermined levels of tax revenue to achieve this goal it has enacted special tax provisions that affect only life insurance companies this paper1 provides an overview of the most significant tax provisions that apply only to life insurance companies in addition it examines internal revenue code sections 809 and 815 whic h have attracted legislativ attention in recent yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs2 2 more detailed analysis of life insura nce products is contai ned in crs report rl32000 taxation of life insurance products background and issues by andrew d pikethe business of life insurance companies life insurance arrangements typically combine two distinct economic components pure insurance component and savings component when policyholder pays premium to life insurance company portion of the premium pays for pure insurance protection anot her portion of the premium can be viewed as an investment in financial instrument similar to bank deposit or purchase of mutual fund shares most of the difficult issues that arise concerning the taxation of life insurance companies relate to these two economic co mponents of life insurance arrangements before discussing the tax issues this sec tion presents brief overview of the risk protection and financial intermediation activities of life insurance companies life insurance company products and premiums the life insurance i ndustry lls range of insurance products that generally involve contingency that relates to mortality ie the timing of the death of an individual for example life insurance companies sell life insurance products in whic h payments are made to the beneficiaries of life insurance contract following the death of the insured and annuity and pension products in which payments are made to an annuitant or retiree for the remainder of his or her life within these broad outlines the life insuran ce industry sells wide variety of specific products life insurance products2 one common form of life insurance is term life insurance as with all forms of life in surance the insurance company pays the specified death benefit if the insured dies during the period of coverage if the insured remains alive at the end of the policy term the owner of the policy and the designated beneficiaries has further economic claims against the life insurance company term life insurance arrang ement primarily involves pure insurance protection with little or savings another form of life insurance is cash value life insurance the distinguishing feature of cash value life insurance is the pr esence of the contracts cash value which is the amount that the policy owner receive s if she terminates the policy the accumulation of cash value reflects the existence of savings feature in this form of insurance the savings component is much more significant in cash value life insurance than in term insurance variations on the basic cash value life insurance design include universal life insurance variable life insurance single premium life insurance and secondtodie life insu rance in addition key person lifehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs3 insurance corporate owned life insurance coli and split dollar life insurance incorporate cash value life insurance into other financial arrangements annuity and pe nsion products life insurance companies sell wide variety of savings vehicles that are used to provide postretirement sources of income for example life insurance company may issue annuity contracts in connection with an employers pension pl an in these annuity arrangements an employer makes series of premium pa yments during the working years of its employees the life insurance company i nvests these funds and agrees to pay pension benefit following the employees re tirement this type of arrangement is primarily an investment vehicle however annuity payments generally continue until the beneficiarys death because the num ber of payments depends on the timing of the beneficiarys death however there is also an insurance element in these arrangements life insurance companies sell wide va riety of other savings vehicles some of these are sold to individuals including deferred annuities and individual retirement annuities in these arrangements individuals pay premiums to the life insurance company the life insurance company cr edits return on the invested funds depending on the contractual terms of the nnuity the return may be fixed rate of interest or variable retu rn based upon the performance of specified assets these arrangements are primarily savings vehicles that are quite similar to certificates of deposit issued by banks and mutual fund sh ares issued by mu tual funds in an annuity arrangement however the policyhol der has the right but not the obligation to receive repayment in the form of series of payments that continues for the remainder of the beneficiarys life common features of life insura nce and annuity arrangements in these types of contracts the life insurance company receives one or more premium payments as consideration for its assuming its obligations to make benefit payments for some insurance products the life insu rance company will receive the premium payment and will pay all be nefits under the contract in the same year more frequently however the life insurance company receives the premium payment in one or more years and will pay the benef its under the contracts in subsequent years in many instances the premium charged with respect to life insurance contract an annuity or pension plan ex ceeds the amount that th insurance company is expected to pay out in benefits with respect to that contract during the current year because the life insurance company may beco obligated to make benefit payments in future years the premium charged will reflect the following amounts the amount that the life insurance company estimates that it will pay out in the current year the amount that the life insurance company estimates will be sufficient in combination with future premium payments and interest to pay out benefits in connection with the contract in future years andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs4 the amount that will be used to pay the life insurance companys operating expenses and profit state regulation and reserve liabilities each life insurance company is subject to regulation by the state insurance regulators in the states in which th company conducts business the primary concern of the state regulators is to ensure that the life insurance company remains solvent in an actuarial sense the goal of this solvency requirement is to make certain that the life insurance company will have sufficient assets to pay insurance benefits when they become due in demonstrating its solvency the life insurance company files an annual statement reporting its assets and its reserve liabilities in general terms these reserve liabilities represent mathematical estimate of the present value of the companys future liabilities the life insurance companys actuaries compute the reserve liabilities ta king into account the following factors the actuarial likelihood that benef it payments will become payable in any given year the future premium payments specified in the insurance contracts and the interest that the life insurance company will set aside in future years at an assumed rate more detailed discussion of reserve liabilities and simple illustration of the computation of reserve liabilities are on page 11 the life insurance company as financial intermediary as previously discussed many life insu rance products incorporate significant savings component in these arrangemen ts the life insurance company receives premium payments portion of which is i nvested to benefit the policyholders or their beneficiaries in later years the company uses the invested amounts together with interest credited thereto to pay the insurance benefits to the beneficiaries of the insurance contracts this investment of the policyholders funds to provide future economic benefit for the benefi ciaries is form of financ ial intermediation for this reason life insurance company opera tes as financial intermediary other financial intermediaries such as banks and mutual funds also receive funds from their customers these financ ial intermediaries invest the funds and credit an investment return interest in the case of banks and changes in the asset values of the mutual funds to the accounts of the customers in calculating the annual income of these fina ncial intermediaries the am ounts that customers pay to the financial intermediary as an investment is not treated as income rather the bank treats these amounts as nontaxable deposits and the mutual funds treat these amounts as nontaxable capital contributi ons similarly the bank and the mutual fund may deduct the in terest or other investment re turn allocated to its depositors or the owners of the mutual fund shares httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs5 for purposes of reporting life insuran ce companys annual income for state regulatory purposes and for income tax purposes it is necessary to reflect the companys operations as financial interm ediary unfortunately two factors make this analysis more difficult in the case of the life insurance company first the insurance premium may not separate the portion that is to be invested for the benefit of each policyholder second the liabilities owed to the beneficiaries are contingent the amount and timing of the benefit payments depend upon the occurrence and timing of future events these issues are discussed below in c onnection with the tax treatment of the insurance reserve liabilities brief history of taxation of life insurance companies taxation prior to the life in surance company tax act of 1959 at the outset of the federal corporate income tax life insurance companies were taxed according to the same statutory provi sions as other corporations beginning with the revenue act of 1921 however congress has taxed life insurance companies under of rules that differ fro m those applicable to normal business corporations from 1921 through 1957 life insurance co mpanies were taxed utilizing the free investment income approach u nder this method life insurance company was taxed only on the portion of its profit ttributable to its investment activities cash value life insurance annuities and pension plan contributions represent in whole or in part financial investment the premiums paid with respect to these types of contracts include an amount that is invested for the benefit of the policyholder or pension plan beneficiary the life insurance company invests these funds and in effect credits an inves tment return to the policyholders in calculating its free investment income life insurance company started with its net income from its inve stment activities from th is amount the life insurance company subtracted the portion of this net investment income that was deemed to be allocable to the companys obligations to its policyholders the remainder of the companys net investment income was free of any obligation towards the companys policyholders and was therefore subject to income taxation during the period from 1921 through 1957 congress used number of different formulas to determine the amount of inves tment income that was deemed to be allocable to the companys policyholders and thus deduc tible in computing the life insurance companys taxable income in enacting this method of taxation congress avoided some of the difficult issues inherent in taxing life insurance companies specifically taxing life insurance companies on their free investment income made it unnecessary to decide the extent to which premiums received represented taxable income and whether life insurance companies should be allowed an offs etting deduction for the life insurance companys reserve liabilities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs6 3 pl 8669 73 stat 112 although enacted in 1959 the statutory provisions enacted in the life insurance company income tax act of 1959 were made retroactive to the beginning of 1958 4 the extraordinarily complex statutory rule s enacted in the 1959 act will not be discussed in detail in this paper in analyzing tax dispute arising under the 1959 act judge fletcher of the court of claims wrote that these co mplex and obscure provisions bear all of the earmarks of conspiracy in restraint of understanding lincoln national life insurance company v us 582 f2d 579 583 ct cl 1978moreover life insurance compan may earn underw riting profits underwriting profit results if the amounts that company charges policyholders for protection against insurance risks exceed the corresponding benefits paid to the beneficiaries for example life insura nce company that sells term insurance may collect 5 million in premiums for these contracts if the company pays 3 million as benefits and expenses with respect to these contracts the life insurance company has 2 million underwriting profit during th period in which life insurance companies were taxed on their free inves tment income underwr iting profits were not taxed taxation under the life insurance company income tax act of 1959 in the years prior to the enactment of the life insurance company income tax act of 1959 the 1959 act3 developments in the life insurance industry made it necessary to abandon the free investment in come approach to taxing life insurance companies these changes included the growth of the stock life insurance companies relative to the mutual life insurance companies and the substantial increases in the amounts of term life insurance and credit life insurance sold these life insurance products generated substantial underwritin g profits but relatively small amounts of premium and investment income the 1959 act sought to respond to these velopments by enacting the socalled threephase system of taxation4 under this extraordinarily complex system each life insurance company had to determine its taxable investment income which roughly corresponded to the free investme nt income tax base used prior to 1958 and its gain from operations which r oughly corresponded to the life insurance companys total profits although the details of this threephase system are beyond the scope of this paper the following significan t features are worth noting httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs7 congress sought to collect predetermined level of income tax revenue from the life insurance industry an appropriate portion of this tax revenue would be collected from each of the two segments of the life insurance industry the stock segment and the mutual segment most mutual life insurance companies would continue to be taxed on their share of the companys investment income with an appropriate limit on the am ount of policyholder di vidends that mutual company could deduct in technical terms they were taxed on their phase i income the tax liability of most stock life insurance companies would be based upon their gain from operations this was the phase ii tax base these companies were allowed to deduct certain non economic special deductions nd were allowed to defer the taxation of 50 of the re maining underwriting income if life insurance company deducte d any special deductions or had underwriting income that was not taxed in full these amounts were added to the companys policyhol ders surplus account these deductions were designed to provide financial cushion to be used in the event that the company ex perienced significant underwriting losses in future years if however the company distributed these funds to its shareholders or if it ceased to be life insurance company the previously untaxed amounts were included in the life insurance companys taxable income when these amounts were included in income they were referred to as the phase iii am ounts overview of current taxation in 1984 congress overhauled the federal in come tax treatment of life insurance companies the fundamental goal of this overhaul was to blish single scheme for taxing all life insurance companies and to eliminate the threephase method of taxation although life insurance companie s continue to compute their taxable income under set of internal revenue code provisions that apply only to life insurance companies they are taxed in manner comparable to other businesses operating in corporate form certain differences tend to reduce the effective tax burden imposed on life insurance companies as compared to other corporations as with other business corporations life insurance company includes all of its receipts in its income including all premiums received and all of its investment income in computing its taxable income the company is allowed to deduct its general business deductions which include the range of ordinary and necessary business expenses that all business corpor ations may deduct consequently life insurance company may deduct such routine expenses as salaries rents utilities advertising costs and othe r normal operating expenses the company may alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs8 deduct all benefits accrued with respect to its insurance contracts during the taxable year special provisions of the tax law are signed so that the tax burden of life insurance is not excessive compared to the taxation of other financial intermediaries specifically amounts that customers pa to life insurance company as an investment are not taxed this is accomplished in twostep manner that is unique to the taxation of insurance companies first company must include in income the full amount of premiums that the policyhol der pays second company is allowed to deduct any net additions to its life insurance reserves the reserve liabilities generally reflect the investment compone nt of the contractual arrangements similarly the increase in reserves also re flects the amount of interest that the life insurance credits with respect to the policyholders investments analysis of current law major structural issues in taxation of life insurance companies although life insurance companies genera lly are taxed in manner comparable to other business corporations the taxation of life insurance companies deviates from the general corporate tax principles in four significant respects when congress created the current system for taxing lif insurance companies in 1984 it made the following major policy decisions the taxable income of life insurance companies would be basedupon their total economic profit congress decided however to adjust the industrys tax burdens by effectively reducing the tax rate applicable to life insurance companies irc section 806 following the general reduction in corporate tax rates enacted in 1986 however the lower tax rates now apply only to small life insurance companies limitations were enacted to prevent life insurance companies from deducting costs that are attributable to taxexempt income and thereby generate inappropr iate double tax benefits every life insurance company was allowed to deduct increases in the level of its reserve liabilities for tax purposes congress established objective standards for calculating the reserve liabilities for all life insurance companies irc section 807 congress was concerned that mutual life insurance companies may have enjoyed inappropriate tax advantages arising from the mutual form of doing business in res ponse to this concern and to achieve what congress viewed as an ppropriate allocation of the tax burdens between the stock and mu tual life insurance companies congress created an explicit limitation on the amount ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs9 policyholder dividends that mutu life insurance company could deduct irc section 809 each of these matters is discussed below effective tax rate reduction for small life insurance companies in designing the life insurance company provisions of the tax reform act of 1984 one of the legislative goals was to raise predetermined level of federal income tax revenue from the life insurance industry to produce this level of tax revenue congress first estimate d the level of revenue ge nerated under the structural provisions that taxed life insurance companies on their total economic profit because the estimated revenue exceeded the predetermined targets congress enacted two extraordinary deductions that reduced the effective tax rates of life insurance companies to levels that would have ge nerated the desired vel of tax revenues the first extraordinary deduction was calle d the special deduction it equaled 20 of life insurance companys taxable income this effectively reduced large life insurance companys rate of tax from the 46 statutory corporate tax rate then applicable to 368 rate in 1986 congre ss reduced corporate tax rate to 34 for corporations with taxable income of mo re than 335000 in light of this general reduction in corporate tax rates congress eliminated this 20 special deduction in 1986 the second extraordinary deduction is the socalled small life insurance company deduction under internal re venue code section 806 small life insurance company may deduct 60 of its otherwise taxable income subject to several limitations first the small life insurance company deduction cannot exceed 1800000 second if life insurance companys otherwise taxable income exceeds 3 million the deduction is phased out so that deduction is allowed for life insurance companies with taxable in come in excess of 15 million third deduction is allowed for life insurance co mpany that has assets in excess of 500 million to illustrate the operation of the small life insurance company deduction consider the following example assume that company has taxable income of 2 million before taking the small life insu rance company deducti on the small life insurance company deduction equals 12 milli on ie 60 of its otherwise taxable income the companys taxable inco of 800000 is taxed at the generally applicable corporate tax rate although technically deducti on this provision has the effect of reducing small life insurance companys effective rate of taxation to 40 of the normal rate applicable to co rporations thus small life insurance company with income of up to 3 million will be subject to maximum effective tax rate of 14 rather than the 34 statutory rate in enacting this provision congress r ecognized that this deduction did not reflect an expense that constituted cost of doing business rather it recognized that small life insurance companies had enjoyed taxfavored status for some time priorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs10 5 us congress house of repr esentatives hrept 432 pt 2 98th cong 2nd sess 1410 1984 6 generally individuals cannot but businesse s can deduct the interest on borrowed funds used to purchase securities paying interest which is taxable to the enactment of the tax reform act of 1984 and congress believed that it would not be appropriate to dramatically increase their tax burden at this time5 the legislative history does not address r eason why small life insurance companies should be taxed at lower rates than other business corporations with the same level of income costs incurred to produce tax preferred forms of income certain forms of income are taxed in preferential fashion under the income tax for example interest paid to owne rs of certain state and local bonds is exempt from taxation irc section 103 similarly corporation that receives intercorporate dividends is permitted deducti on equal to between 70 and 100 of the dividend irc section 243 taxpayer who incurs deductible expenses to earn taxpreferred income may engage in what tax analysts call tax arbitrage6 simple illustration demonstrates the tax benefits that arise in tax arbitrage transactions consider taxpayer who borrows 100 000 which is used to purchase taxexempt bond assume that the taxpayer pays interest on the borrowed funds at 6 rate and that the taxexempt bond pays interest at 5 rate in this example were there restraints on tax arbitrage the taxpayer receives 5000 of interest income and pays 6000 of interest expens on pretax basis the taxpayer loses 1000 per year as result of engaging in these transactions on an aftertax basis however this transaction is profitable assuming that the taxpayers income is taxed at 35 marginal tax rate the taxdeductible interest payment of 6000 generates tax savings of 2100 035 x 6000 this tax savings convert the pretax loss of 1000 in to an aftertax profit of 1100 the internal revenue code contains several provisions that reduce the tax benefits that otherwise would arise in tax arbitrage transactions for example internal revenue code s ection 265 limits the deduction for interest deemed to be allocable to investments in taxexempt bonds the tax provisions governing life insurance companies contain the most comprehensive limitation on deductions arising from tax arbitrage irc sections 805a4 and 807a2 these provisions apply to all taxexempt interest and mo st intercorporate dividends under these provisions the taxpreferred investment income is prorated between the company and the policyholders this proration is based upon the portion of the life insurance companys investment income that is allocable to the policyholders for example if 90 of the companys investment income is used to satisfy the companys obligations to its policyholders only 10 of the taxpreferred income is deemed to be allocable to the companys own investment as result the company is allowed deduction with respect to only 10 of the intercorporate dividendshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs11 7 the joint committee on taxation characteri zes the deduction of life insurance reserves as tax expenditure and it estimates that this deduction reduces tax collections by 68 billion for the years 20032007 joint committee on taxation estimates of federal tax expenditures for fiscal years 20032007 jcs502 dec 19 2002 8 life insurance company establishes reserves for periods before all benefits are paid with respect to an insurance contract althoug h the life insurance company may deduct the amount paid as benefit under an insurance contract this deduction is offset by the amount of reserves established with respect to that c ontract for example consider life insurance company that paid 100000 to the beneficiaries of life insurance contract following the death of the insured if the company had established reserve of 90000 with respect to this contract the company is entitled to net deduction of 10000 which equals the 100000 payment reduced by the 90000 reserve which is longer needed to fund future benefit payments received similarly the pror ation rules effectively disa llow the deduction for interest allocable to the policyholders share of the companys taxexempt interest income treatment of life insurance reserve liabilities as previously discussed life insura nce companies operate as financial intermediaries to measure life insurance companys income and net worth it is necessary to take into account its reserve liabilities7 under both the 1959 act and the 1984 act provisions life insurance companie s were allowed to take their reserve liabilities into account in measuring their ta xable income specifically life insurance companies were allowed to deduct any increase in the level of the companys life insurance reserves and they were required to include in income any decrease in their life insurance reserves8 the methodology utilized in calculating the reserve liabilities however differed in the two acts to determine the level of life insurance reserves actuaries undertake complex calculations that take into account numerous factors the most important factors utilized in making these calculations are 1 the actuarial lik elihood that benefit payments will become payable in any given year 2 an assumed rate of interest 3 the future premium payments specified in the insurance contracts and 4 the technical actuarial method utilized in the computation each of these factors can influence the calculated level of reserves to illustrate assume that life insurance company will become obligated to make payment of 10000 ten years from today because the liability is for known sum of 10000 and there is certainty concerning the date of payment the only variable factor is the rate of interest that the life insurance company will credit to satisfy this obligation if the company calculates its reserve with respect to this contract utilizing 3 assu med rate of interest the reserve will be 7441 ie the present value of 10000 payable in 10 years us ing 3 discount rate if however the reserve is computed utilizing 5 in terest rate the re serve will be only 6139 the difference in the level of the com puted reserves affects both the annual income and the net worth of life insurance company assume that life insurance company receives premium payment of 7500 to create the obligation to payhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs12 10000 in 10 years if it can use 3 intere st rate in calculating its reserves the deduction for the increase in its reserves equals 7441 in this case the life insurance companys income in connection with this contract is 59 ie the 7500 premium the 7441 reserve increase in contrast the life insurance company will have income of 1361 if it us 5 assumed interest rate for reserve calculation purposes the 7500 premium the 6139 reserv increase it should be noted however that in this latter case the life insurance company will have larger increases in its reserves in subsequent years with the consequence that its income will be smaller in those years the tax law has used two different approaches with respect to the actuarial assumptions used to compute life insura nce reserve liabilities under the 1959 act life insurance companies used for tax purpos the same actuarial assumptions that the companies chose to use for reportin g their reserve liabilities on their annual statements for state regulatory purposes the principal concern of the state insurance regulators is to assure solvency that is to make certain that life insurance companies set aside sufficient assets to meet their future liabilities to their policyholders to accomplish this goal the insurance regulators want to prevent life insurance companies from understating their liabilities conseque ntly the regulators specify minimum actuarial assumptions but permit the use of more conservative assumptions thus the state insurance regulators may prevent life insurance companies from using an interest rate assumption in excess of 5 but life insurance company could choose to use an interest rate assump tion of 3 or 4 while drafting the life insurance co mpany tax provisions of the 1984 act congress recognized that some life insurance companies used reserve actuarial assumptions that were exceedingly conservative thereby reducing the am ount of income subject to taxation for this reas on it enacted internal revenue code section 807 which contains new limits on the actuari assumptions that may be used for computing reserves for tax purposes as general rule the life insurance reserve used for tax purposes for any contract is the greater of 1 the net surrender value of the contract and 2 the reserve computed in compliance with the requirements of irc section 807 in general this provision precludes the use of actuarial assumptions that would produce unduly large reserves consequently the re serve levels tend to be the minimum level of reserves that the states mandate sp ecifically irc section 807 mandates that the most significant actuarial assumptions be determined as follows 1 the actuarial likelihood that benefi t payments will become payable will be based upon minimum state regulatory standards the reserves computed with respect to contracts issued in given year are determined utilizing the prevailing commissioners standard table for mortality and morbidity the national association of insurance commissioners the naic publishes commissioners standa rd tables when sufficient new actuarial data becomes available when life insurance companies are allowed to use the new table for computing reserves for state regulatory purposes in at least 26 states the table becomes the prevailing table httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs13 2 the assumed rate of interest w ill be the greater of two rates the first rate is the prevailing state assumed interest rate this term is defined as the highest assumed interest rate that life insurance companies may use in at least 26 states to compute reserves with respect to the particular type of insurance contract the second rate is the applicable fe deral rate this is rate published by the internal revenue service that reflects the average of midterm interest rates during the 60month period preceding the year for which the rate is calculated 3 the technical actuarial computation method will be based upon methods approved by the st ate regulatory authorities actuaries employ different mathematical techniques in calculating reserves the state regulatory authorities specify which technical methods may be used for purposes of calculating the reserv reported on the annual statement some of these methods utilize p reliminary term appr oach which tends to produce relatively small reserves in the initial years of an insurance contract other techniques produce larger reserves in those years internal revenue code section 807 which specifi which of these techniques may be used for tax purposes generally mandates the use of preliminary term approach deduction of policyholder dividends and the special treatment of mutual companies in general corporations cannot duct amounts paid as dividends to their shareholders in addition the shareholders are required to include in income the amount of dividends that they receive this treatment applie s to distributions that life insurance companies make to their shareholders in the same manner as it applies to general business corporations life insurance companies make distributions to their policyholders that in the parlance of the insurance indus try are also called divide nds these are policyholder dividends which are defined as any dist ribution not fixed by the terms of the insurance contract for example an insurance contract may specify that interest will be credited at rate that will never be less than 3 the contract may also provide that interest may be paid at higher rates determined at the discretion of the insurance company any interest paid in excess of the 3 guaranteed rate of interest is treated as policyholder dividend life insurance company may agree to provide term life insurance protection to the employees of business the life insurance contract states that the life insurance company may rebate portion of the premium paid for this protection if the company in its discretion determines that the prof its for its term insurance business exceeded the companys targets an rebate paid in connection with this term insurance arrangement is characterized as policyholder dividend httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs14 9 the policyholders generally did not include these amounts in income because the amounts were treated as nontaxable pension or life insura nce benefits in general an owner of life insurance contract includes benefits in income only if 1 the policy is surrendered prior to the death of the insured and 2 the amount received upon the surrender exceeds the premiums paid with respect to the contract amounts credited with respect to pension plan are not taxed currently rather taxation occurs only when the plan participant receives her pension 10 life insurance company can allocate amounts to policyholders using several different techniques first the life insurance compan could credit the policyholder dividends to the cash values of life insurance or annuity c ontracts or it could increase the accumulation value of pension contracts second the life insurance company could increase the rate of interest that it commits itself to pay with respect to its life insurance annuity or pension contracts third the life insurance compan could reduce the premiums that it chargesthe interest payments that financial intermediary makes to its depositors are generally treated as deductible business expe nses rebates that business pays to its customers are also deductible in general life insurance companies are also allowed to deduct these amounts when payments are made to their policyholders the conceptual problem arises when mutual company pays policyholder dividends to its policyholders histori cally many of the largest life insurance companies were organized as mutual organizations unlike general business corporation mutual organizations do not have separate class of owners rather the mutual companys policyholders are also the owners of the organization the difficult question is whether the mutual life insurance company pays dividends to its policyholders in their capacity as customers or in their capacity as owners of the enterprise irc section 809 was enacted with the goal of creating tax parity between mutual life insurance companies and stockowned life insurance companies in enacting irc section 809 congress indicated that it believed that mutual life insurance companies effectively distribute portion of their corporate earnings to their policyholders in their capacities as owners of the enterprise9 key conceptual difficulty is that mutual life insurance companys policyholders also are customers and creditors of the insurance company consequently it is impossible to deter mine whether amounts that mutual life insurance company allocates to its policyholders represent rebates of premiums interest or corporate earnings10 for this reason the drafters of irc section 809 attempted to derive an indi rect method of measuring th amounts distributed to the policyholders in their capacity as owners of the enterprise specifically they made the following assumptions 1 mutual life insurance companys distributed earnings would be proportionate to the companys equity 2 in the aggregate stock life insurance companies and mutual companies will earn comparable rates of return andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs15 3 any difference between the observed pr etax profit of mutual life insurance companies as group and the pret ax profit of investorowned life insurance companies as group would be attributable to distribution of corporate earnings to the policyholders in their capacity as owners of the mutual enterprise irc section 809 implemented these assump tions in complicated manner in simplified terms irc section 809 utilizes the following steps 1 each mutual life insurance company and each of the 50 largest investor owned life insurance companies must compute its equity base as that phrase is defined in irc section 809b 2 each mutual company and each of the 50 largest investorowned life insurance companies must compute its pretax profit by computing its statement gains from operations as that term is defined in irc section 809g1 3 the treasury department computes the average earnings rate for the mutual companies as an aggregate entity and the average rate of the 50 largest stock life insurance companies 4 after the treasury department adjusts these averages as mandated in irc section 809d it calculates the imputed earnings rate for given taxable year the imputed earnings rate is the pretax rate of return that irc section 809 deems to be the pretax rate of return that mutual life insurance companies as group s hould have earned given the pretax rate of return of the mutual life insurance companies 5 for each year the treasury department compares the imputed earnings rate and the average earnings rate for the mutual companies to the extent that the imputed earnings rate is higher than the average earnings rate for the mutual companies congress assumed that the difference resulted from distribution of corporate earnings to the policyholders of the mutual life insurance companies in these circumstances irc section 809a disallows any deduction for the differential earnings amount which quals the difference between these two rates of return multiplied by each mutual companys equity basehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs16 11 m graetz life insurance company taxation an overview of the mutualstock differential in life insurance company taxation the mutual vs stock differential larchmont new york ros enfeld emanuel 1986significant current issues repeal irc section 809 from its enactment irc section 809 has been heavily criticized on both conceptual and pragmatic grounds in ddition president bushs fiscal 2004 budget proposal included provision to repeal irc section 809 the conceptual criticisms of section 809 have focused on two arguments first some tax analysts have argued that the theoretical underpinnings of section 809 are not sound these arguments are based on th following three lines of analysis some argue that prepayment analysis demonstrates that tax equity is achieved only if mutual companies are allowed to deduct all amounts distributed to their policy holders this analysis is based on the fact that an investorowned corporation is not taxed when it receives contributions to capital from its shareholders if mutual life insurance companys policyhol ders pay amounts to acquire an ownership interest these amounts are taxed as premium income to the company commentators argue that this difference demonstrates that irc section 809 has theoretical justification11 others argue that the implicit ssumptions underlying irc section 809 are deeply flawed specifically they argue that it does not make sense to assume that stock and mutual life insurance companies will necessarily earn comparable rates of return in addition they argue that irc section 809 does not adequa tely reflect variations in the operations of different mutual companies others argue that there is empirical evidence that mutual life insurance companies provide greater benefits to their policyholders than do stock life insurance companies as result they argue that there are distributions to the mutual policyholders in their capacity as owners of the mutual enterprise consequently they conclude that special tax provisi on is needed to equalize the tax treatment of stock and mutual life insurance companies pragmatic criticisms of irc section 809 also exist the first pragmatic argument focuses on the ineffectivene ss of irc section 809 for the years 2001 2002 and 2003 congress established temporar differential earnings rate of zero irc section 809j the house of repr esentatives has approved hr 3521 which contains an extension of this provision to 2004 for most of the preceding years the actual differential earnings rate was also zero it is unclear what led to this result three possibilities arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs17 12 the life insurance company tax act of 1959 included numerous technical provisions and noneconomic special deductions that are not discussed in this paper many of these provisions had the effect of reducing life insurance companys taxable investment income to levels significantly below the companys profits from its operation as financial intermediary similarly certain of these provisions reduced companys gain from operations to levels below the companys total economic profit 1 mutual companies do not allocate an earnings to their policyholders in their capacity as owners of the enterprise 2 mutual life insurance companies were able to increase their apparent pretax profit rate by realizing their capital gains to greater extent than stock life insurance companies and 3 some other flaws exist in the structure of section 809 second pragmatic argument focuses on changes in the life insurance industry following the enactment of section 809 in the intervening years number of mutual life insurance companies including the largest mutual companies have demutualized to become investorowned companies consequently of the 25 mutual companies that were the largest mutual life insurance companies in 1984 at least 21 longer operate as mutual compan ies as result the perceived need to balance the relative tax burdens of the stock and mutual segments of the life insurance industry that led congress to enact section 809 may be greatly lessened forgive deferred section 815 amounts deferred section 815 amounts under the 1959 act as discussed above from 1958 through 1983 life insuran ce companies were taxed under the so called threephase method of taxation under this system of taxation each life insurance company had to determine its taxable investment income and its gain from operations in rough terms12 companys taxable investment income represented the companys profits from its actions as financial intermediary cash value life insurance annuities and pension plan contributions represent in whole or in part financial investment the premium payments made with respect to these types of contracts include an amount that is invest ed for the benefit of the policyholder or pension plan beneficiary the life insura nce company invests these funds and credits amounts to the policyholders cash values in calculating its taxable investment income life insurance company started with its net income from its investment activities from this amount the life insurance company subtracted the portion of this net investment income that was deemed to be allocable to the companys obligations to its policyholders under the provisions of the tax law in effect from 1958 through 1983 the companys taxable investment income was taxed at the full corporate tax ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs18 13 under irc section 815 distribution tri ggered income recognition only if the amount of the distribution exceeded the previously taxed retained earnings of the corporation income recognition was also triggered if the company ceased to be an insurance company or if it ceased to be taxed as life insu rance company for two successive years 14 report of the committee on ways and means to accompany hr 4245 hrept 34 86th cong 1st sess 13 1959again in rough terms companys gain from operations represented the life insurance companys total profit as computed for tax purposes in addition to its profits from its actions as financial intermediary the companys gain from operations included the companys profits from its underwriting activities unlike the companys profit attributable to its fi nancial intermediary function only portion of life insurance companys underwriting profit was taxed in the taxable year in which it was earned technically if life insurance companys gain from operations exceeded its taxable investment income the company was subject to tax on the sum of 1 its taxable investment income and 2 50 of the excess of its gain from operations over its taxable investment income the untaxed 50 of life insurance companys underwriting profits was tax deferred life insurance company was required to maintain for tax purposes an account calle d the policyholders surplus account in any year in which the company had untax ed underwriting income it was required to increase its policyholders surplus account by the untaxed amount in addition life insurance companies were allowed to deduct amounts under provisions that authorized noneconomic special deducti ons the amounts deducted under these provisions were also added to the policy holders surplus account if the company distributed these amounts to its shareholders or if the co rporation was dissolved the previously untaxed amounts were included in the life insurance companys income13 the legislative history to the 1959 act indicates that congress permitted life insurance companies to defer the taxati on of onehalf of companys underwriting profits because of the claim that it is diffi cult to establish with certainty the annual income of life insurance companies14 concern was expressed that given the long term nature of contracts computation of income on an annual basis will characterize certain amounts as profit which as result of subsequent events will be needed to fulfill obligations arising under these contract s if the untaxed profits are distributed to shareholders however it was recognized that the life insurance company longer needed those funds to meet its obligations to its policyholders 1984 act treatment of previous additions to policyholders surplus account the 1984 act eliminated the threephase system for taxing life insurance companies as result further defe rral of underwriting prof its was allowed in addition the 1984 act retained the requireme nt that life insurance company must include in income any amount deemed to be distributed out of companys existing policyholders surplus account president clintons 2000 budget proposals contained proposal to require life insurance companies to include in income any remaining balance in their policyholders surplus accounts this propos focused on the fact that the originalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32180crs19 rationale for the deferral that the longterm nature of the life insurance and annuity contracts made it difficult to determine profits on an annual basis longer existed because the deferrals took place between 20 and 40 years ago it is unlikely that unanticipated losses will occur with respect to the insurance contracts issued during those earlier years congress took action with respect to this proposal on the other hand the senate fina nce committee approved an amendment to the proposed national employee savings and trust equity guarantee act on september 17 2003 that would suspend the pplication of the rules imposing income tax on distributions to shareholders from the policyholders surplus account for the years 20042 009 the pr ovision also would have modified the order in which distributions reduced the various accounts so that distributions would have been treated as first made out of the policyhol ders surplus account the apparent primary rationale for this proposal is that little if any tax reve nue will be generated under the existing provisions governing the policyhol ders surplus account under current law life insurance companies have the ability to decide whether to undertake discretionary distributions to their stockholde rs that trigger the tax consequently life insurance companies may avoid this trigger by limiting the distributions that they make
