defense and trade division february 10 2005 abstract indias economy has shown relatively healthy growth since 1991 when an economic crisis caused the government to implement various economic reforms yet many analysts view indias economy as falling below its potential especially when compared to country such as china which has achieved far greater economic success over the past decade the united states is indias largest trading partner india is relatively minor us trading partner although us officials argue that it could be potentially large market if india implemented further economic reforms order code rs21502 updated february 10 2005 crs report for congress received through the crs web indiaus economic relations wayne morrison and alan kronstadt foreign affairs defense and trade division summary india is country with long history and large population more than one billion people nearly half living in poverty given that it is the worlds most populous httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21502 democracy us ally in antiterrorism efforts and potentially major export market indias economic development and its trade relations with the united states are of concern to congress this report will be updated as events warrant indias economy upon achieving independence from british rule in 1947 india pursued policies that sought to assert government planning over most sectors of the economy and strove to promote relative economic selfsufficiency these policies included extensive government spending on infrastructure the promotion of governmentowned companies pervasive regulatory authority over private sector investment and extensive use of trade and investment barriers to protect local firms from foreign competition while these policies achieved some economic goals such as rapid industrialization the overall effect was to promote widespread inefficiency throughout the economy eg unprofitable staterun firms and constrained private sector and to greatly restrict the level of foreign direct investment fdi in india indias real gdp growth was relatively stagnant during the 1970s averaging about 27 piecemeal economic reforms and increased government spending during the 1980s helped boost average real gdp growth to 601 1991 economic crisis and reforms india suffered major economic crisis in 1991 largely due to the effects of oil price shocks resulting from the 1990 gulf war the collapse of the soviet union major trading partner and source of foreign aid and sharp depletion of its foreign exchange reserves caused largely by large and continuing government budget deficits2 the economic crisis led the indian government to cut the budget deficit and implement number of economic reforms including sharp cuts in tariff 1 unless otherwise noted data on india are on fiscal year basis that runs from april to march 2 the central governments budget deficit as percent of gdp averaged over 7 from 1980 to 1990 the high level of government debt became unsustainable as the high right of government borrowing raised real interest rates sparked inflation and undermined faith in the currency congressional research service the library of congress crs2 and nontariff barriers liberalization of foreign direct investment fdi rules exchange rate and banking reforms and significant reduction in the governments control over private sector investment by removing licensing requirements these reforms helped boost economic growth and led to surge in fdi flows to india in the mid1990s annual fdi rose from about 100 million in 1990 to 24 billion by 1996 more than onethird came from us investors reform efforts stagnated however under the weak coalition governments of the mid1990s the 19971998 asian financial crisis and usimposed sanctions on india as result of its may 1998 nuclear tests further dampened the economic growth3 following parliamentary elections in 1999 the government launched secondgeneration economic reforms including major deregulation privatization and tariffreducing measures current economic conditions indias economic growth has been relatively robust over the past few years real gdp grew by 82 in 2003 and by an estimated 57 in 2004 global insight an economic forecasting firm projects indias real gdp will rise by 63 in fy2005 and 60 in 20064 by some measurements india is among the worlds largest economies while on nominal us dollar exchange rate basis indias 2003 gdp was 577 billion however on purchasing power parity ppp basis which factors in differences in prices across countries indias gdp is estimated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21502 at close to 3 trillion by this measurement india is the worlds fourthlargest economy after the united states china and japan5 however its per capita gdp on ppp basis common international measurement of nations living standards was 2780 equal to only 74 of us levels poverty is perhaps indias greatest problem according to the world bank india has 433 million people 442 of the population living below the international poverty measurement of less than 1 per day6 indias trade is relatively small according to the world trade organization wto india was the worlds 31stlargest merchandise exporter and the 25th largest importer in 20037 merchandise exports and imports totaled 63 billion and 77 billion respectively indias principal exports were pearls and precious and semprecious stones 148 of total textiles 108 and clothing 105 its top three imports were petroleum 270 of total pearls and precious and semprecious stones 96 and gold and silver 838 indias major export markets were the united states 181 of total 3 real annual gdp slowed from 71 in 1999 to 39 in 2000 4 global insight projects that the overall economic effects of the

national currencies converted into us dollars based on comparable level of purchasing power these data would have in the united states 6 the world bank notes that india has made significant progress in reducing poverty especially in recent years it estimates that indias poverty rate in the 1970s was over 50 official indian government poverty rate measurements differ from world bank data it estimates that the poverty rate at 26 at the end of the 1990s down from 36 in 19931994 7 in terms of trade in commercial services india was the 21st largest exporter 25 billion and the 21st largest importer 22 billion in 2003 8 much of indias trade consists of diamonds india imports rough diamonds which are cut and polished then reexported crs3 the united arab emirates and hong kong and its top sources for imports were the united states 65 of total china and belgium indias it sector the indian government has made the development of indias information technology it top priority over the past few years it has been one of indias fastestgrowing economic sectors and major source of service exports9 for example software and service exports in 2003 totaled 125 billion 30 higher than the previous year the indian governments information technology action plan seeks to boost software and service exports to50 billion by 2008 and to increase the contribution of it to indias gdp from the current level of 2 to 77 currently more than 60 of indias software and service exports go to north america mainly to the united states10 comparisons between india and china many analysts argue that indias economy has failed to live up to its potential especially relative to other developing countries such as china which has comparable population size but has enjoyed far greater economic development in recent years in 1990 indias economy gdp on ppp basis was about threequarters the size of chinas but by 2003 it had fallen to 44 of chinas size indias living standards per capita gdp on ppp basis were slightly greater httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21502 than chinas in 1990 but by 2003 they had fallen to about half of chinas india made small gains in fdi flows relative to china from 1990 to 2003 rising from 2 to 7 however the total level of fdi stock in china remains substantially higher than in india in fact fdi flows to china in 2003 alone nearly 54 billion were 54 higher the cumulative stock of fdi in india through 2003 about 35 billion many economists attribute the sharp widening economic gaps between india and china to differences in the pace and scope of economic and trade reforms undertaken by each country where china has substantially reformed its trade and investment regimes which has contributed to sharp rises in gdp growth trade and fdi flows indias economic reforms have been far less comprehensive and effective for example chinas average tariff has fallen from 43 in 1992 to12 in 2002 indias average tariff during this period dropped substantially from 128 to 32 but still remains among the highest in the world usindian economic relations trade between the united states and india is relatively small but has risen sharply over the past few years in 2004 us merchandise exports to and imports from india are estimated to have totaled 61 billion and 155 billion respectively see table 1 making india the 24th largest us export market and the 18th largest supplier of us imports11 in 2004 us merchandise exports to india rose by 226 while imports rose by 184 over 2003 levels major us exports to india included electrical machinery chemicals unfinished

2004 source us international trade commission dataweb major usindo trade issues indias sizable population and large and growing middle class make it potentially large market for us goods and services12 however number of factors hamper increased economic ties first in addition to maintaining high tariff rates on imports especially on products that compete with domestic products india also assesses high surcharges and taxes on variety of imports major nontariff barriers include sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions import licenses regulations that mandate that only public sector entities can import certain products discriminatory government procurement practices and the use of export subsidies13 variety of restrictions are placed on foreign services providers and on the level of permitted fdi in certain industries second india continues to maintain number of inefficient structural policies which affects it trade including price controls for many essential commodities extensive government regulation over many sectors of the economy and extensive public 12 estimates of the size of indias middle class widely differ using indian standards estimates of the middle class run as high as 300 million people the commerce department estimates that india has 20 million welloff consumers with annual incomes exceeding 13000 and 80 million people with incomes over 3500 and 100 million people with incomes over 2800 13 historically india maintained extensive nontariff barriers on many imports based on balance ofpayments reasons however in 1999 wto dispute resolution panel ruled that these restrictions were longer justifiable which prompted india in 2001 to remove many of its quantitative import restrictions although many of these barriers were replaced with high tariffs crs5 ownership of businesses many of which are poorly run third despite indias attempt to develop internationally competitive it industries such as software us government officials charge that india has poor record in protecting intellectual property rights ipr especially for patents and copyrights the international intellectual property alliance estimated us losses of 420 million due to trade piracy in 2003 nearly three quarters of this in the categories of business and entertainment software and noted very little progress in combating piracy indias extensive array of trade and investment barriers has been criticized by us government officials and business leaders as an impediment to its own economic development as well as to stronger usindian ties14 for example in september 2004 alan larson us under secretary of state for economic business and agricultural affairs stated that trade and investment flows between the us and india are far below where they should and can be adding that american exports to india have not fared as well as have indian exports to the united states and that the picture for us investment is also lackluster he identified the primary reason for the suboptimal situation as the slow pace of economic reform in india httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21502 some us interest groups have expressed concern that closer usindia economic ties could accelerate the practice by some us firms of outsourcing it and customer service jobs to india15 various proposals have been made in congress and various state governments to restrict outsourcing work overseas bush administration officials have expressed opposition to government restrictions on outsourcing but have told indian officials that the best way to counter such protectionist pressures in the united states is to further liberalize its markets other us interest groups have raised concern over the outsourcing of financial services such as call centers to other countries that entail transmitting private information of us consumers16 us officials have urged india to enact new privacy and cybersecurity laws to address us concerns over identify theft17 prospects for indias further economic reform india faces number of significant challenges to its goals of sustaining healthy economic growth and further reducing poverty many economists argue that india needs to substantially liberalize its trade and investment regimes accelerate privatization of state firms cut red tape and crack down on corruption and substantially boost spending on its in physical and human 14 in recent years india and the united states have pursued number of initiatives to improve commercial ties in march 2000 framework for bilateral economic cooperation was created through several working groups as new

nuclear and civilian space cooperation became subsumed under the next steps in strategic partnership nssp initiative 15 the 108th congress passed hr 2673 pl 108199 which limits certain federal government contractors from outsourcing work overseas 16 see crs report rs21809 financial services industry outsourcing and enforcement of privacy laws by m maureen murphy and angie welborn 17 in 2001 the usindia cyberterrorism initiative was established to discuss number of cybersecurity issues the latest meeting was held in october 2004 crs6 infrastructure18 however large and continuing government deficits and the high level of public debt equal to 62 of gdp in 2003 severely hamper the ability of the government to boost spending for needed infrastructure projects without major reforms to the tax system and significant cuts in government subsidies in october 2004 the world bank country director for india lauded the countrys economic achievements but called accelerating reforms essential for sustained growth and poverty reduction there and top international monetary fund official said that india remains relatively closed economy and urged greater trade liberalization and regional economic integration19 organized resistance to desired reforms has come from hindu nationalist groups that were influential under the bjp government from 1998 to 2004 as sister organization to the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh rss leading hindu nationalist organization the swadeshi jagaran manch sjm has taken the lead in efforts to forward the swadeshi or self reliance cause according to the sjm the western notion of global market does not fit into the swadeshi approach nor does the western notion of individual freedom which fragments and compartmentalizes family economy culture and social values such antiglobalization policies continue to enjoy limited but still httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21502 substantial backing among indians moreover the surprise may 2004 election upset defeat of the bjp seated new national coalition led by the congress party that is supported by group of communist parties early alarm was sounded that the influence of communists in new delhi might derail indias economic reform efforts however indian industrial leaders have sought to assure foreign investors that left front members are not cubastyle communists but can be expected to support the upa reform agenda the communist chief minister of west bengal has himself actively sought corporate investment in his state20 despite the sometimes considerable resistance to further progress with indias economic reforms most analysts believe that the congressled coalition will not alter new delhis policy direction in any meaningful way prime minister and oxford educated economist manmohan singh served as finance minister from 19911996 and has been the architect of major indian economic reform and liberalization efforts the new governments first budget released in july 2004 generally was lauded by indian industrial groups as progressive and forwardlooking21 still new delhis movement on key reform issues could remain slow in the near and mediumterm 18 on the political front tensions with pakistan and continued violence in the disputed territory of kashmir pose serious threats to indias longterm economic health 19 remarks by michael carter india director world bank
