the age of 14 years but had not attained the age of 18 years at the time of such offense by fine under this title and imprisonment for not less than 10 years or for life the proposal is essentially the same as 18 usc 1591 but for knowledge of the minority of juvenile victim upon which section 1591 insists9 the proposal contains the same definitions of commercial sex act coercion and venture as its predecessor10 however it does contain technical amendments relating to corresponding civil cause of action and mandatory restitution made necessary by the transfer of the section from the chapter on involuntary servitude 18 usc ch 77 to the mann act 18 usc ch 117 11 g21g142g161g561g22g155g138g143g143g146g140g148g146g151g144g561 proposed 18 usc 2430 would represent an expansion of federal authority to punish sex trafficking if the offense occurs in or affected interstate or foreign commerce it features more expansive jurisdictional base than 18 usc 1591 and thus bears some resemblance to 18 usc 2422 today three federal statutory provisions outlaw inducing another to commit an act of prostitution 18 usc 1591 2422a 2422b12 they differ most notably in their jurisdictional elements 9

force fraud or coercion described in subsection c2 will be used to cause the person to engage in commercial sex act or that the person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in commercial sex act shall be punished as prov ided in subsection b b the punishment for an offense under subsection is 1 if the offense was effected by force fraud or coercion or if the person recruited enticed harbored transported provided or obtained had not attained the age of 14 years at the time of such offense by fine under this title and impris onment for any term of years not less than 15 or for life or both or 2 if the offense was not so effected and the person recruited enticed harbored transported provided or obtained had attained the age of 14 years but had not attained the age of 18 years at the time of such offense by fine under this title and imprisonment for not less than 10 years or for life 18 usc 1591a bemphasis added 10 in this section 1 the term commercial sex act means any sex act on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person 2 the term coercion means threats of serious harm to or physical restraint against any person b any scheme plan or pattern intended to cause person to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person or c the abuse or threatened abuse of law or the legal process 3 the term venture means any group of two or more individuals associated in fact whether or not legal entity 18 usc 1591c pro posed subsection 2429 is identical 11 proposed subsection 2429d1 section 1593 relating to mandatory restitution applies to an offense under this section to the same extent and in the same manner as it applies to an offense under chapter 77 relating to involuntary servitude 2 section 1595 relating to civil remedy applie s with respect to violation of this section to the same extent and in the same manner as it applies to violation of

adults ie unlike section 1591 and proposed section 2429 it would not require that the offense involve either child under the age of 18 or the use of fraud force or coercion as means of persuasion inducement or enticement some of the apparent expansion however would merely duplicate the proscriptions of subsections 2422a and b both proposed ction 2430 and subsection 2422a would cover persuasion inducement or enticement of another individual regardless of age to engage in unlawful prostitution or attempts to do so subsection 2422a however requires persuasion inducement enticement or coercion to travel in interstate or foreign commerce proposed section 2430 on the other hand does not mention coercion and permits prosecution when the persuasion inducement or enticement occurs in or affects interstate or foreign commerce subsection 2422b features jurisdictional element somewhere between the two ie persuasion inducement enticement or coercion transmitted using the mail or some facility of interstate or foreign continued b whoever using the mail or any facility or means of inte rstate or foreign commerce or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states knowingly persuades induces entices or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of 18 years to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with criminal offense or attempts to do so sh all be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than 10 years or for life 18 usc 2422

federal law calls for the confiscation of property derived from or used to facilitate the commission of substantial number of federal crimes 21 confiscation comes in two forms criminal forfeiture and civil forfeiture both are triggered by the commission of an underlying offense civil forfeiture involves civil procedure in which the property is treated as the offender and under which confiscation is ordered if the government establishes the required statutory nexus between the property and the confiscationtrigger offense confiscation does not require the conviction of the property owner or anyone else subsection 1594c calls for the civil forfeiture of property used to facilitate or derived from violation of the peonage trafficking chapter 18 usc 15811595 criminal forfeiture occurs as consequence of the property owners conviction for the confiscationtrigger offense and results only in his interest in the property subsection 1594b calls for the criminal forfeiture of the facilitating and derivative property of defendant convicted of an offense proscribed in the peonage and trafficking chapter 18 usc 15811595 as general rule the proceeds from confiscated property are deposited in the department of justice asset forfeiture fund or the treasury department forfeiture fund and set aside for law enforcement purposes 22 some statutes permit the attorney general or the secretary of the treasury to grant petitions for remission or restoration of confiscated property or the proceeds from the sale of confiscated property 23 relief in civil forfeiture cases is ordinarily confined to property owners innocent of any involvement in the confiscationtrigger offense24 although justice department regulations authorize petitions by innocent victims with present ownership interest in the forfeited property25 relief in criminal forfeiture cases is also available where the claimant has an innocent property interest independe nt of and superior to that of the

to return to victims property seized or confiscated under the involuntar servitude and trafficking chapter 18 usc 15811595 it would amend 18 usc 1594 further to permit the attorney general to return property confiscated under other laws to trafficking victims28 the proposal would further amend 18 usc 1593 in manner that may contemplate sort of shareinthe enterprise concept29 it seems to envision not the return of the proceeds from commercial sex acts to the specific exploited victims who earned them but sharing among the exploited sex workers of the confiscated proceeds of the enterprise as general rule restoration or remission is onl possible where the claimant has or had legally recognized interest in the confiscated property and where the claimant played part in the offense which gave rise to the forfeiture the proposed amendments appear designed to overcome the second limitation they permit victims to recover notwithstanding their participation in the confiscationtriggering offense the courts however may find in the use of the terms restoration and remission an intent to continue in place the ownership requirement under the proposals exploited victims might be thought entitled to more than the return of property that can be shown to once have been theirs it seems possible that rather than permitting vi ctims to recover property confiscated from them because of violations of the peonage and trafficking laws drafters intended to require or permit 27 b subject to remission or restoration the court in imposing sentence on any person convicted of violation of

determines what is criminal and how crimes may be punished there are some circumstances however under which extraterritorial jurisdiction exists in the case of federal law there are some circumstances under which federal crimes committed overseas may be prosecuted in federal court in large measure those circumstances are either found in statute or presumed from the context of the statute if consistent with related principles of international law 32 for example when statute proscribes the theft of federal property it is presumed that congress intends the prohibition to apply regardless of where the property may be stolen33 the courts have generally considered overseas application of federal criminal law consistent with international law when either the offender or the victim is american34 extraterritorial jurisdiction may also be considered consistent with international law when the overseas conduct has an impact within the united states35 or when the criminal prohibition is enacted to implement treaty or similar international obligation or with respect to crime that is contrary to the law of nations ie that is abhorrent under the laws of all countries36 32 for general

jurisdiction in some instances when it seems likely that federal courts would assume it even in the absence of such an explicit provision for instance section 222 proposed 18 usc 1596 would permit prosecution of an overseas violation of proposed 18 usc 2429 aggravated sex trafficking when the victim is an american or when the offender is an american or when the offender is later found or brought to the united states however the elements of proposed section 2429 limit the circumstances under which the offense can be committed overseas because it outlaws misconduct only when committed within the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the united states or in or affecting the interstate or foreign commerce of the united states offenses committed in or affecting interstate commerce or within the spec ial maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states are by definition not committed overseas offenses committed in or affect the foreign commerce of the united states may occur overseas but international law principles have been said to recognize extraterritorial application when crime has an impact in this country 37 on the other hand the application of proposed section 1596 might prove more problematic when the only contact with the united states or its nationals or interests is the fact the offender is found or has been brought to the united states federal prosecution under 18 usc 1589 forced labor might be problematic for example when the misconduct occurs entirely within another country and neither the offender nor any of the victims of the offense are americans
