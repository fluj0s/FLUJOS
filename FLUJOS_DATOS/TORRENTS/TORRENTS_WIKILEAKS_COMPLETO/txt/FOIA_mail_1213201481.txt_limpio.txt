from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to pjonesueaacuk subject re request for some additional info date wed 11 jun 2008 122441 0400 replyto mannpsuedu thanks philyes thats perfect i just wanted to have some idea of the paper thats more than enough info i wouldnt bother worrying about scanning in etc i should have draft letter for you to comment on within few days or so after i return from trieste talk to you later mike 1pjonesueaacuk wrote mike thanks the 19801981 papers i dont have the pdfs 1980 this paper looked spatially at temperatures and precipitation for the 5 warmest years during the 20th century and the 5 coldest we then differenced these to produce what might happen we expanded this in doe tech report to look at the warmestcoldest 20year periods this latter effort didnt make much difference 1981 this looked at statistics of annualwintersummer temperatures for the nh and zones of the nh to see what signals might you be able to detect snr problem really showed that best place to detect was nh annual and also tropics in summer last place to look was the arctic because variability was so high i did look while ago to see if nature had back scanned these papers but they hadnt is the above enough i have hard copies of these two papers in norwich cheers phil hi phil thanksyes revised bibliography looks great ill can send you copy of my nominating letter for commentsuggestions when done alsocan you provide one or two sentences about the 80 and 81 nature articles w wigley so that i might be able to work this briefly into the narrative of my letter thanks mike 2pjonesueaacuk wrote mike will this do have added in section on da you didnt send the narrative will i have to alter that hope to get out of avl at 5pm tonight thunderstorms permitting cheers

h62 that is an impressive number and almost certainly higher than the vast majority of agu fellowsbr br ive attached the 2 page bibliography i think it would be good to add some some of the more prominent dampa type papers especially those early ones because they seem to be ahead of their time and it is high profile topic more so than hydrology but its your callbr br enjoy ashevillesay hi to

wrap mike off to the us tomorrow for 15 days in asheville on 1 this is what people call the h index ive tried working this out and there is software for it on the web of science problem is my surname i get number of 62 if i just use the software but i have too many papers i then waded through and deleted those in journals id never heard of and got 52 i think this got rid of some biologist from the 1970s1980s so go with 52 i dont have pdfs of the early papers i wont be able to do anything for few days either when do you want this in by the way can you email the piece i wrote for you as i dont have this on my lap top i can then pick it up tomorrow at some airport the dampa work has always been with others there is another area on hydrology that i omitted as well keiths daughter is ok she had the operation last tuesday he should be over in birmingham this weekend cheers phil pre blockquote typecite pre wrap hi phil im continuing to work on your nomination package here in my hotel room in triestethe weather isnt any good if its possible for case to be too strong we may have that here lonnie is also confirmed as supporting letter writer along w kevin ben tom k and jean j 4 of the 5 are already agu fellows which im told is important surprisingly ben is not yet nor am i but david thompson is quite young for one of these im guessing mike wallace and susan solomon might have had something to do w that anyway i wanted to check w you on two things 1 one thing that people sometimes like to know is the maximum value of n where n is the number of papers an individual authoredcoauthored that have more than n citations n40 ie an individual has published at least 40 papers that have each been cited at least 40 times is supposedly an important threshold for admission in the us national academy of sciences im guessing your n is significantly greater than that and it would be nice to cite that if possible would you mind figuring out that number and sendingi think it would be useful is really sealing the case 2 would you mind considering minor revision of your 2 page bibliography in my nomination letter im trying to underscore the diverse areas where youve made major contributions and i think its well known and obvious to many that two of these are instrumental data and paleoclimate reconstructions but it occurs to that it is equally important to stress your work in detection of anthropogenic impacts on climate w both models and observations for example your early nature papers w wigley in 80 and 81 seem to be among the earliest efforts to try to do this though i dont have copies of the papers so cant read them and that seems very much worth highlighting to my suggestion is that you add category on anthropogenic climate signal detection and include this work say 8 or so of the key papers in this area including the two early nature ones w wigley as well as some of your later work w santertettthornehegerlbarnett i realize that most of your work in this area isnt as primary author but i do think it would be helpful to show this side of your research and id like to incorporate that into my nomination letter ie how critical your efforts have been to developments in areas such as dampampa you could still fit this onto 2 pages by making the font smaller for the references 10pt rather than 11 pt while keeping the headings at 11 pt and if necessary you could probably sacrifice few of the surface temperature record references to make space for the additional references also if you happen to have pdfs of the two early wigley papers or even just the text for the abstracts it would be great to have little more detail about those papers so i can appropriately work them into the narrative of my letter thanks for any help mike ps please tell keith i was very sorry he was unable to make it here to trieste i was really looking forward to seeing him as were ed and many others here i hope all is well w his daughter michael mann associate
