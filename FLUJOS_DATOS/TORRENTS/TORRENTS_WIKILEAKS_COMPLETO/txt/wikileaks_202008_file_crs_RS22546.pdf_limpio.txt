and to combat transnational terrorism and criminal activities including trafficking in persons and narcotics state department congressional budget justification for foreign operations for fy2007 constitutional reform to reduce overweening presidential power was major rallying cry during kyrgyzstans tulip revolution spurring these calls were memories of frequent constitutional changes orchestrated over the years by former president askar akayev to increase his power at the expense of the legislature postindependence constitution had been drawn up in 1993 with i nput from international jurors that created strong presidency but that also provided for some countervailing legislative powers and for extensive human rights protections ak ayev complained in 1994 however that thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22546crs2 constitution was too idealistic since the kyrgyz people are not prepared for democracy and said that transitional peri od was needed he decreed referendums in 1994 1996 1998 and 2003 that whittled away gislative power despite these successive restrictions the legislature at times asserted itself in lawmaking and oversight many people both inside and outside kyrg yzstan were hopeful that legislative election scheduled for february 2005 might mark progress in democra tization observers from the organization for security and coope ration in europe osce who monitored the race concluded however that serious irre gularities had taken pl ace after the vote protests began in southern kyrgyzstan and sp read throughout the country in march in the wake of what many citizens regarded as fraudulent second round of voting in districts where the earlier vote was inconclusive and president akayev fled the country kurmanbek bakiyev party leader active in the protests was named acting president and won presidential election in july 2005 that the osce praised as generally respecting fundamental civil and political rights virtually all of the legislators elected in februarymarch retained their seats purportedly because bakiyev feared that new elections might exacerbate political instability deliberations over new constitution proved highly contentious with bakiyev seeking to protect numerous presidential power s that many legislators and others wanted to curtail facing rising criticism agains t this stance bakiyev in march 2006 appointed one of the critical legislators azimbek be knazarov to head up working group to draft three alternative constitutions one with st rong presidential powers one with strong legislative powers and one with mixed sy stem in september 2006 these drafts were released for public discussion frustrated by what they viewed as dilatory tactics by bakiyev many parties and nongovernmental organizati ons ngos formed for reforms bloc in january 2006 to press for c onstitutional and other reforms it sponsored large rallies in april and ma to demand that bakiyev agree by september 2006 on new constitution limiting his powers after this deadline passed for reforms announced that new protests would be held recent developments thousands of supporters of for reforms and others launche d daily rallies outside the kyrgyz legislature and presidentia l buildings on november 2 2006 demands included that president bakiyev and prime nister feliks kulov resign if they did not quickly accede to constitutional reforms to cr eate more balanced separation of powers on november 6 bakiyev submitted draft constitution to the legislature that retained substantial presidential authority but the f or reforms members of the legislature vowed to enact their own version bakiye v and kulov publically denounced this as coup attempt later on nove mber 7 demonstrators outside the legislature supporting bakiyev violently clashed with critics of bakiyev resulting in some injuries this violence was denounced by both bakiyev and the for reforms legislators and they formed small team to quickly work out compromise draft late on november 8 the legislature approved this draft and it was signed by bakiyev the next day among the innovations the november 2006 constitution established mixed voting system for new legislature to be elected in 2010 with one half of the members elected by party lists and onehalf in singlemembe r constituencies the legislature would be increased from 75 to 90 seats and the body

central election commission and the pros ecutorgeneral only after parliaments approval the national security service n ss would be placed under the purview of the prime minister rather than as is presently the case under the personal control of the president some critics warned that the agreement by the two sides that the sitting legislature and government would be retained til 2010 created great uncertainty about how constitutional laws would apply in the interim period new st rife between the two sides was assured these critics argued2 appearing to bear out this prediction battle developed in december 2006 when bakiyev nd kulov accused the legislature of being tardy in approving 2007 budget and passing ws on privatization po litical parties and the election code according to some repor ts bakiyev and kulov decided that if the ministerial government resi gned legal uncertainties surr ounding how new government would be formed might convince the legislat ure to disband and hold elections kulov announced the governments resignation on d ecember 19 but most legislators balked at dissolution following veiled threat by bakiyev on december 30 2006 that he would dissolve the legislature it agreed to his ultimatum to enact another constitution that restores his power to appoint the prime minister ministers and regional governors and to directly oversee the nss during the transition period up to 2010 in return bakiyev dropped or postponed his mand for new legislative elections this december 2006 constitution which bakiyev states he soon will sign reportedly re tains most of the innovations of the november version ex cept for the provisions on executive power implications for kyrgyzstan according to some observers the contention over political powersharing between the legislature and the executive branch may well continue despite the enactment of the december 2006 constitution they argue that more careful draf ting of constitutional provisions and implementing laws might have eased some of this wrangling including by competing regional and clan interests perhaps troubling the maneuvering that resulted in kulov stepping down as prime minister could exacerbate regional and clan tensions if bakiyev does not reappoint kul ov or make other conce ssions to the northern interests that support kulov the balance betw een these interests and southern interests that support bakiyev may be broken3 while for reforms and other bakiyev opponents appeared to gain influence with the enactment of the november 2006 constituti on they appeared to lose influence when they boycotted the december 30 legislative session that restored some of bakiyevs powers if the legislature becomes more cooperative it might support kyrgyzstans participation in debt

strong presidential power bakiyev will find it difficult to reverse pluralist trends that are defended by civil society likewise the legislatures capitulation on the constitutional change may not avert calls for its dissolution5 these calls may well increase since the popularity gained by the legislature in 2006 wh ile it challenged presidential power seemed reduced in early 2007 by its cap itulation to presidential power the process by which the new constitutions were enacted also has raised concerns in kyrgyzstan some observers warn that the successful public protests encourage citizens and parties to take to the streets as the main form of political advocacy rather than to work within political institutions indicative of possible future instability for reforms has announced that it will launch new mass protes ts against the december 2006 constitution in spring 2007 other kyrgyz commentators praise the government and opposition leaders for eventually r eaching compromises on progressive constitutional provisions these include that citizens may be detained only after court warrant rather than on the order of the prosecutors office as was previously the case another provision for national council on justice to provide non governmental input into selecting judges and evaluating their conduct ma contribute to the independe nce of the judiciary from political influence accord ing to these analysts6 the international crisis group icg ngo has argued that even if there is progress in kyrgyzstan in restructuring political institutions other major problems of northsouth regional tensions corruption and organized crime must be tackled otherwise icg warns kyrgyzstan could still become failed state major key to solving these problems could be progress in reforming law enforcement and the judiciary it suggests which would improve public confidence in the government according to analyst erica marat president bakiyev reputedly associated just after the tulip revolution with criminal elements in order to reestablish civil order in some regions of kyrgyzstan she asserts however that in recent months the top level of the government has combated organized crime although corr uption remains rampant and ma ny politicians are involved in criminal activities she argues that thes anticrime efforts are strongly supported by civil society and that

the rights of peaceful assembly it stressed that balanced system of representation and accountability is democratic necessity and urged kyrgyzstanis to continue peaceful efforts to implement such

the rule of law11 just after this visit there was an unsolved assassination ttempt against for reforms cofounder edil baysalov who reportedly had warned boucher that democratization in kyrgyzstan was faltering such events contributed to cerns expressed by the us ambassador days later that crime and corruption increasingly threatened kyrgyzstans stability the european union too in may 2006 urged
