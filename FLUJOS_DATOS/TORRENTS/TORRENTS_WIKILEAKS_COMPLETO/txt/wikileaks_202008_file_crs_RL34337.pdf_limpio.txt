major sovereign wealth fund the china investment corporation cic on september 29 2007six months after it first announced its intention to create such fund financed with 200 billion in initial capital the cic is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds swfs in the world although some of the cics initial investments were apparently political in nature the cics top management have repeatedly asserted that future investments will be commercially based seeking to maximize the return on investment since its creation the cic and its subsidiaries have made several investments including the purchase of 99 of the us financial firm morgan stanley on december 19 2007 meanwhile other governmentowned financial entities in chinaincluding the state administration of foreign exchange safehave started to act like sovereign wealth funds and have been making sizable overseas investments according to top chinese officials the cic was created to improve the rate of return on chinas 17 trillion in foreign exchange reserves and to sterilize some of the nations excess financial liquidity depending on its performance with the initial allotment of 200 billion the cic may be allocated more of chinas growing stock of foreign exchange reserves number of experts in international finance have expressed some concern about the recent growth in swfs and chinas creation of the cic analysts have cautioned that major shifts in swf investments could potentially disrupt global financial markets and harm the us economy other experts are less concerned about swfs and the cic and welcome their participation in international investment markets china has resp onded by maintaining that the cic will prove to be source of market stability china has also stated that it has intention of using its swf to disrupt the us economy or global financial markets despite chinas reassurances there have been calls for greater oversight and regulation of the activities of swfs the international monetary fund imf in consultation with many of the leading swfs is developing set of voluntary generally accepted principles and practices gapp for the operation of swfs the organization of economic cooperation and development oecd is drafting policy guidelines for countries that are recipients of swf investments some international financial experts have suggested elements to be included in such guidelines including standards for transparency governance and reciprocity other experts have suggested that the united states should review its current laws and regulations governing foreign investments in the united states and possibly implement special procedures or restrictions on proposed investments by swfs these include financial reporting requirements limits on swf ownership of us companies restrictions on the types of equity investments swfs can make in us companies and special tax provisions for swfs this report will be updated as circumstances warrant

group us private equity firm after few delays chinas new sovereign wealth fundthe china investment corporation cicofficially starte d operations on september 29 2007 the cic has proven to be of interest to congress for several reasons first some observers are concerned that its investment activities might have adverse effects on certain financial markets and possibly the us economy second its creation signals chinas intention to diversify its foreign exchange holdings away from us governme nt securities into other forms of investment third specific proposed investments by the ci c may raise national security concerns fourth some see the possibility that china could use the cic as mechanism to pursue geopolitical objectives with an initial capital fund of 200 billion the cic is significant new addition to the existing pool of swfs see table 1 the cic augments the 2 to 3 trillion under management by swfs worldwide in addition the swf provides china wi th another avenue by which it can invest its growing foreign exchange reserves which totaled 18 trillion as of june 2008 2 also the conversion of the foreign exchange reserves into capital for the cic may help sterilize some of the excess financial liquidity in china that is reportedly contributing to chinas recent inflationary pressures3 t able 1 leading so v ereign w ealth funds country fund size billion year

peterson institute for international conomic s pb083 april 2 00 8 however chinas decision to create the cic reawakened some concerns about the impact of swfs on global financial markets and engendered new misgivings about chinas involvement in the international equity markets david r francis columnist for the christian science monitor started his november 26 2007 article will sovereign wealth funds rule the world with the words sovereign wealth funds are huge scarily big 4 during november 30 2007 interview on national public radios morning edition brad setser of the council on foreign relations stated the rise of sovereign wealth funds represents shift in power from the us to group of countries that arent transparent arent democracies and arent necessarily us allies5 in june 2007 clay lowery us treasurys acting undersecretary for international affairs indicated in an interview that the rise in governmentowned investment funds could cause major changes in global markets and bring about financial protectionism 6 although the current value of cics working capital is small when compared to global capital flows china could increase the size of cic to over 1 trillion if it makes more of its foreign exchange reserves available the growth potential of cic may prove important because according to setser somebody with working capital of 1 trillion such as the cic would have the ability to push the us economy into recession 7 there are also concerns about how china and other nations will invest the capital of their swfs before the creation of the cic china had invested much of its foreign exchange reserves in us government debt such us treasury bills tbills that were relatively riskfree but offered relatively low rates of return on the investment kenneth rogoff former chief economist for the international monetary fund imf indica ted in recent interview countries like china just dont need to hold any more tbills theres just point 8 as result most analysts expect the cic to invest in equities andor acquisitions in order to obtain higher rates of return on their investments one financial experts analysis of chinas foreign exchange reserve holdings from 2000 to 2007 shows slight shift away from us dollar denominated assets 9 with its current capital stock the cic has the th eoretical ability to purchase controlling interests in or acquire major corporations

cream10 surowieckis observation was echoed by wellknown investor warr buffett who added that the annual us trade deficit of approximately 700 billion means the united states has to give away little part of the country every year11 buffet continued by auguring that if these trade deficits continue the united states could wind up as sharecropper economy in which us citizens largely work for foreignowned firms12 in the opinion of securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox the fundamental question presented by stateowned public companies and sovereign wealth funds does not so much concern the advisability of foreign ownership but rather of government ownership13 however others are less apprehensive about the potential impact of swfs on the global economy rogoff thinks the swfs will do more good than bad14 surowiecki maintains that some of the worries about the dangers posed by sovereign wealth funds are overstated and that the swfs will act much like other investors and focus primarily on the bottom line15 preston keat of the global risk consulting firm eurasia group echoes surowieckis assessment pointing out its context of mutual dependence blowing somebody else up does you at least as much financial damage16 the investment activities of several swfsincluding the cicfollowing the outbreak of the subprimemortgage crisis in august 2007 lent pport the views of rogoff surowiecki and keat struggling major financial firms have received much needed injections of capital from swfs on december 19 2007 cic invested 5 billion in morgan stanley not long after the financial firm announced it was writing off 94 billion of lossmaking mortgage investments17 on january 15 2008 swfs from abu dhabi kuwait singapor and south korea provided 21 billion infusion of capital to citigroup and merrill lynch18 during period of global market uncertainty swfs appeared to be providing source of stability19 however as the ripple effects of the financial crisis spread during the summer of 2008 the cic and other swfs seemed reluctant to take on additional ailing financial houses indicating possible limit to the willingness of swfs to play the roles of financial rescuers and suppliers of market stability20 10 james surowiecki sovereign wealth world the new yorker november 26 2007 11 francis op cit 12 ibid 13 christopher cox the role of government in

amount of information is available about the existing investments of the cic however because of the manner by which china typically publicizes cicrelated activities it is often difficult to obtain specific information about investment transactions in particular china frequently announces planned investments shortly before the financial transaction is to take place and subsequently mentions in passing that the planned investment has occurred but rarely reports on the investment the day the actual transaction happens while this pattern demonstrates some relative transparency about cic activities it also indicates an apparent reluctance to be completely forthcoming about the details of the cics investments figure 1 provides an overview of cics current direct and indire ct

jianyin investment company whollyowned subsidiary of the central huijin investment company chic signed an agreement to purchase less than10 stake in blackstone group in nonvoting shares worth 3 billion34 the decision to purchase less than 10 of blackstones shares and to purchase nonvoting shares was apparently not an arbitrary one according to blackstones ceo and chairman stephen schwarzman the deal is purely commercial and do sic not need the us government approval as the stake is less than 10 percent 35 according to executive vice president wang cic will hold onto its blackstone stock for five to seven years or longer36 in november 2007 the newly formed cic assumed responsibility for the assets and liabilities of the chic which was previously owned by the pboc it was reported that the pboc obtained about 500 billion yuan 67 billion in compensation for the chic37 this transaction utilized approximately one third of the cics working capital as result the cic became the parent company for chic and china jianyin investment company plus owner of 3 billion in blackstone group stock in addition cic indi rectly became major stock holder in china construction bank ccb and the industrial and commercial bank of china icbc by way of the investments of chic and china jianyin investment company in those two banks 38 also in november 2007 decision was made that the cic was to

stated that overseas media reports concerning the banks shareholding reforms were false but did not indicate which aspects of those reports were incorrect 42 news article in march 2008 cited an abc spokesman as sa ying that reports of cics investment in abc were not true43 then in august 2008 it was reported that cics capital injection into abc was being reduced to 20 billion to free up more

everbright banks ipo had not occurred overall the reported existing direct and indirect investments of the cic total leave about 90 billion available for future investments so far most of cics investments have apparently been made based on noncommercial criteria for example there are indications that the state council the pboc and the ndrc insisted that the cic provide help in the restructuring of these two state owned banks as condition of the cics establishment 57 similarly the payment to the pboc for the cics acquisition of chic and its subsidiary china jianyin investment company may have been driven more by political considerations than economic ones the noncommercial character of the cics existing investments may lead to increased interest and surveillance on its future investments another factor that may subject the cic to greater scrutiny is the poor performance record of its major overseas investments since cic or its subsidiaries purchased equity positions in blackstone and morgan stanley the share prices of those companies have fallen 50 and 34 respectively 58 some government officials as well as members of the public have been critical of the cics

corporation and various government agencies have been actively publicizing that chinas swf would operate with high degree of transparency utilizing an investment strategy based on commercial principles china has also shown some sensitivity to existing apprehensions about the possible overseas investments the cic might make and cic representatives have publicly announced that the new swf will not invest in certain sensitive sectors and markets however the chinese government has also made it known that it is concerned about undue criticism or scrutiny of the cic and in particular is worried that other nations including the united states may try to use the creation of chinas swf as an opportunity to implement protectionist measures targeted at the chinese economy in sum china has

will adopt longterm and prudent investment principle and safe professional portfolio strategy that adapts to market changes which will put emphasis on rational match of returns and risks61 the cics need for relatively high rates of return on their investments is partially being driven by the manner in which the company has received access to chinas foreign exchange reserves according to one of the cics top managers the co mpany is responsible for servicing the interest on the 155 trillionyuan of bonds issued by the pboc see above according to cic chairman lou the interest cost on the outstanding bonds amounts to 300 million yuan 40 million per day62 with minimum return of 40 million per day the cic will need to earn at least 146 billion per year in profitsor at least 73 on its total capital of 200 billion there was report that cic was late in making its first interest payment to the pboc despite the receipt of dividend payment from blackstone 63 however for its second interest payment the cic was able to draw on its dividends from its investments in domestic banks to cover the installment64 also as lou points out the cics ability to obtain access to more of chinas

will adopt prudent accounting system adhere to commercial lines and improve the transparent sic on the condition that company interest will not be jeopardized 77 in april 2008 cics wang contrasted cics operations to the government of singapore investment corporation gic indicating that while cic discloses its investments in the united states the gic does not78 according to wang cic is one of the most transparent sovereign funds in the world79 however the degree and pace at which china will make the cic transparent is uncertain during dinner at the mayor of london englands mansion lou

however while much of the rest of the world would apparently prefer that china focus on liberalizing various aspects of its inward capital flow policies much of its recent effort has been on laws and regulations governing its outward capital flows at present more foreign direct investments fdis are flowin g into china than are flowing out of china the combination of chinas net fdi inflows and overal l trade surplus is financing the growth of its foreign exchange reserves the bush administration has been pressuring china to make its stock and bond markets more open to foreign investors matching the comparative openness of its inward fdi policies 81 however of late china has been more concerned about increasing the avenues by which it can redirect more of its domestic foreign

us financial industry more open to foreign investment82 in addition the chinese government is gradually introducing reforms to its outward fdi laws and regulations for example china rolled out program

invested in the existing qdiis 84 in december 2007 jp morgan estimated that about 90 billion would be invested in qdiis by the end of 200885 however declines in international stock markets have hurt chinas qdiis one estimate placed the total value of chinas qdiis as of june 2008 at just over 7 billion86 the goals of the qdii program are to offer chinese investors new options and to soak up some of chinas excess liquidity by moving funds overseas chinas apparent efforts to improve the reciprocity of its investment policies have been accompanied by warnings to other nations about using the creation of the cic and the possible rise in chinese overseas investments as an excuse to raise inward investment barriers especially on the ground of national security on december 10 2007 cic chairman lou cautioned during dinner at the mayor of londons mansion if an economy will use national security as criteria for entry of sovereign wealth funds we will be reluctant to tap the market

equities104 according to one analyst safes recent investments have blurred the distinction of responsibility between itself and cic105 second there is uncertainty on how to interpret safes willingness to invest in petroleum companies given cics previous assurances that it would not invest in this potentially politically sensitive industry rumors that safe may be c onsidering an investment in bhp

not sterilized the excess liquidity in chinas money supply may contribute to domestic inflation or speculative bubble in chinas domestic asset markets principally the real estate and stock markets116 prior to the creation of the cic china had been absorbing some of the excess foreign exchange by issuing government bonds and then purchasing foreign government debtmuch of it us treasury billswith the accumulated foreign exchange117 however this was generating two economic forces considered undesirable by the chinese government first to attract the foreign exchange away from its citizens china was offering relatively high rate of return on the government bonds raising the cost of sterilization second because the rate of return was relatively high overseas investors were attracted to the chinese bonds fostering an additional influx of foreign exchange this influx of socalled hot money placed more pressure on china to appreciate its currency when there were already widespread claims that chinas renminbi was undervalued 118 ironically the expectation that the renminbi would appreciate would tend to foster the inflow of even more hot money creating potentially unstable speculative spiral in addition chinas accumulation of us debt in 2007 was not very profitable given the appreciation of the renminbi rmb against the us dollar the yield on 10year us treasury bills fluctuated between 45 and 50 throughout the year however since the beginning of 2007 the rmb has appreciated 60 relative to the us dollar as result the effective rate of return on us treasury bills valued in chinese currency was negative in 2007 119 when evaluated in its domestic currency china lost money on its investments in us government debt in 2007 the cic offers new avenue for the government to utilize the accumulated foreign exchange and possibly earn positive rate of return on its investments the sale of the special treasury bonds places the foreign exchange in the hands of the cics investors who can then invest the capital in domestic assets other than real estate or stocks as well as foreign assets in theory this could reduce upward pressures on chinas real estate and stock prices lower chinas investments in us government debt and generate positive yields on its investments in foreign assets 116 sterilization is process by which government absorbs excess foreign exchange in circulation one common method is by issuing government debt instruments in exchange for the foreign exchange 117 for more information on chinas accumulation of us debt see crs report rl34314 chinas holdings of us securities implications for the us economy by wayne m morrison and marc labonte 118 the name of chinas currency is the renminbi or peoples currency it is denominated in units called yuan on september 15 2008 the exchange rate between the renminbi and the us dollar was 68475 yuan 1 for more information on chinas hot money problems see crs report rs22921 chinas hot money problems by michael f martin and wayne m morrison 119 for example on january 1 2007 the exchange rate was 1 yuan of rmb 1282 cents of us dollars if china had invested 100 billion yuan in oneyear us treasury bills on january 2 2007 it would have been offered return of 50 after conversion into us dollars china would have invested 1282 billion at the end of the year china would have been paid 13461 billion by the us treasury for its investment however the exchange rate at the end of 2007 was 1 yuan 1359 cents so after converting the us dollars back into rmb china would have received the equivalent of 99051 billion yuan for its investmenta ss of 949 million yuan or 09 return on its investment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34337g5g145g146g151g138g514g156g561g21g152g159g142g155g142g146g144g151

critical issue will be the types of investments the cic makes furthermore the entr ance of cic has invigorated discussion of how sovereign wealth funds are regulated and what standards or codes of procedure guide their operations implicit in the creation of the cic is shift in chinas overseas portfolio away from us treasury debt into other assets there has been some speculation that china may be considering shifting most of its 15 trillion in reserves to the cicif it manages its investments well according to some analysts shift in chinas portfolio away from us debt could put upward pressure on us interest rates at time when the federal reserve is trying to lower interest rates to prevent possible economic recession 120 with reported daily trade volume of existing us debt of 600 billion121 large divestment of us treasury holdings by china might also cause more severe market disruptions however there would be little impact on the exchange rate between the renminbi and the us dollar because chinas policy of keeping the exchange rate within narrow band 122 the arrival of new investor with over 90 billion to invest is attracting the interest of many major financial markets around the world on october 26 2007 mayor of london england john stuttard met with cic chairman lou in china to lobby for the new swf to set up branch office in the city of london123 on november 22 2007 hong kongs chief executive donald tsang met with representatives of the cic in beijing for similar discussions124 in early december 2007 lou traveled to london paris and singapore for additional talks about possible cic activity in those financial centers however cics blackstone group in vestment has made some observers wary about the specific types of investments the new swf will make th ere is concern that china may use the cic to secure energy resources or purchase strategic assets for geopolitical purposes there are also market apprehensions that the cic could seek to increase its market share in important industries via targeted acquisitions or takeovers others ar concerned that cic might make investments in particular companies in order to obtain access to sensitive technology or information these various forms of possible strategic investments ar fueling the calls for international guidelines for swfs including chinas cic 120 for an analysis of the potential

policy activities such as injected capital into stateowned banks that violate the gapp however there had already been earlier in the summer of 2008 some indications of possible change in the cicchic relationship including possible separation145 two of the key issues motivating the possible separation are the desire to avoid potential regulatory problems and clarification of the roles of chic and cic the licenses for ccb and icbc branches in new york city were reportedly delayed in part because of the combined shareholdings of cic and chic in the two banks146 in august 2008 the us federal reserve informed the cic that it could not subsidize loans for its companies via an icbc branch in new york city147 also if the two investment agencies are separated it is expected that cic will remain primarily an investor in overseas assets while chic will become an administrator of stateowned financial assetssuch as abc boc ccb cdb and icbc 139 ibid 140 video of gaos interview available

committee released its report sovereign wealth funds swfs and recipient country policies spelling out principles and policy guidelines for fair treatment of swfs148 the report recommends that recipient countries abide by five investment policy principles 1 nondiscrimination 2 tr ansparency 3 progressive liberalization 4 standstill and 5 unilateral liberalization the report also contained list of investment policy guidelines for recipient countries including similar treatment for similarly situated investors codification and publication of investment laws and regulations prior notification to changes in investment policies consultation on possible investment policy changes procedural fairness and predictability and disclosure of investment policy actions on the issue of national security concerns the oecd investment committee recognized that each country has right to determine what is necessary to protect its national security but recommended that in making this determination countries should keep narrow focus in their investment restrictions use appropriate expertise to make national security determinations tailor their responses to the specific risks posed by proposed investment and block investments only as last resort when national securityrelated concerns cannot be eliminated the oecd intends to release final report on guidelines for investment policies for recipient countries by mid2009 the final report is to include list of best practices and if appropriate suggestions for clarifications to existing oecd instruments in addition to developing investment policy pr inciples and guidelines the oecd is holding regular meetings among its members to conduct peer reviews of their investment policies 149 while the group does not have the authority to alter or amend member investment policies the presentations are subject to what ervin referred to as the red face test in response to question on the oecds understanding of the meaning of national security ervin indicated that there is clear consensus that it included military risks government procurement and critical infrastructure but also recognized that each oecd member had to make the determination of what constituted risk to national security ervin also stated that the oecd thinks that members should strive to keep their definitions of national security as narrow as possible g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g11g151g146g157g146g138g157g146g159g142g156g561 congress has already taken action regarding the m onitoring and regulation of foreign

acquisitions or takeovers which results in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states or if the transaction would result in foreign control of critical infrastructure that could impair the national security150 the new law also adds new criteria for cfius to use when determining if an investigation is warranted including whether the transaction is foreign governmentcontrolled transaction151 in addition pl 11049 increases congressional oversight of cfius by requiring more detailed reports on its operations and the results of its investigations however the authority to suspend or prohibit foreign investments in the united states remains with the president even with the passage of pl 11049 some members of congress are concerned that the new law may not sufficiently protect the united states from the risks posed by the emerging swfs in february 2008 letter to their fellow senate banking committee members chairman christopher dodd and ranking member richard shelby indicated their willingness to consider appropriate legislation 152 in an editorial opinion published in the wall street journal senator evan bayh wrote chinas drive for economic advantageincluding rampant intellectual property theft currency manipulation and subsidies for manufacture and exportraise serious concerns about how sovereign wealth funds might be used153 senator bayh also suggests that the cfius 10 review threshold may not be sufficient standard and calls for the united states to implement passive investment requirement on swf investments154 some commentators maintain that while pl 11049 effectively dealt with the national security risks posed by foreign investments it did not adequately mitigate against the economic security risks in his november 14 2007 testimony before senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs truman mentioned that some observers are concerned about the stability implications for the us economy and financial systems of swf investments in private equity firms hedge funds and regulated financial institutions 155 there have been suggestions that the united states should prohibit swf from investing in the united states unless its home nation meets certain criteria such as those proposed by truman and garten on september 5 2007 the house of representatives passed hres 552 110th congress by vote of 401 to 4 which included reciprocity requirement that united states financial service regulators in assessing whether applications from chinese financial institutions meet comprehensive consolidated supervision standards should consider whether the applications are for operations and activities in the united states that are currently prohibited for united states financial institutions in china however others warn that such restrictions could lead to wave of financial protectionism that would cause undue damage to the us economy 150 for more information about the foreign investment and

been pushing the imf to develop system of best practices for swfs160 as previously mentioned pl 11049 broadened th investigatory authority of cfius in cases of national security risk and increased the committees reporting requirements to congress however there have been suggestions that the recent changes do not adequately protect the united states from economic risks posed by swfs these potential economic risks are seen as including financial market instability undesirable foreign control or influence over key industries or companies access to sensitive technology and other forms of unfair competitive advantages among the regulatory changes being suggested are requirements that any swf interested in investing in the united states publicly release audited financial statements that follow international accounting standards on regular basis restrictions on the percentage of us company an swf may ownother nations have such limits for example h ong kong may withdraw the authority of standard chartered bank to issue hong kong currency if the share of its stock owned by singaporean swf exceeds 20 restrictions on the type of investment swfs may make in us companies alternatives include restricting swfs to the purchase of nonvoting shares banning swfs from negotiating seat on the companys board of directors or representation in the companys senior management and changes in us tax codeunder current us law the profits of swfs are generally taxexempt it has been suggested that the taxexemption for swfs be eliminated or restricted in addition there have been suggestions that access to us financial markets should be contingent on the successful conclusion of re ciprocity agreement that would allow us banks and financial institutions comparable access to the other nations investment and financial markets however some commentators are concerned that increasing the regulatory constraints on swfs will precipitate period of global financial protectionism 161 in addition china might respond to additional restrictions on chinese investments in the united states by restricting us companies access to chinas financial markets the issue is whether the value of protection obtained outweighs the forgone benefits of investments prevented in more restrictive global andor chinese financial markets 159 ibid 160 francis op cit and lynch op cit 161 truman op cit
