us policy coordination with selfconsciously independent france classified by ambassador craig r stapleton for reasons 14 b d 1 sbu introduction and summary the nicolas sarkozy who arrives in washington november 6 is in robust political health he completely dominates the politics of france all the levers of institutional power in highly centralized state are at his disposal he remains committed to revitalization of france through reform of policies and laws that have acted as break on french economic growth the challenge now is to put his ideas and programs into effect off to quick start this summer with the implementation of first series of reform measures sarkozy is now beginning to feel the full force of french resistance to change his public support as reflected in the polls is high but has slipped of late the political impact of the first direct challenge last weeks national transportation strike is not yet clear but strikes in other sectors are threatening raising the possibility of the kind of crisis atmosphere sarkozy had hoped to avoid given his electoral mandate and professed openness to dialogue the image of welloiled disciplined machine has suffered as sarkozy has repeatedly rebuked members of his team including his own prime minister raising questions about thinskinned and authoritarian personal style the concentration of power and decisionmaking in the presidency has made for uneven decisionmaking and followthrough the prospect of slower domestic and international economic growth and tight gof budget have narrowed his room for maneuver his appointment to the cabinet of women and minority representatives and the more populist style of his presidency have been wellreceived but his omnipresence and hyperactivity risk overexposure and sarkozyfatigue finally freshly divorced from cecilia he is deprived of someone who by his own account was crucial to his personal equilibrium and served as valued political sounding board 2 sbu while not central to his presidential campaign sarkozy has quickly asserted french leadership in europe and staked out new positions and role for france on the most pressing international issues he believes that relationship of trust and close cooperation with the us enhances frances ability to make an impact toward the achievement of what are in most cases common objectives after five months in office he and his foreign minister bernard kouchner have begun to make their mark they have overseen dramatic shift in french policy on iraq reversed declining french support in afghanistan have set in motion possible return to nato toughened frances approach to iran and also russia and promised new one toward africa the top foreign policy issue for sarkozy is the environment which he has embraced as headline issue linking foreign and domestic policy sarkozy and kouchner also assign priority to kosovo lebanon and darfur sarkozys decision to assist the dutch in afghanistan is the latest illustration of willingness to push cautious bureaucracy and military and to break the mold of chiracera policy despite and perhaps because of convergence with the us on key issues and the dramatic improvement in the tone of the relationship sarkozy has identified specific areas of disagreement with the us 3 c we continue to believe that sarkozy represents an important opportunity energetic in full command at home he is determined to make mark on the international scene as distinct from chirac who advocated multipolar containment of us hegemony sarkozy is welldisposed personally to the us he wants close policy cooperation with us but in relationship that gives france its full due as an independent player alliance not alignment is the way he usually puts it although he is not beyond striking more defiant pose as recently in moscow when he stated publicly that he would not be vassal of the us he will also continue to highlight differences on selected issues paris 00004357 002 of 011 such as the environment gmos and turkeys relationship with europe as demonstrations of frances independent policy course his emphasis of french independence makes less controversial at home both the warming up of the bilateral relationship and the bold policy decisions in such areas as iraq nato and afghanistan distinct french approach supportive on many issues but not in lockstep is in our interest partner with the international bone fides that france retains as leading european power close to but proudly independent of the us is one that can enlarge our ability to effect positive outcomes internationally 4 u in addition to setting the scene for sarkozys first official visit to washington this message iterates the state of play in long list of issues where opportunities and challenges abound in usfrance relations end summary part one sarkozy five months into his presidency 5 sbu nicolas sarkozys visit to washington follows an exceptionally long state of grace as the french call political honeymoon one that only began to peter out in october the fifth month of sarkozys presidency through the summer and well into the new french political year that begins in september sarkozy seemed incapable of political misstep his poll ratings set records both vertically level and horizontally durability for politician long attacked as an extremist and divider this was small feat 6 sbu sarkozys success is attributable to several factors while candidate sarkozy ran hard right election campaign geared to winning over the 1520 percent of the votes that jeanmarie lepens national front had captured in recent years president sarkozy quickly made clear he wanted to be president of all the french not just the political right he also made clear that his ambition would not be satisfied with his election to the presidency he was determined to use the office to get france moving again unleashing its economic potential allowing it to surmount longterm budgetary financial and social challenges he would do this by making good on his program of concrete reform measures which had received mandate from the french electorate 7 sbu immediately after his election in may sarkozy embarked on policy of inclusiveness ouverture bringing in leading figures of the opposition including the socialist party such as foreign minister kouchner the nongaullist centerright and civil society in addition he shattered the whitemale cast of previous french governments with his appointments of women and minorities including to key ministries on the strength of his electoral mandate and with this inclusiveness as cover sarkozy moved swiftly and with virtually socialist opposition to implement his reform program moving five major pieces of legislation through parliament by early october sarkozy seemed well on his way to proving that france could embrace change and that he could imprint on it the culture of results that would be the basis for less painful selfrenewing change in the future 8 sbu over the past few weeks shadows have entered this unnaturally bright picture current polling suggests that while support for sarkozy remains at historically high levels in the low 60s depending on the poll there has been slow erosion in his standing which has perhaps accelerated in the past few weeks in the first serious pushback against key reform french public transport unions engaged in countrywide strike on october 18 over the generous pensions available to public transport workers sarkozy paris 00004357 003 of 011 insists that this time unions will not be able to scuttle this or any other part of the governments reform program while continuing to stress the need for dialogue not government fiat as the mode of action however international economic uncertainty affords sarkozy far less room for maneuver as he seeks to reduce both government expenditures and taxes to unleash economic activity while not fatally exacerbating frances already alarming debt situation 9 sbu sarkozys unexpected willingness to compromise on several of his reform measures may signal recognition of the hard economic realities however he risks diminishing this image of determination and command key components of his political success thus far sarkozy appeared critical of both his finance minister and his prime minister in turn when the former called for greater rigor in state spending and the latter described the state as bankrupt in parliamentary hearings sarkozy fearing that alarmist pronouncements could undermine the publics confidence risks creating an impression of friction and hesitation at the top sarkozys close personal association with policy reform has reduced his ability to cast aside the prime minister or other officials should his policies lose public support 10 sbu the transport unions are but one of the constituencies sarkozy will offend in shaking the french economy loose from policies that have held back growth and bloated public spending as he pushes for reforms that make it easier to fire workers shrink the size of the state whose spending represents 52 percent of gdp by cutting the civil service and open up retail markets to more competition he can expect further pushback from wellentrenched constituencies sarkozy has set in motion series of negotiations on these issues that ultimately could lead to important systemic change but the real impact will only become clear once the negotiations conclude probably in early 2008 and the government is forced to make politically difficult decisions 11 sbu frances broader economic environment will not make the reform process any easier having promised the electorate measures that would bring an extra percentage point of growth to the economy the sarkozy government finds itself at delicate point in the business cycle the government has already scaled back earlier 2007 growth estimates and most private sector economists believe the governments 2008 estimates are inflated although the fiscal stimulus from tax cuts passed this summer may give the president shortterm boost he is unlikely to enjoy the political benefit of strong growth environment in which to pursue his supplyside reforms he has also promised the french people increased purchasing power which will be hard to achieve some of this he blames on the strength of the dollar 12 sbu sarkozy is keen on unleashing market forces to reinvigorate the french economy but he is less than laissezfaire when it comes to restructuring french industry the french state owns far smaller share of the economy than was once the case but it still has effective control of energy and other key sectors sarkozys industrial policy seems to be based on facilitating the emergence of key french firms as leaders in their industries in europe and globally while european experience with national champions industrial policies is shaky the french have done comparatively well of late sarkozy does not hesitate to reduce state ownership in these deals the merger of gaz france with suez creates european giant in gas and energy but also reduces the french stake in its gas company from 80 percent to 30 percent 13 sbu at the macroeconomic level sarkozy has been highly critical of the european central banks tight money strong euro policy and he is all but ignoring previously paris 00004357 004 of 011 agreed eurozone commitments to brining budgets back into balance in both cases eurozone partners have little recourse and france can ride for free on the budget discipline of its partners at least for while in the meantime the presidents approach plays well at home and often appears designed for domestic consumption 14 sbu the usfrench economic relationship remains robust with over 1 billion in commercial transactions per day taking place between the two countries firms during president sarkozys visit ceos from some of the most important of these will meet for the first time in several years as the frenchamerican business council fabc to exchange views on policy priorities us firms have been almost unanimously positive about the sarkozy government nonetheless there are number of regulatory unknowns that could potentially impact us commercial interests among these are the gofs evolving views on geneticallymodified organisms ipr in the digital environment and pricing policy as it relates to pharmaceutical spending 15 c on permanent overdrive and intense in the best of times sarkozys recent divorce raises questions about his ability to maintain his equilibrium and focus sarkozy has himself spoken of his dependence on cecilia my source of strength and my achilles heel as he put it during their separation in 2005 highly irritable darker sarkozy came into view the same one that reappeared at the lisbon summit the day after the announcement of the divorce how much cecilia really anchored him personally and politically should soon become evident but we are betting on sarkozys ability to bounce back 16 c notwithstanding the debate swirling around him and his slight decline in the polls sarkozys political health remains strong he controls all the main levers of power the presidency the parliament the dominant political party and the omnipresent agents of the french state the opposition socialists are in disarray incapable for the moment of taking unified policy positions sarkozy is in position to reassert french leadership in europe and in international affairs generally he and foreign minister bernard kouchner have also begun to make their mark unevenly on french policy the foreign policy equivalent of his domestic rupture are his iraq iran afghanistan and possibly nato on iraq sarkozy and kouchner have made dramatic difference offering political support and associating france with reconstruction efforts and prompting surprisingly little opposition or criticism on nato sarkozy has challenged his bureaucracy and the us to find way to fashion winwin approach for nato and esdp that would entail full french return to nato although the specifics of sarkozys conditions have not yet been worked through sarkozy will be calculating the political cost of any shift on nato knowing that he would be breaking foreign policy consensus that has long enjoyed the support of the gaullist right much of the center and all of the left other issues already showing sarkozys imprint include russia where he is less willing to accommodate and is increasingly concerned about russian intentions and objectives the middle east where he has introduced new emphasis on israels security into the inhospitable ground of frances politique arabe and africa where sarkozy appears intent on finally making break from frances postcolonial reflexes and relationships other high priority issues which sarkozy will also want to discuss include his top issue climate change along with iran kosovo burma darfur counterterrorism and climate change sarkozys approach to these and other international issues of concern to both france and the us are discussed in the second section of this cable part two paris 00004357 005 of 011 key policy issues where they are and where we want them to be 17 c the white house has already publicly enumerated key topics on the visit agenda afghanistan iran middle east peace lebanon darfur burma kosovo counterterrorism and the promotion of democracy herein follows snapshot of where the french are on each of them and on some additional areas and where we would like to move them our list is topped by thee priority policy issues iraq nato and russia sufficiently sensitive not to have been publicly highlighted in the white house announcement along with afghanistan followed by climate change which will likely be highest on sarkozys list 18 c iraq the sudden and dramatic french decision days following the presidents meeting in kennebunkport to break with previous policy and reengage with iraq has uncertain paternity with both sarkozy and kouchner claiming credit following kouchners threeday visit to iraq in august the gof has already hosted both president talibani and fm zebari last week sarkozy told talibani that france wanted to help iraq across the board politically diplomatically educationally and culturally french assistance will not include any commitment of french troops in iraq but it could include training for iraqi securitypolice units as well as counterterrorism forces the french have promised other initially symbolic measures such as opening diplomatic office in the northern city of irbil and aid for hospital in the same area kouchner has already pressed the eu to become more active in multinational efforts at reconstruction which france would like the to head up any us diplomatic conference or initiative could garner french support kouchner plans to attend the upcoming ministerial meeting in istanbul of iraqs neighbors in fact the french are just starting to figure out how they can best help iraq especially to relieve what they see as harsh humanitarian situation sarkozy would likely be open to detailed discussion on this topic given his and kouchners identification with the new policy and abiding lack of enthusiasm in at least parts of the bureaucracy he is in fact the best place to start regarding the us role sarkozy and kouchner do not share their predecessors fixation on our continued troop presence they understand and acknowledge the reality that hasty pullout of us troops would lead to worsening not lessening of the violence with potentially grave implications for the larger region we should push sarkozy to implement humanitarian and reconstruction programs in iraq starting with an already promised medical clinic in the kurdish north as soon as possible 19 c iran sarkozys blunt language on the unacceptability of militarily nuclear iran and the need to maintain maximum pressure on the iranian regime over its nuclear program has only been exceeded by that of his foreign minister the degree to which france has taken public lead with the eu to press for additional european sanctions should the unsc be unable to act has been as impressive as has sarkozys willingness to confront russian president putin over this issue french officials make the point that paris has normal diplomatic relationship with tehran despite sharp disagreements on the nuclear question in this context the french have particularly valued their quiet dialogue over lebanon which has convinced them that by contrast with syria iran has interest in renewed internal violence that might accompany failure to elect new president sarkozy has proven impervious to iranian blandishments aimed at softening frances position or even to break it away from the p5 1 group much to irans chagrin the meetings with sarkozy offer an opportunity to bolster frances tough line and it can be expected that sarkozy will want to get sense from the president of his analysis of our paris 00004357 006 of 011 ability to influence iranian choices and how best to maintain international pressure toward that end having just met with israeli pm olmert to discuss the same issue sarkozy will be keen to understand the limits of our patience while we pursue the diplomatic track which like us france prefers to exhaust before considering military options 20 c nato in one of his first acts as president sarkozy launched defense white paper commission to review frances defense and security priorities one component of the report expected in march 2008 is review of frances relationship with nato the defense white paper could set the stage for possible full reintegration into the nato military command president sarkozy and defense minister morin launched public debate over deeper french role in the alliance in september in two major foreign policy speeches sarkozy clarified that french rapprochement to nato would be tied to two conditions 1 strengthening european defense structures by developing europes own capabilities to plan and carry out defense and security operations and 2 seeking french representation in the highest decision making posts of nato the mfa and defense establishment uniformly caution us against raised expectations with some in the sarkozy administration reportedly including prime minister fillon concerned that abrupt moves toward nato could be controversial domestically all beginning with sarkozy argue that at minimum esdp needs to be strengthened in parallel the idea seems to be that french embrace of nato will ease us concerns about more robustly structured european defense while progress on that front will help ease opposition at home to frances return to nato sarkozy will likely use his speech before congress to further refine his public approach casting frances willingness to move ahead in terms of working with the us as an independent ally and partner not automatically aligned to us positions we believe this visit offers an unprecedented opportunity to identify with sarkozy the common ground on which mutually beneficial bargain on nato and european defense might be elaborated in addition to addressing the substance of sarkozys two conditions we will want to learn how open he is to modifying frances narrowly military europefocused vision of nato and whether he will be on sufficiently fast track to implement or in some way foreshadow elements of bargain at bucharest in april 21 c afghanistan after moment of hesitation during his presidential campaign sarkozy now publicly highlights the importance of french efforts in afghanistan france has recently stepped up military commitments by deploying 3 additional operational mentoring and liaison teams omlts to complement the 2000 military personnel isaf and oef now deployed largely in and around kabul significantly sarkozy recently responded positively to the dutch prime ministers pleas for french presence in uruzgan needed to secure parliamentary approval for renewing the netherlands participation in isaf in agreeing to deploy french omlt sarkozy again demonstrated his willingness to move ahead of more cautious advisors and bureaucracy that prefers slow adaptation to bold moves france has taken other decisions to bolster its presence in afghanistan including moving six french mirage planes from dushanbe to kandahar on september 10 the french and germans reaffirmed plans to support the germanled eu police training mission in afghanistan despite delays on july 30 saceur officially requested six mediumlift helicopters to provide rotarywing support in isaf to replace the us helicopters which are scheduled to depart early 2008 france is considering still this request we should use the opportunity of the visit to persuade the french to broaden and deepen their efforts in afghanistan including by standing up provincial reconstruction team prt we understand the presidency favors this proposal while civilian leadership at the mod opposes french prt sarkozy may echo recent mfa and mod paris 00004357 007 of 011 calls for more comprehensive afghanistan strategy integrating military support and civilian reconstruction and including timeline for shifting the burden from the international coalition to the government of afghanistan 22 sbu environmentclimate change climate change on his election day sarkozy called for greater us leadership role on climate issues he will want to come out of his meeting with the president able to say that he again pushed the president to lead the embassy backed closely by washington agencies has impressed on not only sarkozy and his staff but also officials across france that the us has been leading and continues to lead in the fight against climate change weve impressed on them and sarkozy should be told again that the us has spent 37 billion in the past six years more than any other country for climate science and energy research weve developed new international partnerships part of real strategy of international engagement to reduce carbon emissions weve shown the french that even with considerably greater economic and population growth than in europe were doing better job at reducing both energy intensity and carbon emissions after the presidents major economies meeting mem in late september in washington french officials offered to host the next meeting while expressing some disappointment with both the lack of agreement on postkyoto emissions goal and us reluctance regarding marketbased cap and trade measures areas of potential conflict include concerns that failure for broad adoption of similar carbon reduction schemes will put european industry at competitive disadvantage and the possible french advocacy of european imposed carbon tax on imported goods despite extensive usfrench collaboration in developing next generation climatefriendly technologies the french also criticize what they see as us overreliance on yettobedeveloped technologies carbon capture and storage second generation biofuels and advanced nuclear to address emissions france is skeptical that china and india and other major emerging economies will take steps to reduce emissions unless the us moves first this is an opportunity to convince sarkozy that we take this issue seriously and have concrete plan to make real progress 23 c democracy promotionburma under president sarkozy the french position on burma has converged with that of the us france vigorously condemned the regimes crackdown on peaceful protesters pushed through as unsc president presidential statement supporting the democracy movement supported toughening eu sanctions and bilaterally pressed asean members to take tougher stand on burma fm kouchner will have visited asean countries and china in the week before sarkozys visit to washington to push the burmese leadership to reconcile with aung san suu kyi and the political opposition while sarkozy seems forwardleaning he reportedly considered french disinvestment before being dissuaded by advisors thus far france remains unprepared to implement unilateral sanctions sarkozy however has urged french companies to freeze future investments in our efforts to work with france to promote democracy we should appeal to sarkozy to redouble french efforts within the eu to push for tough sanctions against the junta and for measures in support of the democracy movement 24 c russia during his first presidential visit to russia on october 910 sarkozys advisors were reportedly struck by putins defiant and distrustful attitude toward the us and his revisionist desire to dismantle or undermine the perceived antirussian institutional framework regional and international that has prevailed since the fall of the soviet union sarkozy made little or progress with putin on broad range of topics including iran missile defense georgia and kosovo sarkozys positions tracked with us views except on georgia where he favors future status that is short of nato membership sarkozys visit to moscow highlights seachange in francorussian relations paris 00004357 008 of 011 from the chirac era sarkozy has abandoned chiracs notion of russia as counterweight to the us and does not shy away from directly addressing difficult issues including democracy human rights and rule of law problems in russia chechnya and energy policies sarkozy for example took the unprecedented for french president step of visiting human rights activists while in moscow france is concerned about both putins increasingly authoritarian style and russias increasing willingness to defy international opinion as on cfe and georgia sarkozy is also less willing than chirac to allow energy security and trade priorities to dominate frances appoach that said the french never fail to remind us of russias relative proximity and frances and europes need to come to terms with newly assertive russia sarkozy will want to address how the us can work with france in cooperation with its major european partners to find new modus vivendi with russia we should use the meetings with sarkozy to solidify common approach of tough engagement with russia and highlight the need for the closest cooperation on four related subjects georgia kosovo missile defense and the conventional forces in europe cfe treaty 25 cnf georgia in moscow october 910 sarkozy told putin that france opposes full nato membership for georgia although we have been assured he did not address map for georgia with him highlevel french interlocutors have emphasized in recent meetings that france remains open to something less than membership the gof has maintained that nato membership should not create new lines of division and that territorial conflicts should be resolved prior to membership and that georgia does not meet these criteria france is considering whether nato could offer georgia different kind of status and different approach to regional security possibly combined with incentives including abolishing visas with the eu while we are aware of reports that sarkozy told georgian president saakashvili that he supports map for georgia the gof continues to oppose map which would in its view create additional tensions with russia and exacerbate georgias problems with its separatist regions it also talks about the need to define the territorial limits of nato and its article 5 collective security obligations 26 c kosovo this is an opportunity for the president to reaffirm sarkozys commitment to an independent kosovo sarkozy has stated numerous times that he supports kosovos independence and has instructed fm kouchner to actively seek eu consensus on the matter the french also remind us from time to time that kosovo is european issue which europeans bear primary responsibility for solving the gof is pessimistic that serbia and kosovo will come to status agreement and is working closely with the us and the contact group on postdecember 10 actions the french remain concerned that while eu memberstates may agree to not publicly oppose kosovos independence the eu may fail to reach consensus on legal basis for an esdp mission in kosovo the gof has accepted unscr 1244 as basis for an international force in kosovo and agrees with the us that it would not be advantageous to seek new unscr sarkozy lobbied putin in moscow for more russian flexibility but received commitments the us and eu sarkozy will argue must publicly demonstrate that good faith effort was made to come to an agreement the french are not prepared to recognize independence before the end of 2007 and are hopeful that the us will assist in convincing the kosovars that it is in their interest to be patient with the eu sarkozy will likely ask that the us work closely with kosovar authorities to take coordinated us eu kosovo approach to kosovos now almost inevitable unilateral declaration of independence udi and avoid dramatic rhetoric that will further embarrass serbia encourage similar udis by abkhazia and south ossetia and put internal political pressure on eu states like greece and cyprus to publicly oppose kosovos paris 00004357 009 of 011 independence 27 c missile defense the french agree that russias objections to the planned system are politically driven reflecting russian view of its relationship with its former satellites that is at once revisionist but is also informed by real fears of nato encirclement the gof is interested in us plans for nato to adopt complementary system to protect the exposed southern flank of europe from short and mediumrange threat although it has warned that there is not one euro allocated to pay for such system sarkozy will be interested in learning of the status of usrussian discussions and our analysis of prospects for bringing moscow around to support cooperative effort we should urge sarkozy to use his leadership position in europe to promote understanding of the true nature and scope of the md initiative one that in way threatens russia 28 c cfe the french government remains concerned over the russian threat to suspend participation in the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe cfe in december and strongly supports unified allied position in support of the us parallel actions plan fm kouchner recently wrote to secretary rice to propose an informal cfe seminar in paris on sipdis november 56 to promote constructive dialogue leading to comprehensive political solution these efforts are seen as key to keeping allied solidarity and building pressure on russia to recognize the consequences of pulling out of major arms control treaty despite these efforts the french are increasingly pessimistic political director gerard araud was told recently in moscow that the decision was already made by putin and the mod to suspend participation due in part to russian views that it is humiliating to have flank limits imposed on russian forces within its own borders we should welcome french initiatives to help resolve the cfe issue and continue our close collaboration 29 c lebanon sarkozy has not been as closely associated as fm kouchner with french efforts to help lebanon elect new president and emerge from its present political crisis but he has played key supporting role initially unimpressed with the march 14 majority leaders he met sarkozys view of saad hariri has improved with subsequent meetings after their last session sarkozy authorized announcement of frances tranche of more than 6 million for the special tribunal which france had been withholding pending formal request for contributions by the secretarygeneral our close consultations with the french sipdis over lebanon continue although we differ over tactics and the risks attached to any strategy that would allow the majority to elect president via simple majority the french emphasize finding consensus candidate acceptable to all lebanese and external parties and place more trust than we believe wise in lebanese parliamentary speaker nabih berri despite his association with the prosyrian minority while the french have revived limited contact with syria to discuss lebanon we do not believe they intend to go further at this stage we will want to discuss with sarkozy how to keep pressure on the lebanese to elect president by the november 24 deadline without compromising the gains we have made over the past two years in terms of reducing syrian influence and reasserting lebanese independence we will want to impress on him that the election of president whether by majority of consensus by november 24 is must fear of the repercussions of election of president by mere majority should not be ruled out if it is the only way to prevent void that the syrians would only be too happy to fill 30 c middle east peace process sarkozy will want to hear about our efforts to convene regional meeting in support of israelipalestinian efforts at achieving twostate solution the french have generally supported our efforts and not tried to get out in front they are paris 00004357 010 of 011 however eager to play some sort of role sarkozy has taken to using his bona fides as friend of israel to call on it for more creativity and gestures toward the palestinians in the runup to the meeting the gof recently announced its intention to host donors conference for humanitarian assistance to help the palestinian people as an end in itself and in support of the political process sarkozy will mostly be in listening mode though as someone who has sought since taking office to underscore his readiness to listen at least as attentively to the israeli point of view as the arab one 31 c franceeu president sarkozy was instrumental in reactivating the moribund political reform process in the european union with the june negotiation for shortened reform treaty that will simplify some of the eus operating procedures while sidestepping efforts of deepened political integration that doomed the eu constitution in 2005 this reform treaty was approved by eu leaders in lisbon last week and is scheduled to be signed in december with ratification over the course of 2008 sarkozy has said publicly he wants france to be the first country to ratify the simplified treaty the process of parliamentary ratification will begin in december the french will also take over the rotating eu presidency from julydecember 2008 and plan to focus on immigration energy the environment and european defense during their term while sarkozy remains firmly opposed to eu enlargement to include turkey he has effectively sidestepped this issue by supporting continued negotiations on the acquis communautaire that do not presuppose membership he also conditioned his position on eu support for committee of wise men to reflect without taboos on the broader questions about the european future ie what is the european identity what should the eus borders be how to handle common issues and how deep can political integration go 32 c colombia sarkozy promised during his presidential campaign to work for the release of francocolombian farc hostage ingrid betancourt he would sorely like to be able to achieve in few short months what chirac couldnt despite years of effort in june of this year the french pushed colombian president alvaro uribe to release 200 farc prisoners in an effort to move forward negotiations for the release of farc hostages while the prisoner release did not achieve the desired results the french are now backing venezuelan president hugo chavezs offer to negotiate hostage deal between the colombian government and farc guerillas sarkozy invited chavez to paris in late november the french admit chavez is difficult political actor but accept bargain with the devil to advance prospects for the release of an iconic hostage sarkozy may ask us to return two farc leaders in us prison to third country in order to obtain the release of french hostage we should ask sarkozy not to take any steps that would result in separate treatment for ingrid betancourt and put us hostages in harms way 33 sbu gmo moratorium when sarkozy came into office not only did he create mega environment ministry but he also directed it to undertake process the grenelle involving all sectors of the economy to reshape french environmental policies among the topics considered in the grenelle was what to do about genetically modified organisms subject of considerable domestic concern in france the result is that france is currently considering moratorium on biotech planting that would significantly undermine us agricultural exports to europe we believe president sarkozy may support the politically popular moratorium in order to gain capital to use in his reform efforts 34 c darfur and chad central african republic sarkozy demonstrated an immediate renewed interest in africa paris 00004357 011 of 011 upon entering office with france calling for and organizing the june 25 ministerial conference on darfur which served to refocus international attention on that country the french followed up with ministerial meeting on darfur on the margins of the unga in new york in september and then hosted broader security council session on africa for headsofstategovernment france has been instrumental in organizing separate security councilblessed euun peacekeeping mission in chad and the central african republic minurcat paris hopes to deploy this force as soon as practicable in addition the french have firmly supported the deployment of the hybrid unau force in darfur unamid we should thank sarkozy for french leadership on chad and the car sarkozy may ask for enhanced us financial contributions
