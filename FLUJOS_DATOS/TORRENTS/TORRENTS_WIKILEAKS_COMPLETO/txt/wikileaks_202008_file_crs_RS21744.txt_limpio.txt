overview the national aeronautics and space administration nasa was created by the 1958 national aeronautics and space act pl 85568 nasas charter is to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities military space and aeronautics activities are conducted by the department of defense dod and the intelligence community dod and nasa cooperate in some areas of technology development and occasionally have joint programs nasa opened its doors on october 1 1958 almost exactly one year after the soviet union ushered in the space age with the launch of the worlds first satellite sputnik on october 4 1957 in the more than 45 years that have elapsed nasa has conducted far reaching programs in human and robotic spaceflight technology development and scientific research the agency is

vahudia bill hr 5041 hrept 108674 had cut 11 billion from the request major reductions included all 438 million from the crew exploration vehicle cev 230 million of the 438 million for project prometheus 190 million from the 19 billion for international space station iss including 70 million of the 140 million for new iss crewcargo services line and 103 million of the 309 million for bioastronautics research the senate appropriations committee s 2825 srept 108353 recommended 164 billion 135 million over the request including 800 million designated as emergency spending 500 million for the space shuttle and 300 million for hubble space telescope repair mission among the cuts made by the senate committee were 160 million from cev all 115 million from exploration systems technology maturation 260 million from iss including all 140 million from iss crewcargo and 124 million from biological research neither chamber brought the vahudia bill to the floor for vote instead compromise version was included in hr 4818 pl 108447 it provides nasa considerable latitude to shift funding among the agencys programs specific amounts of were identified for only few programs see crs report rl32676 for more detail key issues for congress return to flight of the space shuttle the space shuttle columbia disintegrated as it returned to earth on february 1 2003 all seven astronauts aboard were killed nasa and its contractors are working to resume shuttle launches as soon as possible consistent with ensuring the shuttle is as safe as possible see crs report rs21408 for more on columbia and return to flight rtf the fy2005 budget request released in february 2004 proposed 43 billion for shuttle funding up from 4 billion in fy2004 in november 2004 however nasa informed congress that 762 million more is needed in fy2005 for rtf activities in pl 108447 crs4 congress appropriated 43 billion but said the administrator may request supplemental funding or reprogram funds within the agency if needed one issue involved in rtf is whether president bushs vision see below may be creating the type of pressures on the shuttle program that existed prior to the columbia tragedy the columbia accident investigation board caib cited schedule pressure as one factor in the columbia tragedy it also noted that funding was taken from the shuttle budget over several years to pay for other nasa programs president bush has called for iss construction to be completed by 2010 at which point the shuttle system would be retired ending the shuttle program would free funds for implementing the vision nasas fy2005 request includes outyear projections that reduce the shuttle budget by total of 15 billion in fy2008 and fy2009 to help pay for the vision nasa estimates that 28 shuttle launches are required to complete construction nasas willingness to slip rtf most recently to may 12june 3 2005 suggests to some that nasa is proceeding cautiously but the agencys plan to launch 28 flights in less than six years makes others worry that an environment similar to that prior to columbia is being recreated president bushs vision for space exploration httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21744 on january 14 2004 president george w bush made major space policy address in which he directed nasa to focus its activities on returning astronauts to the moon by 2020 and someday sending them to mars and worlds beyond see crs report rs21720 it is called the vision for space exploration or simply the vision to accomplish those goals nasa would terminate the shuttle program in 2010 discussed above build new crew exploration vehicle cev to take astronauts to earth orbit by 2014 and ultimately to the moon restructure the us issbased research program to support only life sciences research associated with achieving the exploration goals and build robotic probes as trailblazers for the astronauts the president invited other countries to join between 2010 when the shuttle is terminated and 2014 when the cev would be available us astronauts would have to rely on russia to travel to and from iss cost and other issues initially the president and nasa did not provide cost estimates for the vision only budget estimates for fy2005fy2009 and budget chart the sand chart see below extending to fy2020 in late february 2004 however nasa released cost estimate for landing crew on the moon in 2020 64 billion fy2003 dollars 24 billion fy20042020 to build and operate the crew exploration vehicle and 40 billion fy20112020 to build the lunar lander portion of that vehicle new launch vehicle and operations the estimate does not include the cost of robotic missions an estimate for sending astronauts to mars was not provided the president plans to fund the vision by redirecting most of the needed funding from other nasa activities nasa budget chart dubbed the sand chart and available at httpwwwnasagovpdf54873main_budget_chart_14jan04pdf covering fy20042020 shows nasa budget that increases 5 in fy2005 2007 less than 1 in fy20082009 and is roughly level with inflation beyond fy2009 nasa says the intent of the chart is to demonstrate there is balloon in funding past fy2009 the total amount of funding represented in the chart appears to be 150170 billion nasa explains that the fy2005 budget request and its projections through fy2009 include an additional 126 billion for the vision however only 1 billion is new crs5 money the other 116 billion is redirected from other nasa programs leading some to question whether it is an addition redirecting most of the funding from other nasa activities may quell concerns about rising deficits and neglecting other national priorities in order to fund the vision but it subjects the plan to criticism that total agency projected funding level is insufficient and that the plan will preclude other nasa activities mr okeefe says that the schedule will be allowed to slip rather than increasing the budget by agreeing to take most of the funding from other nasa activities nasa has opened the door to questions about the value of those activities even if the vision is not adopted if congress and the public are not persuaded to embark upon the vision what direction should nasa be given for the future is it reasonable to assume that the proposed 116 billion in cuts can be made in any case should us participation in the iss program continue under the vision the only apparent reasons for us involvement in iss are fulfilling its commitments to the other partners and performing research associated with the presidents goals if the latter rationale is eliminated are the international commitments sufficient to warrant spending 67 billion 24 billion for the space station and 43 billion for the shuttle in fy2005 alone are they worth the risk to astronaut lives inherent in human space flight or are there other reasons that us httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21744 taxpayers may wish to continue the human space flight program such as its oftcited value in demonstrating us technological leadership stimulating children to study math and science or satisfying an intangible desire written in the human heart as stated by president bush following the columbia accident fy2005 budget request nasa chart identifies 45 billion of the agencys fy2005 162 billion request as exploration specific but that does not include the space shuttle and space station programs which are related to it among the exploration specific projects are 428 million for project prometheus to design nuclear power and propulsion systems 428 million for the crew exploration vehicle cev to take astronauts to the moon 115 million for technology maturation and 70 million for robotic lunar probes as precursors to human missions congressional action the house appropriations committee cut 230 million from prometheus all of the funds for the cev shown as 438 million in committee documents but as 428 million in nasas budget request and 30 million from technology maturation related projects in other parts of nasa that were cut include 124 million of the 125 million for scientific instruments to be carried aboard jimo all 70 million for robotic lunar probes 103 million from the 309 million for bioastronautics research 190 million of the 19 billion for iss construction and operations including 70 million of the 140 million for iss crewcargo services to fund alternatives to the space shuttle the senate appropriations committee cut 260 million from the iss including all 140 million for iss crewcargo 160 million from cev 50 million from lunar probes and 50 million from planning for future mars probes both committees expressed support for the vision but cited the constrained budgetary climate as factor in their decisions in pl 108447 conferees did not identify funding levels for any of the programs listed above giving nasa latitude to decide those funding levels the conferees noted that they were providing substantial funding for the vision but to date there has been substantive congressional action endorsing the initiative they called upon the appropriate authorizing committees to provide guidance and expressed other concerns crs6 hubble space telescope planned shuttle mission to service the hubble space telescope was cancelled primarily for safety reasons in the wake of the columbia accident for more information see crs report rs21767 nasa now intends to proceed with design of robotic servicing mission to hubble and is also considering other options nasa administrator okeefe has been quoted as estimating the cost of robotic servicing at between 1 billion and 16 billion cost estimates are still imprecise because many technical issues remain to be resolved the fy2005 budget request did not include funds for this mission because the decision had not yet been made to proceed with design the senate appropriations committee provided 300 million in emergency funds for hubble servicing mission in its markup of the fy2005 vahudia appropriations bill s 2825 100 million in the exploration capabilities account and 200 million in the exploration science and aeronautics account the conference report on the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act hr 4818 provided 291 million for hubble servicing mission on december 8 2004 national academy of sciences report found that robotic servicing would be unlikely to succeed and recommended proceeding with shuttle servicing mission after all httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21744 aeronautics congress has expressed concern about constraints in nasas funding for aeronautics rd for several years the need to reprioritize nasa spending in light of president bushs vision for space exploration may exacerbate those concerns aeronautics advocates decry multiyear slide in funding although this trend has been difficult to track recently because of changes in how nasa presents its annual budget aeronautics rd at nasa was cut by about onethird in the late 1990s with the termination of programs in highspeed research and advanced subsonic technology nasas aeronautics activities have been restructured several times including the august 2004 reorganization noted above critics have argued for several years that nasa lacks clear vision of its goals and direction in aeronautics despite the february 2001 nasa aeronautics blueprint httpwwwaerospacenasagovaboutustfaero_blueprintcoverhtml and further recommendations by the congressionally established commission on the future of the united states aerospace industry httpwwwitadocgovtdaerospace aerospacecommissionaerospacecommissionhtm and the national research council httpbooksnapeduhtmlatp0309091195pdf the fy2005 request for aeronautics was 919 million reduction of 11 from fy2004 most of the reduction came from eliminating funds for items added at congressional direction in fy2004 other changes included 7 million increase for aircraft noise reduction and 15 million to fund rotorcraft research the house appropriations committee directed nasa to develop prioritized set of aeronautics goals through 2020 along with associated annual funding requirements and recommended increases for 24 specific projects totaling 429 million the senate appropriations committee provided 25 million to continue research on hypersonic engine technologies and recommended increases for 17 specific projects totaling 338 million the conference report on the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act contained the house language on prioritized goals and provided 25 million for continued design work on the hypersonic x43c aircraft it also expressed concern about the impact of fullcost accounting on the operation of nasas wind tunnels and provided increases for 22 specific projects totaling 428 million
