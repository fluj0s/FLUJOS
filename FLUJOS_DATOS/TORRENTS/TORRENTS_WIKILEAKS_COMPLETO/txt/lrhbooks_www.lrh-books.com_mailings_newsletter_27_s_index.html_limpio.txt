bridge publications inc newsletter date the undoing of the black enchantment well thats what has happened approximately to this degree black enchantment has obviously been laid across man who natively has every potential for good for constructive action but how would you keep people from realizing it youd divide them within themselves you would teach them that they hadcould know only law that they were incapable of assuming full responsibility that they were not to meet in groups or perform various actions and that they could not unite in single effort forward toward the conquest of the material universe and that was what we were told evidently and man has been living up to it very well ever since here was your fear of death here was your shutoff of knowledge of past lives here is your fear and here is incompetence oddly enough evidently the only reason i went on and invented dianetics was because to get they had to pull out of the brush with both feet flailing and my intention as i went into it was something quite beyond them and that is someday ill get even with you bastards and find out and the rest of the people youre doing this to are going to be undone and evidently this is almost very close to mission accomplished l ron hubbard excerpted from the scientology milestone one lectures before time and before earth an article by l ron hubbard from the scientology milestone one lectures well i studied and i thought and i studied and i thought and figured and figured and you know the first thing i knew i saw the machine dive on before time it says before time has anything ever happened before timewondering whether or not somebody might not be preaberrated and the machine just started going crazy before time before time did something happen before time did somebody aberrate us before time and all of sudden you get this horrible picture this horrible idea of maybe this is hell and once we lived in heaven and somebody came along and picked us up and said mmm youre badun took us before tribunal or council and then dumped us on the chute and we arrived here on earth crash well this is not very solid but the lady went off the top of the dial on running the first part of it the first time ive ever seen anybody go off psychometer all the way up off the top and we only ran just little bit of it and then i tailormade the idea thinking that this was all by counterthought in some fashiondone by counterthought in some weird way i figuredall of sudden realized we had the handbook for preclears and there had map its from notknow to know its from effect to cause in other words if we run the cycle backwards we will run time in reverse therefore regret will vanish off notknowing and person would theoretically go through this incident from notknowing to knowing notknowing to knowing notknowing to knowing and pretty soon would get into the state of knowing running this incident fascinating ahha after i ran it for while experimented with it bit more located it in other people and ran into something i had known of in mysticismthe third eye this eye of the soul the jewel eye so forth lot of complimentary things about this and then suddenly located circuits the second i located this i located circuits what are circuits circuits are divisions of your own mind which seem to make up other personalities and these other personalities affect you and argue with you and so forth and here was brandnew therapy the jewel soul what you did was taken the youngest circuitthat is the last one closest to present timeand find out which circuit back of that had set it up and you went back through about four circuits and you blew out those four incidents and you would turn on this eye only one thing wrong with itthe eye turned out to be an engram get this the jewel soul the soul of souls the supervaluable entity turned out to be about the most lousy stinking trick ever done on the human race its manic of sorts once upon time fellow by the name of henry ford said undoubtedly lying under the seas of the world are railroad tracks rusting away the forgotten and hidden relic of former great civilizations mhhm i dont know about atlantis i havent been therenot lately now this was very interesting that we all of sudden began to turn up with information which was not bt but bebefore earth but that could also be merely before this civilization if you want it to be that way if you wanted to make it that way and we really started localizing this stuff it had on it thought emotion and effort and it is simply manic which degrades and its laid in on pattern the supersonic sound well i guess if you were civilized people and you kept being hit by the barbarians and your patrols kept getting cut down and so forth youd eventually do something about it too particularly if you had supersonic sound and you knew how to lay in an engram even if you didnt know how to pick one up when did it happen maybe million years ago i cant get proper estimate on it in terms of time but its some such order of magnitude what were we and who were we well they did nice thorough job they hit you in the middle of the head with supersonic pellet and they said this would make you good and happy and cheerful and honorable and of course it took you way down the tone scale its the supersonic equivalent of prefrontal lobotomy and then they hit you in the stomach to produce anxiety sound did it with sound wonderful gimmick and is that stuff sticky and id run into this somatic on preclears before and i thought it was just board like board had been pushed up againstthe fellow had been squashed and it would never release the way you release it is get it as sound get it as vibration and try to keep it from vibrating and all of sudden the thing will start blowing out turn on the eye try to keep it from vibrating youll get the rest of it itll take quite while to do but you can feel yourself go down tone scale as this stuff hits you who did it why im sure i dont knowyetas completely as i might but boy id sure like to find some of those guys if this were just found in one person here and there this would be one thing but it isnt its pretty uniform and the availability of that eye to some degree establishes persons effort to get out of it you see when youre yourself youd have that well thatd be pretty bad because youd be half asleep or threequarters asleep when youre running past deaths what were you running into you were running into this thing now im talking to you about research line as sober and as consistent as any research line was ever conducted relentless searcha very relentless searchto find the wild variable you followed all the laws you knew about thought all the laws you knew about mind and it didnt quite turn out right there was something there somebody was stealing the second apple what was it well this was it now you all look very grim laughter when you get around to this thing theres real honesttogoodness terror in it its practically all the terror there is on case its the anxiety stomach its your fear of arrest its your fear of being mauled around its your unwillingness to be and its alsogod help us allthe installed circuits they put man on one side and woman on the other side and every time youve been jealous every time youve been upset one of these things has gone into restimulation and come back and kicked you aw what dirty trick now of course this has lasted for long time the circuitry i wouldnt dare tell you about any part of this and so excite your incredulity unless i could show it to you in processing and unless it was very very fast route out and its very fast route it takes quite while to coax preclear sometimes into running it and to get out all of its manifestations and to get his sonic on full in it and to run all the columns backwards and forwards until person does get up to know but every time in the past when you tried to say i know youve come up there and this confounded incident would kick in and say you dont and down youd go every time you tried to say i am cause i amount to something im important this incident would kick in and say youre slave and in addition to that circuitry setups they gave you somebody to walk through life with you and keep you on the straight and narrow also to obey their laws and like them and to stop shooting their patrols to pieces the advanced society evidently this was an advanced society which moved ina society possibly not even as advanced as ourswhich moved in suddenly on almost cave society almost stone age maybe it was planets that got crossed or maybe it was merely continents that got crossed people would hardly know that but whatever it was here was retarded society being suddenly hit here was the story of the polynesians here is the story of tahiti barbaric but very happy very dignified very cheerful honorable people that suddenly objected to someone coming in and say were going to make your laws now and you stack that wood over there and draw that water and so you said noo workers of the world will now arise and you started cutting them to pieces and they objected to this naturally electronics so they evidently cooked upmaybe they did it this way some places they might have done it one way some places they did it another way they might have cooked up big story about this is the great thing to do this is the stuff were gods and were really going to make you into gods and pow well fix you up bap turn on the sound actually the sound box theyve got runs with crank i dont think they even had electric motors but theres some sound like electricity in there the poor fellows who manage power stations ohhh i often wondered why they were so crazy i often wondered why when you got into the navy and youd listen to ships generators pulse pulse pulse pulse pulse all night long in the air vents and so forth that youd eventually get kind of groggy and youd wonder what was wrong with your headyou have headache and youd notice this amongst the men well i had an electric typewriter and it sat there and it whined and whined and roared and roared and roared and it put years and millions of words worth of lock on top of this with all the postulates in it its made the case kind of rough but it was this one now separating it out and getting the locks of electric motors and that sort of thing off of it we were starting to whip ourselves thats why we started to go down the line in hurry we had choice then we were either them and vicious mean and degrading or ourselves with somatics from that point on that was our choice either to be mean wicked ornery vicious degrading your fellow man but very thorough and ride over everything about 18 or 15 or if you wanted to be good decent noble or upstandinglung somatics nose somatics bad eyes headaches and general frailty because youd have to take one or the other therefore anybody confronted by somebody being good you see if person is confronted by somebody being very good and very honorable the valence is stolen to some degree you see and they have tendency to flick into this other valence and when youve got somebody being very mean and very wicked you have tendency to flick over into the good valence and this has been this endless drama going on on on hrrrr its easy to run this incidentdo it with thought emotion and effort very simple to run it whats difficult to run is is this supersonic is so solid that you have to realize that it was such kind of wave in order to run it at all before that it wouldnt budge because you couldnt get preclear to run vibration he thought he was just being pushed and as push it didnt go away and it hit there and it hit there and it hit there somatics are with it and so on person kind offeel awful crippled up running this thing how many hours it takes the average person to run this i dont know but i know that running it runs you off the top of the scale l ron hubbard from the
