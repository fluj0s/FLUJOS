6111c22 shspec83 reading the emeter it is horrible fact that the request for the extraordinary solution if prompted always by the gross auditing error your sense of propriety may be so violated by the magnitude of the outness that you dont see it for instance the auditor runs session with the emeter broken or sessions are given at all not reading the emeter is gae the early emeter 1951 wouldnt read because the electrodes were little quarterinch bars soup cans were substituted and then you could see that something was going on british meters started being supplied with aluminum pipes they arent as good as cans for can squeeze the meter was first used for dating incidents on the track ron found that the onthebeach incidents gave 16dial drops at that point he still thought that the higher the ta went the clearer the person was for the first five months lrh had reality on the meter and would take his own judgment instead of the meters every time for the next three years lrh had to get used to every new meter they were variable that is why they are made standard now so you dont have to learn each ones idiosyncracies one reason why emeters werent used in the mid 50s was that they got too complicated don breeding joe wallace and jim pinkham eventually in the late 50s designed one for lrh in washington with simple basic circuit design they were transportable unlike the volney matthison models which were mains meters with high current that could if malfunctioning deliver potent electric shock some pcs now can feel current from battery meter they are just hypersensitive to electricity the british mark iv is now standard its behavior is very similar to the american meter the tone arm was originally believed to indicate the tone of the pc on the tone scale hence the name tone arm its really complete misnomer lie detector operators go wholly on body motion plus respiration pulse and blood pressure since the emeter can measure the mental reaction of the pc eg as given in the instant read it is well in advance of lie detectors also unlike polygraph the emeter is pt machine furthermore there are only two hundred people out of thousands trained in the use of polygraphs who can really use them the emeter is present time machine you use its information as you get it not after some comm lag youve got to catch the read when it happens youve got to know that in checking ruds stop on the rise is read and that its got to be an instant read it registers the moment the sense gets to the pc if the pc is trying to sell you on something the read will be latent because the pc takes an instant to get it and respond but the reactive mind doesnt it has time in it and reads instantly you have to be satisfied that the meter works get to where it is an unimportant albeit vital part of the session and you can have your attention on the pc instead of the meter
