budgetary problems for the marshals judiciary security program because the usms must serve both the executive and judicial branches report that reviewed the protection provide d to the federal

providing an adequate numbe r of deputy us marshals dusms for judicial security duties17 there is federal funding available for state courts however with respect to judicial security in state c ourts state courts cannot dir ectly apply for such funding18 they have to request such funding from the states executive branch which means that state courts must comp ete with executive branch ag encies for federal funding this has proven to be barrier for state courts in directly accessing federal funding for court security measures witness intimidation witness intimidation reduces the likelihood that citizens will engage with the criminal justice system which could deprive police and prosecutors of critical evidence19 witness intimidation can reduce public confidence in the criminal justice system and it can create the perception that the criminal justice system cannot protect citizens witness intimidation can be the result of actual or perceived threats from an offender or his associates but it can so be the result of more general community norms that discourage residents from coope rating with the police or prosecutors witnesses can be intimidated in many ways

violence actual physical violence property damage or other threats such as challenges to child custody or immigration status20 threats are more common than actual physical violence but they can be just as effective in deterring cooperation with po lice and prosecutors some witnesses might experience one incident of intimidation but others might experience an escalating series of threats and actions that become more violent over time other witnesses might not experience intimidation directly but they believe that they will receive retaliation if they cooperate with law enforcement according to community oriented po licing services cops report small scale studies and surveys of police and prosecutors suggest that witness intimidation is pervasive and increasing21 the report cites study of witnesses appearing in criminal courts in bronx county new yor k which shows that 36 of witnesses had been directly threatened and of those that were not directly threatened 57 feared reprisals the report also states that prosecutors believe that witness intimidation plays role in 75100 of viol ent crime committed in gangcontrolled neighborhoods but it might be less of f actor in neighborhoods not dominated by gangs and drugs the report also notes that it is hard to quantify the prevalence of witness intimidation for several reasons some reasons include crime is underreported for reas ons not related to witness intimidation in cases where witness is successfully intimidated neither thecrime nor the intimidation is reported victimization surveys and interviews with witnesses whose cases goto trial only capture information from subset of witnesses and there has been empirical research on the scope or specificcharacteristics of communitywide intimidation report from the national center for victims of crime presented data from surveys and interviews of youths in massachusetts 22 the youth surveys and interviews focused on different topics related to gangs and
