supplement domestic gas production recen t actions by congress and federal agencies have promoted greater lng supp lies by changing regulations clarifying siting authorities and streamlining the pproval process for lng import terminals were these policies to continue and ga s demand to grow lng might account for as much as 21 of us gas supply by 2025 up from 3 in 2005 congress is examining the infrastructure and market implications of greater us lng demand there are concerns about how lng capacity additions would be integrated into the nations gas infrastructure meetin g projected us lng demand would require six to ten new import terminals in addition to expanding existing terminals twelve new terminals most in the gulf of mexico are approved but public opposition has blocked many neartomarket terminals which might save billions of dollars in gas transportation costs new lng terminals can also require more regional pipeline capacity to transport their supply although this capacity may not be available in key markets securing lng infrastructure against accidents and terrorist attacks may also be challenge to public agencies since import terminals process large volumes of lng breakdown at any facility has the potential to bottleneck supply lngs effectiveness in moderating us gas prices will be determined by global lng supply the development of spot market potential market concentration and evolving trading relationships there app ears to be sufficient interest among lng exporters to meet global demand projecti ons although some new export projects may not be built an lng spot market which may help us companies import lng costeffectively is also growing alt hough some analysts believe cartel may influence the future lng market the potential effectiveness of such cartel is unclear whether exporters cooperate or not an integrated global lng market may change trading and political relationships individual country energy polices may affect lng price and

expect lng to account for 12 to 21 of total us gas supply by 2025 up from approximately 3 in 2005 if these forecasts are correct us natu ral gas consumers will become increasingly dependent upon lng

was 22 trillion cubic feet tcf accounting for 23 of total us energy consumption6 until recently nearly all us natural gas was supplied from north american wells and transported through the continents vast pipeline network to regional markets in 2003 however due to constraints in north american natural gas production the united states sharply increased imports of natural gas from overseas in the form of liquefied natural gas lng while absolute levels remain limited today growth in lng imports to the united states is expected by manyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32386crs3 7 energy information

is lng when natural gas is cooled to temp eratures below minus 260f it condenses into liquefied natural gas or lng as liquid natural gas occupies only 1600th the volume of its gaseous state so it is stored more effectively in limited space and is more readily transported by tanker shi p typical tanker for example can carry 138000 cubic meters of lng enough to s upply the daily energy needs of over 10 million homes7 when lng is warmed it regasifies and can be used for the same purposes as conven tional natural gas the physical infrastructure of lng includes several interconnected elements as illustrated in figure 1 in producing countries natural gas is extracted from gas fields and transported by pipeline to centr liquefaction plants where it is converted to lng and stored liquefaction plants are built at marine terminals so the lng can be loaded onto special tanker ships for tran sport overseas tankers deliver their lng cargo to import terminals in other countries where the lng can again be stored or regasified and injected into pipeline systems for delivery to end users this lng infrastructure requires large capital investment s in addition to gas field development costs new liquefaction plant costs pproximately 23 b illion and an import terminal costs 500 million to 1 billion one lng tanker costs 150200 million8 source oil gas journal nov 10 2003 p64 due to the high capital costs of lng infrastructure lng trade has traditionally relied upon longterm fuel purchase agreements in order to secure project financing for the entire supply chain of over 160 ma jor lng

produced natural gas to supplement pipeline supplies during times of high gas demand in th 1970s lng imports began to supplement domestic gas production between 1971 and 1981 developers built four us

states demand for lng has been increasing dramatically since 2003 this growth in lng demand has been occurring in part because north american natural gas production appears to have plateaued so it has not been able to keep pace with growth in demand as result us natural gas prices have become higher and more volatile as figure 2 shows gas prices at the wellhead have risen from around 200mcf through

of new onshore lng facilities and interstate gas pipelines and also regulates prices for interstate gas transmission27 in december 2002 the ferc exempted lng import ter minals from rate regulation and open access requirements this regulatory action commonly called the hackberry decision allowed import terminal owners to set marketbased rates for terminal services and allowed terminal developers to secure proprietary terminal access for corporate affiliates with investments in lng supply28 these regulatory changes greatly reduced investment uncertainty for potential lng developers and assured access to their own terminals29 in february 2004 ferc streamlined the lng siting approval process through an agreement with the us coast guard and the department of trans portation to coordinate

market was priced well below conventiona l gas supplies transported by pipeline from the gulf of mexico37 if new terminals are built far from key consumer markets delivered gas might cost more than if lng terminals were built locally as of january 2006 federal agencies have approved only one new lng import terminal outside the gulf of mexico in massachusetts such neartomarket terminal proposals

terminals may affect pipeline infrastructure in two ways first new terminals and terminal expansions must be connected to the interstate pipeline network through sufficient takeaway pipeline capacity

beginnings gas is expensive in boston fo r example because th ere are few pipelines supplying the region transportation constr aint that would not be alleviated by pumping more gas into pipelines in the gulf of mexico as one senior ferc official has reportedly remarked putting more and more lng plants in the gulf while it may be good for the overall gas supply situa tion in this country wont do whole lot for the regional gas needs of new england47 it is not clear therefore whether adding lng supplies to traditional produc ing regions would be less costly for consumers than building inmarket terminals and adding to regional pipeline capacity in addition to requiring sufficient takeaway capacity lng terminals likely will influence pipeline network flows majo r us pipeline systems were designed primarily to move gas from traditiona l producing regions eg gulf coast appalachia western canada to consuming regions eg northeast midwest if most new lng capacity is built in the gulf of mexico then traditional gas flows would be maintained if number of new terminals are built in consuming regions however they may change historical gas transportation patterns potentially displacing traditional production and changi ng infrastructure constraints among other potential impacts some analysts have suggested that new lng terminals will result in less market leverage and probably lower cash flows for some existing pipelines because new lng supplies may be able to reach consumer markets by alternate routes48 predicting the overall effects of long term changes in gas flows is complex problem although such change s may have important implications for current pipeline utilization and for future pipeline investments interchangeability lng consists primarily of methane but it may also

cause problems when imported into the united states because it may damage pipelines and natural gasfired equipment eg electric power turbines which are designed for lower heat content there are number of potential technical solutions to lng interchangeability problems such as stri pping out the nonmethane fuels blending the lng with domestic natural gas and diluting the lng with nitrogen49 these
