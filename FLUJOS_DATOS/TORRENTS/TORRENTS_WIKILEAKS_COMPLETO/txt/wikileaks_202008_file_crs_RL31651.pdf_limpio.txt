constitution prohibits in the absence of congressional au thorization over this period there has been continuing interest in knowing how much waste is being shipped across state lines for disposal and what states might be affected by proposed legislation this report provides data useful in addressing these questions total interstate waste shipments continue to rise due to the closure of older local landfills and the increasing consolidation of the waste management industry about 35 million tons of municipal solid waste cr ossed state lines for disposal in 2001 an increase of 94 over 2000 waste imports have grown each year since crs began tracking them in the early 1990s and now represent 216 of all municipal solid waste disposed at landfills and waste combustion facilities in the last eight years reported imports have increased 141 pennsylvania remains by far the largest waste importer the state received 107 million tons of municipal solid waste and 19 million tons of other non hazardous waste from out of state in 2001 mo re than 30 of the national total for interstate shipments virginia the s econd largest importer received 41 million tons 62 less than the amount received by penns ylvania michigan the third largest importer imported 36 million t ons of msw in fiscal year 2001 waste imports to michigan have doubled since 1999 twentythr ee states had increased imports in the current report the largest increases occurri ng in pennsylvania and michigan in all eight states reported imports that exceeded one million tons while waste imports increased overa ll several states including new hampshire south carolina connecticut arizona and washingt on reported sharp declines in waste imports new york remains the largest exporter of waste with new jersey and illinois in

congress the senate passed s 534 the b ill would have granted states authority to restrict new shipments of municipal solid waste from out of state if requested by an affected local government in the 103rd congress both the house and senate passed interstate waste legislation hr 4779 and s 2345 but lack of agreement on common language prevented enactment for discussion of the issues addressed in

information on interstate shipment of municipal solid waste concerned about increased wa ste imports some stat have attempted to regulate this commerce federal courts however have declared these state restrictions unconstitutional if states are to have such authority congressional action is required since the late 1980s congress has cons idered but not enacted numerous bills that would grant such authority1 over this period there has been continuing interest in knowing how much waste is bein g shipped across state lines for disposal and what states might be affected by pr oposed legislation th is report provides data useful in addressing these questions it updates information provided in earlier crs reports2 the report presents information gather ed through telephone contacts with solid waste officials in the 50 states the distri ct of columbia and the canadian province of ontario the data obtained from these c ontacts are summarized in tables 1 2 and 3 and figures 1 and 2 table 4 presents additional information including the names and telephone numbers of state contacts not all states require reporting of wast imports and very few track exports so the available data are incomplete and in some cases represent estimates rather than actual measurements in number of cases faced with conflicting reports from exporters and importers or quantitative data at all we provided

differentiate msw from other nonhazardous waste imports we compared total msw imports to epas national estimate of msw generation 2319 million tons in the latest available year 2000 statereported waste generation summarized in biocycle magazines annual survey is substantially higher 409 million tons in 2000 but is likely to include other nonhazardous waste provided it was disposed at msw facilities for statereported data see nora goldstein and celeste madtes the state of garbage in america biocycle december 2001 p 42 4 much of the waste destined for recycling may also have crossed state lines but waste destined for recycling does not carry the same s tigma as that sent for disposal and recycling facilities do not generally require permits by state agencies thus amounts shipped across state lines for recycling cannot generally be tracked by the solid waste agenciesfifteen of the states provided data fo r period other than calendar year 2001 either their latest fiscal year or different calendar year this adds another layer of imprecision we combined data for what ever was the latest reporting period even though in these 15 cases this meant comb ining data from diffe rent time periods each of the exceptions from the 2001 reporting period is noted in the appropriate tables but the reader should perhaps keep in mind that many of the totals reported here are our best estimate rather than precise figures total shipments the data show that total interstate waste shipments continue to rise imports in the current survey totaled 350 million tons 151 of the 2319 million tons of municipal solid waste generated in the united states3 of municipal waste disposed as opposed to recycled or composted the percentage is even higher epa estimates that 699 million tons of municipal solid wa ste were recycled or composted in 2000 leaving 162 million tons to be disposed in ndfills or incinerators of this amount 216 crossed state lines for disposal4 between crss year 2001 report reportin g largely 1999 and 2000 data and the current survey reporting generally 2001 da ta imports increased 30 million tons or 94 since 1993 reported imports have risen 141 from 145 million tons in 1993 to 350 million tons in the current survey states reporting increased imports twentythree states had increased imports of municipal waste in 2001 with the largest increases occurring in pennsylvania and michigan the increases in these two states 09 million tons and 075 million tons re spectively total 55 of the entire increase nationally the preponderance of these two states in the 2001 waste statistics demonstrates another element of the emerging picture of interstate waste shipment 52 of total municipal waste imports are disposed in just three states pennsylvania virginia and michigan pennsylvania continues to be the larges t waste importer by far disposal facilities in the state received 107 million t ons of msw and 19 million tons of otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31651crs8 nonhazardous waste from out of state in 2001 the amounts represented half of all solid waste disposed in the state and more than 30 of the national total for interstate shipments after pennsylvania virginia is the rgest waste importer with 41 million tons of msw imports and 720782 tons of other nonhazardous waste despite predictions that virginia would receive increased im ports as new yorks fresh kills landfill phased out operations waste imports to virg inia have remained roughly the same in the 19982001 period instead new yorks in creased exports appear to have gone primarily to pennsylva nia and new jersey michigan the third largest waste im porter in 2001 saw outofstate waste disposed in the state grow by more than 750000 tons that year substantial amounts of waste come to michigan from illinois indiana and other neighboring states but the biggest source accounting for about half of michigans outofstate waste is ontario canada ontarios waste shipments are growing as the toronto area awards new contracts for waste disposal and closes its two remaining landfills at the beginning of 1999 the toronto area was ge nerating about 28 million tons of waste annually of which about 700000 tons were shipped to michigan by early 2003 however there will be virtually local disposal capacity barring unforeseen developments most of this waste is expect ed to be sent to michigan for disposal in other highlights eight states reported imports ex ceeding one million tons per year in the latest year figure unchanged from our two previous surveys which reported 1998 and 2000 data another 21 states had imports exceeding 100000 tons for the fourth year in row new jersey is on the list of major importers with 892394 tons of msw imports in 2000 2001 data were not yet available the state is still major exporter of waste as well receiving states estimate ne w jerseys exports at more than 54 million tons in 2001 but the absence of flow control local government requirements that waste within their jurisdiction be disposed at local facilities which were overturned by the courts in the mid1990s has led wastetoene rgy facilities in new jersey to search for waste to replace local waste now being disposed elsewhere as result large amounts of waste are entering new jersey from new york new york the nations largest wa ste exporter also saw rapid growth in waste imports in 2000 and 2001 the state imported 839700 tons of waste in 2001 an increase from 539000 tons in our previous survey other states reporting major increases in imports were ohio georgia and new mexico oh io has had nearly 900000 ton increase in msw imports be tween 1998 nd 2001 georgiahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31651crs9 5 transfer stations receive waste from collec tion trucks compact it bale it and load it on larger trucks for disposal elsewhereexperienced nearly 750000 ton increase over the same three years and new mexico had 500000 ton increase in the last two years oklahoma made its first appearance on our list of importers the state reported that in septem ber 2001 it began receiving 1500 tons per day of waste from wichita kans as based on this information we estimate imports at 125000 tons for the year 2001 this amount will increase to around 400000 tons in 2002 although there are comprehens ive data imports to transfer stations5 are political issue in some locations transfer stations are generally located in urban areas and are subject to less stringent regulation than disposal facilities heavy truck traffic and odors have aroused concerns in some neighboring communities connecticut rhode island and the district of columbia report significant amounts of outofsta waste imported to transfer stations then exported to other stat for disposal new york citys plan to export waste to transfer stations in new jersey raised substantial controversy before being rescinded states reporting decreased imports while waste imports increased overall 14 states reported declines in waste imports in many cases the declines were small but five of the states new hampshire south carolina connecticut arizona and washington had declines exceeding 100000 tons most notable were south carolina where imports declined by about onethird in the last two ears simultaneous with major increase in georgias imports connecticut where im ports declined by twothirds and new hampshire where new per mit conditions imposed on the states largest landfill have contributed to statewide reduction in imports of more than 560000 tons since 1997 major exporters six states new york new jersey illinois maryland missouri and massachusetts each exported more than one million tons of waste to facilities in other states in the latest reporting period and ten other states and the district of columbia exported more than half million tons the canadian province of ontario also exported substantial amount of municipal waste about 2000000 tons most of it to michigan new york new jersey illinois and ma ryland remained the largest exporters together these four states accounted for 52 of waste exports nationally new yorks exports rose to 7493130 tons in 2001 according to seven receiving states an increas of nearly 700000 tons over the previous year thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31651crs10 6 illinois like most states does not report waste exports this export estimate was derived from data provided by neighboring statesincrease reflects the march 2001 closure of new york citys fresh kills landfill the citys last disposal facility new jerseys estimated exports 54 million t ons have also grown dramatically in new jerseys case the cause of increased exports is the overturning of the states flow control law which until 1997 directed much of the states waste to highcost local facilities for disposal the state law was overturned and the state exhausted its appeals in october 1997 exports have ce grown by about 3 million tons per year illinois exports at 31 million tons declin ed slightly in 2001 after several years of rapid growth despite the decline the states exports in 2001 were still three and half times the amount reported for 19956 most of the exports originate in cook county chicago and its suburbs which has relative shortage of disposal capacity illinois as whole reported more th an doubling of landfill capacity between 1995 and 2000 but chicago is located near the border of both indiana and wisconsin so increases in capacity elsewhere in illinois may not affect disposal decisions in the metropolitan area in all 13 states and ontario canada increased waste exports by more than 100000 tons each in the period while 4 states had major decreases in addition to the exporters discussed above pennsylva nia and maryland showed the largest increases although in pennsylvanias case the increased exports were dwarfed by additional waste entering the state among states showing decreased exports california showed the largest dr op reduction of nearly 450000 tons net imports and exports table 3 combines import and export data to rank the states by net amounts imported or exported the table shows that 25 states were net importers 22 plus the district of columbia were net exporters thirtynine of the 50 states had net imports or exports exceeding 100000 tons in the reporting period 23 exceeded 500000 tons perhaps most interesting given the tendency to identify states as either exporters or importers 17 states both exported and imported in excess of 100000 tons of municipal solid waste several factors are at work here in the larger states there are sometimes differences in available disposal capacity in different regions within the state areas without capacity may be closer to landfi lls or may at least find cheaper disposal options in other states g ood example is illinois the chicago area which is close to two other states exports significant am ounts of waste out of state downstate however illinois has substa ntial available landfill cap acity and imports about 1 million tons annually from st louis and other locations in missouri as noted earlier the movement of waste also represents the growing regionalization and consolidation of the wa ste industry in 2001 the three largest firms waste management allied waste and republic services accounted for
