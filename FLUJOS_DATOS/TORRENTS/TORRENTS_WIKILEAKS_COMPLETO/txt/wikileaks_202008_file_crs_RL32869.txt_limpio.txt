president submitted his fy2006 budget to the congress on february 7 2005 requesting 291 billion for hud cut of 28 billion or 9 from fy2005 appropriations of 319 billion the most controversial aspect of the budget was the proposed elimination of the cdbg and related programs at hud and their replacement with new program at the department of commerce crs3 introduction to the department of housing and urban development hud most of the appropriations for the department of housing and urban development hud are designed to address housing problems faced by households with very low incomes or other special housing needs these include programs of rental assistance for the poor elderly or disabled housing assistance for persons with aids and shelter for those who are homeless the two large hud block grant programs home and cdbg also help communities finance variety of activities to address the housing and community development needs of disadvantaged populations in recent years hud has focused more attention on efforts to increase the homeownership rates for lowerincome and minority households at the end of the fourth quarter of 2004 the national homeownership rate stood at 692 while the rates for white black and hispanic households stood at 762 491 and 489 respectively huds federal housing administration fha insures mortgages made by lenders to lower income homebuyers many

tenantbased rental assistance the section 8 program is really two programs tenantbased rental assistance commonly called vouchers and projectbased rental assistance see below the two programs were previously funded under joint account called the housing certificate fund which was split into the two components by the fy2005 appropriations law see crs report rl32284 an overview of the section 8 housing program by maggie mccarty section 8 housing choice vouchers vouchers are portable federal subsidies that lowincome families use to reduce their housing costs in the private market hud currently funds over two million section 8 vouchers note that approximately 42 billion of the funds shown in the table below are provided in the form of an advance appropriation for the following year and each year approximately 42 billion is available from the previous year this advance funding structure had been used to provide funds to the public housing authorities phas that administer the voucher program in the months between the beginning of their fiscal years and the time the federal budget is enacted in final form which in recent years has generally lagged the federal fiscal year and often lagged the calendar year the fy2004 appropriations bill synchronized pha fiscal year start dates however this advanced funding structure has continued table 3 section 8 tenantbased rental

funds to be used to adjust the budgets of agencies that 1 apply for an adjustment because they had unusually low leasing levels during the mayjuly period that was the basis for fy2005 funding or 2

house 15 billion senate 21 final voucher renewals the most contentious aspect of the tenantbased assistance account is the renewal of existing vouchers congress has authorized the creation of more than 2 million vouchers over the history of the program and the funding for virtually all of them expires every year if family is using voucher to lease an apartment but funding is not sufficient to renew it then the family will lose its assistance and likely lose its current housing prior to fy2004 hud funded phas based on the number of vouchers they were using and the cost of those vouchers if costs went up or phas were able to use more of their vouchers they received additional funds to cover those costs in fy2005 at congresss direction hud funded phas based on the number of vouchers they were using and the cost of those vouchers in mayjuly 2004 plus inflation reduced by 4 to fit within the amount appropriated this new formula was designed to contain the growing cost of the program many phas and lowincome housing advocates opposed the new formula arguing that it left many agencies with inadequate funding to maintain their programs while it appears that few agencies were required to terminate assistance to families as result of budget shortages many agencies suspended the reissuance of vouchers when families left the program and undertook other administrative measures to cut costs the presidents fy2006 budget request included 141 billion to renew expiring voucher subsidies an increase of 5 from fy2005 it proposed distributing renewal funding to phas on prorata basis based on what they received last year plus an inflation adjustment and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated in addition to renewal funding the administration requested 45 million for central reserve fund to cover the cost of unforeseen exigencies experienced by phas such as natural disasters or significant changes in the economic condition of locality congress provided hud with central reserve account in fy2003 and fy2004 but not in fy2005 crs9 hr 3058 as it passed the house appropriations committee on june 21 2005 provided more than 300 million less for tenantbased assistance than the president requested but funded renewals at the presidents requested level during floor proceedings on june 30 2005 an amendment adding 100 million for tenantbased renewals was approved the increase was offset by decrease in funding for the working capital fund the bill proposed to distribute renewal funding using the same formula proposed by the president it would have permitted the secretary to set aside 45 million of renewal funding to adjust budgets that were adversely affected by the fy2005 funding formula due to high number of portability vouchers the senate version of hr 3058 would have funded renewals at the presidents requested level unlike the house bill and the presidents request the senate bill would not have funded agencies based on the funding they received in fy2005 plus inflation rather agencies would have received renewal funding based on their voucher costs and leasing over the past 12 months plus inflation and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated lowincome housing and pha groups advocated for this use of more recent data the senate bill would have provided the secretary with the authority to use up to 45 million to adjust pha budgets if they were adversely affected by the mayjuly formula either because those months were anomalous for the agency or because the agency faced high number of portability vouchers the final version of hr 3058 funds renewals at the same level proposed by the senate bill and the presidents request 100 million less than the housepassed level it adopted the renewal funding formula proposed by the president and included in the house bill for calendar year 2006 agencies will receive the amount of funds they were eligible to receive in 2005 plus inflation adjusted for tenant protection vouchers hope vi vouchers and projectbased reservations and reduced to fit within the appropriated amount the bill permits the secretary to set aside up to 45 million to 1 adjust the budgets of phas that apply for an adjustment because of temporarily low leasing during mayjuly 2004 and 2 adjust the budgets of phas that experienced significant increase in renewal costs as determined by the secretary due to unforeseen circumstances or portability vouchers administrative fees prior to fy2003 phas were paid fixed fee per voucher administered beginning in fy2003 at congresss direction hud changed the way it distributed administrative fees providing agencies with prorata share of the amount appropriated for administrative fees based on what they had received in the previous year the change was designed to contain the cost of administrative fees which were estimated to have grown to account for 10 of the cost of voucher the presidents fy2006 budget requested 13 billion for administrative fees an 8 increase over fy2005 and would have distributed the funds on prorata basis the house bill proposed 12 billion and also would have allocated the funds on prorata basis except for 25 million that the secretary could set aside to distribute to agencies in need of additional funds to administer their programs the bill also would have allowed the secretary to transfer up to 200 million from the tenantbased account to projectbased rental assistance which if done would have crs10 reduced the amount of administrative funds to well below the fy2005 level the senate bill would have funded administrative fees at the presidents requested level and distributed them on prorata basis the final version of hr 3058 provides 125 billion for administrative fees splitting the difference between the house and senate levels of that amount 10 million will be available for the secretary to allocate to agencies in need of extra money to run their programs and the remaining funds will be allocated on prorata basis based on last years distribution the bill does not include the 200 million transfer authority provided in the house bill tenant protection vouchers tenant protection vouchers are provided to families in variety of circumstances including families who are threatened with displacement because the contract on their assisted unit is ending projectbased section 8 for example families who are displaced from public housing due to demolition or disposition families in the witness protection program and families in the child welfare system the president requested an increase in funding for tenant protection vouchers of almost 120 for fy2006 the proposed increase was attributed partly to the needs of the hope vi program and partly to new rule that hud stated would be published in 2005 that would permit the secretary of hud to require the conversion of public housing to vouchers practice called mandatory conversion the report accompanying the housepassed version of hr 3058 expressed doubt that the mandatory conversion rule would be implemented before the end of fy2006 and therefore proposed to fund tenantprotection vouchers at roughly the same level as last year an increase of about 3 the senate version expressed the same doubt about the mandatory conversion rule and noted that for many of the units that would be subject to the rule hope vi remains viable option the senate recommended 192 million for tenant protection vouchers more than the house but less than the presidents request the final version of hr 3058 provided 180 million for tenant protection vouchers which is less than the presidents request and falls between the house and senateproposed levels rescission the presidents fy2006 budget requested that congress rescind 25 billion in unobligated balances from the tenantbased rental assistance account the request included provision stating that if sufficient funds were not available within the account the secretary could use funds from other accounts to meet the rescission target lowincome housing advocates stated concern that sufficient funds would not be available in the tenantbased rental assistance account and that other programs would be negatively affected by the rescission when questioned about the source of funds to meet the requested rescission in hearings before the senate appropriations committee on april 14 2005 the secretary indicated that he was not crs11 sure where the funds would come from and could not guarantee that they would not come from active programs1 the house bill proposed rescission level of 249 billion about 64 million less than the president proposed and included language permitting the secretary to use funds from other accounts as necessary the senate bill proposed notably lower rescission level and provision stating that if sufficient funds were not available within the section 8 tenantbased or projectbased account the secretary would be required to first take up to 10 from the hud salaries and expenses account and up to 10 from the office of management and budgets appropriation before taking funds from other hud programs the final version of hr 3058 rescinds 21 billion in unobligated funds from the section 8 accounts the language permits the secretary to use funds from other accounts if necessary but does not include the language proposed by the senate requiring reductions first from hud and ombs appropriations the accompanying conference report directs the secretary to report to the appropriations committee 30days before taking funds from other accounts voucher reform legislation beyond funding levels the fy2006 budget documents also stated that the president intends to introduce new proposal to reform the tenantbased voucher program one purpose for this reform proposal is to contain if not reduce the cost of the program according to the presidents budget summary section 8s program costs are cannibalizing every hud program at the same time waiting lists of families seeking housing continue to grow the congressional budget justifications state that this new proposal will provide additional flexibility to phas which will enable them to run their programs more effectively and efficiently and better respond to the current budgetbased funding structure in the program reform proposals were also submitted as part of the fy2004 and fy2005 budgets although congressional action was not taken on either the state and local housing flexibility act of 2005 was introduced in the senate on april 13 2005 s 771 and in the house on april 28 2005 hr 1999 it would replace the current voucher program with new program called the flexible voucher program which would have fewer rules and regulations than the current program would provide for greater discretion in administering the program for both the secretary of hud and for phas and lowincome housing advocates contend would also provide fewer resources and protections for very poor families for more information see crs report rl31930 section 8 housing choice voucher program funding and related issues by maggie mccarty emergency supplemental hurricane funding in october 2005 fema engaged hud in mission assignment to provide rental assistance to families that were unlikely to qualify for standard fema assistance specifically families that were receiving hud rental assistance or were homeless when the storm struck on december 30 2005 the president signed supplemental appropriations bill pl109 1 congressional quarterly congressional transcripts congressional hearings april 14 2005 senate appropriations subcommittee on transportation treasury the judiciary and housing and urban development holds hearing on fy2006 appropriations crs12 148 which transferred 390 million to hud from fema to provide this rental assistance directly hud has implemented the program as the disaster voucher program dvp and it is largely governed by section 8 voucher program rules although the secretary was given the authority to waive income eligibility and rent determination rules for more information on the role of the voucher program in response to the 2005 hurricanes see crs report rl33270 the section 8 housing voucher program reform proposals by maggie mccarty section 8 projectbased rental assistance this account provides funding to renew existing contracts between hud and private landlords providing subsidies to lowincome families that allow them to live in private market rental units but pay only 30 of their incomes toward rent projectbased section 8 differs from section 8 vouchers in that the subsidy is provided to specific unit of housing in which family can live rather than to family to then use to pay for the housing of their choice new contracts are entered into under this program the funding provided is used only to renew existing contracts and pay administrative costs this program was formerly funded with the section 8 tenantbased

contracts in fy2006 hud budget documents explained that the department planned to augment the renewal funding request with 622 million in funds recaptured from previous years and savings from program improvements the additional funds would have raised the program level to 56 billion an increase of 6 over the fy2005 program level the house version of hr 3058 proposed 17 million more for renewals than the president requested the bill would have permitted the secretary to transfer if necessary up to 200 million from the tenantbased rental assistance account to the crs13 projectbased account the senate version of hr 3058 proposed funding project based renewals at the presidents requested level and did not include the transfer language included in the house version the senate committee report raised concern that hud was not doing enough to encourage landlords in the projectbased section 8 program to renew their contracts and thus preserve the properties as assisted housing the senate bill proposed that the government accountability office gao assess huds efforts to preserve assisted housing the final version of hr 3058 adopts the housepassed funding level for projectbased renewals but does not include the transfer authority proposed by the house the bill does not include request for the gao report proposed by the senate but does direct the department to study and report back on the living conditions of residents in two developments in illinois contract administrators the presidents budget requested 46 increase in funding for contract administrators and stated that 185 million in unobligated balances would be used to augment the funding resulting in program level increase of 70 over fy2005 contract administrators are subcontracted by hud to manage the longterm section 8 contracts between hud and private owners of subsidized multifamily units hud continues to manage portion of the contracts however the department intends to transfer most if not all contracts to contract administrators in the future the fy2006 budget request includes an increase of 67 million to fund the transfer of additional contracts from hud to contract administrators further huds budget justifications state that the department intends to begin using contract administrators to manage rental assistance contracts outside of the section 8 program such as those entered into under the section 202 housing for the elderly program the budget documents note that 30 million would be used to fund these transfers the house senate and final versions of hr 3058 funded contract administrators at the presidents requested level and permitted the expansion of contract administrators to additional programs public housing programs public housing provides publicly owned and subsidized rental units for very lowincome families while new public housing developments have been built for many years except through the hope vi program which is discussed below congress continues

senate version of hr 3058 would rescind fy2005 hope vi funding operating fund operating funds are paid to phas to help make up the difference between the low rents paid by tenants living in public housing and the cost of running the buildings the presidents budget requested 34 billion for the operating fund in fy2006 while this represents an increase over the fy2005 enacted level it is decrease in the program level in fy2005 congress enacted an accounting change in the program that provided onetime savings of 992 million the total amount available for operating subsides in fy2005 minus the setasides listed above was 16 million more than the amount requested for fy2006 despite the slight decrease the fy2006 request would have been sufficient to fund agencies at similar proration level as fy2005 according to huds budget documents in fy2005 agencies received approximately 905 of the amount that they qualified crs15 for under the operating subsidy formula in fy2006 they would receive approximately 89 at the presidents requested level on april 14 hud issued proposed rule to revise the current formula for distribution operating subsidies the proposed rule differed from version of the rule agreed to by hud and the stakeholders that participated in congressionally mandated negotiated rulemaking process huds decision to publish an altered and arguably less costly form of the negotiated rule proved to be controversial hud contended that the proposed rule better reflects the departments policy and budgetary priorities nonetheless on september 19 2005 hud published final rule that reinstated most of the provisions of the negotiated rule that had been eliminated in the proposed rule and delayed implementation until 2007 the house version of the hud funding bill proposed almost 200 million more for the operating fund than the president requested resulting in more funding available in fy2006 than was available in fy2005 it included language directing the secretary of hud to distribute fy2006 operating funds using the formula agreed to by the negotiated rulemaking committee the bill also included 50 million to help agencies that faced losses of more than 5 under the new formula transition to assetbased management the senate version of the hud funding bill proposed 150 million more than the president requested for the operating fund while 50 million less than the house recommended level the senate bill proposed to set aside fewer funds leaving more to be distributed through the operating fund formula than the house bill while the senate bill would not mandate the use of the negotiated rule the accompanying report stated that the committee expected the final rule to reflect the negotiated agreement to the greatest extent possible the final version of hr 3058 funds the operating fund at the housepassed level which is higher than the presidents request or senatepassed level but will be decrease from the fy2005 program level the bill does not include language specifying how the funds should be distributed noting the postponed implementation of the new rule the conference agreement directs hud to include broad participation from affected agencies when developing the technical guidance to implement the new rule capital fund the presidents fy2006 budget proposed 10 decrease in capital funding for phas under the request the amount available for capital grants after setasides would have been 7 lower than what was distributed in fy2005 hud budget justifications state that the decreased funding level would be sufficient to meet annual capital repair needs however there is backlog of unmet modernization needs in public housing that is estimated to be between 1820 billion which this funding level would not address hud argues that reductions in the capital fund are necessary to ensure that tenantbased rental assistance receives sufficient funding the request would have cut the resident neighborhood opportunities for self sufficiency ross funding in half ross funds are used to provide supportive services for residents of public housing including job training work supports and case management the president also proposed to eliminate funding for neighborhood networks which are used to build and update technology crs16 centers in public housing and to assist lowincome households develop computer skills the housepassed version of hr 3058 would have provided almost 250 million more than the president requested for capital funding the bill would have adopted the presidents requested funding levels for ross and neighborhood networks so the full increase would have gone to capital grants providing 4 increase above the amount available for capital grants in fy2005 and 12 increase over the amount the president requested for capital grants in fy2006 the senatepassed version of the hud funding bill would have adopted the presidents requested level for the capital fund which is lower than the house approved level it would have increased funding for setasides above the presidents requested level for example almost doubling ross funding over the presidents request leaving less available for capital grants than the president requested 2 the fy2005 level 9 and the houseapproved level 12 the final version of the hud funding bill splits the difference between the house and senate funding levels for the capital fund providing 246 billion decrease from the fy2005 level but higher than the presidents request the bill also splits the difference between the house and senate levels for ross and neighborhood networks providing 38 million and 8 million respectively hope vi for the third year the presidents budget requested new funding for hope vi claiming that the program has met its mandate that program funds are spent too slowly and that per unit costs are too high despite the presidents request in fy2004 and fy2005 congress funded hope vi but at lower level than in fy2003 when over 570 million was provided to the program in addition to requesting new funding for the program the presidents budget proposes that congress rescind the funds it provided to the program in fy2005 the version of hr 3058 that passed the house appropriations committee on june 21 2005 did not provide any new funding for the hope vi program in fy2006 but did not rescind the fy2005 funding during floor debate on june 30 2005 an amendment was approved transferring 60 million to the hope vi program for fy2006 from the general services administrations federal buildings fund the senatepassed bill proposed 150 million for hope vi slight increase over the fy2005 level the committee in its report urged the department to reconsider the elimination of the hope vi program and consider restructured hope vi program that is more efficient costeffective and still capable of leveraging other funds for rebuilding often distressed communities the enacted version of hr 3058 provides 100 million for the hope vi program an amount nearly halfway between the house and senatepassed levels although the final bill funded the program the accompanying conference agreement stated that the conferees believe it is time to consider alternative approaches to the hope vi program crs17 for more information see crs report rl32236 hope vi public housing revitalization program background funding and issues by

decrease of 39 million the total included 58 million for the indian community block grant activities in prior years these activities were funded as setaside within the community development block grant program effectively this may be regarded as an additional decrease in funding for the native american block grant program since 58 million which would otherwise be used for other purposes would have to be used for economic development activities the housepassed version of hr 3058 increased funding for native american block grants above the presidents requested level but below the fy2005 enacted level the funding for formula grants is 6 above the presidents request but 10 below the fy2005 enacted level the bill adopted the presidents request that the indian economic block grant program which was funded within the community development fund be funded as setaside in this account hr 3058 would set crs18 aside 45 million for this purpose which is 35 reduction in funding from fy2005 and 22 reduction in funding from the presidents request the senatepassed version of the hud funding bill increased funding for the native american block grants account above the fy2005 level the presidents request and the house level the amount available for formula grants would be slightly decreased from fy2005 but would be an increase of 10 over the house passed level and 17 over the

related programs would not be funded in fy2006 including the youthbuild empowerment zones brownfields and section 108 loan guarantees in addition the bill proposed transferring funding for several cdbgrelated asides to other accounts within hud new selfhelp and assisted homeownership account would provide among others 23 million for the selfhelp homeownership program shop 28 million for the national community development initiative and 3 million for the housing assistance council it also recommended transferring to huds office of policy development and research 29 million in funding for university programs previously included as cdbg setasides under section 107 including assistance to historic black colleges and universities institutions serving hispanic populations and community development work study program on june 30 2005 the house by vote of 405 to 18 approved hr 3058 and forwarded the bill to the senate for its consideration before approving the bill the house considered and approved several amendments two of which increased funding for the cdf account to total of 4324 billion the house approved by voice vote an amendment hamdt 396 offered by representative knollenberg that would have provided an additional 675 million to the cdf account floor debate indicated that 50 million of that amount was to be made available for the youthbuild program unless the program was funded within the department of labors budget the additional 175 million was to be allocated to cdbg formula grants as approved by the house the cdbg formulabased program would have received 39 billion in funding which is approximately 230 million below its fy2005 funding level during floor consideration of the bill the chairman of the tthud appropriations subcommittee representative knollenberg stated his intention to continue to seek means of restoring the cdbg formulabased program to its fy2005 funding level second amendment offered by representative gary miller and approved by voice vote added another 24 million to the cdf account to be used for the hud brownfields redevelopment program in prior years the crs25 program was funded within its own account not as setaside within the cdf see below representative gingrey offered but later withdrew an amendment that would have prohibited the use of cdbg funds for economic development projects in instances where privately owned land was acquired through the use of eminent domain the amendment was offered in response to the june 23 2005 supreme court decision in kelo v new london connecticut which upheld the use of eminent domain to acquire privately held property and transfer it to another private party for governmentsupported economic development projects the supreme court held in 5 to 4 decision that such transfer is permissible if it results in public benefit such as job creation and increased tax revenues the house approved an amendment hamdt 427 offered by representative scott garrett that would prohibit the use of funds in hr 3058 to enforce the supreme courts kelo decision the amendment which was approved by vote of 231 189 would if approved by both the house and senate prohibit the use of any federal appropriations including cdbg transportation and housing funds included in hr 3058 from being used to directly or indirectly support economic development projects involving the use of eminent domain for more information see crs report rs22189 condemnation of private property for economic development kelo v city of new london by robert meltz on july 21 2005 the senate appropriations committee approved its version of hr 3058 by vote of 280 the senate version of the bill would have appropriated 4324 billion for community development fund cdf activities including 3767 billion for cdbg formula grants and 554 million for cdbg related set asides and earmarks it would have also appropriated 72 million more for programs and setasides funded under the cdf account than recommended by the house see discussion below but would have allocated 110 million fewer dollars to cdbg formula grants on october 20 2005 the full senate approved its version of hr 3058 by vote of 931 the senate version of the bill would have continued to fund number of smaller cdbgrelated programs under the cdf account unlike the house bill which would provide funding reduce funding or would transfer the activity to another account within hud for instance the senate bill included 69 million for the native american cdbg while the house version would appropriate 45 million for the program the senate bill would have appropriated 324 million in funding for college and university programs and retain the programs under the cdf account while the house bill called for transferring the activity to new self help and assisted homeownership account it would appropriate 40 million for the neighborhood initiative program program that was not included in the presidents request or the house version of the bill and it would have appropriated 30 million for capacity building grants under the national community development initiative program which is 2 million less than the amount recommended by the house like the house version of hr 3058 the senate version also included provisions limiting the use of federal funds in economic development projects involving eminent domain during the senate appropriations committee consideration of hr 3058 senator bond introduced and then withdrew proposed crs26 amendment that would have prohibited the use of federal funds in economic development projects involving the use of eminent domain the amendment would have allowed the use of federal funds if the project involved airports seaports mass transit or was intended to revitalize blighted area during senate floor consideration of the bill senator bond again introduced an amendment samdt 2113 to limit the use of federal dollars in support of economic development projects involving eminent domain the bond amendment which was approved by voice vote stated that appropriated funds included in hr 3058 could be used to support any federal state or local governmentassisted projects involving the use of eminent domain unless such projects or activities involve public purpose the amendment would not include economic development that primarily benefits private entities as an eligible public purpose but would include transportation and utility projects that benefit the general public as well as projects involving the removal of blighted areas or brownfields as public use activities such projects would be allowed the use of eminent domain without the loss of federal funds the amendment would also direct the government accountability office gao and the national academy for public administration state and local government organizations and property rights organizations to conduct studybystate study of the use of eminent domain the conference version of hr

of hr 3058 provided 100 million less for the homeless assistance grants account than the president requested which is 100 million more than the account received in fy2005 the house bill did not designate any funding for the samaritan housing initiative and did not authorize funding for the prisoner reentry initiative the house appropriations committee report hrept 109153 noted that because authorizing legislation for the prisoner re entry initiative has not been enacted funding for the program was not included in its version of hr 3058 the senatepassed version of the fy2006 hud

transportation treasury hud the judiciary and the district of columbia the secretary of hud referred to the need to make unpopular cuts in programs such as section 811 in order to maintain adequate funding for section 8 and programs for the homeless both the house and senate versions of hr 3058 proposed to fund the section 202 program at about the presidents requested level and approximately the same level as fy2005 spending floor amendment in the senate samdt 2140 made 10 million available for the section 202 legacy demonstration program pl 108186 which provides housing for lowincome elderly heads of households who care for children both house and senate versions proposed to fund the section 811 program at about the fy2005 level and unlike the presidents request allowed funds to be used for capital grants the senate bill included language proposing to transfer the renewal of section 811 vouchers to the section 8 tenantbased rental assistance account under the senate proposal it appeared that the tenantbased account would be required to absorb the cost of vouchers thus leaving additional dollars in the section 811 account for capital grants the enacted appropriation for fy2006 funds section 202 at 742 million it also retains the senates proposal to set aside funding for the section 202 legacy demonstration program but reduces the amount to 4 million from 10 million the final spending bill funds section 811 at 239 million an increase of approximately 1 million over fy2005 and twice as much as the presidents request like the house and senate versions the final version includes funds for capital grants but does not transfer section 811 vouchers to the section 8 tenantbased rental account as the senate version proposed crs34 affordable housing and economic development technical assistance board the senate version of hr 3058 would have established new program designed to provide technical assistance to local nonprofit organizations involved in managing

hrept 109153 and srept 109109 as shown in table 18 fha has negative appropriations which means that the income to the program from insurance premiums exceeds the program expenses this suggests that because of the surplus generated by fha hud needed 1724 million less in appropriations in fy2005 the negative appropriation has implications for two legislative initiatives that have been proposed by the administration one initiative would permit 100 fha financing for firsttime buyers with strong credit records under the other initiative hud would amend its underwriting guidelines in order to permit borrowers with blemished credit records to obtain fhainsured loans the fha insurance premiums for these borrowers would be increased to cover the higher risks and costs involved in these initiatives the presidents budget assumed that these initiatives would create 268 million in additional negative appropriations in fy2006 the budget also assumed that the mmi and gisri programs would generate 1956 million in offsetting receipts based on its assumptions of income costs and fees to the insurance funds the administration estimated net fha appropriations of 1489 million for fy2006 the appropriations committee however did not accept the administrations assumptions the committees reestimate shown in table 18 as the fy2006 request assumes zero savings from the proposed initiatives and it assumes 347 million less in offsetting receipts both house and senate versions of hr 3058 assume lower administrative expenses in the mmi account and lower offsetting receipts in the gisri account than presented in the presidents request as result the committees are able to crs36 realize greater savings than the reestimate of the presidents budget would have allowed although notably less than in the presidents original budget and less than was available in fy2005 as shown in table 18 the committees assumptions result in an estimated appropriation of 913 million the decrease in fha net income implies need for an additional 811 million in appropriations to support other hud programs at the same level as fy2005 pl 109115 funds fha as proposed by the house and senate office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo ofheo is the office within hud which is responsible for regulating fannie mae and freddie mac regarding the safety and soundness of their operations the

expects that the resources of ofheo will be transferred to strengthened regulator that will be proposed hr 1461 as passed by the house would combine ofheo and huds regulatory division into new
