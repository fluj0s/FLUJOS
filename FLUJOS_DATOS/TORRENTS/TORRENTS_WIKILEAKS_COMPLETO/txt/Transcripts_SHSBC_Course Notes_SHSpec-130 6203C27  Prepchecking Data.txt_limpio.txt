6203c27 shspec130 prepchecking data details on correction of errors in prepchecking pc doesnt prepcheck all the way to the bottom of the deck not all levels of pcs prepcheck prepchecking is not as broadly good an approach to all cases matter how lowtoned as the cchs or even 3dxx both cchs and 3dxx go much farther south than prepchecking which requires some responsibility for thinkingness thus 1 prepchecking takes responsibility for doingness 2 3dxx takes responsibility for existingness beingness 3 cchs take some responsibility for mass and repetitive action havingness note that this is be do have situation 3dxx and cchs both go further south than responsibility for doingness which is what prepchecking attacks it is odd that the beingness processes 3dxx go further south than doingness but it is empirically true that this is the case the reason fur this is probably that doingness is the main punishment factor in this part of the universe one will admit to beingness and havingness before admitting to doingness if you are having lot of trouble with prepchecking if you are not making much gain if you have tried for several sessions to find an area that produces ta without success you should run cchs the problem is not necessarily the pc it could be lack of auditor skill but in any case cchs will give the pc more case gain and more auditing it could be that the auditor is timid or that the pc is new and the auditor doesnt want to upset or embarrass him or the pc may be in the middle of ptp of long duration that is undisclosed the cchs will discharge ptps of long duration even if they are undisclosed or the pcs moral code could be so different from the auditors so far outof this world that the auditor misses the boat on it or the pc could have confidence in the auditors prepchecking or the pc has insufficient responsibility to respond to any doingness that will be handled with cchs cch2 is less embarrassing to start new pc with than prepchecking also after an intensive of cchs the same things that didnt produce ta before will now give ta the only thing that breaks an auditors heart is getting nothing done so dont abandon responsibility for yourself by running things which get nothing done most auditor errors are from not flattening processes lrh doesnt care what you run on pc as long as you flatten it and as long as you get results if you are getting ta on something run it however running limited processes beyond the point where they stop producing ta is hazardous operation pcs sometimes get off lies and feel relieved that is just because you didnt get near their overts you should know how to crack the problem of social mores in 3dxx you get the terminals social mores by asking the pc what would be considered antisocial by the terminal you then use the mores to make up zero questions using the overt with the biggest meter reaction first you are liable to come up with the pcs oppterm and overts of failure to damage the oppterm pretty quickly so you have to find out if it is plus overt or minus overt ie whether it is what you would expect or whether it is from the other side of the fence every race every species having fourth dynamic tends to fixate on that dynamic and the thetans running those bodies tend to keep running those bodies as long as they are available but when the species got scarce or extinct they had to move over into something else there is reason you shouldnt have been an animal at one time or another it is actually quite relief you pick up your nowimsupposedtos easily animals tend to stay with their nowimsupposedtos because they cant talk about them that is the only thing wrong with being an animal as far as nationalities are concerned thetan transfer can really scramble things up say some indian gets new body as an englishman the us is now getting lots of exnazis exjapanese etc on the track the pc has often gone round and round on the greeceegyptpersia line getting all confused about his nowimsupposedtos however there is dominant moral code in the 3dxx package dont forget overts of omission as well as commission plus the fruitful area of makeguilty and being victim you could investigate the makeguilty aspect of any zero question to get his efforts to get motivator on the subject which would make someone else guilty of the overt if the pc tends to dodge into past lives to avoid his thislife overts when you get in endruds about halftruths untruths misses withholds etc you will pick up the avoided areas some pcs need lot of cleanup on halftruths all the time others dont you will get to know the pc and see if it is necessary dont use any form of ow to handle ruds in prepcheck sessions or you will pile up unflat chains and the pc will use ruds to avoid uncomfortable hot areas
