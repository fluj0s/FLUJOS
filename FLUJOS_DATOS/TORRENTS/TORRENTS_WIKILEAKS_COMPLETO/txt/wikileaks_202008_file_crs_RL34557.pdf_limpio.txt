resources science and industry division july 2 2008 abstract the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 the 2008 farm bill reauthorizes almost all existing conservation programs modiﬁes several programs and creates various new conservation programs these changes address eligibility requirements program deﬁnitions enrollment and payment limits contract terms evaluation and application ranking criteria among other administrative issues in general the conservation title includes speciﬁc changes that expand eligibility and delivery of technical assistance under most programs to cover more broadly for example forested and managed lands pollinator habitat and protection and identiﬁed natural resource areas among other expansions producer coverage across most programs is also expanded to include beginning limited resource and socially disadvantaged producers speciality crop producers and producers transitioning to organic production the enacted bill also creates new conservation pro grams to address emerging issues and priority resource areas and also new subprograms under existing

significant and visible policy focus in the food security act of 1985 since then questions and concerns about conservation program funding policy objectives individual program effectiveness comparative geographic emphasis and the structure of federal assistance have been recurring issues in the debate shaping each successive omnibus farm bill1 the 2008 farm bill is exception these longstanding issues arguably became even more apparent in this farm bill as they found their way into many individual program changes this result may be continuation of the more active profile taken by many conservation groups and their supporters in the 2002 farm bill unlike commodity programs conservation program participation tends to be well represented by small and midsize farming operations according to the united states department of agricultures usda economic research service the programs also enjoy wider public support in an environment of pronounced domestic budget constraint however conservation groups and producers found themselves competing with other farming interests for the necessary resources to expand and continue many conservation programs budget concerns aside several other issues emerged in the debate leading to enactment of the 2008 farm bill funding priorities and payment structure geographic targeting program complexity the importance of largescale conservation efforts and measurement of costs and effectiveness these general policy issuesin various formsraised questions central to the deliberations and outcomes in the enacted conservation title of the farm bill 1 farmland conservation programs and initiatives initially were enacted as part of the 1985 farm bill pl 99198 food security act of 1985 which also included for the first time conservation title these programs have been reauthorized modified and expanded and several new programs have been created particularly in subsequent omnibus farm bills t

raised were should payment limits be programspecific or for some combination of conservation programs would the imposition of payment limits change patterns of participation and effectiveness of conservation programs what are the potential differences in saving under different payment limit options where should savings be allocated should each conservation program have the same payment limit how will funding levels affect the existing backlog of interest in program participation that cannot be met g9g142g152g144g155g138g153g145g146g140g561g7g150g153g145g138g156g146g156g561 because agricultural production is concentrated in specific regions of the united states agricultural conservation and environmental issues are not randomly distributed some areas and some natural resources reveal greater environmental impact from agricultural activitiesactual and potentialthan others for example pressures on farmland development from urban sprawl are more pronounced on the east and west coasts although many areas of the united states have water qualityquantity concerns or air quality issues the deterioration of certain watersheds and certain air sheds is more advanced in some places than in others how is it determined where federal conservation spending would be most effective should certain locations states regions or watersheds be targeted does targeting particular producer groups provide an effective strategy in resource management should some types of agricultural production or resource concerns receive higher priority in evaluating applications

proliferating conservation programs and the complexity of adhering to various regulations that govern the programs some producers might have some acreage under one program and other acreage under another program onfarm wetland management may be regulated by one program while the environmental management plan of retired acreage is under another program the question arises whether there is avoidable duplication or other inefficiencies that significantly limit conservation and resource management effectiveness could existing programs be combined in certain ways would consolidated effort targeting few specific resource issues reduce the complexity g6g142g149g146g159g142g155g162g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g146g159g142g151g142g156g156g561 along with the perceived complexity of agricultural conservation programs is the related issue of the effectiveness of program delivery does the conservation delivery capacity of usda agencies need to be further supplemented through partnerships relationships with other organizations or expansion of the technical assistance provider system what opportunities and problems would result if large portion of staff in the responsible agencies retired in short time period does usda currently have the staff needed to administer conservation programs if they were all fully funded how might more marketbased solutions to resource conservation improve delivery efficiency and program effectiveness httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34557g5g152g151g156g142g155g159g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561

and implementation of conservation programs through locally constituted councils is an important aspect of conservation manageme nt and longstanding characteristic of us localfederal relations significant question raised by conservation groups however is the extent to which conservation efforts would be more effective and more efficient if they took place at larger scales for example through regional or multistate resource planning and multistate conservation planning because the conservation prog rams are voluntary concern was voiced that participation could decline if producers felt that conservation programs were more remote from local planning input using watersheds or river basin drainage areas as policy targets for example could reduce the planning control of any single area jurisdiction the tradeoff is seen in the efficiencies that potentially stem from pooling financial and planning resources and targeting particular resource issues affecting most if not all producers the chesapeake bay region the great lakes and specific river basins with significant agricultural impacts are examples where larger scale planning may hold particular advantages

essential part of effective conservation management yet developing practical and reliable indicators that can be used across programs and with different producers and different resources has been challenge policymakers and stakeholders generally agree that conservation measures have been effective in reducing the environmental impact of agricultural activities but at what cost in what locations and under what specific circumstances are much more difficult questions to answer the recognized importance of establishing valid indicators has been an ongoing issue in environmental management research has advanced considerably in the area to the point that integrat ing those findings within the structure of current programs is viewed by many to be more feasible than it was in the past g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g7g151g138g140g157g142g141g561g344g342g342g350g561g8g138g155g150g561g4g146g149g149g561g561

conservation programs the various conservation programs administered by usda can be broadly grouped into land retirement and easement programs and socalled working lands programs in general land retirement and easement programs take land out of crop production and pr ovide for program rental payments and cost sharing to establish longer term conservation coverage in order to convert the land back into forests grasslands or wetlands working lands programs provide technical and financial assistance to assist agricultural producers in improving natural resource conservation and management practices on their productive lands the enacted 2008 farm bill also creates several new conservation programs under the bills conservation and other titles the following sections provide brief

enter into 1015 year contracts that provide annual rental payments and financial assistance to install certain conservation practices and maintain vegetative or tree covers its purpose is to conserve and improve soil water and wildlife resources by converting highly erodible and other environmentally sensitive acreage to longterm vegetative cover crp is the largest conservation program in terms of total annual funding it is administered by usdas farm service agency fsa and is funded through the department of agricultures usda commodity credit corporation ccc crp also s several subprograms one of which is the conservation reserve enhancement program crep that are designated to support state and federal partnerships through incentive payments for installing specific conservation practices that help protect environmentally sensitive land decrease erosion restore wildlife habitat and safeguard ground and surface water 2 the enacted 2008 farm bill secs 21012111 caps crp enrollment at 32 million acres down from its current cap of 392 million acres the managers report on the conference agreement states this reduction is not an indicator of declining or reduced support for crp however in other sections of the report usda is encouraged to assist producers who are transitioning from land retirement to working lands conservation the farm bill makes certain program changes including allowing usda to address state regional and national conservation initiatives providing incentives for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmersranchers to purchase crp land from retiring farmers allowing certain types of managed haying and grazing and installation of wind turbines on enrolled lands but at reduced rental rates requiring that program participants manage lands according to conservation plan requiring usda to survey annually the peracre estimates of county cash rents paid to crp contract holders clarifying the status of alfalfa grown as part of rotation practice and establishing costsharing rates for certain types of conservation structures the bill also amends the pilot program for wetland and buffer acres in crp each state can enroll up to 100000 acres up to national maximum of one million acres this maximum may be raised to 200000 in each state following review of the program eligible lands for the program include 1 wetlands that have been cropped three of the immediately preceding 10 crop years 2 land on which constructed wetland is to be developed to manage fertilizer runoff and 3 land that has been devoted to commercial pondraised aquaculture 3 conditions under which managed haying and grazing on crp acreage may occur have been modified the farm bill allows managed harves ting and grazing in response to drought and 2 for more detailed

agriculture and farmland conservation groups have responded favorably to the expanded provisions and increased funding for programs in the conservation title of the 2008 farm bill since enactment few national wildlife groups have expressed concern about changes to some provisions during the conference negotiations which are perceived as providing fewer benefits to the protection of wildlife and wildlife habitat among the concerns expressed by these groups are the reduction in the crp acreage enrollment cap reduction easing of the requirements under the sodsaver provision limitations on the types of lands eligible under wildlife habitat incentives program and the new permanent disaster fund which could encourage marginal land plantings among other concerns httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34557
