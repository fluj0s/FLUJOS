to broadly defined appropriations accounts such as military construction army or family housing air force these appropriations have typically been stated within the statutory language of the act itself nevertheless within the budget documentation that the president submits to congress each year ar hundreds of detailed justifications for individual construction projects at speci fied locations for stated purposes in established funding amounts the appr opriations and authorization committees consider each of these as individual reque sts and indicate their approval disapproval or additions to the project lists in the explanatory statements reported to their respective chambers while it is generally recognized by legal experts that statutory language provisions stated in the body of legislation passed by congress and enacted by the president carries the full weight of law the legal standing of statements contained within what is generally considered supporting language such as explanatory statements written into reports to the chambers by members of committees is less clear on january 29 2008 president george w bush issued executive order eo 13457 titled protecting american taxpay ers from government spending on wasteful earmarks in that eo the president stated in part that for appropriations laws and other legislati on enacted after the date of this order executive agencies should not commit ob ligate or expend funds on the basis of earmarks included in any nonstatutory s ource including requests in reports of committees of the congress or other congressional documents or communications from or on behalf of members of congress or any other nonstatutory source except when required by law or when an agency has itselfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34558crs8 15 the president defines earmark as funds provided by the congress for projects programs or grants where the purported congre ssional direction whether in statutory text report language or other communication circ umvents otherwise applicable meritbased or competitive allocation processes or specifies th location or recipient or otherwise curtails the ability of the executive branch to manage its statutory and constitutional responsibilities pertaining to the funds allocation process the full text of eo 13457 can be found online at httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200801200801295html 16 legal interpretation in this section has b een assisted by crs legislative attorney r chuck masondetermined project program activity grant or other transaction to have merit under statutory criteria or othe r meritbased decisionmaking15 the impact of eo 13457 on appropriati on or implementation practices of either the executive or the legislative branches is unclear for example the order states that executive agencies should emphasis added not commit obligate or expend funds under certain circumstances in law should is interpreted as non binding guidance to those to whom it is ddressed however in subsequent section of the eo the president directs that the head of each agency shall emphasis added take all necessary steps to implement the policy according to certain criteria that he then lays out it should be noted that shall is much stronger directive term the eo applies only to appropriations enacted after january 29 2008 and will therefore not affect any existing or prioryear appropriation the eo does not appear to bar the imp lementation of cong ressionally directed funding in cases where spending is requi red by law or when an agency has itself determined project program activity gran t or other transac tion to have merit under statutory criteria or other meritba sed decisionmaking examples of such situation have existed where particular c onstruction projects have been directed in the text of previously enacted authorization acts the presidents order also allows agency heads to consider the views of house committee member officer or staff of the congress with respect to commitments obligations or expenditures to carry out any earmark when such views are in writing in addition the definition of an earma rk written into the eo may reduce somewhat the clarity of exactly what spendi ng is to be avoided that definition states that earmarks are purporte d congressional direction whether in statutory text report language or other communication tha t circumvents otherwise applicable meritbased or competitive allocation pr ocesses or specifies the location or recipient emphasis added16 while much of the eo stresses the necessity of adhering to the letter of the law this definition could be interpreted as preventing an agency from observing some statutory text more generally the eo may raise num ber of other questions regarding future expenditure of appropria ted funds two examples are suggested below 1 there are instances where construction project is not stated within the statutory text of the law in question but rather is refe renced in the text of another an example might be statutory requirement for the depa rtment of veterans affairs to constructhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34558crs9 17 other instances where text outside of an ppropriations act may be considered as legally binding can occur when congress incorporates language such as shall be effective as if enacted by law or in accordance with into statute 18 in the fy2009 house bill the referenced accounts include military construction army military constructi on navy military construction air force military construction defensewide military construction army national guard military construction air national guard military construction army reserve military construction navy reserve military construction air force reserve family housing construction army family housing construction navy and marine corps family housing construction air force and chemical demilitariza tion construction defensewidea number of cemeteries for the use of vete rans at specified locations for which appropriations are not provided until number of years later17 would the eo bar the initiation of constructi on until such statutory link is found and proven to unambiguously cover each project 2 the eo grants agency heads the authority to accept congressionally directed funding when project has merit under st atutory criteria or other meritbased decisionmaking or when considering the views of house committee member officer or staff of the c ongress when such views are in writing do these provisions constitute broa d discretion on the part of agency heads to accept congressional guidance on spending in drafting its version of the fy2009 appropriations bill the house committee clarified the status of cong ressionally directed spending within the context of the executive order by referencing the list of construction projects within the statute for each appropriation account for which specifi c construction projects are identified in the committee report the proposed legislati on states that the amount appropriated in this paragraph shall be for the project s and activities and in the amounts specified under the headings in the

the ability of agencies to obligate funding to continue for as many as five years after the appropriation is enacted the house committee noted that inflation and the cost of construction over such lengthy period could significantly affect the accuracy of cost estimates submitted by dod the committee directed dod to increase the accuracy of its inflation estimates and report on the baseline
