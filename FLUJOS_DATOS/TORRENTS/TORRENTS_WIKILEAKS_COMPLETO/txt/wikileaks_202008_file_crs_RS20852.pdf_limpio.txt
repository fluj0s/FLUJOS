policy analyst resources science and industry division summary the partnership for new generation of vehicles pngv was cooperative research program between the federal government and the big three american automakers ford daimlerchrysler and general motors it was financed by private contributions and the recha nneling of research funds fo r ongoing federal programs partners agreed to share research responsib ilities and achievements the goals of the program were to improve domestic manufacturing capabilities and to develop prototypes of midsized family car with three time s the fuel economy of comparable 1994 model all three manufactur ers developed concept cars but there were problems with the development of production prototypes the partnership was criticized for several reasons and in the second session of the 106th congress the house of representatives voted to eliminate funding for the program although this funding was later reinstated under the george w bush administration the program was cancelled and funding for this research was redirected to new prog ram the freedom car program which will focus on fuel cell vehicles and the related support infrastructure this report provides background information on the p ngv program and discu sses the programs accomplishments in addition it discusses so of the key issues which surrounded the program introduction on september 29 1993 the clinton adminis tration announced the partnership for new generation of vehicles pngv th program was created as publicprivate partnership between the federal governme nt and the major domestic automakers to improve domestic automobile manufacturing capabilities and significantly increase the fuel efficiency of family cars while maintaining performance safety and cost on the federal level the program simply coordina ted previously authorized research among agencies therefore there was specific authorizing legislation or executive order that created pngv instead the basis for the prog ram was declaration of intent signed by the auto manufacturers and thenpresident clinton the partnership was formed to promote automobile research that would not be otherwise unde rtaken by american manufacturers and therefore promote energy security httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20852crs2 1 other agencies are also considered partners in the program but federal

spent approxima tely 250 million per year for research related to pngv more than half of this through does energy conservation budget on many projects industry shared re search costs with the federal government in other cases research was conducted solely by the industry according to industry estimates the auto manufacturers spen t approximately 800 million annually on pngv and related research4 goals according to the pngv program plan the program had three key goals5 improving manufacturing implementing ne w technologies and developi ng supercar with three times the fuel economy of base line passenger car however the third goal was often the only one mentioned in discussions of pngv this was because the third goal could be easily measured while the first two could not this focus on goal three led to debate over the accomplishments and effectiveness of the program the first goal of pngv was to signifi cantly improve national competitiveness in manufacturing this included minimizing production costs and lead times improving productivity reducing envi ronmental impacts and improving product qualityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20852crs3 6 from table es1 pngv program plan november 29

commercially viable innovations from ongoing research in conven tional vehicles including development of technologies that improve fuel economy redu ce emissions and mainta in safety ideally these technologies would then be incorpor ated in conventiona l production vehicles the third goal of pngv was to develop supercar specifically the program planned to increase fuel efficiency to up to three

technologies with the greatest likelihood of meeting the performance parameters were identified to meet the goal manufacturers planned to use dieselelectric hybrid engines these drive systems combine an advanced dieselpowered engine with an electric motor they tend to be more efficient than conventional vehicles and thus have higher fuel economy7 2 by 2000 each manufacturer was to develop concept car that would be used to evaluate the technical feasibility of the components when integrated for the first time 3 by 2004 all three manufacturers were to develop production prototype which would demonstrate manufacturing feasibility and meet the performance parametershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20852crs4 8 pngv program plan november 29 1995 p 71 9 national academy of sciences review of the

progress in achieving the first goal of the pr ogram accomplishments included process improvements in producing aluminum sheets and carbonfiber composites in addition manufacturers made advances in cost reduction and improve d recycling of composite materials9 however the general accounting office gao questions whether it is possible at this time to assess the poten tial effects of pngv on us manufacturing competitiveness10 both nas and gao agreed that progress wa s made on the second goal all three manufacturers have reported an increase in the use of aluminum and other lightweight materials as well as improved combustion technologies in their production vehicles in addition significant prog ress was made on the third go as of february 2000 all three manufacturers had introduced concept cars for the program these vehicles were the daimlerchrysler concept esx3 th ford prodigy and the gm precept11 all three vehicles achieved 70 miles per gallon or more through the use of hybrid drivetrains lightweight materials and other efficien cy improvements in addition all three manufacturers expected to intr oduce production prototypes by 200412 however because of cost constraints and othe r technical issues massproducti on of these vehicles seemed unlikely high costs forced toyota and h onda which were alread selling small gasoline hybrid vehicles in the us market to heavily subsidize their vehicles to make them affordable issues some key issues were raised concerning pngv the first is that although the programs purpose was to velop highlyefficient vehi cles there was federal requirement that these vehicl ever be produced and sold environmental groups were concerned that the vehicles would therefor never be produced in addition they were concerned that the use of diesel engines would lead to higher pollution and pollution with potentially more dangerous health effects such as fine particulate matter13 another issue was that although the othe r parameters of the progra m may be met it was unlikelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20852crs5 14 union of concerned scientists ucs s upercar programs midcourse report card d for diesel news release september 24 1998 15

catherine strong daimlerchryslers hybrid is affordable associated press february 23 2000that the vehicles could be as affordable as conventional ve hicles if they were produced final issue was that some questioned whether the federal government should be supporting such research at all mass production questions although it was goal of the program for each manufacturer to develop prototype manuf acturers were not re quired to massproduce the vehicles therefore environmental groups questioned the value of the program further they argued that pngv was used to forestall any increase in federallymandated corporate average fuel economy cafe standards1415 however as was stated above some new technologies deve loped through pngv are being used in conventional vehicles indicating that manufacturers saw opportun ities in the technology use of diesel engines another key concern with pngv was the planned use of diesel engines in the hybrid designs some critics argued that even advanced diesel engines would not meet the ne w tier 2 emissions standards16 and that even if these vehicles were produced they would be illegal to drive under clean air act limits on particulate matter17 for this reason considerable portion of pngv funding was focused on reducing emissions from the diesel hybrid engine according to some critics the program should have focused on cleaner technologies such as fuel cells18 high cost the potential cost of these vehicles was also key issue according to gm the use of advanced lightweight materials in its precept made it too expensive for production19 in order to control costs daimlerchrysler chose to develop concept that had lower fuel economy than the target 72 mpg instead of 80 nonetheless the esx3 was still approximately 7500 mo re expensive than the intrepid the manufacturers family sedan however accord ing to daimlerchrysler this was an improvement from its earlier model the esx2 wh ich would have cost 15000 more20 it remained to be seen whether consumers were willing to pay such premium for these vehicles but successes among smaller hybrids like the h onda insight and the toyota prius were promising despite an incremental purchas price of approximately 7000 for the insight as compared to conventional civic hatc hback honda expects to completely sell itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20852crs6 21 james r healey highprofile

technologies energy environment and development issuesproduction runs for 2001 and 200221 however the premium would have been considerably higher without subsidies from the manufacturers to promote sales what is the governments proper role another issue that was raised was whether the federal government should support this research at all and that the program amounted to corporate welfare according to the cato institute taxpayers should not be forced to help private companies devel op profitable new products in the first place22 this concern contributed to june 14 2000 house of representatives vote to eliminate funding for pngv in the fy 2001 appropriati ons bill pl 106291 and to use the funds for debt reduction in the final conferen ce pngv funding was reinstated because consumers generally do not make fuel ec onomy high priority supporters of pngv argued that it may be necessary for the federal government to intervene to limit petroleum dependence further according to industr estimates auto manuf acturers spent three times as much as the government per year on pngv research related issue is the question of whether the program picked winne rs through its selective technology focus critics argued that too much funding was being directed at the technologies chosen for implementation in goal 3 of the partnershi p pngv supporters count ered that research was continuing on topics unrelated to goal 3 the supercar but which may have helped the partnership meet goals 1 and 2 improved domestic competitiveness and implementation of new technol ogies in conventional vehicl respectively these technologies included research on fuel cells and other advanced technologies other concerns that were raised at the beginning of the partnership cente red on questions of anti trust and intellectual property rights current pngv status on january 8 2002 the george w bush administration announced that the pngv program would be replaced with new initiative the free dom car program23 this new program will still be partnership between uscar and the federal government but with doe taking the lead role while hybrid vehicle research will continue24 the program will focus on the research and development of fuel cell vehicles and the infrastructure necessary to support them25
