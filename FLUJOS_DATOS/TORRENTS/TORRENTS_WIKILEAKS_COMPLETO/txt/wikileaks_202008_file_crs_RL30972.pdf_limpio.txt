authorization cleanup of contaminated sites summary the environmental protection agency epa defines brownfields as abandoned idled or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination the brownfields program was established administratively by epa under the aegis of the superfund program without explicit authority for it in the law it has been financed by the superfund appropriation the program provides financial and technical assistance to help communities restore less seriously contaminated sites that have the potential for economic development combination of potential environmental economic and social benefits gives this program broad support among governments environmentalists developers and communities the program began in 1993 and has grown to include 398 brownfields assessment grants most for 200000 over 2 years 151 grants of up to 350000 up to 1 million beginning in fy2001 to establish revolving loan funds to help finance the actual cleanups 47 job training grants and 28 brownfields showcase communities where technical and financial assistance from 20 participatin g federal agencies is being coordinated with state local and nongovernmental efforts epa also addressed some liability and cleanup issues affecting brownfields by changing its hazardous waste site

the brownfields revitalization and environmental restoration act of 20011 background the brownfields economic redevelopment initiative is an effort begun in 1993 by the epa to address sites that may be contaminated by hazardous substances2 but do not pose serious enough public health or environmental risk to qualify for cleanup under the superfund program3 the purpose of the program is to provide seed money for activities prior to cleanup but not to fund the actual cleanup or remedial action as it is called in the superfund program the environmental protection agency epa defines brownfields as abandoned idled or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination4 they range in size from corner gas

reform legislation may 12 1999range from 500000 to million5 they are often in economically distressed areas brownfield sites face paradox they are generally not eligible for remediation funding under the superfund program because they pose low public health risk while at the same time developers may avoid them because of cleanup costs potential future liability or related reasons thereby stalling economic development the brownfields program is not specifically mentioned in the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or the superfund law it was created administratively by epa congress has recognized it through separate line item appropriation since fy1997 and there is desire among many members to formally establish the brownfields program by law and provide it with legislative guidance and structure brownfield issues have been the subject of several hearings and have been discussed in superfund and appropriations hearings6 in the 106th congress approximately 32 bills with significant brownfields provisions were introduced some of them with broad bipartisan cosponsorship in 2001 the senate passed s 350 srept 1072 which would provide the statutory authority for the program 250 million per year for various brownfield initiatives and relief from superfund liability for some property owners among other things support for the brownfields program as it has been operating comes from wide array of states and localities environmental groups business associations developers and community activists proponents argue that the program has the potential to leverage federal state local and private funds to improve the environment by addressing lowlevel lowrisk contamination that otherwise might not be remediated once the environmental problems are remedied the economic potential of previous brownfield sites can be realized they argue this might include wide range of economic uses possibly creating jobs recreational opportunities and local tax revenues from this there may be positive social benefits for communities negatively affected by environmental contamination and economic decline httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30972crs3 7 for

1998 p 40 9 environmental law institute p 43 10 environmental law institute p 46there are of course variety of federal programs that target urban renewal7 and the brownfields program is designed to supplement not duplicate them the program itself as it presently exists does not aim to perform the cleanups it generally provides grants which are to serve as catalysts to bring together other resources in the communities to provide the environmental cleanup component of redevelopment efforts overall the brownfields program is intended to fill previously unmet need and to offer hope for cleaner environment new jobs stronger tax base and economic recovery voluntary cleanups vs brownfields one way states are dealing with contaminated sites is through voluntary cleanup programs which had been adopted by 44 states as of the end of 1997 these programs encourage the owners or developers to work cooperatively with the state outside of the states enforcement driven cleanup program thereby avoiding some of the costs and delays associated with that approach cleanup standards are usually identical to those the states enforce at other hazardous waste sites according to the environmental law institute eli8 most states provide incentives for participating in the program most commonly some form of liability release other incentives include streamlined process financial or tax incentives and technical assistance states created voluntary cleanup programs in the absence of federal legislation or standards and these programs vary considerably states define brownfield sites in different ways but they usually echo epas definition encompassing urban industrial or commercial facilities that are abandoned or underutilized due in part to environmental contamination or fear of contamination9 eli noted that few states have different standards or cleanup approaches for brownfields than they do for voluntary cleanup sites for brownfield sites florida provides for sitespe cific cleanup levels based on risk allowing institutional or engineering controls instead of the statewide remediation levels otherwise required north carolina allows for alternative cleanup strategies focusing on removal of exposure pathways at certain brownfield sites and mississippi did not set specific standards the statute requires that risk assessment be used10 the difference between brownfields and voluntary programs in the states is often matter of semantics the environmental law institute distinguished them thus typically voluntary programs do not focus on redevelopment nor do they target urban sites specifically rather voluntary programs are more often aimed at getting simple less contaminated sites cleaned up regardless of whether they are reused brownfield programs on the other hand are more likely to focus onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30972crs4 11 environmental law institute p 44redevelopment and be part of broader state strategy or set of social policies aimed at improving distressed urban areas11 prior to enactment of pl 107118 the legal underpinnings of the brownfields program were somewhat nebulous since the program is not mentioned in cercla the authorized

brownfields which epa calls assessment pilot project awards has been increased from the original 50 announced in 1995 to nearly 400 brownfields cleanup revolving loan fund grants and job training grants have been initiated and the brownfields showcase communities have been inaugurated epa has also used targeted brownfield assessments to hire contractors to conduct assessments and beginning in fy2000 has provided supplemental awards and awards for greenspace enhancement in addition to these grant programs epa has taken several steps to relieve uncertainty over cleanup liability it has changed the way it keeps track of potentially contaminated sites and has issued guidances to clarify the situations where it will use its enforcement discretion and not bring legal action to force cleanups such as against prospective purchasers of brownfields several of epas actions relate to property transfer as the sale of real estate is frequently central element to redevelopment brow nfield assessment pilot projects epa provides funding for brownfields through cooperative agreements with state local and tribal governments as well as with multijurisdictional authorities such as regional planning commissions and economic development agencies the awards are for up to 200000 over 2 years to be used to bring together governmental entities community groups investors lenders developers and other affected parties to address site assessment and cleanup planning issues the agency awards grants for the brownfields assessment pilots on competitive basis in selecting projects epa focuses on firm redevelopment plans as well as commitment from the public and private parties to both cleanup and redevelopment after the brownfields assessment is completed from fy1995 october 1994 through

variety of federal agencies could be applied successfully to redevelop their brownfields properties gao reported that the 10 federal agencies they reviewed had improved their coordination of brownfield activities both within their own agency and between agencies the showcase communities also acknowledged improvement they are now better aware of the federal resources available to support brownfield redevelopment and how to access them and are getting more technical and financial help from agencies major reason for this success is that epa loaned staff person to each city under the

groundwater are currently deductible but only for the person who contaminated the land also the cleanup would have to be done without any anticipation of putting the land to new use further any monitoring equipment with useful life beyond the year it was acquired would have to be capitalized on the other hand person who acquired previously contaminated land such as brownfield site would have to capitalize his cleanup costs spreadin g them out over number of years cleanup costs are major barrier to redevelopment and the irs ruling made challenging situation even more difficult for developers the taxpayer relief act thus had the effect of overturning the ruling and allowing develop ers who had not caused the contamin ation to deduct cleanup costs in the current year rather than to have to capitalize themlegislation brownfields tax incentive tax incentive allowing the costs of redeveloping brownfields to be deducted in the current year was enacted in the 105th congress as part of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 initially good for 3 years until december 31 2000 the tax break was extended to the end of 2003 by the 106th congress and expanded to include all brownfields certified by the appropriate state agency the administration has announced that it will seek to make the provision permanent as part of its fy2003 budget request the 1997 act limited eligibility for the tax break to the 76 brownfield pilots announced prior to february 1 1997 areas with poverty rate of 20 or more adjacent industrial or commercial areas and empowerment zones and enterprise communities ezecs the tax extenders act of 1999 pl 106170 added year to the life of the incentive to december 31 2000 and the consolidated appropriations act 2001 pl 106554 extended the brownfields tax incentive for an additional 2 years to december 31 2003 the latter act also broadened eligibility for the tax break to include any site containing hazardous substance that is certified by the appropriate state environmental agency superfund sites are excluded congress enacted this incentive to resolve an issue that arose from the tax treatment of costs of cleaning up contaminated land in general costs incurred for new buildings or for permanent improvements to increase the value of property must be capitalized that is the cost must be deducted over period of years some expenses such as repairs are currently deductible that is deductible in the year in which the cost is incurred this is also called expensing it is considerable financial advantage to be able to fully deduct cost in one year rather than many however the benefit of the brownfields tax incentive is reduced to certain degree over time by what is called in tax terminology the recapture provision recapture mandates that the gain realized from the value of the property when it is later sold be taxed as ordinary income rather than at the generally lower capital gains rate to the extent of the expensing allowance previously claimed in effect the taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30972crs11 22also see issue brief ib10078 superfund and brownfields in the 107th congress for regular updates on

postponing certain amount of the develope rs tax liability in the early days of project when the developer is spending money to clean up the property when the developed property is later sold the

have been introduced in the 107th congress and one of them s 350 subsequently hr 2869 was enacted as pl 107118 see table 1 on page 15 for summary of their major provisions s 350 senator lincoln chafee then chairman of the superfund waste control and risk assessment subcommittee of the committee on environment and public works introduced s 350 on february 15 2001 the full committee reported it on march 12 srept 1072 with the understanding that negotiations on the state finality question would continue hearing witnesses have testified over several congresses that barrier to cleanup and development at many brownfield sites is the concern that even though site might meet state cleanup standards and be released from liability under state law thereby achieving finality the us environmental protection agency could still intervene or overfile and require second cleanup to meet more stringent federal requirements s 350 has such finality language but it also contains exceptions that are meant to provide an environmental safety net allowing epa to step in if threat to public health or the environment is not being met by state some senators felt that these exceptions to the finality language in the bill were too broad and that the state should have an opportunity to act before epa initiates an enforcement action23 the post markup negotiations led to managers amendment satisfying their objections which was adopted in the senate debate on april 25 2001 as passed by the senate title i of s 350 directs epa to establish 1 program to provide grants to characterize assess and conduct planning at brownfield sites and to perform targeted site assessments and 2 program to provide grants to capitalize revolving loan funds or to be used directly to remediate one or more sites characterization grants are limited to 200000 which epa may increase to 350000 based on the anticipated level of contamination the size or the status of ownership of the site the remediation grants may be awarded on communitywide or sitebysite basis and are limited to 1 million the bill authorizes 200 million for each of 5 years for these programs and dedicates 50

defense cercla provides defense against liability for person who unknowingly purchased contaminated land provided the person made all appropriate inquiry prior to the transaction the bill spells out what comprises all appropriate inquiry for the purchaser to qualify as an innocent landowner under the law25 these provisions would apply to all contaminated sites not just brownfields title iii of s 350 authorizes 50 million per year for 5 years to assist states in establishing or enhancing their voluntary cleanup programs states may also use these grants to capitalize revolving loan fund or to develop risk sharingpool an indemnity pool or insurance mechanism to provide financing for response actions title iii also addresses the finality issue forbidding enforcement by the federal government at sites being cleaned up under state program except where 1 the state requests assistance 2 the contamination has or will migrate across state lines or onto federally owned or controlled property 3 epa determines after taking into account the response actions already taken that release or threatened release may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment or 4 epa after consultation with the state determines that information not known by the state has been discovered that requires further remediation to protect public health or welfare or the environment the federal enforcement ban is contingent on the state maintaining public record of sites where response action is completed and sites that are scheduled to be cleaned up in the coming year the environment and public works committee noted in the bill report that the committee expects this title i money to be funded through general revenues and to be in addition to appropriate

funds for the state voluntary cleanup programs in title iii hr 2869 after the senate unanimously passed s 350 on april 252001 the house unanimously passed hr 1831 on may 22 that bill dealt with the superfund liability of small businesses and other small contributors of hazardous wastes at sites on the national priorities list on september 10 energy and commerce committee chairman paul gillmor

weekly bulletin april 30 2001 p 11 28 rebecca adams brownfields redevelopment measure clears congressional quarterly weekly december 22 2001 p 3091there were two substantive issues that held up passage the first was the state finality question that is the circumstances under which epa should be allowed to intervene at site that has been or is being cleaned up under state program this was the same issue that had proved problem in the senate house energy and commerce committee chairman billy tauzin said he wanted bill with stronger language than s 350 to bolster state authority27 the second issue was whether the davisbacon act which requires that workers be paid prevailing union wages in the area would apply at brownfield cleanups davisbacon has been applicable at brownfield sites all along because the brownfield grants were made under cercla authority and cercla requires it in section 104g house speaker dennis hastert reportedly used his influence in both cases to persuad reluctant members to go forward and ultimately pass hr 286928 other bills ten other bills have been introduced in the 107th congress and two of them s 23 and hr 324 would provide statutory authority for the brownfields program s 23 introduced by senator specter is an urban economic development bill one title of which would approve epas existing program hr 324 representative boehlert is superfund reauthorization bill identical to one reported in the 106th congress hr 1300 they both address the state finality issue and hr 324 also contains the liability relief provisions another set of bills would promote brownfield programs in other agencies representative quinns hr 2064 would give specific statutory authority to three agencies enabling them to provide direct federal funding loans and loan guarantees for brownfields within the context of their agency missions and existing programs the three are the department of housing and urban development hud the small business administration and the economic development administration eda senator levins s 1078 and representative gary millers hr 2941 address huds brownfields program and levins s 1079 provides authority to eda with s 1079 employing the same language as hr 2064s eda provisions these same three bills along with s 350 would expand the list of sites eligible to receive brownfield grants they would include former illegal drug labs petroleum contaminated sites and minescarred lands within the definition of brownfield site making them eligible for federal assistance for petroleumcontaminated site to be eligible it would have to be of relatively low risk as compared to other petroleumonly sites in the state have viable responsible party be assessed investigated or cleaned up by person that is not potentially liable and not be subject to cleanup order under the leaking underground storage tank program the drug labs and minescarred lands have other qualifying requirements the quinn bill and three others would address the expensing of cleanup costs see pages 1011 above the bills are senator torricellis s 1082 representative wellers hr 2264 and representative coynes hr 1439 all four bills would makehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30972crs14 the tax break permanent it is due to expire at the end of 2003 position the administration is backing s 1082 and hr 2264 would also eliminate the recapture provision and would include additional substances in the definition of hazardous substances that may be cleaned up and be eligible for the tax break asbestos oil pesticides radon and leadbased paint and hr 2064 would make the expensing provision available to those who lease sites for more than 30 years hr 2064 would add four new tax breaks to stimulate brownfields redevelopment the first is 50 tax credit for cleanup costs incurred at brownfield site the credit is limited to 50000 per site and must be taken over 5 years taxpayer would have the option of using this credit or the expensing provision but could not take advantage of both secondly hr 2064 authorizes the establishment of brownfield iras the site owner could put up to 1 million per year free from federal taxation into special savings account the ira for future use in brownfield assessment and cleanup the money would have to be used within 10 years the third tax incentive in the bill is aimed at banks and other lenders to encourage them to make loans for brownfield redevelopment interest earned on brownfield loans would be exempt from federal taxation up to 100000 per year the fourth tax break would provide 20 tax credit for the costs of research and development of environmental remediation technology representative andrewss hr 3170 would provide limited tax credit for qualified brownfields cleanup bonds issued by state or local governments outlook as noted previously the administration has backed the idea of making the brownfields tax incentive permanent and will include it in the budget request with vocal opponents prospects for passage appear good httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30972crs15 table 1 brownfields bills in the 107th congress program or activity s 23 specter s 350 chafee s 1078 levin s 1079
