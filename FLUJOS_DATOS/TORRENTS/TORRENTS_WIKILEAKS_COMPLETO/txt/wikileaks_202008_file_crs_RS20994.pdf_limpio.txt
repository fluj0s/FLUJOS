and trade division summary the japanese economy is burdened by an overhang of nonperforming bank loans that are officially recognized to total 3675 billion but could exceed trillion dollars if all problem loans are taken into account and economic conditions worsen significantly these bad loans have weakened japans already sluggish economy undermined the strength of the yen and are exacerbating the slowdown in asias economies in recent years japan has averted replay of the crisis conditions that accompanied earlier failures of financial institutions but the problem is immense and restoring health to the balance sheets of japanese banks remains top economic policy concern both in tokyo and in international financial circles after nearly decade of repeated attempts to resolve the problem the current koizumi government has set new deadline for banks to write off the worst of the loans within three years even if this causes as many as 200000 lost jobs and numerous bankruptcies the united states and japan have initiated financial dialogue led by the us treasury to discuss various financial issues including the bad loan problem and the bush administration has said it would assist japan in pursuing its economic reforms in any way it can the nonperforming loans held by japans banking sector total at least 3675 billion despite decade of government programs to strengthen its banks and private efforts to clean up the mess this mammoth challenge facing japans financial sector is of interest to the united states because this huge debt problem weakens japans economic performance is dragging down other neighboring economies in asia undermines the strength of the yen and affects the financial flows between the united states and japan it also can affect american trade and investments in japan in addition as the second largest economy in the world japans economic weakne ss along with the slowing economy of the united states are key to the export performance and stability of many exportdependent countries in asia the overhang of bad loans also contributes to weakness in japans capital markets and shortage of capital despite bank of japan interest rates of less than 1 small and mediumsized businesses in japan face relatively high interest charges and reluctance on the part of banks to lend them funds japanese banks also have been reducing their lending in international markets particularly in southeast asia tokyo recognizes that the country is in danger of becoming second or thirdrate power if it does not restore health to its economy beginning with the banking sectorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20994crs2 1 japan financial services agency non performing loans of all deposittaking financial institutions as of the end of march 2001 august 2 2001 2

total loans 57 for major banks these official figures however are thought to be understated if one includes problem loans that might go sour if the economy goes into recession the total could be as high as 1409 trillion 113 trillion2 also only about 30 of the bank loans to firms that recently have gone bankrupt had been listed as nonperforming for most japanese banks only extensive government efforts and financing of bank recapitalization packages have kept them from bankruptcy or severe punishment by stock and lending markets even with government intervention fitch an international rating agency rates the intrinsic strength of individual japanese banks as d or the bottom of the scale although fitch gives ratings mostly of or on longterm debt for major japanese banks this is based on the theory that the banks longterm debt instruments are of relatively higher quality because the japanese government would intervene to support them if necessary3 the poor condition of japanese banks did cause crisis in 199798 when they had to pay premium of as much as 07 percentage points over international bank borrowin g rates to compensate lenders for their increased risk the new koizumi administration has announced its intention to restructure the japanese economy and to resolve the nonperforming loan problem the united states and japan also have been engaged in what is called the usjapan economic partnership for growth launched by president bush and prime minister koizumi at camp david summit on june 30 2001 this economic partnership includes financial dialogue which is to serve as forum for the us department of the treasury and japans ministry of finance and financial services agency to exchange information and views on range of key financial issues including non performing loans of japanese banks4 in june 2001 us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan reportedly urged japan to immediately embark on the task of disposing of bad loans in the banking

problem is about to see policy action economic research note march 2 2001in june 2001 the koizumi government declared that banks must dispo of loans to bankrupt and nearbankrupt borrowers within two years and remove newly emerging nonperforming loans within three years of such classification even at the cost of 100000 to 200000 jobs in troubled companies6 given prime minister koizumis popularity rating of over 80 he may succeed in pushing through reforms that heretofore have been stymied by powerful interest groups the program is being criticized by some as being too limited while entrenched financial interests are attempting to reduce its scope problem is that the prime minister also is attempting to curtail deficit spending which could slow the economy so much that new bad loans will appear and banks will be unable to generate the profits needed to finance the bad loan writeoffs counter risk is that if drastic action is not taken now the situation will only worsen background the genesis of japans problem with nonperforming loans can be traced to two structural factors the first is the burst of japans socalled economic bubble in 1989 during the latter half of the 1980s japans monetary authorities flooded the market with liquidity money in order to enable businesses to cope with the rising value of the yen businesses did invest in new capital equipment to become more competitive in international markets but the excess liquidity also found its way into speculation in japans stock market in real estate ventures and in foreign investments at that time the market value of both land and equities was rising so fast that investors and speculators could hardly miss the larger mistake for them was not to borrow and invest and consequently not be positioned to reap the returns from rising markets banks considered most loans with real estate as collateral as being unquestionably secure when japans economic bubble burst in 1989 causing stock and land prices to fall the value of collateral underlying many loans dropped below the value of their loan principal commercial real estate ventures especially office buildings also became unprofitable as rents fell as the economy slowed companies also faced excess capacity and inventories and lower profits as more and more loans turned sour more and more of the underlying real estate had to be sold at bargain prices this only drove land values further down particularly for commercial real estate in the major urban areas as shown in figure 1 japans nikkei stock market average peaked in 1989 at 40000 and subsequently has dropped by more than half to roughly 12000 in august 2001 unrealized capital gains on holdings of stock by major banks which stood at 491 trillion 355 billion in 19897 has dropped to approximately 5 trillion 42 billion in 2001 for some weaker banks stock holdings have resulted in capital losses commercial land values in the six major metropolitan areas peaked in 1991 and by 2000 had fallen by 80 the value of residential and indus trial land which are combined with commercial to form the all urban land price index fell by less but still declined by nearly 20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20994crs4 8 for details see choy jon banks go hat in hand to tokyo jei report march 19 1999source bank of japan financial and economic statistics monthly 85 86 87 88 89 90

market average and prices for all urban and commercial urban land 1985 2000the second cause of the bad loan problem has been the structure of japans capital mark ets during most of the post world war ii period japans banking system provided mechanism to transfer savings from the household sector to the business sector the system favored business investment and household saving while it discouraged household sumption and consumer debt banks also operated under convoy system in which the government oversaw and intervened extensively to ensure not only that banks followed its official policy line but that stronger banks helped weaker banks in order to keep the convoy of domestic banks moving along together one result of this system was that banks tended to lend on relational rather than purely economic basis crony capitalism also an implicit government guarantee of deposits in the banking convoy created moral hazard that encoura ged lending to borrowers who might have been considered substandard by more independent credit evaluators the moral hazard stems from the government guarantee of deposits which tended to foster risky lending behavior by banks which then exacerbated the problem of bad loans the government guarantee was to have alleviated over the 1990s the japanese government announced various programs and measures to resolve the problem of nonperforming bank loans this included 18 trillion 1375 billion in public funds injected into 21 major banks in 1998 and 75 trillion 625 billion in public funds that included 56 trillion 467 billion allocated to be transferred to the top tier of japanese banks through the sale in 1999 of new preferred bank shares to governmentrun organization8 the government has the option of converting these preferred shares which convey priority claim on dividend payments but voting rights into common stock after certain periods of time the government can convert the preferred shares to common stock if bank misses its dividend payments the government furthermore has replenished funds in its woefully undercapitalized deposit insurance fund and nationalized two banks before selling them to private investors the defunct longterm credit bank of japan was bought from the government by the new yorkbased ripplewood holdings for much of the 1990shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20994crs5 79128136125285 218298 296304325

they are being disposed of between fy1992 and fy2000 japans banks had written off cumulative total of 313 trillion approximately 275 billion in bad loans but new ones have appeared so fast that the total for bad loans keeps increasing see figure 2 in response to the banking problem and in line with the general liberalization of japans financial markets tokyo also has been deregulating its financial sector in what the government has termed its big bang various reforms have been announced that are aimed at making japans financial markets more efficient transparent global and fair in addition to new standards products supervision and reporting requirements the government lifted the half centuryold ban on holding companies these banking sector changes along with the badloan problem have induced wave of mergers among japanese banks on august 15 2001 the bank of japan announced that it intended to pump more money into the economy by implementing monetary policy aimed at fighting deflation by increasing cash balances at banks and by buying more government bonds this may slow the decline in japans asset prices and help banks deal with their bad loans us policy options the policy options for the united states with respect to japans banking problem are limited considering the broad implications of the situation for us economic and financial interests congress has held hearings on the banking problems and economic conditions in japan under the clinton administration the united states pressed japan to pursue stronger actions to recapitalize banks and to resolve the

banking problem and other issues it also is in the interest of the united states to ensure that japan pursues solutions to its banking woes that provide the widest access to japans financial services sector to us investors exporters and corporations currently the financial situation in japan bears close watching significant change in certain indicators could portend worsening of the problem and possible need for counter actions on the us side these indicators include large fall of values on japans stock market and in real estate markets sudden jump in the rate of bankruptcies particularly of financial institutions reappearance of the japan premium in international borrowing or any failure by japanese banks to meet their capital adequacy ratios10 true banking crisis characterized by multiple bank failures and run on deposits seems unlikely at this time however as japanese banks cope with sluggish economic conditions and write off more nonperforming loans while attempting to cut
