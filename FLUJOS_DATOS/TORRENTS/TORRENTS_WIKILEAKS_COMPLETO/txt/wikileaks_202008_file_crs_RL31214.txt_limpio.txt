specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division saving for college through qualified tuition section 529 programs summary congress has tried to make higher education more affordable by providing favorable tax treatment to savings accumulated in qualified tuition programs qtps also called section 529 programs after their citation in the internal revenue code qtps initially allowed individuals to save for qualified higher education expenses qhees on taxdeferred basis the pension protection act of 2006 ppa made permanent the temporary enhancements to qtps contained in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 the enhancements include making qualified withdrawals from qtps taxfree one type of qtp prepaid tuition plans enables account owners to make payments on behalf of student beneficiaries for specified number of academic periodscourse units at current prices thereby providing hedge against tuition inflation states were the only sponsors of prepaid plans until congress extended sponsorship to eligible higher education private institutions effective in 2002 states remain the sole sponsor of the more popular type of section 529 program college savings plans which account for most of the 1057 billion in qtp assets as of december 31 2006 college savings plans can be used toward variety of qhees at any eligible institution regardless of which state sponsors the plan or where the beneficiary attends school in contrast if beneficiaries of statesponsored prepaid plans attend outofstate or private schools the programs typically pay the same tuition that would have been paid to an eligible instate public school also unlike prepaid plans in which the state plan invests the pooled contributions with the intent of at least matching tuition inflation college savings account owners can select from range of investment portfolios college savings plans thus offer the chance of greater returns than prepaid plans but they also could prove more risky additionally college savings plans charge fees eg enrollment fees and underlying mutual fund fees that lower returns more so for accounts opened through investment advisors eg sales charges the level of these fees visavis the tax savings the extent and manner of fee disclosure across plans and the role of federal regulators in this area was the subject of oversight during the 108th congress more recently the 109th congress included in the ppa enactment of section 529f it charges the secretary of the treasury with developing regulations to prevent abuse of section 529 and to carry out its purposes in general the internal revenue service currently is developing notice of proposed rule making which will include portions of the 1998 proposed regulation and antiabuse rules both types of section 529 programs have several features in common beyond qualified withdrawals being taxfree earnings not applied toward qhees eg the beneficiary forgoes college generally are taxable and subject to penalty the tax and penalty can be avoided if account owners designate new beneficiary who is an eligible relative of the original beneficiary account owners rather than beneficiaries

since the late 1980s an oftvoiced concern has been that the nations educational and training institutions may not be supplying enough persons with the heightened skill levels reportedly demanded by businesses indeed the demand for workers with at least bachelors degree has been growing and is projected to continue growing at more rapid rate than the demand for individuals with little if any postsecondary education1 at the same time the cost of higher education has risen to greater extent than average household income over the past two decades2 the trend has caused concern among members of congress that higher education is becoming less affordable for middleincome families in response to these trends congress has added panoply of tax benefits to supplement the traditional student financial aid system with the intention of encouraging human capital development by increasing the affordability of postsecondary school attendance among the tax incentives to promote higher education is the qualified tuition program qtp or section 529 program named for its place in the internal revenue code irc it provides favorable tax treatment to money accumulated for future payment of qualified higher education expenses although more states sponsored qtps after the small business job protection act of 1996 pl 104188 clarified their federal tax status the amendment of section 529 by the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 greatly increased the programs attractiveness among other temporary amendments to qtps egtrra made withdrawals from section 529 plans to pay qualified higher education expenses taxfree previously earnings on contributions to qtps had been allowed to grow on taxdeferred basis and their subsequent withdrawal to pay for qualified expenses had been taxable to comply with the congressional budget act of 1974 however pl 10716s amendments to section 529 and many other provisions in the irc sunset for tax years

postpl 10716 provisions it also addresses issues of recent concern associated with qtps the report discusses the interaction of section 529 plans with other tax incentives for postsecondary education as well the appendix tables a1 and a2 summarize section 529 prepaid tuition and college savings plans by state respectively as of december 2003 what is section 529 program states their agencies or their instrumentalities can establish and maintain tax exempt programs 1 that permit individuals to purchase tuition credits or certificates for use at eligible institutions of higher education4 on behalf of designated beneficiary which entitles the beneficiary to the waiver or payment of qualified higher education expenses or 2 that permit individuals to contribute to an account for the purpose of paying beneficiarys qualified higher education expenses qhees5 in addition to states eligible institutions of higher education can now offer the first type of qtp commonly called prepaid tuition plans states remain the sole tax exempt sponsors of college savings plans which is the name commonly applied to the second type of qtp according to section 529 of the irc payments to both types of qtps must be in cash eg not in the form of securities contributor may establish multiple accounts for the same beneficiary and an individual may be designated beneficiary of multiple accounts eg an account in college saving plan sponsored by state and another in state b originated by parent for child x or an account in prepaid tuition plan sponsored by state c that is originated by parent for child and an account in college savings plan sponsored by state d that is originated by 4 eligible institutions of higher education generally are those accredited public and private nonprofit postsecondary schools that offer bachelors associates graduate or professional degree or another recognized postsecondary credential as well as certain proprietary and vocational schools the institutions also must be eligible to participate in student aid programs of the us department of education 5 qhees are tuition fees books supplies and equipment required for enrollment or attendance at an eligible institution as well as room and board for students attending school at least halftime note pl 10716 further expanded the definition of qualified expenses to cover the cost of special needs services for special needs beneficiaries the legislation also raised the potential level of room and board expenses for students who attend eligible institutions at least halftime thus enabling qtps to pay for more of this qualified expense both these expansions are effective in tax year beginning after december 31 2001 crs3 grandparent of child but states may establish restrictions that are not mandated either by section 529 or by the proposed regulations issued in 1998 there generally are income caps on contributors unlike the limits that apply to taxpayers who want to claim hope scholarship and lifetime learning tax credits or who want to use coverdell education savings accounts the absence of an income limit on contributors likely makes section 529 programs particularly attractive to higher income families who also are likely to make aboveaverage use of the savings plans because persons with more income have greater propensity to save6 prepaid tuition plans prepaid tuition plan enables contributor eg parent grandparent and interested nonrelative to make lumpsum or periodic payments for specified number of academic periods or course units at current prices prepaid tuition programs thus provide hedge against tuition inflation statesponsored plans eighteen states sponsor the plans as of december 31 2006 prepaid tuition plans held about 156 billion in contributions and earnings7 if the beneficiary of statesponsored prepaid tuition contract eg child grandchild or someone not related to the contributor elects to attend an instate private college or an outofstate college the program typically will pay the students chosen institution the tuition it would have paid an instate public college which may be less than the chosen institutions tuition the specifics of prepaid tuition plans vary greatly from one state to another eg as to residency requirement age limitation on beneficiaries minimum and maximum contributions refund policies and state guarantee of rate of return and principal some plans reportedly have begun to cover room and board as well as tuition and related expenses8 see appendix table a1 for summary of the specific elements of statesponsored prepaid tuition programs including how the different programs calculate the value of contract if beneficiary attends private institution or an outofstate public institution plans of eligible institutions of higher education effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2001 one or more eligible higher education institutions including private institutions may establish and maintain prepaid tuition programs accorded the same federal tax treatment as statesponsored prepaid tuition plans some believe the expansion of the plans to include private institutions might help them recruit students who would otherwise have been deterred from 6 for information on the characteristics of contributors to section 529 programs see investment company institute profile of

charges it also has been suggested that the plans of private institutions might appeal to alumni who could boast theyve not only enrolled their offspring in their alma mater at birth but theyve already paid the tuition9 in early 2003 the notforprofit tuition plan consortium received regulatory approval to sell tuition certificates in its independent 529 plan it began accepting contributions later that year more than 240 colleges and universities ranging from research universities to small liberal arts colleges have agreed to participate in the plan certificate prepays share of beneficiarys tuition with the value of the share at particular institution depending upon its tuition level eg if in the year certificate in the amount of 10000 would pay for onehalf of the annual tuition and mandatory fees at college x or onethird of the annual tuition and fees at university then the certificate will be worth that same fraction regardless of schools tuition level at the time of enrollment beneficiaries do not commit to attending specific institutions at the time of prepayment and they may use the certificates at any participating school each year participating institutions will set discount from its current tuition and fees for purchasers of certificates with the plan setting minimum discount rate certificate cannot be used toward tuition and fees until three years from the date of purchase and it generally will expire upon the 30th anniversary of its purchase unless at least 500 is contributed by the end of the first two years after having purchased certificate the plan will cancel the certificate and refund contributions without interest the value of certificate adjusted for the plans investment performance plus nominal amount of interest cannot be refunded until one year from the date of purchase or upon the death of the designated beneficiary10 unlike either statesponsored prepaid tuition plans or college savings plans account owners of independent 529 plan tuition certificates do not pay administrative fees they are absorbed by the participating educational institutions11 college savings plans statesponsored college savings plans typically offer several predetermined investment options from which contributors can select eg portfolio of equities and bonds whose percent composition changes automatically as the beneficiary ages portfolio with fixed shares of equities and bonds or with guaranteed minimum rate of return unlike prepaid tuition plans the value of each savings account is based on the performance of the investment strategy chosen by the account owner number of explanations have been offered for the proliferation and popularity of this newer type of qtp it has been suggested that state officials regard college 9 jeff wuorio prepaying tuition offers peace of mind at price available at httpmoneycentralmsncomarticlesfamilycollege1462asp 10 description of the independent 529 plan submitted to the securities and exchange commission available online at httpwwwsecgovdivisionsinvestmentnoaction tuitionplan020403htm 11 see httpwwwindependent529planorg for additional information crs5 savings plans as way to offer people benefit with little cost to the state in contrast if state guarantees its prepaid tuition plan it assumes the risk that earnings on the plans pooled contributions will not match tuition inflation in which case the state must use other resources to satisfy the plans obligations12 another reason put forth this time from the contributors perspective is that the funds in college savings plan can be used toward the full range of qhees at any eligible institution regardless of which state sponsors the plan or where the contributor resides in addition some of the investment options of college savings plans offer account owners the possibility of greater returns than produced by the usually conservative investment strategy of prepaid tuition programs further college savings plans reportedly have increased in popularity as an employee benefit typically the employer contracts with mutual fund company and employees voluntary contributions are deducted from their paychecks13 few credit card companies also rebate percentage of purchases made by cardholders accumulated rebates periodically are transferred into particular college savings plans14 in part for these reasons all 50 states and the district of columbia offer college savings programs they accounted for more than 901 billion 85 of the 1057 billion held in 93 million qtp accounts as of december 31 200615 see appendix table a2 for summary of college savings plans by state recent issues by type of section 529 program college savings plans fees and disclosure states generally have turned to financial services companies eg the vanguard group tiaacref and merrill lynch to manage their college savings plans these firms charge account owners fees that are in addition to those states typically impose eg enrollment fee annual account maintenance fee and administrative fee the investment company fees which reduce returns generally are calculated as percentages of the assets in the basket of mutual

analyst morningstar inc in investing for the future 529 state tuition savings plans hearing before the subcommittee on capital continued crs6 directsold plans reportedly expenses are higher in most 529 plans than in equivalent mutual funds even among plans that arent sold by brokers and thus dont have high upfront loads or annual sales fees17 perhaps in response to the plethora of college savings plans and to the multiplicity of each plans investment choices contributors appear to have increased their use of commissioned brokers and financial advisors18 these intermediaries are the most frequently mentioned source of plan information among persons who have established college savings accounts19 additionally as shown in appendix table a2 some plans require residents of other states to buy their plans through brokers or financial advisors almost twothirds of college savings plans were sold by these intermediaries in 2003 with threefourths of new accounts coming from this source20 individuals who purchase college savings plans through brokers and financial advisors incur sales charges of up to 575 of account assets in addition to the fees imposed by the state plans and fund companies21 congressional oversight some members of congress became concerned about such things as the overall level of fees and the extent to which they offset the value of the tax benefit the lack of uniform disclosure across plans that impedes savers from making informed decisions and about what groups has regulatory authority in its march 2004 response to letter from house committee on financial services chairman oxley the securities and exchange commission sec explained that the plans generally are not regulated under federal securities laws because they are considered instrumentalities of their respective states22 as result those who enroll in 529 savings plans are not required to be provided the same quality of information as other mutual fund investors similarly the sec stated that investors in the statesponsored plans do not have to get the same periodic reporting as other mutual fund investors and that 529 investors encounter difficulty making comparisons across plans because of the lack of standardized disclosure of fees the sec went on to note however that the investment companies statesponsored plans hire to manage assets or provide advice as well as the brokerdealers and municipal securities dealers that sell shares in the plans are governed by applicable federal securities laws eg antifraud provisions and rules of the municipal securities 16

financial services subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government spending held hearing on these matters the complexity of the college savings plans fee structure and the lack of standardized disclosure were frequently raised by those who testified the chair of the college savings plan network cspn testified that the group had begun to develop voluntary disclosure guidelines in 200324 all states have implemented the first statement of disclosure principles which cspn adopted in december 2004 cspn adopted second statement of disclosure principles in july 2005 and it has been incorporated in the states offering materials the senate committee on governmental affairs subcommittee on financial management the budget and international security held oversight hearings on college savings on september 30 2004 nasd vice chairman and president of regulatory policy and oversight mary schapiro testified about the application of advertising rules to the marketing of investments that underlie college savings plans brokerdealers have been made to correct sales material they are required to file with the selfregulatory privatesector organization she also addressed the fact that some states accord preferential tax treatment to residents contributions to instate college savings plans and that an msrb rule states that brokerdealers must have reason to believe that the investments they recommend are suitable to the customer 2003 nasd investigation of the sales practices of six firms found however that most sold virtually all their 529 plan investments to customers who were not residents of the state sponsoring the plan25 upon expanding the investigation to additional firms in may 2004 and finding that most 529 plan sales involved the same practice schapiro reported that the nasd issued an investor alert she also noted the availability of 23 the nasd is the major privatesector regulator the us securities industry the msrb is the selfregulatory

testimony was given by the msrb senior associate general counsel ernesto lanza he discussed draft amendment to the msrbs advertising rule proposed in june 2004 which went into effect in december 2005 after the msrb filed the proposed rule change with the sec it is intended to improve the comparability of performance data across different statesponsored 529 savings plans mutual funds and other types of investments27 the msrb and nasd issued statement in february 2006 in which they agreed to cooperatively strive to promote consistency across regulations and interpretations regarding 529 plans in august 2006 the msrbs interpretive guidance about customer protection obligations of brokers dealers and municipals securities dealers marketing college savings plans became effective eg disclosure to clients of tax benefits offered by their home states 529 plans the sec similarly has continued to pursue its oversight of states that sponsor and firms that sell 529 savings plans in august 2005 for example the commission announced settlement of ceaseanddesist proceeding against the utah educational savings plan trust which had made false statements and omissions about errors in its operation system and accounting practices the sec also filed civil action against the trusts former director for violating securities laws in addition the commission released new section 529 investor guide that explains the different plans their disclosures tax implications and expenses28 in december 2005 the sec settled administrative and ceaseanddesist proceedings against american express financial advisors inc for its failure to disclose receipt of revenuesharing payments that resulted from distribution of certain shares of mutual funds and 529 college savings plans prepaid tuition plans closures and modifications due to the impact of the 2001 recession on state government support for higher education and of the coincident downturn in the stock market on plan performance many statesponsored prepaid plans in 2003 reported actuarial deficits in the millions to tens of millions of dollars meaning the plans assets are currently less than future tuition obligations there is major difference between having an actuarial deficit and cashflow issue however new participants will continue to join the programs current account holders will continue adding to their accounts

statesponsored plans that offer tuition contract for which they paid in full or for which they agreed to make payments over time are unlikely to be affected by rising tuition prices nonetheless number of states took preemptive measures for example colorados prepaid tuition plan was closed to new participants and contributions were not being accepted from existing participants ohio also closed its plan to new participants other states modified their prepaid plans by for example greatly increasing the value of tuition units30 tax treatment of qtp contributions and earnings there is federal income tax deduction for contributions to qtps about 26 states and the district of columbia allow residents who participate in their own states plan to claim partial or total state income tax deduction on contributions31 earnings on contributions to section 529 plans accumulate taxdeferred until withdrawn the deferral confers greater benefits on families with relatively high incomes because of their higher marginal tax rates simulations that compared potential aftertax accumulations in college savings plan to those in mutual funds employing the same asset allocation strategies generally found that the higher households tax bracket the greater the advantage of saving through section 529 plan32 the study concluded that other factors substantially affect the level of accumulations as well these factors are the investment expenses that alternative savings vehicles charge and the value of state income tax deduction if any on contributions to qtp subsequent analysis which took into account reductions in capital gains and dividend tax rates generally found that section 529 plans remained superior investment option33 qualified earnings distributions earnings withdrawn from section 529 plans to pay qhees became free from federal income tax effective in tax years starting after december 31 2001 for state sponsored programs and starting after december 31 2003 for programs of private institutions the federal taxexempt status of earnings withdrawals makes section 529 plans an even more attractive means of saving for higher education expenses for example student would pay nothing instead of incurring an 18000 federal tax bill on 120000 in earnings from contributions of 80000 to qtp made since the 30 albert b crenshaw quick fix for section 529 plans

might especially benefit older students who have relatively high incomes eg beneficiary employed fulltime or with spouse employed fulltime who is pursuing an advanced degree or who is taking courses to update the skills used in hisher current occupation or to learn new skills in order to change occupations as shown in the appendix tables the majority of states now provide residents tax break on qualified earnings distributions from section 529 plans the federal tax exemption likely spurred some of these states to begin to do so only few states extend the tax exemption on qualified earnings to residents that invest in other states qtps35 penalty plans must impose more than minimis penalty on the earnings portion of distributions that exceed or are not used for qhees eg the beneficiary does not attend college36 effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2001 withdrawals of excess earnings continue to be taxable income to the distributee eg account owner or beneficiary and subject to an additional tax of 10 absent certain circumstances37 as clarified by the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107 147 the new tax penalty does not apply to earnings distributions that are included in income but used for qhees for example withdrawal is made from qtp in the amount of 2000 which is equal to students qhees in given year because higher education tax credit of 500 is claimed the coordination rule requires that the credit amount be subtracted from the qhee total 2000 500 1500 as consequence 500 of the qtp withdrawal becomes subject to taxation but not to the additional 10 tax penalty see the section below for more information on the interaction between section 529 plans and other higher education tax incentives effective after december 31 2002 the 10 tax penalty also longer applies to withdrawals made when beneficiary attends the us military academy the us naval academy the us air force academy the us coast guard academy or the us merchant marine academy the amount of the withdrawals must be less than 34 joseph f hurley planning strategies under the education provisions of the new tax act journal of financial planning september 2001 35 carol marie cropper and anne tergesen college savings plans come of age business week march 12 2001 36 plans still may collect for themselves the penalty that prior federal law required however some observers have commented that the modest revenue the penalties have afforded states is outweighed by their administrative burden in addition the practice would create competitive disadvantage unless all states continued it 37 the conditions under which an account owner is not subject to penalty on refund of excess earnings are the beneficiarys death or disability or the beneficiarys receipt of scholarship veterans educational assistance allowance or other nontaxable payment for educational purposes excluding gift or inheritance crs11 the costs of advanced education in order to avoid the penalty this amendment is part of the military family tax relief act of 2003 pl 108121 transfer tax provisions for section 529 plans investment control and the tax consequences of transferring funds between section 529 plans neither account owners nor beneficiaries are allowed to direct the investment of contributions to or associated earnings from section 529 plan according to the proposed regulations published on august 24 1998 in the federal register 63 fr 45019 contributors are permitted at the time they establish an account to choose prepaid tuition plan college savings program or both if they select the college savings program they then can choose among its investment options the statutory restriction on investment control had been considered major drawback of qtps but it was significantly loosened on september 7 2001 bulletin notice 200155 the internal revenue service irs issued special rule that permits contributors to section 529s college savings programs to move balances once per calendar year from one investment strategy to another within the states offerings without incurring taxes and without changing beneficiaries account owners also can on taxfree basis move balances among states investment offerings if they change beneficiaries changing beneficiaries section 529 of the code allows qtp distributions to occur without tax consequences if the funds are transferred to the account of new beneficiary who is family member of the old beneficiary in order to receive this tax treatment the new beneficiary must be one of the following family members 1 the spouse of the designated beneficiary 2 or daughter or their descendants 3 stepchildren 4 brother sister stepbrother or stepsister 5 father or mother or their ancestors 6 stepfather or stepmother 7 niece or nephew 8 an aunt or uncle 9 soninlaw daughterinlaw fatherinlaw motherinlaw brotherin law or sisterinlaw 10 the spouse of an individual referenced in 29 or 11 any first cousin of the designated beneficiary first cousins are covered by the definition in tax years starting after december 31 2001 the expansion to first cousins makes qtps more attractive to grandparents who can transfer an account between cousins that is between their grandchildren and thereby avoid paying federal income tax and penalty on non qualified distributions if say the original beneficiary decides not to go to college38 38 stephanie auwerter the 529 basics smartmoneycom june 8 2001 available at httpwwwsmartmoneycomconsumerindexcfmstory200106083 crs12 samebeneficiary rollovers taxfree transfers from one qtp to another for the same beneficiary can occur once in any 12month period39 the same beneficiary rollover permits contributors to make taxfree transfers between prepaid tuition plan and college savings plan offered by the same state and between state and private prepaid tuition plan perhaps more importantly according to some observers the amendment to section 529 made permanent by the ppa provides an account owner with the opportunity for greater control over the investment of hisher funds without changing beneficiaries an account owner could for example make samebeneficiary rollover into the program of another state with an investment strategy the contributor prefers to those offered by the original states program40 coordination of contributions with estate gift and generationskipping transfer taxes contributors to section 529 plans rather than beneficiaries maintain control over the accounts in other words contributors can change the beneficiary or have the plan balance refunded to them this feature has been touted as significant advantage of saving for college through qtp as opposed to custodial account opened under the uniform gifts to minors act ugma or the uniform transfers for minors act utma or through coverdell education savings account these savings vehicles ultimately are owned by the child the child also can use them for whatever purpose they chose upon gaining control of the funds41 nonetheless the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra pl 10534 declared that payments to section 529 plans made after august 1997 are completed gifts of present interest from the contributor to the beneficiary as result an individual can contribute up to 12000 in tax year 2007 as taxfree gift per qtp beneficiary this amount of taxfree gift is subject to indexation special gifting provision for contributions to section 529 plans could make them of interest to individuals with substantial resources and to families with children who will be attending college in the nottoodistant future qtp contributor may make an excludable gift of up to 60000 in 2007 for example by 39 this is perbeneficiary limit rather than peraccount limit if more than one account of beneficiary is rolled over in 12month period it would represent nonqualified distribution that is subject to taxation susan t brat planning for college using section 529 savings accounts the practical tax lawyer winter 2002 40 kristin davis miracle grow kiplingers personal finance september 2001 and httpwwwsavingforcollegecom 41 about 32 states allow parents to fund qtps with money from custodial accounts custodial 529 plans retain some features of the original accounts eg savings still belong to the child there also could be tax consequences to funding qtps in this manner due to the requirement that qtps accept only cash contributions ie the sale of investments in custodial accounts could produce capital gains that would be subject to taxation penelope wang education yes theres still college money december 2001 and anne tergesen what about those custodial accounts business week march 11 2002 crs13 treating the payment as if it were made over five years thus each grandparent could contribute 60000 for total of 120000 to each grandchilds qtp in tax year 2007 which potentially would allow more earnings to accumulate than if each had contributed 12000 annually for five years in this instance assuming the taxfree gift annual limit remained at 12000 over the period the two grandparents could not make another excludable gift to those account beneficiaries until 2012 by making qtp contributions completed gifts the tra also generally removed the value of the payments from the contributors taxable estate an exception occurs however if contributor who selected the fiveyear advance exclusion option dies within the period irs rulemaking potential for abuse of section 529 accounts at the same time that the ppa permanently extended the egtrra amendments to section 529 the 2006 act added section 529f it provides that the secretary of the treasury shall prescribe regulations to prevent abuse of 529 accounts the joint committee on taxation jct gave two examples of abuse in its technical explanation of the bill jcx3806 abuse might arise because account owners can change beneficiaries without inducing transfer tax payments for example taxpayer establishes several accounts for different beneficiaries and contributes to each using the fiveyear rule discussed above with the ultimate purpose of changing the beneficiaries to one individual and distributing to that beneficiary the combined account balance without further transfer tax consequences the jct also noted that abuse might arise because taxpayer endeavors to use qtp like retirement account but section 529 does not have the same requirements and restrictions as retirement accounts the irs on march 3 2008 published in internal revenue bulletin 20089 an advance notice of rule making requesting that comments be submitted by march 18 the notice of proposed rule making nprm is expected to include general anti abuse rule that will apply when section 529 accounts are established or used for purposes of avoiding or evading transfer tax the nprm also will include rules relating to the tax treatment of contributions to and participants in qtps including rules addressing the inconsistency between section 529 and the generally applicable income and transfer tax provisions of the code in addition the nprm will contain rules about the function and operation of the programs drawing in part on regulations proposed in 1998 notice 200155 concerning the statutory restriction against investment direction notice 200181 concerning recordkeeping reporting and other requirements and instructions related to form 1099q payments from qualified education programs under section 529 and 530 crs14 interaction with other higher education tax incentives contributions can be made to qtp and coverdell education savings account in the same year for the same beneficiary42 before january 1 2002 however sameyear contributions to qtp and coverdell account on behalf of the same beneficiary were considered an excess payment to the latter and therefore subject to income tax and penalty43 the hope scholarship and lifetime learning credits can be claimed for tuition and fees in the same year that taxfree distributions are made from section 529 plan or coverdell account provided that the distributions are not used toward the same expenses for which the credits are claimed44 if distributions are taken from section 529 plan and coverdell account on behalf of the same student egtrra further requires that qhees remaining after reduction for the education tax credits must be allocated between the two savings vehicles egtrra also initiated an abovetheline income tax deduction for tuition and fees effective in tax years starting after december 31 2001 and ending before january 1 2006 the deduction was last extended until january 1 200845 it can be taken for qualified expenses paid with the contributions portion of withdrawals from section 529 program 42 sameyear contributions to qtp and coverdell account for the same beneficiary could have gifttax consequences if the payment to the two savings vehicles exceeds the annual limit on gifts in one year
