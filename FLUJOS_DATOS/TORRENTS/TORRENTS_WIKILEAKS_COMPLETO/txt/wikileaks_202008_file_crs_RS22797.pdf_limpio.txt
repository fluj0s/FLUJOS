2007 and seafood safety 1991 both national academy of sciences institute of medicine food and nutrition boardpublished data for approx imately 3550 reported outbreak s of foodborne illness that occurred during calendar year s 2004 thr ough 2006 causative food vehicle was reported for about 1900 of the outbreaks of these seafood finfish or she llfish was reported as vehicle in 310 16 of the 1900 outbreaks in comparison red meats were reported in 325 17 outbreaks and poultry in about 290 153 to put these data in context annual us per capita consumption of seafood was about 16 pounds in 2005 compared with 110 pounds for red meats and 74 pounds for poultry4 however an average outbreak related to seafood consumption generally affects smaller number of people ie fewer individual cases per outbreak naturally occurring toxins were involved in more than half of all seafoodassociated outbreaks with known or suspected causes in 20042006 such toxins are primarily ciguatera from certain tropical reefdwelling finfish and scombroid poisoning which develops in some species after harvest due to inadequate refrigeration other common problems are norovirus the bacterium vibrio parahaemolyticus in raw shellfish and various other pathogens such as clostridium botulinum in processed seafood products the institute of medicine i om has cited other risks of consuming seafood that of high levels of chemical and heavy metal pollutants from the environment such as mercury lead polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and pe sticides some of these problems such as high mercury levels are more evident in car nivorous fish at the top of the food chain such as shark swordfish and bluefin tuna5 but the iom also has noted that it has been difficult to quantify the risks of some of these hazards due to incomplete data the complexity of dietary and nondietary conta minant exposures and the fact that certain health effects such as cancer develop over much longer period than microbial illnesses6 worldwide onethird of all seafood now comes from aquaculture as producers seek to meet rising seafood demand at time when wild stock production has leveled off at 90 to 95 million metric tons annua lly aquacultured farmraised seafood also may contain high levels of potentially harmful chemical s this was illustrated on june 28 2007 when the food and drug administration fda in th us

processors for example 72 in 10 countries in fy2005 focusing on those that ar major exporters to the united states and on developing countries less likely to have sophisticated safeguards fda is exploring the potential use of third parties to certify foreign processors of aquacultured shrimp for compliance with fdas seafood haccp regulations fda has developed pilot program to collect inform

participants also must meet examples include onsite noaa insp ections during production hours certification that plants or vessels meet specified sanitation requirements quality inspections of individual product lots andor laboratory testing of produc ts among other services these services are provided on feeforservice basis and entitle participants to use various official grading and labeling marks which are viewed as making their products more attractive to buyers in 2006 noaa reported active seafood inspection program contracts with 377 firms although the par ticipant number changes constantly the additional number of foreign participants cu rrently more than 50 has increased recently due to such firms desire to comply with requirements of the fda import alert on aquacultured products from china the number of participating firm s is small fraction of all seafood facilities but they produce significant portion of the total volume in 2006 the noaa voluntary program inspected 19 billion pounds or 33 of the total seafood consumed in the united states14 selected legislation in congress until the mid1990s through the 104th congress many seafood safety proposals sought to put fish inspection on par with that of meat and poultry usdas fsis is required under the federal meat in spection act fmia 21 usc 601 et seq and the poultry products inspection act ppia 21 usc 451 et seq to inspect all livestock and poultry both before and after they are slaughte red and to be present whenever plants are processing meat and poultry products15 jurisdictional differences were among the reasons previous bills were not enacted usda and the house and senate agriculture committees have long been responsible for meat and poultry inspection while fda the senate committee on health ducation labor and pensions help and the house committee on energy and commerce have claimed jurisdiction over the safety of seafood and other foods others such as the senate committee on comme rce science and transportation also have had roles seafood safety began to garner new atte ntion in 2007 following number of reports of contaminated foods some from foreign s ources entering the food supply numerous congressional hearings and dia reports in 2007 brought wi der public recognition of the role foreign producers now play in mee ting us demand for fish and shellfish underlining this awareness was the issuance of the food and water watch report in may 2007 and the fda action on chinese seafood in june 2007 2007 fda legislation wideranging fda legisla tion pl 11085 adopted in 2007 includes provision 1006 requiring re port to congress in 2008 that describes the specifics of the seafood inspection prog ram the feasibility of developing traceability systems for

110234 with section 11016b that newly designates catfish as defined by the secretary of agriculture as an amenable species that is subject to mandatory inspection under the fmia the amendment w ill apply to companies that process catfish for food it also directs usda to take into account the conditions under which the catfish is raised and transported to processing establishment and to consult with fda the inspection provision reportedly was urged by the us catfish industry which has faced strong competitive pressure from foreig n catfish producers particularly in asia where us interests allege unacceptable type s and levels of veterinary drugs are more frequently used the conference report states the intent of congress that catfish be subject to continuous inspection and that im ported catfish inspecti on programs be found to be equivalent under usda re gulations before foreign catfi sh may be imported into the united states the report also noted that the secretary already has authority under the fmia to mandate inspection for other seaf ood species if he d eems it appropriate also 11016a amends the agricultural ma rketing act of 1946 7 usc 1622 to require usda to establish voluntary gradin g program for catfish which producers could opt into and pay for with user fees as exists in other usda quality grading programs authorized by the 1946 act the section furt

committee marked up on april 24 2008 the commercial seafood consumer protection act s 2688 the committeea pproved bill would require the hhs and commerce departments to cooperate on examining nd testing seafood imports coordinating inspections of foreign facilities providing for expedited entry for those with good safety records increasing seafood testing laboratories and conducting more oversight of problem exporters and their c ountries among other provisions other bills include s 2914 on actions to be taken when seafood imports are refused us entry hr 3077 to require seafood
