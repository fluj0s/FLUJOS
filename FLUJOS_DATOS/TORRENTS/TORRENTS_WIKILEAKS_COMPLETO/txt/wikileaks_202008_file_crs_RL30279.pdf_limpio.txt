fy1999 are estimated at 2161 billion net outlays after deduction of beneficiary premiums are estimated at 1946 billion the program consists of two distinct parts part hospital insurance program and part b supplementary medical insurance program part is financed by payrol l taxes paid by current workers and their employers part b is financed by combination of monthly pr emiums levied on current beneficiaries and federal general revenues beneficiary premiums account for 25 of part b costs medicare part provides coverage for hospital services posthospital skille d nursing facility services and home health care part b provides coverage fo r physicians services laboratory services durable medical eq uipment and other medical services benefits are generally provided under the traditional medicare progra m sometimes known as feeforservice dicare under this program beneficiaries obtain covered services through the providers of their choice and medicare make s payments for each service rendered ie feefor service the amount of payment per service is generally subject to certain limits in recent years the program has bee n modified number of times to expand the types of services paid on prospectiv rather than feeforservice basis under prospective payment methodology predetermined payment is made for each episode of care regardless of the scope and mix of services used in each individual case medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in both parts and b may elect t receive their medicare services through managed care arrangement under th medicarechoice progra m rather than through the traditional medicare program under medicarechoice also known as medicare part c beneficiaries voluntarily enroll with an entity typically health maintenance organization which has agreed to assume the risk for providing all of medicares covered services for each enrolled beneficiary in return medicare makes monthly pred etermined payment to the plan this predetermined payment is fixed and does not vary by the amount of resource s used over its 33year history medicare has provided important protections fo r millions of ameri cans however the program is facing number of problems one of the most pressing concerns is the fact that medicares financing structure will be unable to sustain it in the long run many are also concerned that the program s structure which in large measure ref lects both the health care delivery system as well as political considerations in effect at the time of enactment has failed to keep pace with the changes in the health system as whole related concern is whether th benefits s tructure adequately responds to the health care needs of todays aged andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30279crs2 for further discussion of this issue see crs report rl30147 medicare prescriptio n1 drug coverage for beneficiaries by jennifer osullivan and crs report rl30250 medicare prescription drug proposals by jennifer osullivandisabled populations one of the most notable coverage gaps is the absence f coverage for most outpatient prescription drugs in respon to these concerns number of observers have recommende d significant reforms to the current medicare program on june 29 1999 presiden t clinton announc ed the presidents plan to modernize and strengthen medicare for the 21 century on july 2 1999 the white house issued detailed description ofst this plan prepared by the national economic council and the domestic polic council there is legislation incorporating the presidents proposal administration representatives have indicated that they expect to work with th congress in drafting bill language the presidents plan contai ns several key components it would establish new prescription drug benefit and make number f other benefit modifications it would also create new competitive defined benefit program that would change the wa medicarechoice managed care plans are pa id it would provide for the modification and extension of certain policies incorporated in the balanced budget act of 199 7 bba 97 further the proposal would incorporate number of changes in th traditional feeforservice ffs program which are designed to make the progra m more effici ent the following is summary of the presidents plan based on the july 2 1999 document this summary is limited by the information currently available at the conclusion of this report are the cost estimates of the presidents proposal made by the administration and by the congressional budget office cbo according to t he administration the net 10year fy2000fy2009 cost of its plan is 457 billion cbo estimates the net 10year cost at 1111 billion the majo r difference between the two estimates is the cost of the prescription drug proposal the administration estimate is 1188 billion the cbo estimate is 1682 billion the proposal also includes financing provision which is not linked to th reform package it would dedicate po rtion of the budget surplus 328 billion over 10 years to medicare solvency the administration estimates this would extend the solvency of the part trust fund from 2015 to 2027 medicare benefit expansions prescription drug benefit1 benefit design medicare currently has very limited outpatient prescription drug benefit the proposal would establish new optional outpatient prescriptio n drug benefit under newly established part d in general all therapeutic classes f drugs would be covered drugs currently covered under part b would continue to be paid under the part b program there would be part d deductible the planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30279crs3 would pay 50 of drug costs beginning with the first prescription filled up to specified maximum beneficiaries would be liable for the remaining 50 the program would be phased in over the 20022008 period in 2002 an d 2003 the federal g overnment would pay up to maximum of 1000 per person per year accounting for the first 2000 in spending in 2004 and 2005 the government would pay up to 1500 accounting for 3000 in spending in 2006 and 2007 i t would pay up to 2000 accounting for 4000 in spending in 2008 it would pay up to 2500 accounting for 5000 in spend ing beginning in 2009 the limit would be increased by the increase in the consumer price index the administratio n estimates that 90 of beneficiaries would not reach the cap when the program was fully implemented financing beneficiaries would pay prem ium equal to 50 of program costs the remaining 50 would be paid by the federal government the administratio n estimates that the premium for 2002 would be 24 per month ri sing to 44 per month in 2008 cb which has estimated higher overall cost for the drug benefi t estimates that the monthly premium would be 2520 per month in 2002 rising t 5290 per mont h in 2008 premiums would be collected in the same way as part b premiums f or most persons this is deduction from monthly social security checks enrollment coverage would be xtended to all persons otherwise eligible for medicare who enroll in part d pers ons would only have one chance to enroll for current benef iciaries there would be an open enrollment period for the first year the program is in effect 2002 for other persons the enrollment opportunity woul d generally occur when an individ ual first becomes eligible for medicare there would be two exceptions beneficiaries who are covered by their employer while stil l working or by an employer of working spouse would have onetime enrollment opportuni ty after retirement or after retirement or death of the working spouse beneficiaries covered under retiree health plan would have onetime enrollment opportunity if the former employer drops retiree drug coverage man agement payments beneficiary protections the secretary woul d contract with private entities who would competitively bid to administer the new drug benefit in geographic region only one contract would be awarded in each region entities that could compete for the contract include pharmacy benefit manager s pbms retail drug chains health plans or insurers states through mechanism s established for medicaid or multiple entities in collaboration such as alliances f pharmac ies provided the collaboration is not anticompetitive the entit administering benefit for an area would negotiate prices process claims an d implement drug utilization review programs all pbms or similar entities would be required to meet access and quality standards established by the secretary under the proposal medicare would not set prices for drugs prices would be determined through negotiations between the benefit managers for an area and drug manufacturers it is expected that this process would res ult in discounts the proposal would require that beneficiaries would continue to have access to prices established by the benefit manager even after they had exceeded the caphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30279crs4 benefit managers co uld use various cost containment tools in administering the program subject to limitations and guidelines set in the contract they would b permitted to use formularies the are lists of drugs preferred by plans sponsor in part on the basis of costs however benefi ciaries would be guaranteed access to off formulary drugs when medically necessary and hav appeal rights when coverage was denied private benefit managers would also be authorized to create appropriat incentives for generic substitution benefit managers would be required to enter i nto contracts with pharmacies that meet set of qualifications including having necessary infor mation systems to process electronic pointofsale transactions and create utilization records negotiate d dispensin g fees would have to be high enough to assure participation by mos t pharmacies the government rather than the benefit manager would bear most of the risk for cost and utilization of services und er the benefit the benefit manager would be paid fee for managing the benefit and would have som contractual incentives to control costs and utilization enrollees in managed care plans would receive their benefit through th medicar echoice plans for the first time these plans would be paid directly fo r providing drug coverage assistance for low income under current law medicare beneficiaries with incomes below 100 of poverty have their medicare costsharing and part b premium charges paid by the medicaid program with the federal and stat governments sharing in the costs these persons are known as qualified medicare beneficiaries qmbs persons with incomes between 100 and 120 of poverty have their part b premium charges paid by medicaid under th specified lowincome medicare beneficiary slimb program in certain cases persons below 135 of poverty can qualify for payment of their part b premiums some of these person s may also be entitled to full medicaid coverage all states provide prescription dru g coverage to persons entitled to full medicaid benefits medicaid prescription dru g coverage is not available for the qmbonly or slimbonly populations the proposal would make available part d protection for all beneficiaries including the low income medicare would therefore pick up some costs currentl paid by medicaid under the proposal medicaid would pay the part d dru g premiums and cost sharing charges for benefi ciaries up to 100 of poverty using the current federalstate matching rate beneficiaries with incomes between 100 an d 135 of poverty would have their part d cost sharing and premium charges pai d 100 by the federal government persons with incomes between 135 and 150 of poverty would pay partial sliding scale premium based on income full federa l funding would be provided for the remaining cost sharing incentives to retain employerprovided drug benefits the proposal would provide partial drug premium subsidy to employers whose retiree health coverage for drugs is at least as good as the part d benefit the subsidy would equal 67 of the amoun t that would otherwise be provided to the private benefit manager fo r medicare part d enrollees the health care financing administration hcfa thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30279crs5 agency that administers medicare would make these premium subsidy payments to the health plan or pbm used by the employer improving preventive benefits eliminating preventive services co stsharing most services covered under medicare part b are subject to 100 deductible and 20 coinsurance som preventive services are exempt from either or both of these requirements th proposal would extend the waiver of the part b deductible and 20 coinsurance to all preventive services therefore the deductible would be waived for hepatitis b vaccinations colorectal cancer screening bone mass measurements prostate cancer screening and di abetes selfmanagement benefits coinsurance would be waived for screening mammography pelvic examinations hepatitis b vaccinations colorecta l cancer screening bone mass measurements prostate cancer screening and diabetes selfmanagement benefits information campaign on prevention the proposal would provide for the dhhs to launch 2year nationwide education campaign beginning in 2001 t promote the preventive use of health services by older americans and people wit h disabilities th campaign would consist of three parts first the public and private sector would combine public service and print media campaigns to educate l americans 50 and over and disabled persons about t he importance of preventive care second the campaign would provide medicare beneficiaries with information about the import ance of using medicares preventive benefits this would be done i n several ways including distributing compr ehensive information to all beneficiaries and developing health status selfassessment tool f or beneficiaries third dhhs would launch campaign to prevent falls in the elderly in order to reduce the incidence of injury us preventive serv ices task force study the proposal would require the secretary of dhhs to direct the us preventive services task force to conduct series of new studies t hese studies would identify preventive interventions that can be safely delivered in the primary care setting that are most valuable to olde r americans demonstration of smoking cessation nd counseling hcfa would launch demonstration project to evaluate the most successful and costeffective means of providing smoking cessation services to beneficiaries changes in costsharing and medigap coinsurance for clinical laboratory services as noted ab ove most services covered under medicare part b are subject to 100 deductible and 20 coinsurance however there are costsharing charges for clinical laborator services the proposal would apply the 20 coinsurance requirement to all clinical laboratory services except those which are also preven tive services eg pap smears the requirement would apply beginning in 2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30279crs6 for further disc ussion of medigap see crs report rl30094 medicare supplementary2 medigap coverage by jennifer osullivanpart b deductible the part b deductible is 100 when the program began in 1965 the deductible was 50 it was raised to 60 in 1973 75 in 1982 and 100 in 1991 the propos would provide for an annual inflation adjustment beginning in 2002 updating and expanding medigap options beneficiaries can obtain private insurance to supplement medicares benefits these individually purchased policies are known as medigap benefici aries with medigap insurance typically have coverage for medicares deductibles and coinsurance they may also have coverage for some items and services not covered by medicare individuals generally select from 1 of 10 standardized plans known as plan through plan j though not all 10 plans are offered in all states only 3 of the 10 plans plans h i and j offer some coverage for prescription drugs bba 97 added two high deductible plans to the list of 1 0 standard plans with the exception of the high deductible feature the benefit package under the high deductible plan will be the same as plan f or plan j2 the proposal would request the national association of insuranc commissioners naic to create medigap plan option which would mak beneficiaries themselves rather than medigap liable for some of medicares cost sharing charges at the same time the policy would protect them against catastrophic costs the proposal would also authorize review of the 10 standardized policies particularly the drug benefit provisions report on policy options for supplemental coverage the proposal would require the secretary to prepare detailed report to congress on policy options for improving supplemental coverage access to medigap the proposal would improve access to medigap policies as follows 1open enrollment for the aged and disabled current law establishes an open enroll ment period for the aged all medigap insurers are required to offer open enrollment for 6 months from the date person first enrolls in part b generally when an individual turns 65 there is guaranteed open enrollment period for the nonaged disabled population the proposa l would extend the 6month guaranteed open enrollment requirement to new disabled and end stage renal disease esrd beneficiaries 2special open enrollment period for certain beneficiaries bba 9 7 provided 63day open enrollment period for benef iciaries in managed care plans that terminate t heir medicare contracts or reduce their service areas applicati on of the open enrollment period was first triggered in januar 1999 however not all insurers were able to provide the necessar information to beneficiaries the proposal w ould establish special 90day open enrollment period for persons who were affected by the january 1 1999 plan terminations or service area reductionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30279crs7 3expanding choice of medigap plans during special enrollment periods bba 97 established special open enrollment periods for medigap unde r certain circumstances including cases where the enrollees managed care plan terminates the contract beneficiaries in these situations ar guaranteed enrollment only in plans b c and f none of these offers prescription drug coverage the proposal would expand th requirement to include access to all medigap options 4increase in penalty for violation of open enrollment requirement currently issuers who viola the open enrollment requirement are subject to civil monetary penalty cmp of 5000 for each violation th proposal would increase the amount to 50000 plus 5000 per day pe r violation medicare buyin for certain people ages 5564 medi care buyin for persons ages 6264 medicare coverage is currentl limited to persons who are age 65 and over and persons who are permanently an d totally disabled the proposal would permit persons ages 6264 without access to employer sponsored insurance to buy into medicare they would pay for this early coverage in part during the period they were receiving the early coverage and in part after they turned age 65 individu als would pay base premium during the time they received early coverage prior to age 65 this premium is estimated at 300 pe r month when they turned age 65 they would l onger pay the base premium they would however pay premium estimated at 10 to 20 per month for each year of early participation this premium would be added to the regular part b premiu m which is currently 4550 per month medicare buyin for displaced workers ages 5562 the proposal would offer coverage to persons who involuntarily lose their jobs and health care coverage individuals choosing this option would be required to pa the full premium at the time they were receiving early coverage access to coverage for retirees whose employers terminate coverage the proposal would permit retirees age 55 and older whose employers terminat health insurance coverage to extend cobra coverage until the medicare eligibility age of 65 the cobra law requires employers to allow certain former employees to buy into the employersponsored health plan for up to 36 months competitive defined benefit most medicare beneficiaries obtain covered health services through the original ffs program also known as traditional medicare under the ffs program beneficiaries obtain co vered services through providers of their choice and medicare pays for each ser vice or package of services rendered some medicare beneficiaries elect to obtain their medicare services through managed care arrangement such as health maintenance organization instead of through the ffs program manage d care arrangements providing services to medicare beneficiaries are known shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30279crs8 for discussion of the method used to calculate mc payment rates see crs report 973 859 epw medicare payments to hmos and other private plans under th medicarechoice program by madeleine smithmedicarechoice plans these plans receive monthly capitation payment fro m medicare in return they have agreed to assume the risk for paying for all f medicares covered services for each enrolled beneficiary the administration proposal would create new competitive defined benefi t cdb program that would change the way medicarechoice mc plans are paid under the current mc program plans re ceive payments that are based on formula contained in bba 97 payments are set by co unty and equal the maximum of floor amount minimum update amount or blended amount subject to budge t neutrality provision if the mc payment rate exceeds the plans estimated costs of providing m edicare covered services to enrollees the plan must increase benefits or decrease costsharing to cover the difference3 the cdb program would alter the payment mechanism to inject price an d quality competition among managed care plans into medicare instead of receiving fixed payment and varying ben efits so that payments equal costs the new program would fix benefits and allow costs to vary each plan would determine its cost f providing coverage for defined set of medicare benefits including the subsidize d prescription drug coverage described above medicare beneficiaries would the n select among plans based on cost and quality beneficiaries would have the option to choose plans that can offer coverage with or lower premium than th traditio nal part b premium according to the administration the cdb progra m would help make beneficiaries more price sensitive and would encourage them t choose the highest quality most efficient health plan option that suits their needs beneficiaries would select plans during an open enrollment period each year note that government payments to medi cal savings account msa plans and private ffs plans would remain the same as under current law for the first few years of the new system beneficiary premiums based on choice of managed care plan currently all medicare beneficiaries including those who enroll in mc plans pay the same part b premium under the cdb program that would be effective in 2003 beneficiary premiums for medicare cove rage could vary if beneficiary chose managed care plan with price lower than average traditional medicare cost s including the cost of drugs if the bene ficiary has elected coverage of drugs under the new part d the beneficiarys part b premium would be reduced if the beneficiary chose plan with price that was higher than traditional medicare costs th beneficiarys part b premium would b higher if beneficiary chose managed care plan with price about equal to the average traditional program costs th beneficiarys part b premium would remain unchang ed beneficiaries choosing to stay in traditional medicare would pay their part b premium as they do under current lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30279crs9 under current law managed care plans would receive about 96 of traditional medicar e4 costs in 2003 this 4 discount is based on the traditional 5 reduction for managed care savings the mandatory reductions in the national mc g rowth percentage of 008 percentage points in 1998 and 05 percentage points each year from 1999 through 2002 and n approximate 4 increase due to lack of readju stment for overestimation of cost increases for 1997 assuming beneficiary opts for managed care the amo unt he or she pays in part b premiums would depend on the plans price relative to the costs of traditiona l medicare the part d premium for prescription drugs would also be included in this calculation for participating beneficiaries beneficiar ies choosing managed care plan with price equal to 96 of traditional medicare would pay the same current law4 part b premium and part d premium if applicable beneficiaries choosing pla n that is mo re costly than 96 of traditional medicare would pay the part b premium plus the full amount of the difference between the plans price and 96 of the costs of traditional medicare beneficiaries choosing plan that is less costly than 96 of traditional medicare could keep 75 of the sa vings the government would retain the remaining 25 the administr ation estimates that beneficiaries choosing plan that is at or below about 80 of the costs of traditional medicare would pay part b premium it should be noted that the beneficia ry premium is affected by geographic adjustment as discussed below government payments based on plan prices government payments to managed care plans would be determined in two steps first private plans meeting medicare participation criteria would bid on medicares defined set of benefits including the new prescription drug and prevention benefits plans could alter slightly the defined benefits they could reduce or eliminate cos t sharing for medica re benefits so long as the value of this reduction does not exceed 10 of the value of the defined medicare benefits package they could offe r supplemental benefits and charge an additional supplemental premium for thes benefits as is permitted under mc today while this practice could continue th supplements would not count towards the price used to establish the governmen t payment and thus would not be subsidized second the plan price would be compared to the cost of traditional medicar for an average beneficiary the gove rnment payment level would reach its maximum for plan whose price is equal to 96 of the cost of traditional medicare th government contribution would stay at this maximum for plans with prices equal to or greater t han 96 of the cost of traditional medicare for plans with costs below 96 of traditional medicare the government payment would be reduced by 25 of the differe nce between the cost of the plan and 96 of the costs of traditiona l medicare the governments contribution would vary as percent of total plan price for plans whose price is below about 80 of the costs of traditional medicare th governmen t would pay 100 of the price and beneficiaries would pay nothing t enroll in the plan for plans whose price falls between 80 and 96 of the costs of traditional medicare the dollar amount of the government contribution woul dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30279crs10 part b premiums are expected to represent about 12 of total costs for parts and b i n5 2003 under current lawincrease as plan prices increase but the government contribution would fall as percent of the total price beneficiary premiums would increase as well th government contribution would be capped for plans whose prices re at or above 96 of the costs of tradition medicare increased beneficiary premiums would fund the difference between plan price and 96 of traditional medicare costs for these high cost plans for these higher cost plans the percent of the price funded by th government would fall as plan prices rise table 1 illustrates beneficiary and government payments for managed care and ffs plans in an area with costs comparable to those nationwide in this example beneficiaries who enroll in the ffs plan pay the part b premium 720 or 12 f total costs and the government pays the remainder 5280 beneficiaries wh o5 select managed care plan with total cost that is equal to 96 of the ffs cost s 5760 would also pay the part b premium of 720 the government would pay the remaind er 5040 beneficiaries who elect managed care plans with total cost s below 5760 would pay lower part b premiums and the government contribution would be lower than 5040 those in managed care plans with total costs abov 5760 would pay part b premiums above 720 but the government contributio n would remain at the cap of 5040 note that under this program beneficiarie s enrolling in managed care plan with costs of 5900 which are lower than ff s costs would pay 860 in part b premiums which are higher than the ffs part b premium this result stems from the 4 government discount built into the payment structure and the cap on government contributions ie 5040 in table 1 table 1 example of beneficiary premiums and government payments plan cost ffs premium share contribution sharetotal of beneficiary

cdb program would not alter th current riskadjustment mechanism which is scheduled for full implementation b 2004 however it would include new geographic cost adjustment procedure that is intended to adjust the prices of managed care plans to reflect geographic cos t differences which affect plan operations and costs in specific geographic locations this adjustment procedure has the effec t of transforming the local managed care planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30279crs11 prices into national rates as illustrated below this adjusted price is used t determine beneficiary premiums geographic adjustment of g overnment payments helps protect beneficiaries and promotes competition according to the administration currently the part b premium is set nationwide all beneficiaries pay the same p remium regardless of where they reside under the cdb program bene ficiary premiums for managed care would vary based on plan prices since plan prices wou ld reflect local variations in the costs of delivering care if the government did not pay for these variations the plan would pass them along to the beneficiary consequently in highcost areas beneficiar premiums for managed care would most likely be much higher than the costs f traditional medicare and few beneficiaries would elect managed care coverage full geographic adjustment of government payments in highcost areas was included in the administratio ns proposal to make competition between the traditional program and managed care programs equitable according to the administration th administrations geographic adjustment would retain the current partial adjustmen t system for lowcost areas by maintaining the provisions included in the bba t encourage private plans to enter rural areas thus th geographic adjustment procedure would vary between highcost and lowcost areas highcost areas would have the cost s of managed care plans adjusted to reflect full local costs under the bba highcost areas have seen lower rates of increase in mc payments over due to blending of local and national rates and to minimum updates the cdb program would use local rates instead of the bba provisions as benchmarks in these highcost ar eas this would produce lower values for the adjusted nationally based costs of managed care in these areas and lowe r beneficiary payments to managed care plans other things being equal lowcost areas woul d have the geographic adjustments that were implemented under the bba maintained the bbas blending of local and national rates an d establishment of floor pay ments has increased relative mc payments in these areas to amounts above the actual local costs the goal of this increase was to encourage managed care plans to serve beneficiaries in these areas appendix provides more detailed discussion of the geographic adjustment proposal the secretary of the departmen t of health and human services dhhswould study this twopart geographic adjustment system in its first several years to assure that it produces its intended effect modification and extension of policies incorporated in the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 bba 97 included provisions which were designed to constrain

care provided and total medicare payment is not t exceed the amount that would have been made if the patient had been discharged withou t being transferred bba 97 provides that qualified discharges

the disproportionate use of post discharge servicesnext 5 years and 229 billion over 10 years the revised spending projections ar attributa ble to number of factors including an improved economic forecast heightened antifraud and ab use initiatives slowing payments to providers and lower projected enrollment growth in the medicar echoice number of provider groups6 contend that the bba 97 has had bigger impact than originally anticipated the have recommended revisions in the legis lation to bring spending more in line with the original estimates modifying balanced budget act policies quality assurance fund under the presidents plan total of 75 billion between fy2000 and fy2009 would be used to address bba 97 policies that have caused either major access problems for beneficiaries or excessive difficulties fo r providers the administration states that it will work with congress to develo p fiscally prudent policies that would pay targeted providers addi tional money to resolve specific problems that have impeded beneficiary access to care administrative actions hcfa will provide administrative relief in th following four areas 1as mandated by bba 97 hcfa has i mplemented

neutral 3year transition period to hospitals such as lowvolume hospitals teaching hospitals and cancer hospitals that would suffer fro m large payment reductions 3hcfa will implement an administrative change that will enable mor hospitals to be reclassified to higher wage area and receive additiona l medicare payments currently faci lities can be reclassified if their average wage is at least 108 of the average wage in their rural area and at least 84 of the average wage in the nearby urban area hcfa will chang those thresholds 4hcfa is implementing the following changes to hel p home health

the requirement to report services in 15minute increments to enable home health agencies t accomm odate the competing demands of ensuring y2k compliance hcfa has already eliminated the sequential billing rule as of july 1 1999 the sequential billing rule meant that claims had to be paid in the sam order in which services were provided thus in instances where clai m was held for further documentation or review subsequent claims fo r that beneficiary could be paid until the claim being held was resolved dispropo rtionate share payments presently additional payments are made to hospitals that serve dispr oportionate share of lowincome medicare or medicaid patients hcfa would be authorized to remove disproport ionate share payments that are built into the medicarechoice rate

a3 appendix tables a1 a2 and a3 illustrate the effects of geographical adjustment n payments to managed care plans under the presidents propos table a1 represents geographic area with costs comparable to those nationwide it assumes that th average cost of treating medicare ffs beneficiary in this area is the same as th average cost nationwide 6000 geographic adjustment would not alter the total local costs of private plans in this area table a2 represents l owcost area private plans operating in lowcost areas are able to offer coverage of def ined benefits for lower costs than they would be able to offer if they operated in areas with higher input prices therefore in order t compare costs bid by plans in lowcost area to nationwide ffs costs the privat plan costs must be inflated table a2 assumes that the average cost of treating medicare ffs beneficiary in this area is 10 ie 600 below the national average so the averag cost of ffs beneficiary in this area would be 5400 ie 600 0 minus 600 geographic adjustment would increase the local costs of privat plans by 10 of the national ffs cost 600 in order to make local plan cost s comparable to nationwide ffs costs the local costs are the costs bid by th private plans and represent what the plan would be paid through beneficiary an d government contributions the geographically adjusted costs are calculated only for the purpose of computing the beneficiary premium plans would not be pai d geographically adjusted costs table a3 represents highcost area private plans in highcost areas offe r coverage at costs that reflect their relatively high input prices in order to compare costs bid by plans in highcost area to nationwide ffs costs these private plan local costs must be deflated table a3 assumes that costs in this area are 10 higher than the national average so that the average cost of ffs beneficiary in this area would be 6600 ie 6000 plus 60 0 geographic adjustment would decrease the local costs of private plans by 10 of national ffs costs 600 for comparison wit h nationwide ffs costs comparisons of beneficiary p remiums and government contributions for private plans across the three tables illustrate the effect of geographic adjustments and the changing relati onships of private plans to ffs depending on actual local costs for8 example the first plan in each of the three tables bids 4700 in its geographic area 4700 is the plans local cost when computing the beneficiary premium the local cost of plan 1 is unaltered in table a1 because costs in this area are assumed t equal the average nationwide private plan as total local cost is increased by 600 to 5300 i n its lowcost area table a2 and private plan as local costs ar decreas ed by 600 to 4100 in its highcost area table a3 when the cd b program rules for beneficiary premiums are applied to the geographically adjuste d costs private plans 1 and have 0 beneficiary premium in their average and high cost areas respectively tables a1 and a3 but private plan has beneficiar premium of 375 in its lowcost area table a2 the government contribution forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30279crs22 each plan would be the difference between the beneficiary premium and th unadjusted cost bid by the plan these comparisons illustrate the potentially significant effect of geographi c adjustment on beneficiary premiums with geographic adjustments plan offering coverag for 4700 in lowcost area is shown to be less efficient than pla n offering coverage for 4700 in highcost area for example plan as geographically adjusted cost in lowcost area bec omes 5300 and plan as adjusted cost in highcost area becomes 4100 since beneficiary premiums are based on the geographically adjusted costs they may vary for plans with identical premium s prior to geographic adjustment another way to think about the effects of geographic adjustment is to consider how costs of private plans would vary if they operated in different areas fo r example if private plan from the lowcost area represented by table a2 were to move to an average cost area represented by table a1 private plan would increase its bid to 5300 similarly private plan moving from the highcost are represented by table a3 would decrease its bid to 4100 if it were to move to an average cost area private plan 1 located in an average cost area would decrease its costs by 600 to 4100 if it were to move to the lowcost area represented b table a2 and would incr ease its costs by 600 to 5300 if it were to move to the highcost area represented by table a3 the relationship between the current mc payment rates and th administrations proposed cdb program is complex and wo uld vary depending upon classification of the geographic area as highcost or wcost the administration proposes that geographic adj ustment in highcost areas would reflect full local costs in the example shown he re this policy implies that the highcost area represented by table a3 would have local costs decreased by 600 for purposes of computin g beneficiary premiums under the bba formula payments in highcost areas ar limited by t he blending of local and national rates the effect of blending is mitigated by the minimum update provision which guarantees that mc payment rates wil l increase by at least 2 per year under the administrations proposal restrictions on rate growth in highcost areas resulting from the blend would be removed othe r things being equal payments to highcost areas would increase over bba amounts on the other hand the administration proposes that bba provisions resulting in higher payments to lowcost areas would be retained the bba provides fo r payments that exceed local costs in lowcost areas again through blending of local and national rates when computing mc payment rates moreover the bbas floor payment rate provi sion increases mc rates in the lowest cost areas even more than the blend p rovision the administrations proposal implies that local costs in table a2 which represents lowcost area would not be infl ated by the full 600 instead the bba provisions would be used to calculate lower adjustment perhaps equal to 500 this would make each plan less expensive for benefi ciaries and more expensive for the government than would be the case if full geographic adjustment were used however other things being equal payments to lowcost areas would be equal t bba amountshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30279crs23 table a1 example of beneficiary premiums and government payments plan cost cost ffs beneficiary premium contributiontotal
