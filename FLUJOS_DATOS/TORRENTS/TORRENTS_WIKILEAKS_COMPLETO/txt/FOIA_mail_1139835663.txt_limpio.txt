from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re in confidence opinion sought date mon 13 feb 2006 080103 0500 replyto mannpsuedu xflowed hi keith im pretty sure theyre just asking for neutral discussion of the science that youve done that is relevant to the issues being reviewed by the committee after all this is the us national academy of sciences not the us senate etc but i understand where youre coming from nonetheless perhaps you could suggest an alternate any possibility tim could do this instead hes less intimately involved w the paleo chapter of ipcc so i think it might be less of worry for him or phil its your prerogative to suggest alternates and i think theyll take your suggestions very seriously my greatest fear is that mcintyre dominates the discussion its important that they hear from the legitimate scientists thanks mike keith briffa wrote mike thanks for this but after lot of soul searching this weekend i have decided to decline the invitation pressure of stuff here is intense but the real reason is that i really think it could be politic to retreat into neutral mode at least until after the ipcc report is out i know you can argue this various ways but the sceptics are starting to attack on this non neutral stance and the less public i am at the moment the better i think hope you do not think i am wimp here just trying to go the way i think best best wishes keith at 1714 09022006 you wrote hi keith i think you really should do this if you possibly can the panel is entirely legititimate and the report was requested by sherwood boehlert who as you probably know has been very supportive of us in the whole barton affair the assumption is that an honest review of the science will buttress us against any attempt for barton to continue his attacks there is some indication that he hasnt given up yet especially with the new science article by you and tim i think its really important that one of you attend if at all possible im scheduled to arrive thursday march 2rd and give presentation friday morning march 2nd i believe malcolm is planning on participating not sure about ray i would guess that tom c and caspar have been invited as well but havent heard anything the panel is solid gerry north should do good job in chairing this and the other members are all solid chrisy is the token skeptic but there are many others to keep him in check httpwww4naseduwebcrnsf8f6526d97317407285256635006841662dbbe64b5fe9981b8525710f007025b2opendocument so i would encourage you to strongly reconsider let know if youd like to chat over the phone at all about any of this my cell phone number is 8148760485 i teach in about an hour for about 15 hours but then free most of the day mike keith briffa wrote mike in strict confidence i am sending this for your opinion to be frank i am inclined to decline what do think presumably you and others are already in the frame keith xsbrs none xremoteip 1441713841 xironportav

xueaspamlevel xueaspamflag dear dr briffa the national research council of the national academies of the united states is empanelling committee to study surface temperature reconstructions for the past 10002000 years the committee will be asked to summarize the current scientific information on the temperature record over the past two millennia describe the proxy records that have been used to reconstruct preinstrumental climatic conditions assess the methods employed to combine multiple proxy data over large spatial scales evaluate the overall accuracy and precision of such reconstructions and explain how central the debate over the paleoclimate temperature record is to the state of scientific knowledge on global climate change i have attached the complete study proposal word document since this issue has been the subject of considerable controversy we have taken great care to assemble an unbiased panel of scientific experts with the appropriate range of expertise to produce an authoritative report on the subject the committee slate will be formally announced on wednesday but i can tell you that jerry north texas am will be chairing the committee and nas members mike wallace karl turekian and bob dickinson will be on the panel in addition to halfdozen other scientists with expertise in statistics climate variability and several different types of paleoclimate proxy data the committee would like to invite you to come to washington dc on thursday march 2nd to speak about your extensive work with this area and to discuss your perspective on the issues noted above and in the study proposal the committee will be familiar with the relevant peerreviewed literature but is also interested in any recently submitted or accepted papers we will be inviting 810 other experts to speak complete agenda will be made available prior to the meeting and the meeting will be open to the public speakers will be reimbursed for travel expenses and invited to stay for the entire open session of the meeting which will include reception on thursday evening and few speakers on friday morning thank you in advance for your time and interest i hope that you are available and willing to
