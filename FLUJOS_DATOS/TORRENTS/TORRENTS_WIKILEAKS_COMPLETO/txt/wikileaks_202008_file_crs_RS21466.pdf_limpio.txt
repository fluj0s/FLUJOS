liability in tax year 2005 total of 65 million returns used the dctc for total credit of 35 billion3 the nonr efundable nature of the credit results in many lower income taxpayers not being able to fully utilize the credit for example in tax year 2007 married couple with two children claiming standard deduction and qualif ying expenses of 6000 would not have taxable income and taxes to offset with the credit until their total income was more than 24900 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21466crs4 4 the plan will then reimburse the employee fro m the set aside amount employee contributions for

employee benefits research institute ebri reports6 that in 2005 the average employee contribution to dependent care flexible spending plan was 2630 the national compensation survey in march 2007 by

both provisions use the same definition of employ mentrelated expenses the sa expenses cannot be used for both the dctc and dcap taxpayers must choose between the two tax provisions for the same qualified pendent care expenses for taxpayers in tax brackets higher than the dctc credit rate the dcap using salary reduction arrangement is more advantageous however becau the dctc has higher limit 6000 in the case of two or more children higher income taxpayer may use up to 5000 in dcap with salary reduction and use 1000 of taxpayer paid em ploymentrelated expenses for the dctc legislation in
