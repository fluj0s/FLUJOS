tags pter pgov prel fr subject french judge says ct focus is on jihadists to iraq ref paris 479 classified by adcm josiah rosenblatt for reasons 14 bd 1 s summary islamicinternational terrorism investigating judge jeanfrancois ricard strictly protect told poloffs may 6 that his sections openended investigation into potential jihadists to iraq has become their current priority with two networks already discovered french authorities fear that jihadists to iraq is growing problem not unique to france and one that will affect other eu countries ricard also discussed the exguantanamo gtmo detainees with the news that one detainee may be released the recent announcement of gof white paper on terrorism and ct resource issues and rivalries within the french government end summary priority on jihadists to iraq investigation 2 s french press reported the arrests april 24 and 25 of six people in the paris and marseilles areas suspected of involvement in the recruitment and sending of potential jihadists to iraq this is the second network uncovered in france since an inquiry by the terrorism investigating judges into jihadists to iraq first began in september 2004 in comparison to the first network reftel ricard said two of the suspects recently arrested had significant longstanding ties to islamist circles one of them said almaghrebi had in the past recruited european muslims to fight in afghanistan ricard said he believed that france and europe in general was facing only the beginning stages of attempts to form networks to fight jihad in iraq as an example ricard said that gof investigations into this most recent network revealed that the suspects had significant ties to other islamists in england the openended jihadists to iraq investigation is now the priority said ricard based on the premise that those going to iraq not only endanger coalition forces and iraqi stability but upon return to europe might constitute significant terrorist threat one exgtmo detainee may be released before the summer 3 s when asked about the status of the six exgtmo detainees currently in pretrial detention ricard said his office was considering the release and dropping of charges against imad kanouni one of the original four exgtmo detainees transferred to french custody ricard said kanouni had never undergone military training in afghanistan and though active in extremist religious circles they had evidence linking him to terrorism planning the continued detention of kanouni could damage gof cases against the others said ricard he said his office depended significantly upon its reputation within the french justice system which tends to give the terrorism investigating judges the benefit of the doubt as an example ricard said that the proof against recently convicted djamel beghal and his accomplices accused of plotting to bomb the us embassy would not normally be sufficient to convict them but he believed his office was successful because of their reputation if they proceeded to trial with the information they currently possessed on kanouni it would be clear that the judges had been holding kanouni without sufficient evidence therefore ricard and fellow investigating judge jeanlouis bruguiere are in favor of his release although he cautioned that formal decision had not yet been made ricard said that kanouni may be released before the summer turning to the eventual trial of the exgtmo detainees ricard said he was in favor of trying them separately to avoid the spectacle of multiple defense attorneys arrayed against one prosecutor gof to analyze ct in white book 4 c prime minister raffarin announced on may 3 the longrumored commencement of gof white paper on internal security and terrorism specifically the goal of the white paper will be to analyze and report on the type of terrorism france might face in 2020 and the governments potential responses the report will be written by the general secretariat for national defense sgdn in conjunction with sipdis the ministry of interior and will be given to president chirac in early 2006 the paper encompasses six areas all of which are being led by different ministries and individuals pierre bousquet florian head of the dst frances internal security service will lead group studying possible threats pierre brochand head of the dgse frances external intelligence service will study terrorist threats to world stability jeanmichel hubert vicepresident of the general council on information technology within the ministry of finance spearheads group on the use of technolgy by terrorists jeanmarie huet director of criminal affairs within the ministry of justice will lead group studying the role of the legal system in combatting terrorism stanislas lefebvre laboulaye us for political affairsequivalent at the mfa will study international ct cooperation and francois heisbourg director of the foundation for strategic research thinktank an organization closely linked to the french government will lead group studying the involvement of citizens and public outreach to combat terrorism heisbourg already heads an effort by the gof to put online publicly accessible database on terrorism when asked about the white book ricard said he hoped it would result in the passage of stiffer penalties for terrorism conspiracy charges which currently carries with it maximum prison sentence of ten years contact in the interior ministry told poloff may 4 that the gof hopes its white book will be taken up for discussion by the european union with the goal of applying many of its conclusions to the eus counterterrorism approach ct resource issues and rivalries 5 s with the announcement in early april by justice minister perben that additional magistrates will be assigned to counterterrorism ricard said his section in the paris prosecutors office will likely grow from its current number of five investigating judges to seven within the next year he said the investigating judges will also be given additional support staff recruiting the investigating judges has been difficult at first said ricard given that he and bruguiere and the other veteran judges gilbert thiel and laurence vert have distinct more hierarchical work environment than is usually the case in the french judiciary ricard also commented on recent press articles on renewed attempt by dnat the national counterterrorism division section of frances judiciary police to wrest away from the dst that services nearmonopoly on islamic terrorism investigations currently dnat focuses on corsican and basque terrorism investigations ricard believed that the dst would continue its primary role given that it also is in charge of international liaison and as such it is the recipient of terrorismrelated information from other countries which is key component of islamic terrorism investigations 6 u minimize considered wolff
