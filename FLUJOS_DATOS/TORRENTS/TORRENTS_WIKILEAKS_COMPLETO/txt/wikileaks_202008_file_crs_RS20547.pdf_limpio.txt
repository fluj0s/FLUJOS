accounts had been uniformly critical of natos and us military involvement in kosovo on march 26 1999 china joined russia and namibia in voting in favor of the security council resolution calling for an immediate halt to nato air strikes in yugoslavia the draft resolution failed on vote of 312 the basic points of chinas position were that nato airstrikes were an interference in yugoslavias internal affairs that unilateral nato action was operating without authorization and thus violated the charter and set bad international precedent and that the kosovo issue should be settled through peaceful negotiations conducted under auspices in chinese press accounts beijing equated kosovos independence aspirations with similar aspirations called splittism in tibet and xinjiang both autonomous regions of china and in taiwan which beijing considers breakaway province indeed some chinese press accounts described kosovo as breakaway province of yugoslavia involving splittist elements thus explicitly drawing link between kosovo andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20547crs2 1 secretary of defense william cohen dod news briefing may 10 1999chinas own internal challenges in the

intended to hit the federal directorate for supply and procurement key yugoslav military target1 secretary cohen also stated that the united states had already taken steps to ensure that such mistake did not happen again he described those steps as including tasking the state department with reporting to the intelligence community whenever foreign embassies move or new embassies are built strengthening the internal mechanisms and procedures within the intelligence community for developing targeting information and updating maps and developing rapidresponse procedures at the defense intelligen ce agency and the national imagery and mapping agency for updating databases for strike targets in followup briefing senior us intelligence officials answered press questions about the

map to establish bombing targets these sourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20547crs3 2 subsequently it was revealed that the chinese embassy had moved to the new belgrade site in 1996 3 testifying before

response to press question about where the incorrect target suggestion came from one of the officials said this was nomination originally from an agency in washington although other specifics were offered at the time subsequent reports revealed that the target site was the only one selected by the central intelligence agency in the 78day kosovo bombing campaign protests in china and beijings official response chinese officials were highly suspicious of us and nato contentions that the bombing of their embassy was accidental in the days following the bombing chinese staterun newspapers declared the bombing was deliberate act of aggression meant to punish china for its opposition to natos intervention in kosovo tens of thousands of protestors demonstrated outside the us and other nato countries government facilities in beijing and in five other chinese cities throwing rocks splattering paint and inflicting other damage the residence of the us consulgeneral in chengdu was seriously damaged by fire and smoke and protesters attempted to burn the us consulate in guangzhou us diplomatic personnel including ambassador james sasser were trapped for several days in the us embassy the chinese government and some western observers insisted the public sentiment was real some western press accounts however portrayed the protests as at least partially governmentorganized and attributed some of the inflamed public passion to the chinese governments delay in publicizing any of the us apologies until may 11 1999 president clinton reportedly tried to place several phones calls to chinese party secretary jiang zemin but was rebuffed by chinese officials the president finally was able to speak with jiang on may 14 19993 in the week after the bombing the chinese

bombing occurred along with letter from president clinton to chinas president jiang zemin5 the chinese government rejected that explanation as unsatisfactory us and chinese negotiators met on number of occasions throughout the rest of 1999 to discuss appropriate payment terms ultimately reaching agreement on two separate monetary packages one for loss of life and injury and one for mutual damage compensation payments according to testimony by director of central intelligence george j tenet before the house permanent select committee on intelligence on july 22 1999 the us government would conduct an accountability review on the events surrounding the bombing would contemplate discipline for errors and would report results to the chinese government according to washington post report of april 9 2000 the cia early in april 2000 fired one intelligence officer and reprimanded 6 cia managers for errors committed in selecting the target site undersecretary pickering briefed the chinese ambassador to the united states on april 8 2000 about the results of the us accountability review on april 10 2000 china rejected the us explanation again demanding that the united states punish those

humanitarian paymentof 45 million to the families of the 3 killed and to the 27 injured as result of the nato bombing error us officials were particular in referring to the payment as voluntary in order to avoid acknowledging legal liability7 the agreement was announced by david andrews us state department legal adviser after two rounds of uschina discussions on the matter according to us state department officials the payment was made to the chinese government on august 25 1999 out of dod discretionary appropriated funds decisions about how to divide the funds among the bombing victims and their families were specified in the agreement with payment to be made directly to the victims by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20547crs5 8 according to chinese government officials interviewed for this report the new chinese embassy in belgrade will be built at different site 9 according to administration officials actual us repair costs were somewhat lower after us company donated windows to replace those broken in us diplomatic facilities cost that state department officials say was about 45000 bank of china us officials say they received confirmation from beijing in october 1999 that the funds had been disbursed according to agreement property damage agreements on december 16 1999 after five rounds of talks following the june 1999 pickering mission department of state legal adviser david andrews announced that two separate agreements had been reached on property damage payments one for 28 million in us payment to china for damage to the chinese embassy in belgrade and one for 287 million in chinese payment to the united states for damage to us diplomatic and consular facilities as result of postbombing protests in china these sums were in addition to the 45 million voluntary humanitarian payment the us payment is contingent upon an appropriation by the us congress and request for this amount is included in the foreign operations appropriation account budget request for fy2001 by mutual agreement the chinese payment of 287 million is contingent upon us approval and payment of the 28 million the concluded agreement is intended to cover any and all future claims and it presumes that china will make further demand on the united states for explanation apology or punishment of responsible parties for the accidental bombing us officials maintain that the sums agreed upon represent fair compensation for the respective damage inflicted to the properties of both countries according to state department officials the 28 million us payment is consistent with estimates made by the state departments foreign buildings office on the approximate costs for building in belgrade facility comparable to the chinese embassy which the chinese government maintains was effectively destroyed by nato bombs and will have to be replaced8 in addition the 28 million us payment includes compensation for temporary housing in belgrade for chinese embassy personnel who were housed within the belgrade embassy compound funds for replacement of chinese antiques and furnishings which china claims were destroyed in the bombing and funds for replacement of technical equipment likewise according to state department officials the chinese payment of 287 million will fully cover the remaining us costs incurred for repairing damage done to us facilities by demonstrators in the days following the bombing9 implications for congress although the 45 million us voluntary humanitarian payment of august 1999 was paid out of dod discretionary funds state department officials maintain that the 28 million us payment for property compensation is too large to be covered by such contingency accounts therefore the property compensation agreement with china has to come from us funds appropriated for that purpose request for this amount has been included in the fy2001 international affairs budget which congress will consider as part of the foreign operations appropriations bill the bill could see appropriations committee markup as early as may 2000 with full consideration and conclusion not likelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20547crs6 10 in the omb budget submission appendix volume p 997 11 in the february 3 1998 incident us marine corps a6 aircraft severed the cable of ski gondola near cavalese italy killing 20 people the following year us payment of 20 million for reimbursement of property damage was provided in section 8114 of the department of defense appropriations act pl 105262 under the heading operation and maintenance navy until september or october 2000 several points of controversy could affect congressional consideration inclusion in the foreign operations bill in decision thought to have been controversial within the executive branch and likely to be so in congress the administration elected to include the 28 million payment as part of the international affairs budgets economic support fund account esf flexible economic aid channel used to support us security and political interests funded within the foreign operations spending measure the total esf request for fy2001 is 23 billion most of which involves assistance to israel and egypt to cover any potential restrictions in us law against aid transfers to china the legislative request earmarking the payment also waives any restrictions in current law10 some may suggest that the payment to china should come out of other us government agency budgets they may feel that the cia budget would be more appropriate source of payment or that the approximately 300 billion department of defense dod budget would be better able to absorb the payment than the 22 billion foreign policy budget would be there is recent precedent for making such payment out of dods budget in the case of 20 million us payment following february 3 1998 accident involving us military aircraft and ski gondola in italy11 payment amounts some may object to the dollar amounts involved in the payments they may feel that the 287 million agreed on for chinas payment to the united states is too low to cover actual damage to us diplomatic facilities or that chinas payment should be increased to reimburse us company for having donated part of the repair costs likewise some may raise concerns about the amount of the 28 million us payment to china suggesting it to be too high or perhaps objecting to us funds being used to help pay for replacement of technical equipment reported to have been used in chinese intelligencegathering activities in eastern europe concerns may also be raised about the agreement to make chinas payment to the united states contingent upon the us payment to china congressional options congressional decisionmakers have variety of options in considering the issue involving the us payment to china including straightforward approval as part of the foreign operations budget or flat denial of any appropriation of us funds for that purpose or congressional appropriators may elect to approve the payment but as part of another us government agency appropriation rather than as part of the esf account appropriations committee or other members may amend the payment request either by changing the amount or by placing conditions or restrictions on the payment finally the payment provision could simply be deleted either in committee during floor consideration or in conference
