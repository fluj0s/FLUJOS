been among the most important challenges for the honduran government when president maduro took office in 2002 kidnaping and murder were common in major cities particularly in the northern part of the country youth gangs known as maras terrorized many urban residents while corresponding vigilantism increased to combat the crime with extrajudicial killings increasing including killings of youth honduras along with neighboring salvador and guatemala has become fertile ground for the gangs which have been fueled by poverty unemployment leftover weapons from the 1980s and the us deportation of criminals to the region the two major gangs in hondurasmara salvatrucha or ms13 and the 18th street gang or m18were first established in angeles in the 1980s by salvadoran immigrants who were excluded from mexicanamerican gangs the us deportation of central american criminals back to the region in the 1990s may have helped lay the foundation for the development of ms13 and m18 in central america 23 although estimates of the number of gang members in central america vary widely the us southern command maintains that there are some 70000 concentrated largely in honduras salvador and guatemala24 president maduro who campaigned on zerotolerance platform increased the number of police officers and cracked down on delinquency the government signed legislation in july 2003 making maras illegal and making membership in the gangs punishable with 12 years in prison some human rights groups expressed concerns about abuses and the effect of the crackdown on civil liberties there were also concerns that the crackdown would exacerbate already poor prison conditions subsequently in 2004 fire in the san pedro sula prison killed 107 inmates mostly gang members although the crackdown initially reduced crime for example an 80 decline in kidnapping and 60 decline in youth gang violence 25 and was popular with the public crime subsequently picked up again on decemb er 23 2004 ms13 gang members massacred 28 people including 6 children on public bus crowded with christmas shoppers in san pedro sula an event that shocked the honduran nation beginning in 2006 the zelaya governmentin move to replace the maduro governments zero tolerance policyinitially announced measures to use dialogue and other outreach techniques to convince gang members to give up violence and reintegrate into society but subsequently has focused more on traditional law enforcement action to crack down on the gangs26 in september 2006 the government launched operation thunder to increase

several highprofile killings have drawn greater attention to the issue of violent crime in honduras several studies on the gangs in central america contend that socalled mano dura strong arm policies

and economic prevention programs as means of effectively dealing with the gang crisis best practices are seen as involving strategies that are developed with community collaboration so that prevention and law enforcement programs are accepted by all sectors and the general population 30 several us agencies have been involved in assisting honduras and other central american countries in dealing with

those deported on criminal grounds to honduras were much smaller percentage than the average for latin america and the caribbean overall about 17 of hondurans were removed on criminal grounds in 2007 in march 2007 the honduran congress approved motion calling for the united states to halt deportations of undocumented honduran migrants who live and work in the united states 42according to the department of homeland security in 2005 honduras became the first foreign country to agree to the use of video teleconferencing by honduran consular officers for travel document interviews in order to speed the deportation process43 in honduras and other central american countries policymakers are most concerned about their countries abilities to absorb the large volumes of deportees arriving from the united states increasing deportations from the united states have been accompanied by similar increases in deportations from mexico transit country for central american migrants bound for the united states the deportations have caused numerous challenges for central american governments and social service providers in countries where poverty and unemployment rates are high it can be difficult for returning deportees to find gainful employment individuals who do not speak spanish who are tattooed who have criminal reco rds andor who lack familial support in the country to which they are deported have particularly difficult time with reintegration some deportees have left close family members behind in the united states which may make their transition even harder in addition to these social problems regional leaders are also concerned that remittances may start to fall if the current high rates of deportations continue 44 some analysts contend that increasing us deportations of individuals with criminal records has exacerbated the gang problem in honduras and other central american countries45 by the mid 1990s the civil conflicts in central america had ended
