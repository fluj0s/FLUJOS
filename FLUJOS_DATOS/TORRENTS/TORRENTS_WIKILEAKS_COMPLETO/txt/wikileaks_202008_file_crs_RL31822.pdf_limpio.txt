and ethics standards which look so to previous employment and past associations of those b ecoming federal officers and employees conflicts of interest generally the term conflict of interest may have broad meaning in general usage however under federal law and regulation conflict of inte rest for the most part deals with conflict between federal employees official governmental duties and responsibilities on the one hand and the personal financia l or economic interests of the employee on the other2 when the official duties of government employee may impact upon the outside private business or economic interests of that employee or the economic interests of those closely associated with the employee conflict of interest situation presents itself the overall scheme of the conflict of inte rest laws adopted by congress generally embodies the principle that pub lic servant owes undivided loyalty to the government3 and that advice and recommendations given to the government by its employees and officials be made in the public interest and not be tainted even unintentionally with influence from private or personal fina ncial interests4 the house judiciary committee reporting out major conflict of interest revisions made to federal law in the 1960s found the proper operation of democratic government requires that officials be independent and impartial that government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its governme nt the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists or appears to exist an actual or potential conflict between the private interests of government employee and his duties as an

the fact that the disclosures were to be made public was also seen as serving the pur pose of increasing public confidence in the integrity of the institutions of government and in those who serve themthe concern in such regulation is not only the possibility or appearance of private gain from public office but the risk that official decisions wh ether consciously or otherwise will be motivated by somethin g other than the publics interest the ultimate concern is bad government6 the conflict of interest laws are thus directed not only at conduct which is impr oper but rather are often preventative in nature directed at situations which merely have the potential to tempt or subtly influence an official in the performance of fficial public duties as explained by the supreme court with regard to predece ssor conflict of interest law requiring disqualification of officials from matters in which they have personal financial interest this broad proscription embodies recogniti on of the fact that an impairment of impartial judgment can occur in even the most wellmeaning men when their personal economic interests are affected by the business they transact on behalf of the government7 conflict of interest regulation the application of federal conflict of interest laws and regulations particularly the laws requiring an officials recusal or disqualification from certain matters or regulations or procedures requiring the divestiture of certain assets have traditionally been directed at current and existing financial interests and ties of that official and those

but also possibly in deterring the recruitment of certain persons into the government because of such persons uneasiness with the required details of public financial disclosure as noted by the senate committee however this latter deterrent effect was not necessarily negative consequence of required public disclosures but could be positive consideration in the enactment of the financ ial disclosure requirement public financial disclosure will deter some persons who should not be entering public service from doing so individuals whose personal finances would not bear up to public scrutiny will very lik ely be discouraged from entering public office altogether knowing in advance that their sources of income and financial holdings will be available for public review9 who must file generally

official upon the officials departure statutory disqualifi cation or recusal the federal statutes deal with existing conflicts of interest principally by requiring the disqualif ication of federal official from certain governmental matters in which he may be financially interested as opposed to specifically requiring the di vestiture of conflic ting interests the federal statute at 18 usc 208 which is the principal genera l conflict of interest provision under federal law thus requires an officials di squalification recusal from particular governmental ma tter in which the officer hi s or

i n addition to the statutory recusal requirement there also exists regulatory requirements for disqualification for othe r financial interest s and connections although the range of private interests potentially affected by an officials governmental actions are broadened in the regulation the regulatory recusal provision is more narrowly focused than th statutory provision as to those specific governmental matters covere d the regulations of the office of government ethics provide this regulatory disqualification provision to he lp assure the avoidance of an appearance of loss of impartiality in the performance of official duties by federal employee44 the regulation in comparison to the statutory recusal requirement expands the persons and entities who are deem ed to be so connected to the employee that their financial interest s may be imputed to that employee and as such would constitute cause for recusal or disqualification of the employee from governmental matter affecting or involving those intere sts but as compared to the statutory disqualification narrows thos particular governmental matters that are included in the disqualification requirement even if covered by this particular regulatory provision there are circumstances in whic h the employee may still be authorized by his or her agency to participate in the particular matter when warranted45 the regulation requires government employee in the executive branch to recuse himself or herself from particul ar matter involving specific parties when 1 the employee knows that the matter will ve direct

one in exce ss of 10000 in value made by an employer after the employer has learned that the employee is to enter government service and one which is not an ordinary payment that is is payment other

not therefore accept salary supplementation from business or organization intended to make up the difference between private sector and federal government salaries or to otherwise reward or compensate the new federal employee for his or her public service th is statutory restriction originated in 1917 from an initial legislative concern over pr ivate foundations paying the compensation of persons who were serving under cooperative agreement in the bureau of education within the depar tment of interior and the undue and to some noxious influence of such foundations on national edu cational policy52 the law at 209 has been described as conflict of interest statute in the strictest sense that is an employee does not have to do anything improper in his ffice to violate the statute but rather his or her special status as government employee makes an unexceptionable act wrongful wrongful because of the potential dangers in serving two paymasters53 the law thus seeks to assure that federal employee is compensated for his or her services to th government only by the government is not placed in position of serving two masters and is not nor app ears to be

severance payments packages or plans from former private employer to an individual who has entered federal service if there is evidenced an intent to compensate an individual for that pers ons federal employment55 the provision is not as broad in application to severance paym ents however as it may seem at first glance since the language of the statute applies expressl only to an officer or employee of the executive branch of the united states govern ment and has been interpreted by the courts as applying only to persons who at the time payments were received were federal employees that is th restriction does not apply to severance payments which are made at the time one leaves private employment but before the individual actually becomes an officer or em ployee of the government56 even if made to reward the employee for taking public service job or is intended to or has the effect of instilling in the abouttobecomeofficial sense of gratitude or goodwill towards the private employer there is violation of this criminal conflict of interest provision for severance payments made before one is federal offi cial since federal employment status is an expr ess element of the statute of course as noted above extraordinary payments from private employer to an incoming federal official even if made before the person is actua lly federal employee and thus not within 209 may still encounter the twoyear disqualification requirement under oge regulations requiring the recusal of the employee for two years from any particular governmental matter involving that former employer as party pensions past or present financial interest one of the issues that arises with respect to current or past associations under the statutory recusal or disqualification requirement is the trea tment of pensions from outside entities pensions generally involve current payments or vested interests from fund controlled by an outside entity but in recognition of or as compensation for past services there are thus questions raised as to whether an employees vested interest in pension is current financial interest or association with or in the entity making the payment subject to all of the disqualification restrictions and limitations on current and existing financial interests or whether pensions are excluded from being disqualifying interest of an employee the issue under the statutory recusal requirement is as stated by the office of government ethics the concern about an employees participation in government matter that c ould have an effect on

maintaining the government employees pension plan57 in interpreting the law at 18 usc 208 and the regulations under it the office of government ethics has distinguishe d between two common types of pension plans the defined benefit plan and the defined contribution plan in defined benefit plan the employer typically makes payments to an investment pool which it holds and invests for all participatin g employees and such plans are the obligation of the employer which pays the former employee an amount generally based on some percentage of what the employees compensation had been58 defined contribution plan however ty pically involves contributions by the employer andor the employ ee to specific individual retirement account and the payout of income or annu ity is based on the amounts earnings gains or losses generated by such account the expressed conflict of in terest concerns thus generally arise more typically with defined benefit plan type of pension where the employer itself is obligated to make the pension payments but not so in defined contribution plan where the pension payments come out of an alread established and f unded retirement account for purposes of the statutory disqualifica tion requirement therefore the office of government ethics would not consider defined contribution plan as disqualifying financial intere st of the employee for matters affecting the sponsor of defined contribution pla n an employees interest is not ordinarily disqualifying financial interest under sec tion 208 because the sponsor is not obligated to fund the employees pension plan59 if the employees pension is based on d efined benefits plan then the office of government ethics would consider ch pension as current disqualifying interest under 18 usc 208 in some circ umstances defined benefit plan will be considered disqualifying interest in governmental matters relating to the sponsor of the employees pension if the governmental matter involved is so significant to the pensions sponsor that it coul d actually affect employees pension plan that is that the matter would have direct and pred ictable effect on the sponsors ability or willingness to pay the employees pension benefit such as if the matter could result in the dissolution of the sponsor organization60 oge notes that in practical sense it is unlikely that governmental matter will have such an effect on private pension sponsor since even large contr acts worth for exampl 500000 to firm would not materially affect sizable corporations ability to pay its pension obligations to former employeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31822crs15 61 id 62 5 cfr 2635502b1i see oge memorandum 99 x 6 supra at n3 63 5 cfr 2635502a 64 5 cfr 2635403ain most cases it is therefore unlikely that current interest in or receipt of payment from pension plan either defi ned benefit or define d contribution plan would trigger the broad statutory criminal recusal or disqualification requirement of 18 usc 208 for federal employee as to the sponsor of his or her private pension and the office of government et hics has advised agencies to longer automatically presume that employees have conflict of interest in matters affecting the sponsor of their defined benefit plans61 the private sponsor of defined benefit pension plan would however for purposes of the regulatory impartiality requirement be one with whom the federal employee has covered relationship62 in such case absent disclosure to and authorization from the agency the employee should therefore disqualify himsel f or herself concer ning any official governmental matter which i nvolves the sponsor of the pe nsion plan as specific party63 divestiture there is federal statute which expr essly implements general requirement for federal employees to divest particular private assets or holdings to resolve likely or potential conflicts of interest with employees public duties occasionally statutory provision often the organic act establishing an agency bureau or commission will provide expressly that th directors or board members of such entities shall have financial interests in the business or sector which the agency bureau or commission is to regulate or ove rsee furthermore an agency may by regulation prohibit or restrict the ownershi p of certain financia l assets or class of assets by its officers and employees where because of the mission of the agency such interests would cause reasonabl person to question the impartiality and objectivity with which agency programs are administered64 in such instances these statutory and regulatory provisions would in their effect require the divestiture of particular assets and holdings of certain individuals to be appointed to such positions or who are incumbents in such positions while there is general statutory divestiture requirement the divestiture of assets properties or holdings may be required as conflict of inte rest avoidance mechanism by administrative provisions and oversight as well as by senate committee or the senate as whole as condition of favorable action on presidential nominee requiring senate confir mation as noted earlier the principal statutory method of conflict of interest avoidance with respect to particular assets and holdings of federal official is to re quire the disqualifica tion of that official from governmental matter affecting thos financial interest s however under current regulations of the office of governme nt ethics as part of the ethics review process an agency may require the divestiture of certain assets of an individual employee where those interests would requi re the employees disqualification from matters so central to his or her job that it would impair the employees ability to

the trustee have knowledge of the identity of the specific assets held in the trust as such an official will not need to identify and disclose the particular assets in the corpus of blind trust in future financial disclosure reports69 and such assets will not be financial interests of the employee for disqualification purposes70 the conflict of interest theory under which the blind trust provisions operate is that since the official will not know the identity of the specific assets in the trust those assets and financial interests c ould not influence the fficial decisions and governmental duties of the reporting offi cial thus avoiding potential conflict of interest problems or appearances71 assets originally placed into the trust by the official will of course be known to

members of the public the press and even the congress sometimes ve questioned whethe r particular public official might be subject to continui ng influence by former employer74 the general principles in the oge regulations regarding financial interests and connections outside employment or activ ities and impartiality are fleshed out and covered in the more specific regulations promulgated by oge75 although the basic impartiality language is fairly broad on its face the impartiality actually required of federal employee in govern mental matter by the specific conflict of interest and federal ethics standards is disinterestedness in the matter from the point of view of any financial impact th at such matter may have upon the employee personally or upon certain entitie s or persons which are clos ely associated with the employee that is those whose financial interests may be fairly imputed to the employee76 as noted by the offi ce of government ethics questions regarding impartiality necessarily arise when an employees official duties impact upon the employees own fina ncial interests or those of certain other persons such as the employees spouse or minor child77 thus while past employment or other past professional affiliations or connections to private entities may implicate conflict of interest concerns and trigger certain restrictions under re gulations the current ethical standards of conduct and conflict of interest rules do not necessa rily imply prohibited favoritism or impartiality by the mere fact of past employments or past professional associationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31822crs18 78 in addition to bias because of past employme nt affiliations it should be noted that federal employees are specifically prohibited by ethics

federal officials federal cases dealing with the alleged bias of federal official have arisen on occasion in due process context with respect to rule making of an agency in that there had been alleged lack of due process or fairness in the agency proceeding because of some claimed bias of federal agency official in those cases the courts have noted that when federal official is not acting in an
