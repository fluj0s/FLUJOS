summary the fair labor standards act of 1938 f lsa requires employers to pay time andahalf to nonexempt employees who wo rk overtime the main policy objectives of requiring employers to pay timeandahalf for overtime are to reduce involuntary unemployment and ssen overwork employers are not required to pa overtime to bona fide executive administrative and professi onal employees the department of labor dol has proposed new regulations to administer the whitecollar exemptions as of april 8 2004 the regulations are under review by the office of management and budget omb under current regulations to be classified as whitecollar worker an employee must meet each of three tests salary basis test salary level test and job duties test the proposed regulations would make changes to each of these tests among the changes the proposed regulations woul d raise the minimum weekly salary level tests from either 155 170 or 250 to 425 an exemption would be allowed for learned professionals who acquire advanced knowledge through combination of work experience and education estimating the potential effects of the pr oposed regulations is complicated by several factors it is difficult to timate the number of exempt and nonexempt workers using available survey data ma ny of the proposed changes are open to different interpretations and the immediate impact of the changes may differ from the longterm impact according to estimates for 2002 by the congressional research service crs approximately 10 to 11 million employed fulltime wage and salary executive administrative and professional employees earned more than the current salary test levels but less than 425 week if these employees are currently exempt they would be nonexempt under the proposed regula tions an estimated 10 million employed fulltime learned professionals with six or more years of work experience had at least high school education but less than bach elors degree if these employees are currently nonexempt they may be exempt under the proposed regulations finally if the proposed changes create incentives th at do not exist under current regulations employers may convert some nonexempt hourly whitec ollar workers to exempt salaried workers in 2002 an estimate d 84 million employed fulltime whitecollar workers were paid by the hour crs analysis of cps data for 2001 nd 2002 suggests that cyclical changes in the levels of employment among lower wage workers who may have been nonexempt instead of exempt and learne d professionals who may have been exempt instead of nonexempt under the proposed regulations were c onsistent with the policy objective of reducing involunt ary unemployment during an economic downturn the report may be updated as issues

given number per da the flsa does not prevent employers from paying more than timeandahalf for overtime or from paying exempt employees premium wage for overtime9 section 13a1 of the flsa exempts bona fide executive administrative and professional workers as well as outside sales workers from overtime coverage it also gives the secretary of labor the authority to administer the exemptions10 requiring employers to pay timeandahalf for overtime is intended to achieve two main policy objectives first timeandahalf is in tended to reduce involuntary unemployment the flsa was signed into law in june 1938 during the 1930s the united states was in the midst of pr olonged economic depression in 1929 the civilian unemployment rate was 32 it increased to 249 in 1933 and did not fall below 10 until 194111 it was argued that penalty for overtime hours would shorten the workweek and increase empl oyment the second policy objective of requiring timeandahalf for overtime is to reduce overwork during debate over the flsa it was argued that some employees worked overly long hours which was harmful to individual health and public safety12 president franklin d roosevelt said that the flsa was needed to conser ve our primary resources of manpower13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32349crs4 13 continued journal vol 39 nov 1988 p 719 hereafter cited as nordlund brief history of the fair labor

hours raises the average cost per hour worked for persons who work overtime penalty raises the average hourly wage if the penalty reduces overtime fixed costs for example for employerpaid health insurance are spread over fewer hours the higher average cost per hour may cause employers to substitute capital goods for hours worked reducing the total number of hours worked and to substitute additional workers for overtime hours increasing the number of persons employed ehrenberg and smith modern labor economics p 152 daniel s continuedopponents argued that the act amounted to government planning and would increase not reduce unemployment economic framework for analysis economics provides framework for analyzing the policy objectives of overtime pay and the whitecollar exemp tions according to standard economic theory governments may intervene in labor markets for number of reasons these reasons include policies to reduce i nvoluntary unemployment and to improve competition14 in addition governments sometimes require certain kinds of behavior that policymakers believe may improve individual or public welfare these requirements are called merit goods15 involuntary unemployment to many economists involuntary unemploymen t is one of the most visible signs that market economy is not functioning properly16 involuntary unemployment occurs when there are qualified individua ls who cannot find work at prevailing wages17 involuntary unemployment that is due to inadequate demand for consumption goods investment goods or both is generally associated with an economic slowdown or recession as means of reducing involuntar unemployment during an economic downturn timeandahalf for overtime is intended as an incentive for employers to reduce overtime hours

fiscal and monetary policy are macroeconomic options for reducing involuntary unemployment during an economic slowdown or recession in downturn reducing wages may be an alternative to layoffs 25 the employment effects of penalty for overtime may be diminished if straighttime wages are adjusted downward so that employees total weekly pay is unchanged some evidence suggests that after the flsa was enacted in 1938 some employers reduced the regular hourly rate of pay so that the paymen t of overtime did not change their total wage continuedgenerally increases more for less skilled than for more skilled workers1920 one reason for this difference is th at labor costs consist of both variable and fixed costs labor is sometimes called quasifixed fact or of production fixed labor costs vary with the number of workers employed while variable costs vary with the number of hours employees work variable costs consis t mainly of wages fixed costs include fringe benefits eg health insurance as well as hiring and training costs21 hiring and training costs generally increase with skill level thus the costs of hiring and training executive and professional employees are generally greater than the costs of hiring and training workers with less responsibility22 because of the greater investment employ ers often make in skilled workers in an economic downturn employers are more likely to lay off less skilled workers23 but since overtime costs more than straighttime requiring timeandahalf for overtime for less skilled workers may lessen the amount of involuntary unemployment during an economic downturn2425httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32349crs6 25 continued bill us congress house committee on ways and means the national recovery administration message from th president of the united states house

employees may therefore work overtime although they would otherwise prefer shorter workweek some evidence suggests that workers want to work more continuedoverwork overtime may be voluntary or involuntary overtime is voluntary if workers have the option to accept or decline empl oyer requests to wo rk overtime overtime is involuntary if workers do not have the option to accept or decline employer requests to work overtime the difference will generally depend on the degree to which labor markets fit the model of perfect competition for example one of the characteristics of the model of competitive labor market is that there are many employers and many workers if labor market does not have many other employers offering similar work at similar wages employees may have few alternative employment options and may work overtime when they would rather not model of perfect competition according to standard economic theory competitive markets generally result in the most efficient allocation of resources where resources consist of individuals with different skills capital goods eg computers machinery and buildings and natural resources if labor markets fit the model of perfect competition workers are paid according to the value of their contribution to output in competitive labor markets wages include compensation for unfavorable working conditions th latter theory called the theory of compensating wage differentials recognizes that individuals differ in their preferences or tolerance for different wo rking conditions such as the number of hours worked including overtime health and safety conditi ons vacation time and job security26 if labor markets do not fit the model of perfect compe tition overtime may be involuntary in imperfect labor markets requiring employers to pay timeandahalf for overtime may either discourage employ ers from requesting or requiring overtime or ensure that workers who work over time are paid pre mium wage for overtime hours reducing involuntary overtime may be difficult policy to implement first identifying the appropriate labor market may be difficult labor markets can be local eg for unskilled labor regional national or even international eg for top executives second labor market co mpetitiveness is difficult to measure27 laborhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32349crs7 27 continued overtime than the amount that is offered

continuedmarkets may also change because of econo mic technological or policy changes in addition requiring timeanda half for overtime is inte nded to reduce involuntary unemployment and lessen overwork in one case timeandahalf is required for less skilled workers who may be more likely than skilled workers to lose their jobs during an economic downturn in the other case timeandahalf is required for workers in imperfect labor markets the two groups of workers may not be the same in an economic downswing requiring timeandahalf for less skilled workers may reduce involuntary unemployment but requiring timeandahalf to lessen i nvoluntary overtime depends on the competitiveness of the relevant labor markets merit goods finally some policymakers ma believe that employees who voluntarily work overtime are not acting in their best interests or in the best interests of others policymakers w ho believe that 40hour work week is merit good may favor limits on the number of hours worked or may favor incentives such as time andahalf for overtime that discourage employers from offering overtime the general criticism of this view is that in competitive markets individuals are in better position than governments to judg what is in their best interests28 current and proposed regulations the flsa includes several exceptions nd exemptions to the requirement that employers

consistent with the policy objectives of overtime pay and the whitecollar exemptions the section begins with discussion of the difficulties in estimating the effects of the proposed regulations next estimates are provided of the number of employees who may be affected by two of the changes included in the proposed regulations the increase in the minimum salary level test and the change in the job duties tests that would allow an exemption for learned professionals w ho acquire advanced knowledge through combination of work experience and educa tion the analysis categorizes employees as exempt or nonexempt based on their ccupation industry and other information therefore employees are described as potentially exempt or nonexempt the section then compares recent cyclical changes in the levels of employment among exempt and nonexempt workers under both current and proposed regulations the purpose of these comparisons is to examine whether changes in the levels of employment of employees who may change status under th proposed regulations are similar to the changes in the levels of employment of nonexempt and exempt employees under current regulations finally using select ed demographic social and labor market characteristics employees who are exem pt or nonexempt under current regulations are compared to employees who may have become exempt or nonexempt if the proposed regulations had been in effect in 2002 it is not possible here to identify and measure the competitiveness of the labor markets of exempt and nonexempt workers thus the purpose of these comp arisons is to examine whether employees who may become eligible or ineligible for overtime under the proposed regulations are similar to nonexempt or exempt employees under current regulations the analysis examines employed fulltime wage and salary workers using data from the monthly current population survey cps appendix b provides description of the methodolog and assumptions used in this section of the report estimating the number of exempt and nonexempt employees estimating the potential effects of the pr oposed regulations is complicated by several factors first it is difficult to make estimates from available survey data second many of the proposed changes are ope n to differences in interpretation if the proposed regulations are issued as fi nal regulations the impact would depend in part on how the regulations are enforced by the wage and hour division of dol and how they are interpreted by the courts37 third the immediate impact of the regulations may differ from the longterm impact this report considers estimateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32349crs11 38 the gao discussion refers to the discretion and independent judgement tests for administrative and professional employees

limitations make it difficult to estimate the number of exempt and nonexempt workers dol epi and crs estimates of the potential effects of the proposed regulations rely rgely or in part on data from the monthly current population survey cps th cps is monthly household survey conducted by the us bureau of the cens us for bls the survey collects wide range of labor market information and is the source of data for the monthly unemployment rate but the cps does not ask individuals if they are covered by the overtime provisions of the flsa therefore researchers use information on occupation industry earnings education or other variables to infer who may be exempt or nonexempt from overtime these in ferences can involve significant often subjective assumptions interpretation some of the changes that would be made if the proposed regulations are issued as final regulations are open to different interpretations this section examines three such changes first under the proposed regulations tw job duties tests would be eliminated the discretion and independent judgement tests see footnote 36 and the 20 limits on nonexempt work in 1999 report the general accounting office gao stated that for both employers and dol complia nce investigators the discretion and independent judgement tests are difficult to administer on the other hand gao stated that the compliance cases they reviewed included number of instances where the standard of independent judgem ent and discretion was key to determining the employees exempt or nonexempt status38 in addition in the case of administrative employees the discretion nd independent judgement test would be replaced by requirement th at an employee hold position of responsibility it is not clear whether an administrative em ployee who holds position of responsibility would be more or less likely to be exempt than an employee who exercises discretion and independent judgement second example of how it may it be difficult to interpret the proposed regulations involves the concept of prima ry duty which appears in the job duties tests under both current and proposed regula tions current regulations state that the amount of time spent in the performance of the managerial duties is useful guide in determining whether management is the primary duty of an employee in the ordinary case it may be taken as good rule of thumb that primary duty means the major part or over 50 of the employees time time alone however is not the sole test and in s ituations where the employee does not spendhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32349crs12 39 29 cfr 541103 40 us department of labor defining and delimiting exemptions for executive administrative and pr ofessional employees p 15595 41 the 1999 gao report cites two 1982 court decisions involving the burger king corporation that underscore how the 50 rule of thumb in current regulations is not hard and fast rule according to gao the court decisions found that the 50 rule was only one factor to consider when determining employ ees primary duty and that their managerial duties could be carried out at the same time they were performing manual work thus assistant managers could be exempt executives even if they spent most of the day cooking hamburgers as long as they were in charge of the restaurants during their shifts gao fair

rofessional for overtime pay purposes under section 13a1 by william g whittaker 43 29 cfr 541301 over 50 of his time in managerial duties he might nevertheless have management as his primary duty39 the proposed regulations state that the term primary duty means the princi pal main major or most important duty that the employee performs the term primary duty does not require that employees spend over fifty percent of their time performing exempt work however the amount of time spent performing exempt work can be useful guide and employees who spend over fifty percent of the time performing exempt work will be considered to have primary duty of performing exempt work40 whether in practice the revised definition would differ from the current definition is not certain41 finally the proposed regula tions make changes in the definition of learned professionals42 current regulations state that the learned professions are those requiring knowledge of an advanced type in field of science or learning custom arily acquired by prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study as distinguished from general academic education generally speaking it must be knowledge which cannot be attained at the high school level the typical symbol of professional training is of course the appropriate academic degree43 the proposed regulations state that the learned professions require knowledge of an advanced type in field of science or learning customarily acquired by prolonged course of specia lized intellectual instruction but which also may be acquired by alternative means such as an equivalent combination of intellectual instruction and work experience the phrase knowledge of an advanced type means knowledge that cannot be attained at the high school levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32349crs13 44 us department of labor defining and delimiting exem ptions for executive administrative and pr ofessional employees p 15589 45 ibid p 15567 46 for an

employees report prepared for the university of tennessee under contract w ith the wage and hour division of dol jan 2001 tables 2 7 and 9 available on the in ternet at httpwwwdolgovaspprograms flsareportneweconomymainhtm the proposed regulations go on to say that the phrase customarily acquired by prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction generally restri cts the exemption to professions where specialized academic training is standa rd prerequisite for entrance into the profession however the word customarily means that the exemption is also available to employees in such professions who have substantially the same knowledge level as the degreed employee s but who attained such knowledge through combination of work experi ence training in the armed forces attending technical school attending community college or other intellectual instruction 44 in the preamble to the proposed regula tions dol states that although some flexibility to focus on the workers knowledge exists in the current regulation it is very limited and rarely used45 thus it appears that the intent of the combined education and work experience test for learne d professions is to clarify that training and work experience can be substituted for formal education immediate versus longterm effects finally the longterm impact of the proposed regulations may be different fro m the shortterm effects for example because of increases in wages due to in flation and higher bor productivity the relative number of whitecollar employees who are nonexempt because they earn less than the current salary leve l tests has declined over time because the salary level tests in the proposed regulations are not indexed to inflation the relative number of whitecollar workers who may be nonexempt because they earn less than 425 week can also be expected to decline ove r time on the other hand the occupational and industrial composition of the economy may change resulting in an increase in the relative number of whitecollar employees46 finally the proposed regulations may affect employer or employee behavior some hourly workers may be converted to salaried workers or vice versa similarly the job duties of some employees may be changed in order to more clearly distinguish between exempt and nonexempt employees dol epi and crs estimates of the shortterm effects of the

professional employees who are paid by the hour and work overtime may be converted to salaried workers48 epi has estimated that under the pr oposed regulations 25 million nonexempt salaried workers

estimates are based on an analysis of 78 of 257 occupations including managerial professional and supervisor occupations and technical sales and administrative support occupations49 according to cps data large number of executive administrative and professional employees are paid by the hour presumably if there are significant incentives under current regulations to do so these hourly workers would be converted to salaried workers if the proposed regulations create incentives that do not exist under current regulations employ ers may convert some or perhaps many nonexempt hourly whitecollar workers to exempt salaried workers epi cites several changes in the proposed regulations that it believes could create incentives for employers to convert hourly whitecollar workers into salaried workers the combined education and work experien ce test for learned professionals the elimination of the discretion and independent judgement tests the elimination of the 20 limits on nonexempt work and changes in the definition of primary duty50 crs has attempted to estima some of the potential effects of the proposed regulations given the difficulty in interpreting and quantifying the changes however only three estimates have been made the number of whitecollar employees earning between the current salary level tests nd the proposed salary level of 425 the number of learned professionals with at least high school degree but less than bachelors degree and the num ber of whitecollar wo rkers who report that they are paid by the hourhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32349crs15 51 lower and upperbound estimates based on six or more and eight or more years of work experience were made of the number of lear ned professionals who may have been exempt in 2002 as result of the combined education and work experience test when rounded off both methods resulted in an estimate of 10 million employees see appendix b 52 employees exempt from the flsa requirement of timeandahalf for overtime may receive premium pay for overtime under collective bargaining agreement 53 of the estimated 84 million whitecollar workers who were paid by the hour in 2002 an estimated 12 million received overtime pay commissions or tipscrs estimates indicate that in 2002 an estimated 10 to 11 million employed fulltime wage and salary executive administrative and professional employees earned more than the current weekly sa lary test levels ie 155 170 or 250 but less than 425 if they are exempt unde r current regulations they would be nonexempt and eligible for overtime pay under the proposed regulations some or many of these employees may not meet th job duties tests under current regulations and may therefore be none xempt under both current and proposed regulations the effect of the change in status woul d depend in part on the nature ie competitiveness of the bor markets involved for employees newly entitled to overtime pay weekly earnings may increase but because of the increased cost some employers may offer or require less overtime see f ootnote 18 because of the premium for overtime more employees may want to work overtime some salaried workers who work overtime ma be converted to hourly workers the hourly wage of some of these employees may leave their weekly earnings relatively unchanged see footnote 25 in its costbenefit analysis dol assumed that six years of work experience is equivalent to bachelors degree in 2002 an estimated 10 million fulltime learned professionals with six or mo re years of work experien ce had at least high school degree but had not earned bach elors or advanced degree51 some or many of these employees may be exempt under current regulations if not they may become exempt and therefore ineligible for overtime pay under the proposed regulations52 again the effect of the change in stat us would depend on the nature of the labor markets involved for some workers th loss of timeandaha lf for overtime may result in lower weekly earnings because of the lower cost some employers may offer or require more overtime but becau of the loss of timeandahalf fewer workers may want to work overtime some learned professionals who work overtime and are paid by the hour may be converted to salaried wo rkers the weekly earnings of some of these employ ees may remain unchanged finally in 2002 an estimated 84 million fulltime executive administrative and professional employees we re paid by the hour53 if the proposed regulations create incentives that do not exist under current re gulations some or many of these hourly workers may be converted to salaried workers cyclical changes in employment one of the objectives of requiring employers to pay timeandahalf for overtime is to reduce involuntary unemployment crs analysis of cps data for 2001 and 2002 suggests that cyclical changes in the levels of employment among lower wagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32349crs16

and the 65000 decrease in employment among persons who may have been nonexempt under the proposed regulations were not statistically significant nevertheless under current regulations employment among exempt workers did not fall under the proposed regulations employment among wo rkers who may have been nonexempt did not riseworkers who may have been nonexempt inst ead of exempt and learned professionals who may have been exempt instead of nonexempt under the proposed regulations were consistent with the policy objec tive of reducing involuntary unemployment during an economic downturn during 2001 and 2002 the employment of fulltime wage and salary workers reached peak during the threemonth pe riod beginning june 2001 and fell to low during the threemonth period beginning december 20015455 from the threemonth period beginning june 2001 to the th reemonth period beginning december 2001 employment among potentially nonexempt wo rkers under current regulations fell by an estimated 34 million persons on the other hand employment among potentially exempt executive administrative nd professional employees under current regulations increased by an estima ted 94000 persons under the proposed regulations the changes in employment were similar for employees who may have become eligible or ineligible for overtime among employees who may have become nonexempt under the proposed regulations b ecause of the proposed 425 salary level test employment fell by an estimated 65000 persons but employment among workers who may have become exempt because of the combined education and work experience test for learned professionals increased by an estimated 365000 persons56 thus from peak to trough changes in th levels of employment among employees who may have changed status under the proposed regulations ie become nonexempt instead of exempt or exempt in stead of nonexempt were similar to the changes in employment among nonexe mpt and exempt employees under current regulations an examination of different time period or of other changes in the proposed regulations may yield different results an analysis of the number and kinds of jobs lost during an economic downturn may not be good indicator of which work ers should be eligib for timeandahalfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32349crs17 57 jennifer m gardner the 19901991 recession how bad was the labor market monthly labor review

28 quarter 4 1992 pp 34 6 in both studies whiteco llar workers were defined as the sum of managerial and professional speciality worker s and technical sales and administrative workers 58 thus attempt is made to analyze whether the labor markets of workers who may gain overtime coverage are less competitive than the labor markets of exempt workers under current regulations similarly attempt is made to analyze whether the labor markets of workers who may lose overtime coverage are more competitive than the labor markets of nonexempt workers under current regulationsfor overtime downturns differ in their pth and duration some may be relatively mild and shortlived others may be more severe and long erlasting the industries and occupations affected may also differ for example using broader definition of whitecollar workers than the one used in this report some re search has concluded that during the 19901991 recession whiteco llar workers experienced greater job losses relative to bluecollar workers than in previous recessions57 finally cyclical changes in employment may coincide with structural changes in employment during an economic downturn some workers may lose their jobs because of temporary layoffs others may lose their jobs because of shifts in employment from one sector to another eg shift in employment from manufacturing to service industries characteristics of potentially exempt and nonexempt employees the second objective of requiring timea ndahalf for over time is to lessen overwork as discussed above in imperfect labor market s requiring timeandahalf for overtime may discourage employers from requesting overtime or provide employees with higher rate of pay wh they work more than 40 hours week voluntary overtime may be discouraged for social reasons eg to allow workers more time for family educa tion and other matters or to improve individual or public safety ie tired workers may be danger to themselves and others this section does not attempt to identify or m easure the competitiveness of labor markets for different workers rather table 1 uses selected demographic social and labor market characteristics to compare poten tially exempt and nonexempt employees under current regulations with workers w ho may have become exempt or nonexempt under the proposed regulations the purpose of these comparisons is to examine whether employees who may gain or overtime eligib ility under the proposed regulations are similar to or different from nonexempt or exempt employees under current regulations58 the percentages in table 1 are based on estimates of the number of employees potentially exempt or nonexempt under curre nt and proposed regulations in 2002 there were an estimated 98 million fulltime wage and salary workers including for

from other nonexempt workers but in other ways they were much the same in terms of age race and marital status wo rkers who may have gained eligibility for overtime were similar to other nonexempt workers59 however by nature of the proposed change in the salary level test employees who may have been nonexempt instead of exempt had lower weekly earnings than nonexempt workers under current

experience test had been in eff ect in 2002 had less formal education than exempt workers under current regulations although threefourths 758 had some college none had bachelors or advanced degree by nature of the change in regulations the employees who may have lost overtime eligibility were learned professionals they had somewhat wer earnings than workers exempt under current regulations 327 of

eligibility fo r overtime as result of the higher 425 salary level test change in status from exempt to nonexempt may raise the weekly earnings of some workers reduce the am ount of overtime or both some salaried workers who work overtime may be converted to hourly workers some of these workers may experience little change in thei r weekly earnings because less skilled workers are more likely than skilled work ers to be laid off during recession requiring timeandahalf for more lower paid workers may during an economic downturn reduce the amount of involuntar unemployment the effect on the overall unemployment rate may be small however some higher wage workers may lose ligibility for ove rtime as re sult of the exemption for learned professionals w ho acquire advanced knowledge through combination of education and work experi ence change in status from nonexempt to exempt may lower the weekly earnings of some workers increase the amount of overtime or both some learned professionals who work overtime and are paid by the hour may be converted to salaried worker s for some of these workers becoming salaried worker may have little effect on their weekly earnings because skilled

the analysis in this report uses da ta from the monthly current population survey cps the cps is household surv ey conducted by the us bureau of the census for the bureau of labor statistics bls of the us department of labor the monthly cps is the main source of labor force data for the nation including estimates of the monthly unemployment rate the cps collects wide range of demographic social and labor market information each month approximately 50000 households are contacted to be intervie wed either in person or by phone the cps collects labor force data for civilians 15 and over the official definition of the civilian labor force is ages 16 and over the monthly cps sample is representative of the civilian noninstitutional population it does not include persons on active military duty6364 each month onefourth of the cps sample called the outgoing rotation group or org is asked questions about cu rrent hourly or weekly earnings for table 1 the org samples for each month from 2002 were combined to calculate monthly average for the year65 weekly earnings consist of usual earnings before taxes and other deductions and include tips overtime pay and commissions usually received at persons main job hourly earnings are reported for persons who are paid by the hour or who report their earning s on an hourly basis earnings reported for period other than week are c onverted by bls to weekly amount66 the cps does not ask workers if they are exempt or nonexempt from the overtime provisions of the flsa therefore the survey does not allow direct estimates of the number of exempt or none xempt workers nevertheless using information on an employees occupation industry and in some cases weekly earnings and education it is possible to use cps data to estimate the number of employees who are potentially exempt or nonexempt the flsa includes various exceptions and exemptions to the overtime provisions of the act some exemptions apply to certain employers eg some seasonal amusement or recreational establis hments other exemptions are allowed for workers in certain occupations eg out side sales workers or industries eghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32349crs26 67 computer professionals were categorized as exempt whether or not they held bachelors or advanced degree with respect to comput er professionals current regulations state that the level of expertise and skill required to qua lify for this exemption is generally attained through combinations of education and experi ence particular academic degree is required for this exemption 29 cfr 541303c 68 29 cfr 541102 69 medical technologists who meet certain educational requirements are generally exempt from the overtime provisions of the flsa 29 cfr 541301 in the cps medical technologists are grouped with medical technici ans since it is not possible to separate technologists from technicians it was assume d that workers in these categories with bachelors degree or better were exempt 70 section 4f of the flsa authorizes the us office of personnel management opm to administer the flsa with respect to fede ral agencies except for the us house of representatives us senate library of congress congressional budget office us postal service and certain other agenciesforestry and lumber operators employing fe wer than nine workers in addition the wage and hour division of dol administers the flsa with respect to private employers state and local governments and certain federal employees eg us postal service library of congress nd tennessee valley authority but the us office of personnel management opm admin isters the flsa for employees of the executive branch of the federal government the analysis in this report examines employed hourly and nonhourly wage and salary employees ages 16 and over who usually work fulltime selfemployed persons are not included using data fro m the cps the following employees were categorized as potentially exempt from the overtime provisions of the flsa agricultural and fishing workers employees in the railroad nd airline industries outside sales workers seamen taxi drivers newspaper deliverers casual babysitters computer professionals who are paid by the hour and earn more than 2763 an hour drivers and mechanics in the bus and trucki ng service industries salesmen employed by automobile truck aircraft boat nd mobile home dealers and mechanics employed by automobile or truck dealers in addition executive administrative and professional with at least bachelors degree67 employees who meet the current weekly salary level tests for exemption are categorized as exempt according to current regulations executive employees generally perform managerial and supervisory functions68 therefore persons categorized in the cps as managerial and supervisory employees and who meet the weekly salary level test for executives are treated as exempt dent hygienists and health nd medical technologists with at least bachelors degree are treated as exempt under current regulations dental hygienists with less than bachelors degree are treated as exempt under the proposed regulations if they meet the proposed work experience test69 except for employees of the us postal service federal employees are excluded from the analysis70 for analytical purposes using the cps to categorize employees who are potentially exempt and nonexempt may result in employees being misclassified for example respondent who is classified as m anager in the cps may not meet the requirements under current regu lations to be classified as exempt likewise anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32349crs27 71 us department of labor defining and delimiting the exemptions for xecutive administrative and pr ofessional employees p 15577employee who performs both exempt and nonexe mpt work may be categorized in the cps as worker who performs manual work but if the worker also supervises other employees the employee may be exempt for overtime purposes similarly whitecollar employees earning 250 or mo re may not be exempt from the overtime provisions of the flsa if they do not meet the appropriate job duties test the estimates of the number of employees who may have been nonexempt if the proposed salary level st had been in effect in 2002 ar based on the sala ry level tests in the current and proposed regulations the lowerbound is an estimate of the number of employees earning 250 or more per week but less than 425 the upper bound is an estimate of the number of employees earning 155 or more per week 170 for professional employees but less than 425 the estimates of the number of learned professionals who may have been exempt in 2002 because they may have met the job duties test through combination of work experience and education is for em ployees with at least high school degree but less than bachelors degree the estimates do not include creative professionals but include l earned professionals for whom there is federal salary test ie doctors lawyers and teachers for other pr ofessionals the estimates are for employees with usual weekly earning s of 425 or more work experience was calculated as potential work experience age minus years of education minus six the estimates include persons who began work earlier than age 18 an upper bound estimate follows the approach describe d by the us department of labor in its analysis of the impact of the proposed regulations it was ssumed that six years of work experience was equivalent to bachelors degree71 because individuals may not work continuously or may not work continuously in the same job lowerbound estimate was calculated for persons with eight years of potential work experience in both cases when rounded off the calcu lations resulted in an estimate of 10 million learned professionals with less than bachelors degree the pr oposed regulations do not however provide speci fic equivalence between years of work experience and bachelors or advan ced degree therefore the upperbound estimate would be higher if it were assumed that fewer than six years of work experience is equivalent to bachelors degree similarly the lowerbound estimate would be smaller if it were assumed that more than eight years of work experience is equivalent to bachelors degree the estimate of the numbe r of fulltime executive administrative and professional employees who are paid by th hour consists of whitecollar employees who are paid an hourly wage or who repor t their earnings on an hourly basis for workers subject to salary level test the estimate includes employees who earn 425 or more week for computer professionals the estimate includes employees who are paid by the hour have weekly earning s of at least 425 and are paid less than 2763 an hour for learned prof essionals with less than an bachelors degree but at least high school degree the estimate in cludes employees with six or more years of potential work experience httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32349crs28 72 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics employment and earnings vol 49 nov 2002 pp 147148 the earnings intervals used for weekly earnings in table 1 are based on equal quintiles of the earnings distribution that is among all full time wage and salary workers in 2002 onefifth earned 366 week or less onefifth earned more than 366 but less than 519 and so on confidence levels the comparisons discussed in the text of this report are statistically significant at the 95 confidence level estimates ba sed on survey responses from sample of households have two kinds of error nonsampling error and sampling error examples of nonsampling error include in formation that is misreported and errors made in processing collected information sampling error occurs because sample and not the entire population of households is surveyed the difference between an estimate based on sample of households and the actua l population value is known as sampling error72 when using sample data re searchers typically construct confidence intervals around population estima tes confidence intervals provide information about the accuracy of estimated values with 95 confidence interval and repeated samples from population 95 of intervals will generally include the actual value of population characteristic
