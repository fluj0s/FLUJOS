part of the roads supplementary documenta tion has been completed at stage 2 of the planning process parts b c and d will be co mpleted at stage 3 of the planning process planned operations maps of the proposed alternative primary road corridors are presented at the end of this documentation primary road corridors the algonquin park forest management unit has had an approved permanent forest management road system strategy since 1981 the road system has been completed to provide for economical transportation of forest products to processing facilities and access for renewal and tending activities the algonquin park forest independent forest audit 19972002 recommended that the roads strategy be reviewed an updated forest management access roads strategy for the algonquin park forest has been developed as an internal policy document by ontario parks in partnership with the algonquin forestry authority in order to meet this ifa recommendation major part of the roads strategy deals with the division of the management unit into forest access management areas famas whic h are based to the extent possible on the existing road system primary andor branch roads form the backbone of access to fama number of permanent and temporary breaks in the permanent road system were also mapped in support of the objectives and strategies c ontained in the road strategy it is recognized that refinements to fama boundaries and locations of road breaks may be made based on improved information incorporation of any components of the roads strategy into the fmp ar subject to review and discussion by the planning team four changes to the primary road system are pr oposed for construction during the term of the fmp one kilometre wide corridors have been developed as per the fmpm march

alternative corridors this change to the primary road system to provide access to areas in preston and sproule townships fam area 25 currently accessed by the cameron lake road is necessitated by two factors 1 the replacement of the annie bay dam w ill not provide bridge over the opeongo 7 river eliminating access from the north 2 the forest management access roads stra tegy for the algonquin park forest shows 9 permanent break in the road system at the south end of the cameron lake road where it meets the opeongo lake rd loss of these road connections leaves fam area 25 without road access it is proposed that access to this area is from the east off the shir ley lake road via an extension of the billy lake road both alternatives include some s ections of operational road from past harvest
