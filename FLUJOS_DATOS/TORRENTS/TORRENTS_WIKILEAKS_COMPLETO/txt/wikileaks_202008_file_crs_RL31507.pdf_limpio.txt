in employer stock assume unnecessary risk because for any expected rate of return from employer stock there is diversified portfolio that will provide the same rate of return with less investment risk although some employ ees might realize substantial gains by investing their retirement accounts in employer securities all market participants will in the aggregate earn the market rate of return there will be winners among workers who choose to invest heavily in employer stock but there also will be losers crs analysis of forms filed with the securities and exchange commission by 278 firms showed that on average co mpany stock comprised 380 of the assets in their defined contribution plans the median concentration of company stock was 247 both figures are higher than the 10 to 20 that many investment advisors recommend as the maximum exposure to single firms securities statistical analysis showed that three variables had positive and statistically significant relationships to the percentage of plan assets invested in company stock 1 making the company matching contribution with co mpany stock 2 an average annual total return on company stock that exceeded th return on the sp

in 2002 i overview of employersponsored retirement plans the two types of retirement plan over the past two decades the proportion of american workers who partic ipate in employersponsored retirement plans has remained relatively steady in 1979 46 of all workers participated in employersponsored retirement plans while in 2000 an estimated 47 of all workers participated in such plans1 although the overall rate of participation in employer sponsored retirement plans has changed ve ry little over this time there has been shift in the distribution of plans and participants from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans see table 1 in defined contribution plan it is usually up to the employee to decide whether or not to pa rticipate how much to contribute to the plan and how to invest these contributions consequently workers today bear more of the responsibility of providing for their retirement than when defined benefit plans were the dominant form of plan httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31507crs2 2 any plan that does not fit this definition is classified as defined benefit plan see 26 usc 414i and 414jtable 1 retirement plans and participants by type of plan

benefits administration employers sponsor retirement plans vol untarily but those who choose to do so must abide by the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 pl 93406 popularly known as erisa in order for plan to be tax qualified that is for contributions to the plan and investment earnings on those contributions to be eligible for deferral of federal income taxes the plan must also comply with the relevant sections of the internal revenue code of 1986 employer sponsored retirement plans are legally classified as either defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans in defined benefit or db plan the retirement benefit is usually paid as lifelong annuity base d on the employees length of service and average salary in the years immediately pr eceding retirement db plans are funded by employer contributions to pension trust the contributions and investment earnings must be equal to the benefits that workers accrue each year in defined benefit plan the investment risk is borne by the employer if the value of the pension trust is not equal to the present value of the plans accrued obligations the plans sponsor is required to make up this shortfall called an unfunded liability through additional contributions over period of ears defined benefit plans are insured up to certain limits by the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc defined contribution plans are not insured by the pbgc the internal revenue code signates plans that provide individual accounts for each participant and that pay benefits based solely on the contributions to the accounts and subsequent inves tment gains or losses as defined contribution plans2 the most common defined contribution plan is the 401k named for section of the internal revenue code that was added by the revenue act of 1978 pl 95600 under erisa and the tax code 401k plan is both defined contribution plan and an individual account plan in 401k plan the employee as well as the employer can make pretax contributions to his or her account typically the participants can allocate the investment of their account balances among menu of investment options selected by the employ er andor plan administrator appointed by the employer employer stock also ca lled company stock is often one of thosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31507crs3 3 legally both defined benefit plans and fined contribution plans are pension plans erisa applies to both kinds of plan although it prescribes separate rules for each typeoptions in defined contribution plan th participants retirement benefit consists of the balance in the account which is the sum of all the contributions that have been made plus interest divide nds and capital gains or losses the participant usually has the choice of receiving these funds in th form of lifelong annuity as series of fixed payments over period of years or as lump sum in recent years many large employers ve converted their traditional db plans to hybrid plans that have characteris tics of both defined benefit and defined contribution plans the most popular of these hybrids has been the cash balance plan cash balance plan looks like define d contribution plan in that the accrued benefit is defined in terms of an account balance the employer but not the employee makes contributions to the plan and pays interest on the accumulated balance however in cash balance pla n the account balances are merely record of the participants accrued benefit they are not individual accounts owned by the participants legally therefore cash balan ce plan is defined benefit plan reasons for the shift to dc plans some analysts consider the decline in the number of defined benef it plans to be an unintende d consequence of the passage of erisa in 1974 likewise the growth in the number of defined contribution plans is sometimes said to be at least in part an unexpected result of an amendment to the internal revenue code th at was included in the revenue act of 1978 erisa and the decline of the defined benefit plan the employee retirement income security act of 1974 was passed by congress to protect the interests of pension par ticipants and beneficiaries in the private sector3 erisa was enacted in response to instances in wh ich pension funds had been mishandled or plans had become insolvent it also addressed certain obstacles to receipt of pension benefits such as onerous age and lengtho fservice requirements erisa established standards for private pension plans that ma ke it more likely that pension participants will receive the pension benefits that th ey have earned for example erisa requires defined benefit pension plans to be fully funded this means that the assets held by the pension fund must equal the present va lue of the benefits owed to current retirees and to employees who have vested ie who have earned the right to receive benefits when they retire if the assets in the pension f und lose value or appreciate more slowly than vested benef its the employer is responsible for the shortfall to maintain its fullyfunded status the plan must grow each year through employer contributions and i nvestment earnings by an amount equal to the increase in the present value of the benefits accrued by the plans participants the legal requirement to keep the plan fully funded means that the employer is at risk for the full value of the benefits that have been ear ned by the plan participants any assets in excess of the amount needed to pay benefits are the property of the employer although these assets are subject to federa l excise tax of up to 50 if they are used for any other purpose than to provide pensions or retiree health benefits in addition to the financial risk assumed by an employer that sponsors db plan there are ongoing administrative expenses for maintaining the plans recordshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31507crs4 4 the reverse is also true should the plan become overfunded the excess assets can be entered on the firms balance sheet financial reporting of pension fund liabilities is governed by the financial accounting sta ndards boards statement 87 and statement 132 5 the option to defer current cash income and to deposit that amount into an individual account is the reason that the 401k is sometimes called cash or deferred arrangement 6 growing number of firms are enrolling all ligible employees in their 401k plans so that the default condition is for the employee to be enrolled with the option to quit the planprocessing changes in information for pl an participants assuring that the plan remains in compliance with relevant regulations and paying insurance premiums to the pension benefit guaranty corporati on pbgc estimating the present value of the benefits that have been earned under th plan requires an actuary to forecast the ages lengths of service and salaries of the plan sponsors employees many years in the future if at any point the plan b ecomes underfunded the firm must restore it to fullyfunded status over period of years or risk losing its taxqualified status consequence that can result in substantial taxes and penalties furthermore if pension plan develops an unfunded liability this liability must be displayed in the firms financial statements4 the standards establis hed under erisa have made workers pensions more secure however many employers especially small employers have said that the cost of complying with erisa has made db plans prohibitively expensive to administer the revenue act of 1978 and the rise of the 401k the decline in the number of db plans began at nearly the same time that the number of defined contribution plans particularly 401k pl ans began to rise rapidly section 401k was added to the inte rnal revenue code by the revenue act of 1978 but it was not until 1981 after regulations had been published by the irs that the first 401k plan was establishe d defined contribution plans existed before the revenue act of 1978 but it was only after the advent of the 401k that dc plans overtook traditional defined benef it pensions in number of plans participants and total assets earlier defined contributi on plans had been funded exclusively by employer contributions in 401k plan however the employee as well as the employer can make contributions w ith pretax income5 the ability of both the employer and the employee to contribute on pretax basis and the voluntary nature of employee participation are defining char acteristics of the 401k plan6 these characteristics place much responsibility on the participant who must decide whether or not to participate in the plan how much to contri bute and how to invest the contributions defined contribution plans are relativ ely less burdensome to administer than defined benefit plans because they do not require actuarial forecasts of future employment salaries and bene fit obligations nor is the cost of funding dc plan as variable and unpredictable as the cost of funding db plan because the benefit provided by the plan is equal to the account balance dc plan is by definition fully funded at all times in dc plan the employer makes promise about the amount of benefits to be paid during retirement the firm merely commits itself to making contributions of certain amount or certain percentage of pay during the employees tenure with the employer these contributions are sometimes conditioned on the employee also making c ontributions defined contribution plans are not insured by the pbgc and so the firm pays pbgc insurance premiumshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31507crs5 7 benartzi thaler how much is investor autonomy worth journal of finance 2002in dc plan it is the employee who bears the risk that the contributions to the plan and subsequent investment earnings will be sufficient to provide an adequate income during retirement if the contribu tions made to the account by the employer and the employee are too small or if the securities in which the account is invested lose value or increase in value too slowly the employee risks having an income in retirement that cannot sustain his or her desire d standard of living if this situation occurs the worker might choose to delay re tirement the principal kinds of defined contribution plan are listed in exhibit 1 exhibit 1 principal types of defined contribution

pensions 6th edition ii the role of company stock in retirement plans company stock and investment risk as noted earlier fundamental characteristic of defined contribution retirement plans is that the employee bears the investment risk which is defined as the risk of loss inherent in the purchase of stocks bonds and other financ ial assets an investor who understands the risk and return characteristics of stocks and bonds and who has welldefined set of preferences for one set of riskandreturn characteristics versus another will be able to allocate his investments in way that balances his tolerance for risk with the expected rate of return from each kind of investment for example an informed investor understands that the risk of loss associated with holding single stock is always greater than the risk of loss associated with holding welldiversified stock portfolio of the same value recent research seems to indicate however that many 401k plan participants have poor understanding of inve stment risk as result they may make choices about the allocation of their i nvestments that are not well informed decisions7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31507crs6 8 lisa meulbroek company st ock in pension plans how co stly is it harvard business school working paper 02058 march 2002 meul broek emphasizes that the cost of holding company stock is function not of the level risk of holding singlestock portfolio but the lack of compensati on received for bearing that risk 9 defined benefit pension plans are insured up to certain limits by the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc publicly charte red corporation that was established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 pl 93406 for more information see crs report 95118 the pension benefit gu aranty corporati on fact sheet 10 krishna ramswamy company stock and dc plan diversification prepared for the pension research council conference at the university of pennsylvania april 2002 he estimates that the premium for an option contract guaranteeing the better of the rate of return on the stock or the rate of return of well diversified portfolio would be about 178 per year for each 1000 of stock held cost that will ppear prohibitive to most investors when an individual chooses to allocate large proportion of his or her total assets to single security such as em ployer stock instead diversifying among range of stock and bond mutual funds that person is assuming more risk than is necessary to achieve particular expected rate of return some workers who invest in employer stock may do so out of loyalty or because they enjoy the feeling of being an owneremployee others may believe that their employers stock will outperform the overall market over some particular time horizon ne vertheless for any given expected rate of return there exists dive rsified portfolio of assets that will provide the same expected rate of return with less risk to the investor than portfolio concentrated in company stock economists have estimated that portfolio invested in the stock of single firm listed on th new york stock exchange is on average twice as risky in terms of price volatility as welldiversified portfolio of stocks8 portfolio invested in single firm listed on the nasdaq with its more volatile stock prices was threeandahalf times as risky as welldiversified portfolio there is governmental insurance plan for defined contribution plans as there is for defined benefit plans9 there is however financial mechanism through which investors can purchase form of insurance against the possibility that particular security will drop in value by purchasing an option known as put an investor can insure against the possibility of security declining in value within period of time that is specified in the option contract if the stock falls below the value defined in the contract the seller of the option must pay the investor the amount guaranteed by the cont ract the price of the put option therefore is much like an insurance premium if the stock price does not fall by the specified amount the investor loses the amount that he or she paid to purchase the option contract however if the price of the stock colla pses and has not recovered by the date specified in the option contract the inve stor is assured of getting back the amount guaranteed in the option contract an op tion could be designed to guarantee the purchaser the better of the actual rate of return on companys stock or the rate of return of stock market index such options however would likely be priced beyond the reach of all but th most affluent investors10 moreover not all company stocks have underlying options that trade on an exchange company stock and investment choice many public policy analysts have studied the extent to which defined contribution plans are invested in employerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31507crs7 11 shlomo benartzi and richard thaler nai ve

paul sengmuller performance predicts asset allocation company stock in 401k plans columbia university depart ment of economics april 2002 page 31stock and have attempted to identify the reasons that employers and employees take on this risk one hypothesis is that many participants in 401k plans divide their contributions proportionally among all the i nvestment options offered by the plan11 in plan with six investment options for example many participants will direct one sixth of their contributions to each fund the investment choices of workers who follow this 1n investment strategy do not appear to be strongly sensitive to the kind of investment options offered whe ther equity funds or bond f unds and consequently the array of f unds offered to plan particip ants can have surprisingly strong influence on the assets they end up owning12 research has found that when company stock is offered as an inves tment option it comprises substantial proportion of plan assets for example in sample of 170 large plans plan assets were split almost evenly between equities stocks and fixedincome investments bonds in the 103 plans that did not offer company stock as an investment choice in the 67 plans that allowed employees to invest in company stock however 42 of the plan assets were invested in company stock 29 in other equities and 29 in fixedincome investments13 another recent study found that empl oyees tendency to purchase company stock is strongly influenced by the stocks past performance14 employees may tend to excessively extrapolate past gains into the future leading them to invest relatively more heavily in employer stock than employees of firms whose stock has experienced average or belowaverage performance workers whose employers make matching contributions in the form of comp any stock also appear to be more likely to purchase company stock than workers who are able to direct the companys matching contribution to investments of their own choice economists have suggested that employees see the companys choice to make its matching contribution with company stock as form of implicit investment advice workers may interpret it as an ndorsement of the company s stock as an appropriate investment for their retirement account although the past performance of company stock appears to have substantial effect on workers investment choices economists generally agree that past gains are poor predictor of stocks future performance and that chasing past returns is not an optimal strategy for investors to follow15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31507crs8 16

of the university of pennsylvania and steven utkus of the vanguard group have estimated that 23 million peopl have access to company stock through defined contribution retirement plans of this number they estimate that 11 million hold concentrated stock positions exceeding 20 per cent of account balances of these 5 million hold positions exceeding 60 pe rcent of account balances16 mitchell and utkus suggest that because holding high concentration of company stock increases portfolio risk such concentrations w ill produce greater extremes in realized retirement wealth as well as lower median wealth than would system of more diversified investments17 moreover they find that the growth of defined contribution plans that include large centrations of compan stock has gradually blurred the distinction between plans desi gned to enhance employee ownership and plans designed to maximize retirement security18 while some employees might realize substantial gains by investing thei r retirement accounts in employer securities the authors observe that investing in sing stock must be zerosum game across investors with all participants in the aggregate earning the market return19 in

mitchell and utkus 2002 suggest that an employer who also offers defined benefit plan might be more willing to tolerate high concentrations of company stock in the companys dc plan because the db plan

median concentration was higher among firms with fewer than the median number of employees 279 vs 223 the relationship between co mpany size and the concentration of company stock was strongest when

performance and 3 are relatively large in terms of total assets in other words all three of these variables are positively correlated with the proportion of the companys dc plan that is invested in company stock however statistics that show the relationship between only two variables at time can sometimes be misleading because many variables might simultaneously influence firms decision to contribute stock to retirement plan or workers decision to purchase company stock some of these variables may have strong interaction effects on each other we can control for the interaction effects among variables by employing multi variate regression analysis this procedure measures the extent to which changes in one or more independent variables are associated with changes in dependent variable also called the response variable regression analysis shows how specific change in each independent variable is associated with change in the dependent variable when all of the other independent variables remain fixed at their mean values properly specified model will show whether the dependent variable and particular inde pendent variable increase or decrease together or whether they move in opposite directions and whether the change in the dependent variable is large or small one must be careful however not to infer that change in the value of an independent variable causes change in the dependent variable the dependent variable might be affected by some other f actor or factors that are not included in the regression model but that change simu ltaneously with one or more of the independent variables included in the model the possibility of having omitted potentially important variable is especially acute in the social sciences where controlled experiments are not often possible summary of the regression results in this model the dependent variable is the percentage of firms total defined contribution pl an assets invested in company stock at the end of fiscal year 2000 as reported on the form 11k that the firm filed with the sec in 200133 we included six independent variables that economic theory or previous empirical res earch suggested might be related to the concentration of company stock complete results of the regression analysis are shown in the appendix in this case the results of the multivariate analysis confirmed what the simple descriptive statistics shown in table 3 had revealed three variables were shown to have positive and statistically significant relationship to the percentage of companys dc plan assets invested in company stock they were 1 making the co mpany matching contribution with company stock 2 an average annual total return on company stock that exceeded the returnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31507crs14 34 because we are looking at the concentration of company stock at point in time we cannot say how much of this 53 percentage poi nt excess of company stock is attributable to additional employee purchases and how much is due to the fact that absent periodic re balancing of portfolios higher rate of retu rn on any security will lead to that security comprising larger proportion of an investors portfolio 35 the enron

that other things being equal the concentration of company stock would be 53 percentage points higher at firm where the 3year rate average of return on company stock was twice the rate of return of the sp 500 wh compared with firm where the 3year rate average of return on company stock was the same as the return on the sp 50034 finally the regression results indicate that even among the relatively large firms in our sample the concentration of company stock increases with company size the effect is not especially dramatic however among the 278 firms in this sample 10 increase in

ensure that the assets of pension trust funds are diversified beyond the assets of the company itself congress limited the amount of employer stock that can be held in defined benefit plan to 10 of plan ssets when it passed erisa in 197436 this reduces the risk that pension fund would become in solvent as result of the company that sponsors the plan going bankrupt c ongress has generally

sustained to their retirement account balances40 fiduciary duties under erisa section 404a1 of erisa 29 usc 1104a1 requires plan fiduciary to act s olely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their be neficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan the fiduciary must carry

the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with like aims although erisa generally does not limit the amount of company stock that can be held in dc plan the plan sponsor still has fiduciary duty to manage the plan in the best interest of the participants including the obligation to select investment options that are appropriate for retirement plan and to monitor these investment options to assure that they remain suitable investments for plan participants if plan offers company stock as an investment op tion or makes matching contributions with company stock the employer must make disinterested assessment as to whether the stock is an appropriate investment for the plans participants this can sometimes put company officers who are pl an fiduciaries in difficult situation mitchell and utkus 2002 state that the employer as fiduciary sta nds in somewhat tenuous if not contradictory position in the oversight of company stock because if the firm encounters difficulties its executives could be in the incongruous position of removing company stock from the retirement plan while simultaneously seeking to inspire confidence in the company among outside investors41 who is fiduciary under erisa section 321a of erisa 29 usc 100221a defines as fiduciary any person who 1 exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting the management of the plan or exercises any authority or control respecting the management or disposition of its assets or 2 renders investment advice to plan pa rticipants or administrators for fee or other compensation or has

definition of fiduciary that fiduciary is as fiduciary does was affirmed by the supreme court in varity corporation v howe in 1996 wherein the court ruled that in relevant part the statute says that

first p l n fiduciary under erisa must act solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries if actions taken in the best interest of plan participants also were always in the best interest

has noted that ironically even if you are acting in the good faith of the company you may not be acting in the best interests of the plan participants there is often an inherent tension you must manage pension plan for the benefit of participan ts and not for the company these are mutually exclusive43 an example of the conflict that can occur between the interests of firms management and the

404c specify that plan qualifies for relief from responsibility for investment losses only if it provides the participant 1 the opportunity to exercise control over the assets in his or her acc ount and 2 the opportunity to choose from broad range of inve stment alternatives46 participant or beneficiary is deemed to have access to broad range of investme nt alternatives if he has reasonable

disclosure would violate nother federal law such as the securities act of 1933 the section 404c regulations further st ate that relief from fiduciary liability is contingent upon the participant having the opportunity to obtain sufficient information to make informed decisions with regard to investment alternatives available under the plan50 thus an employer that allo ws plan participants to invest in particular mutual fund for example w ould have to provide pa rticipants with the same information generally available to the public such as the funds most recent prospectus however while the regula tion requires plan fiduciaries to provide information that is necessary for participants to make informed investment decisions fiduciary has oblig ation to provide investment advice to participant or beneficiary under an eris section 404c plan51 emphasis added an important caveat relief from responsibility for investment losses through erisa 404c is availabl to plans fiduciaries only after they have met their obligation to select appropriate investment alternatives from which plan participants may choose the department of labors regulation for erisa 404c emphasizes that the

provisions of erisa remain applicable to both the initial designation of investment alternatives and investment managers and the ongoing determination that such alternatives and managers remain

furthermore if employer stock is offered as an investment alternative the plan fiduciaries must ensure that information provided to shareholders of ch securities is provided to participants and

duties with respect to investment in employer stock58 as these cases indicate when the employers stock suffers precipitous decline in value the loss of retirement savings can trigger claims that the plans fiduciaries breached their duties of care and loyalty by allowing the plan to continue buying company stock or by failing to sell company stock as the co mpanys financial condition deteriorated59 if an employer both allows participants to purchase employer stock voluntarily and makes its matching contributi ons with employer stock th participants could assert that 1 the company breached its fiduciary duty by continuing to make its stock available as an investment option after the plan administrators knew or should have known that it was likely to decline in valu

alleged breaches of fiduciary duty with respect to employer securities in defined contribution retirement plans two attorneys who specialize in erisa recently observed that erisa requires that plan fiduciaries pr udently monitor the investments in 401k plans including employer stock alt hough the standard for that review may not be clear at the least the fiduciaries must periodically review the investment for its suitability for participant direction and cannot ignore evidence indicating that the employer stock is longer appropriate for the plan more likely the fiduciaries have an affirmative duty to investigate the quality of the stock as an ongoing investment to hire independent experts when needed and to act on the results of those activities60 recent employer actions some

squares ols the dependent variable the matter to be explained is the percentage of firms total defined contribution plan asse ts invested in company stock at the end of fiscal year 2000 as reported by firms on the form 11k filed with the sec in 200167 we included six independent va riables that economic theory or previous empirical research suggested might be related to the concentration of comp any stock in defined contribution plans the intercept of 98 is statistically significant at the 01 level the adjusted r2 or coefficient of determination is 334 this suggests that the independent variables explai n about onethird of the co mpanytocompany variation in the concentration of employer stock in defined contribution plans complete results of the regression analysis are shown in table a1 mandatory holding peri od for company stock some employers require company stock that is given by the comp any as matching contribution or other contribution to be held by the worker until he or she reaches certain age typically 50 or 55 or until the worker leaves the firm68 sixtysix firms in our sample reported on their 11k forms that they had such required holding period we would expect that other things being equal the concen tration of company stock in firms dc plan would be higher if it had mandatory holding period for company stock than if employees were free to sell shares at any time the sign for this variable was positive as expected but the coefficient was not statistically significant matching contribution ma in company stock more than half of the firms in the sample 146 out of 278 ma their matching contributions with company stock this variable proved to have positive and statistically significant relationship to the concentration of compan stock in the firms defined contribution plans the coefficient of 177 indicates that other things being equal the concentration of company st ock will be 177 percentage points higher at firm that makes its matching contribution with comp any stock than at firm that does not this was the largest coefficient of any independent variable in the regression equation does the company offer defined benefit plan as noted earlier in the discussion of table 3 there is reason to believe that the concentration of company stock might be higher at firms that offer defined benefit plan as well as defined contribution plan most of the firms in our sample 205 of 278 offered db plan to majority of their us employees we included variable in the regression with value of 1 for firms that sponsored db plan and 0 for those th at did not contrary to our expectation the sign of this variab was negative indicating that the company stock concentration was lower at firms that also sponsor ed db plan however the coefficient was not statistically significanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31507crs28 69 more formally the beta coefficient is defined as emk nmk em2 nm2 where m the market rate of return in pe riod p the riskfree rate of

neither the market beta nor the standard deviation of company stock returns was statistically sign ificant in regression on the allocation of employee salary deferrals to company stoc k liang and weisbenner 2002 however found that the standard deviation of the return on company stock was negatively and significantly related to the percentage of employee deferrals allocated to company stockcompany stock performance relative to the sp 500 benartzi 2001 and sengmuller 2002 both found that employee purchases of company stock through retirement savings plan were infl uenced by the past financial performance of the stock relative to the market as whole to test the relationship of past company stock performance to the concentration of company stock in the firms 401k plan we included variable that re presented the ratio of the average annual rate of total return realized by the companys stock from 1997 through 1999 to the average annual rate of total return of the standard poors 500 index over the same threeyear period this variable had positive and statistically significant relationship to the concentration of comp any stock in the sample firms defined contribution plans the co efficient of 53 indicates that other things being equal the concentration of company stock would be 53 percentage points higher at firm where the threeyear rate average of return on company stock was twice the rate of return of the sp 500 when compared with firm where the threeyear rate average of return on company stock was the same as the return on the sp 500 because we looked at the concentration of company st ock at point in time we cannot say how much of this 53 percentage point exce ss of company stock is attributable to additional employee purchases and how much is due to the fact that absent periodic rebalancing of portfolios higher rate of return on any security would lead to that security comprising larger propor tion of an investment portfolio relative variability of company stock the risk that an investor bears is the possibility of loss it is fundament tenet of modern portfolio theory that holding single stock entails greater risk than holding welldi versified portfolio of stocks this risk is measured as the relative volatility of the expected return on given security compared with the expected return for the entire market this measure of risk is referred to as stocks beta coefficient 69 economic theory suggests that for any given expected rate of return an investor would prefer to hold less volatile ie less risky stock we would therefore ex pect to find negative relationship between stocks beta coefficient and its concentration in the companys retirement plan to measure the relationship between the relative volatility of companys stock and its concentration in the companys defined contribution plan we calculated the beta coefficient for each stock for the th reeyear period from 1997 through 1999 as expected the sign associated with company stocks beta coefficient was negative however the coefficient was not statistically significant70 size of the company benartzi 2001 found that company size was positively associated with employee

dependent variable is not the expected change in the dependent variable asso ciated with given percentage change in the independent variable can be derived as loge100x100 where x equals the percent change in the independent variable and the change in the dependent variablecompany stock in the firms retirement pl an we included compan assets expressed as the natural logarithm of those assets in the regression model71 the results indicate that even among sample of biggerthanaverage companies the concentration of company stock increases with company size the effect is not especially dramatic however the regression results indicate that among the firms in this sample 10 increase in total company assets is associated with an increase in the concentration of company stock in the firms dc plans of only 04 percentage points72 note on the number of investment options benartzi and thaler 2001 found evidence that ma ny participants in 401k plans follow 1n diversification strategy an i nvestor following this strate gy would divide his payroll deferrals proportionally among each of the i nvestment options available in the plan their results suggest that other things being equal the proportion of employee elective deferrals invested in company stock will be lower in plan with more investment options than in plan with fewer options the percentage of plans assets invested in company stock at any given time however will depend both on the past performance of company stock relative to the other investment options and the extent to which plan participants respond to new investment op tions by redirecting some of their deferrals and accumulated assets into the new investments it is perhaps not surprising then that when we included variable indicating the number of investment options available in the pla n the sign was negative but the coefficient was not statistically significant we dr opped this variable from the final version of the model table a1 regression
