science and industry division bernard gelb specialist in industry economics resources science and industry division summary steep increases in the prices of gasoline diesel and other transportation fuels have prompted some members of congress to s eek to ease the effects on households and businesses interest has focu sed on possible repeal or suspension of the levying of all or part of the federal excise taxes on those fuels current market conditions and the small amount of tax relief inco rporated in most proposals however raise uncertainty as to whether prices to individuals and busine sses would fall and whether any price decline would be meaningful to consumers re duction in transportation fuel taxes would result in decrease in spending for transportation trustfundsupported federal programs unless congress designated alte rnate sources of funding for these programs as result of the structure of the federal programs th effects of fuel tax repeal on federal transportation programs would not necessarily be immediate but depending on the lengthscope of the repeal or spension they could be substantial increase in crude oil and refined product prices due to growing tightness in the supply of crude oil spot prices of crude oil tripled between midfebruary 1999 and midmarch 2000 from about 10 per barrel to about 30 per barrel perhaps more publicized the futures price of one grade of crude oil exceeded 34 in early march the average acquisition cost of crude oil to u s petroleum refiners which includes some transportation costs increased 145 over almost the same period from 1050 per barrel in february 1999 to an estimated 2578 in february 2000 because the cost of crude oil to refiners accounts for substantial portion of the price of refined petroleum pr

proposals to offset effect of higher crude oil prices the steep increases in the retail prices of refined petroleum pr oducts have prompted many members of congress to seek means of countering the consequences of higher crude oil prices andor actua lly reducing the retail prices among other policy options interest has focused on possible moratoria on nd repeals of all or part of the federal excise taxes on severa l transportation fuels2 virtually all transportation fuels are taxed under compli cated structure of excise tax rates and exemptions that vary by tran sportation mode and fuel

jurisdiction in the respective chambers on march 21 2000 the ground transportation subcommittee of the house committee on transportation and infrastructure held hearing on the general issue of tran sportation fuel taxes impacts on markets and prices as indicated the measures described are motivated by the steep increases in the retail prices of refine d petroleum products and intended to reverse thos increases at least to some extent under normal market conditi ons and assuming reasonable degree of competition the market response to cut in the excise taxes would be tendency to reduce user prices by an am ount less than the tax cut the taxed entities refiners importers and rminal operators7 would view the cut as decrease in the cost of doing business and pass forward at least some of the cut in the form of lower prices current market conditions however may limit or even prevent reduction in prices to endusers the crude oil price rise has resulted largely from tightness in supply stemming from output reductions by some mbers of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec at time when wo rld demand for oil was rising faster thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20521crs4 8 for some background see home heating oil price and supply in th winter of 19992000 by rob bamberger and larry kumins crs report rl30421 9 if passed through completely the 20perbarrel rise in crude oil prices would raise retail gasoline prices by 476 per gallon whereas us retail gasoline prices rose 63 per gallon there are 42 gallons in us barrel 10 price elasticity is measure of the responsiveness of quantities demanded by buyers or supplied by sellers to changes in price currently favorable economic conditions for households may have further reduced the previously low demand price elasticity for gasoline 11 some airlines contract for some or all of their fuel in advance so as to assure certain price those that did so in the current market probabl were able to obtain lower average price but would not benefit from tax suspension or repeal anticipated8 thus world and us inventories have shrunk during the past year and continue to be low in early spring 2000 with respect to gasoline in particular an increasingly tight supply situation has led to the absolute amount of the retail price increase over the last year exceeding the crude price rise on per gallon basis9 us inventories of gasoline currently are the lowest in decades according to the energy inform ation administration greatly limiting the ability of suppliers to increase their offering s with the supply price elasticity and demand price elasticity very low particularly in th short run it is probable that little if any of tax cut would be passed forward10 moreover because 43 is small in rela tion to current end user prices for transportation fuels even full passthrough of suspension or repeal would have little effect on end user prices th at amount represents less than 3 of the current retail prices of gasoline and of diesel fuel and 5 of recent spot market prices for jet fuel11 proposals to suspend the full amount of the di esel fuel tax only could be expected to have larger and more complicated mark et effects the amount of tax reduction is considerably larger in abso lute terms and in relation to current retail prices 244 per gallon equals 16 of current prices althoug h temporary singling out one fuel for tax relief could change the relative price struct ure among distillate re fined products mainly diesel fuel jet fuel and heating oil nd introduce incentives to change the proportions of products derived from each barre l of crude oil all of whic h would be affected by the seasonality of demand also it is possible that refiners would apply some of the diesel fuel tax cut to the prices of one or more other refined products thus it is uncertain not only that measures that give excise tax relief will result in reductions in prices to end users but that any reductions will apply to the produc t given tax relief those proposals that provide for moratori um rather than repeal add the dynamic that refiners by not regarding the tax cut as long term decrease in costs will be inclined to leave prices unchanged also although it is not likely that states would in the short term reduce or negate the objectives of federal legisl ation there also is chance that some states may try to compensate for decrease in funding from the highway trust fund by increasing their transportation fuel excise taxes few stat in fact have provisions that automatically increase their taxes to some extent when the federal tax falls below certain levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20521crs5 12 the htf consists of two separate accounts highway and transit which sometimes are mistakenly referred to as separate trust funds in practice the highway account and the transit account are often discussed as though they were separate entities with the htf being synonymous with the highway account approximately ninetenths of highway trust fund income is derived from the excise taxes on moto r fuels the remainder comes from sales taxes on tires trucks buses and trailers and truck usage taxes the highway account receives an allocation equivalent to 1544 of the tax and the transit account receives the revenue generated by 286 of the tax 13 for discussion of the history of federa l fuel taxes

programs for the sixyear period through fy2003 standard estimate is that tea21 provi des 40 more funding than the funding legislation that preceeded it the key to this funding increase was the creation of direct budgetary link between growth in revenue s accruing to the htf and programmatic spending12 the 43 increment of the tax is now substantial part of the trust fund revenue stream and is the vehicle that makes tea21s funding increases possible13 in absolute terms the addition of the 43 represen ted an increase of slightly more than 30 in the level of federal fuel taxation decrease in highway trust fund income as result of repeal or suspension of the 43 increment therefore would automatically lead to substantial decrease in program spending unless congress acted to provide u s treasury general funds as substitute according to the department of transporta tion dot the elimination of 43 of the tax through repeal or suspension would redu ce income to the htf by approximately 7 billion per year 1 billion reduction in income would also occur in the transit account14 changes in income to the htf could trigger mechanism designed to protect its solvency thereby requiring reductions in the amount of funds available for highway projects second mechanism created by tea 21 to adjust program spending in response to changes in fund income revenue ligned budget authority known as raba also would come into play and reduce highway project spending because of the manner in which federal tr ansportation programs operate the effects of these reductions would not become
