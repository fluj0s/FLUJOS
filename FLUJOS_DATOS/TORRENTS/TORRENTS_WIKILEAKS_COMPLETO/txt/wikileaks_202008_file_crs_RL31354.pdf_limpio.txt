and other bills include controlling the visa entry and educational programs of foreign students and tracking their movement through the higher education system activities relating to limiting access to scientific and technical info rmation include controlling access to rd laboratories selfpolicing classification and reclassification of already released materials withdrawal of information from federal agency websites possible additional exemptions to the freedom of information act foia and withholding information categorized as sensitive but unclassified legislative pr oposals dealing with access to biological agents that could be used by terrorists appear in hr 3448 s 1765 hr 3160 s 1635 hr 3457 and s 1764 these include proposals to register users of potentially toxic biological and chemical agents to inventory laboratories that conduc t research using pathogenic biological agents to limit access to rd laboratories and biological research agents and to give tax preferences to firms that develop tools to deal with bioterrorism among the unintended consequences of th actions as cited by experts are high financial costs especially to academic laboratories of instituting security and tracking measures the possible delete rious impacts on freedom of scientific information exchange and scientific i nquiry and the possible loss to the united states of foreign technical workers in areas of short supply among us citizens policymakers might seek to ensure that t hose affected by counter terrorism policies that affect rd scientists academics industrialists and the

relating to science technology and higher education three salient enactments are described next and will be expanded upon be low in this report pursuant to section 212 of the immigra tion and nationality act as amended5 state department consular officials who issue student visas abroad are required to deny visas for us study in sensitive fields andor areas of illegal export of technology under the rules developed by the state department to implement the law consular officials may deny visas for study in the united states in 16 categories specified on technology alert list to students from countries identified as state sponsors of terrorism the seven countries on the state departments list of state sponsors of terrorism are cuba libya iran iraq north korea sudan and syria in addition with regard to issuing visas to students who wish to study in these fields consular officials are to be alert to cases involving foreign nationals affiliated with countries subject to the nonproliferation export control regulation that is china india israel pakistan and russia6 the purpose is to avert the spread of weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery systems maintain us advantage in some militarily critical technologies and prevent the transfer of arms and dualuse items to terrorist states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31354crs3 two laws were enacted after the worl d trade center bombing attack in 1993 one was the antiterrorism and effectiv death penalty act of 1996 pl 104 132 which required the secretary of the partment of health and human services dhhs to identify hazardous biological agents and require registration of laboratories that transporte d hazardous biological agen ts the law did not require registration of laboratories that used any of the select agents or reporting of existing inventory in laboratories re searchers and laboratories that possessed stockpiled strains in freezers but did not plan to transport them did not have to register and report to the government biological warfare uses were prohibited second the illegal immigration refo rm and responsibility act of 1996 which was part of pl 104 208 authorized an electronic foreign student tracking system called the cooperative interage ncy program regula ting international students cipris student exchange visa program sevis was authorized the electronic monitoring system was intende d to make readily accessible to immigration officials the names residences and educa tional status of foreign students the program was not fully implemented be fore september 11 2001 largely due to objections from the higher education co mmunity about financial costs foreign students would incur as the system was implemented introduction to current issues since the september 11 2001 terrorist att acks congress the executive branch and the scientific and technical comm unities have adopted additional security measures or have considered legislative proposals to counteract terrorism these include passage of the patriotusa act pl 10756 signed by the president on october 26 2001 which among other things increased foreign student monitoring restricted access of potential terrorists to zardous biological agents and gave the government access to some info rmation about students and th eir internet usage the government has issued regu lations and imposed new guidelines about withdrawing scientific and technical information from federal ag ency websites and limiting access to sensitive but nonclassified inform ation reclassifyin g already released materials limiting access to information acce ssible via freedom of information act and expanding the list of technologies subject to export control proposals are being considered to limit access to r d laboratories expand the list of biological research agents that are controlled and to register laboratories that c onduct research using materials of potential value to terrorists in addition some scien tists have started to impose selfpolicing and to velop guidelines relating to release or withholding of certain kinds of scientific and technical information while there appears to be widespread agreement on the need for improving security and limiting access so researchers and academic ians assert that certain of these actions could have unintended consequences for the conduct of research and development training of students and could impinge upon implementation of existing laws the efforts to restrict access to scientific and technical information entry to the united states of students w ho might be potential terrorists and use of hazardous biological agents raise severa l issues these include the potential to reduce the number of foreign students in science and technology thereby possibly reducing income to us higher educa tion institutions and ultimately the capabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31354crs4 7diana jean schemo access to us courses is under scrutiny in aftermath of attacks

never ma triculated at the school to which the visa applied some fear that fo reign students may include terro rists or their sympathizers who gain entry to the united states for illegal purposes or who with the benefit of knowledge and skills gained in the united states could mount terrorist campaigns as an example in the 1970s and 80s saddam hussein sent scientists to universities in western

is governed by provisions of the immigration and nationality act14 which allows consular officials to deny visas to aliens who are viewed as high risks to violate laws relating to the export of sensitive information or technolog in 1996 congress enacted legislation to restrict visas and eligible fields of study for foreign students and faculty from terrorist countries and to track foreig n students with the passage of the patriotusa act after the september 11th attacks the congress acted to ensure funding for the tracking system and to increase federal access to information about students researchers and electronic co mmunications additional legislation is pending some of which would tighten secu rity more than existing programs in addition pursuant to presidential directiv the office of science and technology policy ostp in the white house and th office of homeland security have been charged with developing guidelines relatin g to entry of foreign students the task force is scheduled to issue draft guidelines in april 2002 most educators agree about the need fo r increased controls on foreign students and tracking of them and thei r courses of study in orde r to

212a3iiihowever some say it is possible that inte nsified monitoring of foreign students and their courses of study as well as the impos ition of fees to track students together with increased controls on sensitive research which is discussed below in this report could result in fewer students especially gradua students coming to study scientific and technical subjects in us colleges and universities and ultimately could reduce the supply of scientific and technical personnel available for employment in the united states this possibility may be considered by policymakers when developing implementing regulations for foreign students another crs report provides detailed analysis of the i ssue of foreign students in the united states and issues relating to visas student

house reportedly seeks to enlarge the list of technologies on this list19 principal factors to consider in debating the utility of this list and its possible revision are that 1 international terrorists could reside in any country not only those on the list of seven countries 2 technologies change quickly and the list needs to be monitored and upda ted to exclude study in newly developed sensitive areas and 3 the united states needs to assess the balance between rejecting students and allowing entry to th em given that students who do not receive us visas might ultimately choose to study sensitive subject in another country the association of international educators20 proposed that controls on subjects for study areas need to be focused and multilateral this means limiting controls to narrowly defined sensitive areas with high danger potential and negotiating controls with other countries that are majo r destinations of foreign students so we dont end up simply shifting

argues poste124 proposals for tiered or restricted access to information some experts propose that scientists should velop processes to categorize types of information in research project or report and selectively disseminate restricted information only to qualified persons or allow access to this information only on needtoknow basis for instance poste sa id that researchers should declare when applying for grant whether the research could result in threatening applications with the possibility of the sponsoring agen cy denying permission to publish or for example that anyone wishing to access genomic sequence data for dangerous pathogens might be required to provide evidence of their accreditation with legitimate laboratory125 reportedly the white house has asked the american society of microbiologyto limit potentia lly dangerous information in the 11 journals it publishes including infection and immunity the journal of bacteriology and the journal of virology one reported white house proposal is to eliminate the sections of articles that give experimental details researchers from other laboratories would need to replicate the claimed results helping to prove their validity126 others say restrictions should be pl aced on information about par ticular genes that cause given microbe to be unusually deadly and that some scientists have already abandoned certain research efforts fear ing the results could fall into the wrong hands127 for instance craig venter at the institute for genomic research said his firm halted project on making artificial microbes we were going to make synthetic microorganism to study biology and evolution but decided to stop since techniques could be used to make synthetic pathogen128 during the aforementioned national academies

contentious issue one major argument made against restricting access to scientific and technical information is that it could make it impossible for scientists to assess and replicate the work of

can produce wealth of cures disease antidotes and surprise discoveries185 robert r rich president of the federation of american societies for exper imental biology expressed his judgment i think the risk of forgone advances is much greater than the information getting into the wrong hands 186 he added there is very little that comes out of university labs that could conceivably be considered

available to the public via cached sites on internet search engines188 or in hard copy at depository libraries others argue that the prevention of terrorism requires openness in scientific information

the us customs commissioner announ ced the launch of operation shield america which seeks to increase the list of items on existing state department and commerce department export control lists that might be of potential interest to international terrorist organizations that would be subject to surveillance and could not be exported freely the activity also involves providing us companies with instructions about how to spot suspicious buyers customs has already taken key steps under this initiative the customs intelligence division has compiled list of key technologies and weapons lik ely to be of interest to terrorist groups and has shared this list with the intelligence comm unity and with the departments of state commerce defense energy treasury and justice customs is soliciting feedback from each in order to reach an accord on the items that should be the focus of shield america the list remains secret the program is being implemented by federal agents canvassing us manufactures of th items on the list to educate about the program and encourage them to turn ove r names and information on any suspicious customers194according to the customs service while some of these materials may seem relatively innocuous and have relativ ely little monetary value they can have enormous strategic valu in the hands of americas adversaries these minor technological goods could easily become the necessary component for major weapons development by terrorist groups or rogue nations continuing customs said in one particular case for example customs investigated the export of chemical called thiodiglycol this chem ical has civilian applications in the production of dyes and inks however thi odiglycol is also key precursor in the production of mustard gas the customs investigation dismantled networks that were buying hundreds of tons of this material from baltimore firm and providing the chemical to iran for use in mustard gas several customs investigations have disclosed illicit exports of highspeed timing devices known as krytrons while these devices have broad civilian applications in photocopiers and lasers krytrons are also ideal for use in triggering nuclear warheads in one noteworthy case customs intercepted 40 krytrons destined for an iraqi military establishment after being purchased from california firm

to 56 nations were involved in efforts to acquire us technology with military applications195 under the program customs says it doesnt want companies to investigate their clients but the customs service will send agents to visit firms that manufacture or sell items on the list and ask companies to report suspicious behavior such as first time customers who ask to pay for larger orders in cash or offer more than the market price196 implications the major implication of these actions is the need to strike balance between security and the competitiveness of comme rce in science and technology while controls on export of products that could be used to develop weapons against the united states are necessary the unintende d consequences of this action could jeopardize some us foreign trade becau the list reportedl includes just about everything that you can imagine that rela tes to the production of any kind of weapon of mass destruction whether thats chemical weapon biological weapon or nuclear weapon 197 one observer commented that it is possible that the regulation could stigmatize companies that directly or inadvertently sell to terrorist since the program provides for voluntary compliance to spot suspicious buyers198 some worry about confusion in the proliferati on of export controls and denied persons lists by various agencies and that legitimate deals may be stonewalled while exporters are shunted back and forth am ong agencies that have jurisdiction to withhold export licenses199 the government may need to monitor for effectiveness and impacts the
