rewards for information as to underpayments and fraud burden of proof prior to the enactment of taxpayer bill of rights 3 the burden of proof in tax cases was usually placed on the taxpayer this practice derived from common w and was not statutory in certain instances there were statutory provisions whic h placed the burden of proof on the government section 3001 of the bill added new irc 7491 to govern the burden of proof the general rule is that if taxpayer introduces credible evidence on factual issue in court proceeding dealing with income taxes estate and gift taxes self employment taxes or generationskipping taxes then the irs has the burden of proof on that issue credible evidence is according to the conference report hrept 105 599 at 240241 the quality of evidence which after critical analysi s the court would find sufficient upon which to base decision on the issue if contrary evidence were submitted without regard to the judicial presumption of irs correctness th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30101crs2 section 4002b of the tax and trad relief extension act of 1998 pl 105277 removed1 the net wort h limitation from certain revocable trusts for the period of time that the trus t would have bee n treated as part of the an estate if the trust had made the election under irc 645 to be treated as part of the estate introduction of evidence will not meet this standard if the court is not convinced that it is worthy of belief the taxpayer still has to comply with any substantiation requirements maintain l records required by the code and regulations and cooperate with reasonable ir s requests for witnesses information documents meetings and int erviews the burden of proof is not shifted to the government if the taxpayer fai ls to meet those conditions if the taxpayer is not an individual or an estate there are maximum net wort h requirements corporations most trusts and partnerships with net worth of more than 7 million are ineligible to use this provision 1 this new provision does n ot override any existing code section which provides for specifi c burden of proof in addition the new provision always imposes th burden on the irs in two specific situations first if an item of income wa s reconstructed by the irs solely through the use of statistical information on unrelated taxpayers the irs will have the burden of proof second the irs has the burden of production in court proceedings where an individual is liable for penalty addition to tax or additional amount under the code the provision applies to court proceedings arising in connection wit h examinations commencing after the date of enactment july 22 1998 if there is irs examination the provision applies to court proceedings aris ing in connection with taxable periods or events beginning or occurring after the date of enactment proceedings by taxpayers this subtitle contains si x provisions which make it easier for taxpayers to either have their cases heard by an app ropriate court or go to court to obtain restitution for wrongful acts by the irs attorneys fees and costs prior to the enactment of taxpayer bill of rights 3 any per who substantially prevailed in tax case involving determination coll ection or refund of taxes interest or penalties could be awarded reasonable administrative costs incurred after th earlier of the date the taxpayer received the notice of the decision of the irs office of appeals or the date of the notice of deficiency and reasonable litigation costs only individ uals with net worth of 2 million or less and corporations with ne t worth of 7 million or less could be awarded costs the biggest component f reasonable costs is attorneys fees but reimbursement for attorneys fees was limited to 110 per hour as adjusted for inflation in certain cases court could awar d more than 110 per hour if the court found that s pecial factor justified higher rate in case could reasonable costs exceed the amount actually paid or owed underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30101crs3 prior law taxpayers could only be awarded attorneys fees for services of attorneys although cpas and enrolled agents are authorized to practice before the tax court and the irs only actual costs could be reimbursed which meant that taxpayer s could not be awarded costs for representation by pro bono attorneys section 3101 made seven changes to irc 7430 the provision dealing wit h awards of costs first the hourly rate cap on attorneys fees was increased to 125 per hour from 110 and will be adjusted for inflation this is in line with the rate used in the equal access to justice act which aut horizes the award of attorneys fees in nontax federal cases judges are permitted to adjust the award of attorneys fees upward based on the difficulty of the issues presented in the case or on the loca l unavailability of tax expertise second dministrative costs can be awarded for fees incurred after the earliest of three occasions the two under existing law ie the date of appeals office notice or the date of notice of deficiency or the date on which the first letter of proposed deficiency which allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the internal revenue service office of appeals is sent this change should allo w taxpayers to be reimbursed for almost all administrative costs third fees for the services of cpas and enrolled agents authorized to practice before the tax court or before the internal revenue service may be awarded t prevailing taxpayers as if those indiv iduals were attorneys fourth the statute allows court to award appropriate attorneys fees to those who undertake pro bon representation of taxpayers pr oviding the fee is paid to the attorney or the attorneys employer fifth in determining whether the position of the irs was substantially justified the court is required to take into account w hether the irs has lost in courts of appeal for other circuits on sub stantially similar issues the committee on ways and means report hrept 105364 at 59 indicated that the court may also take into account whether the united states has w on in courts of appeal for other circuits the senate report srept 105174 at 47 and the conference re port hrept 105599 at 243 are silent on this issue this provision presents courts with the decision of whether to punish the ir s for inappropriately pursuing lost cause or whether to tolerate an irs attempt to obtain conflict between circu its in order to have the supreme court decide an issue sixth taxpayer will be treated as having substantially prevailed if irs wins but the judgment is for less than qualified offer made by the taxpayer during th qualified offer period this provision does not apply to judgments issued pursuant to settlement or to proceedings when the amount of the tax liab ility is not in issue eg declaratory judgments proceedings involving summons actions to restrain disclosure under irc 6110f the irs will only be responsible for costs incurred on an d after the date of the qualified offer seventh taxpayer may be awarded attorneys fees in addition to damages if the taxpayer prevails in case involving unauthorized inspection or disclosure of tax return or tax return information under irc 7431 the net worth requirements were not amended these changes apply to costs incurred or pro bono services performed after january 18 1999httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30101crs4 irc 7463 7436c1 7443ab32damages for illegal collection actions under prior irc 7433 if an irs officer or employee recklessly r intentional ly disregarded the law while collecting the taxpayers taxes the taxpayer could sue the government for the lesser of actual damages plus the costs of the suit or 1 million damages could be reduced if the taxpayer did not exhaust availabl administrative remedies or if the taxpayer did not take reasonable steps to mitigat damages suit had to be brought in us district cour t within two years of the cause of action accruing under prior irc 7426 third parties whose property wa s wrongfully sold or levied on by the irs could sue the irs for up to 1 million f damages if an irs officer or employee reckles sly or intentionally disregarded the law while collecting taxpayers taxes the taxpayer bill of rights 3 expanded th authority to pay damages to include cases where the irs causes taxpayer or third party economic damages because of negligent disregard of the internal revenue code or regulations while collecting taxpayers taxes damages for negligence ar limited to 100000 and both taxpayers and thirdparties continue to have to exh aust available administrative remedies before court can award any damages in addition to damages for violations of the law in regular tax collection actions irc 7433 was amended to permit taxpayer in bankruptcy to petition th bankruptcy court to recover damages gainst the irs if an officer or employee of the irs willfully violates the automatic stay provisions or the effect of discharg provisions of the bankruptcy code or bankruptcy regulations damages for violations of title 11 the bankruptcy code can be awarded by bankruptcy court these provisions apply to actions of officers and employees of the interna l revenue service after july 22 1998 increase in size of cases permitted on small case tax calendar under prior law the tax court permitted taxpayers with amounts of tax i n dispute of less than 10000 to elect to use the small case procedures such n election meant that the decision of the tax court was fin and could not be appealed either the irs or the taxpayer could request that the small case procedures b discontinued any time before final decision in the case taxpayer bill of rights 3 raised the jurisdictional amount from 10000 to 500002 actions for refund by certain estates which have elected th installment method of payment the district courts of the united states and the us court of federal claim s have jurisdic tion over suits for refunds of taxes normally the full amount of th taxes must be paid before filing refund action under irc 6166 executors f certain estates containing closelyheld businesses can elect to pay the estate taxe shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30101crs5 3105 of the act3attributable to the business over 14year period under prior law courts have held that refund jurisdi ction did not exist until the entire amount of estate taxes was paid the tax court had jurisdiction to determine eligibility to make the irc 616 6 election section 3104 amended irc 7422 to provide special rule permitting district courts and the court of federal claims to have jurisdiction over an estate tax refund case even if the full amount of the estate tax liability has not been paid because of an installment payment election under irc 6166 in order to qualify for this special provision the estate must meet several requirements 1 installments can hav been accelerated 2 all installments due before the date the suit is filed must have been paid on time 3 there can b case pending in the tax court with respect to the estate taxes due on the estate 4 if notice of deficiency has been issued wit h respect to the estate the time for filing suit in the tax court must have expired 5 action for declaratory judgment under irc 7479 can be pending in the ta x court the general explanation of tax legislation enacted in 1998 prepared by the staff of the joint committee on taxation jcs698 at 64 indicates that taxpayer that had previously litigated its estate tax liability would not be able to use thi s provision under the principles of res judicata and that taxpayers are obligated t continue paying installments in full and on time during the pendency of the suit once final judgment is entered by the cou rt the irs is not permitted to collect any amount disallowed by the court and if the taxpayer has p aid any amount in excess of what the court dete rmines is currently due the irs is to refund that amount with interest the section lso amends irc 7479 to provide that if taxpayer files declaratory judgment action in the tax court to dete rmine an estates eligibility to use irc 6166 the twoyear statute of limitations for filing refund suit is suspended during the pendency of the tax court action these provisions apply to refund actions filed after the date of enactment july 22 1998 admi nistrative appeal of adverse irs determination of bon d issues taxexempt status this provision is not codified in the internal revenue code it directs the irs to amend its admini strative procedures to allow issuers of taxexempt bonds to have right to an administrative appeal to senior officer of the irs office of appeal s whenever an irs examiner proposes to revok the taxexempt status of bond issue under prior law there was and is procedure for obtaining declaratory judgment from the tax court but there was automatic right to an administrative appeal this provision was effective on the date of enactment3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30101crs6 irc 60154third party suits to release erroneous lien prior to 1995 some courts had held that if third parties paid tax to discharge lien on their property they could not sue for refund because they were not th taxpayer against whom the tax was assessed in 1995 in williams v united states 514 us 527 1995 the supreme court held that third party who paid anothers tax under protest to remo ve lien on her property could bring refund suit because there was other adequate administrative or judicial remedy taxpayer bill of rights 3 created mechanism for third parties to have n erroneous tax lien released by amending irc 6325b to create right f substitutio n of value which allows the third party to deposit an amount of mone equal to the value of the interest of the united states in the third partys property or to furnish bond acceptable to the irs in similar amount the irs is required to refund the deposit plus interest or release the bond if the unsatisfied liability can be satisfied from source other than the third partys property or if the value of th interest of the united states in the property is less than the irs had previousl determined under irc 7426a as amended the third party has 120 days afte r obtaining the certificate of discharge for making the payment or furnishing the bond to bring c ivil suit in us district court to determine whether the interest of th united states in the property is less than the value determined by the irs if th court determines that the irs determination of value of the governments interest in the property exceeds the actual value of the governments in terest the court will order refund of the amount deposited plus interest f rom the date of payment or release of the bond to the extent that deposit or bond exceeds the value determined by th court the time that the irs spent pursuing the wrong property does not redound to the benefit of the taxpayer taxpayer bill of rights 3 suspended the running of the statute of limitations for collection under 6502 for period equal to the period from the date when the property of third party is wrongfully seiz ed or received by the irs to the date on which judgment under irc 7426 relat ing to the property becomes final plus 30 more days the pension only applies to the amount of money or the value of property returned similar suspension applies to the period during which the irs holds wrongful lien on third partys property innocent spouse and disability relief the new statutory provisions provide three avenues of relief from spousa l liability for taxes due on joint returns 1 for married taxpayers filing jointly mor liberal standards for innocent spouse status than were available under prior law 2 for those who have since separated or divorced the opportuni ty to elect separate liability and 3 for taxpayers who fail to qualify f or innocent spouse or separate liability relief discretionary authority for equitable relief4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30101crs7 the conference committee report discussed the anticipated uses of this equitable authority5 the conference agreement does not include the portion of the senat amendment that could provide relief in situations where tax was shown on the joint return but not paid with the return the conferees intend that the secretary will consider using the grant of authority to provide equitable relief in appropriat situations to avoid the inequitable treatment of spouses in such situations fo r example the conferees intend that equitable relief be available to spouse tha t does not know and had reason t know that funds intended for the payment of tax were instead taken by the other spouse for such other spouses benefit the conferees do not intend to limit the use of the secretarys authority t provide equitable relief to situations where the tax is shown on return but t paid the conferees intend t hat such authority be used where taking into account all the facts and circum stances it is inequitable to hold an individual liable for all continuedthose who filed joint returns can seek innocent spouse status under mor liberalize d rules than were imposed by prior law under the new law such relief i s available for any understatement of tax liability under the old law relief was available only for substantial understatements and those were defined by dollar amount s 500 or percentage of income the prior law requir ement that the understatement be attributable t grossly erroneous items attributable to the other spouse has also been eliminated it is enough now that there is an understatement attributable to the other spouse those claiming the status must still establish that they did not kno w and had rea to know of the understatement of tax and taking into account all the facts and circumstances it must still be found unfair to hold claimant liable for the taxes due spouse pursuing innocent spouse status may be entitled to refund the new law permits those who are divorced legally separated or have live d separate and apart for year to request separation of liability if the taxpayer filed joint return and is now divorced legally s eparated or has lived separate and apart for at least year prior to filing the request shehe will qualify for such treatment and tax liability will be determined in much the same manner as if separate returns d been filed special rules were included to prevent the improper use of the election thus even if otherwise qualifying request for separate liability may be refused i f irs proves that the spouses or former spouses transferred assets as part of fraudulent scheme or to avoid taxes or the payment of taxes or if irs proves actual knowledge that items giving rise to the deficiency and attributable to spouse r former spouse were incorrect only the hard to attain innocent spouse exemptio n was available to former and separated spouses under prior law request fo r separation of liability will not generate refund equitable relie f may be available for those who cannot qualify for separation of liability or innocent spouse status including spouses from community property states who file separately the new law permits the secretary to make such relief available when under all the facts and circumstances it would be unfair to hold the taxpaye r liable for the understatement or underpayment of tax this is the one remed available for an underpayment of taxes under prior law if spouse took fund s intended for taxes for h is or her own use there was escape from joint and several liability 5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30101crs8 continued5 or part of any unp aid tax or deficiency arising from joint

interna l revenue code two changes were made in the calculation of interest fo r7 underpayment and overpayment of taxes briefly under the new law net interest rate of 0 applies to equivalent overpa yments and underpayments the interest paid to noncorporate taxpayers on overpayments was increased these changes eliminated some interest different ials of prior law which had resulted in taxpayers paying higher interest on underpayments than the government paid on overpayments prior w permitted the secretary to extend tax deadlines for taxpayers in presidentially declared disaster areas interes t abatement provisions were amended to include an abatement of interest for those taxpayers for the course of the extension8 penalties for failure to pay taxes were cut in half for those who entered into and made payments under an installment agreement under pri or law payroll tax deposits9 were credited to the earliest period for which such deposit was due penalties were assessed for failure to make required deposits at rates which increased over time up to maximum of 15 percent cascading penalties could result where the taxpayer made payment sufficient to cover present obligation and that payment wa s credited instead to prior obligation penalties would start to run on the late r obligation while the payment was credited to the earlier obligation where penalties had maxed out mitigating amendments were made in the penalty provision to permit the taxpayer to designate the period to which the deposit would apply and beginning in 2002 credit the pay ments to the most recent period unless the taxpayer otherwise designates 10 number of amendments to the interest and penalty provisions were designed to increase taxpayer awareness and encourage irs communication with
