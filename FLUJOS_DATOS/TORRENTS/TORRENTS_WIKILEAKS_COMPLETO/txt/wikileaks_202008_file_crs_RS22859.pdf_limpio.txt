specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division joe richardson specialist in domestic social policy domestic social policy division summary us food prices rose 4 in 2007 and are expected to gain 35 to 45 in 2008 higher farm commodity prices and energy costs are the leading factors behind higher food prices farm commodity prices have surged because 1 demand for corn for ethanol is competing with food and feed for acreage 2 global food grain and oilseed supplies are low due to poor harvests 3 ri sing incomes in large rapidly emerging economies have changed eating habits and 4 the weak dollar has increased us exports in addition higher energy costs increase transportation processing and retail costs although the cost of commodities such as corn or wheat are small part of the final retail price of most food produc ts they have risen enough to have an impact on retail prices generally price changes at the farm level have diminished impact on retail prices especially for highly processed products the impact of higher food prices on us households varies according to income lowerincome households spend greater porti on of their income on food and feel price hikes more acutely than highincome familie s higher food costs impact domestic food assistance efforts in numerous ways depe nding on whether benefits are indexed enrollments are limited or additional funds ar made available higher food and transportation costs also reduce the impact of us contributions of food aid under current budget constraints introduction us food prices are

trend is expected to continue the all food cpi is forecast to increase 35 to 451 this rapid inflation follows an extended peri od of stable food prices from 1987 through 2007 food prices increased an average of 27 per year excluding the drought years of 1989 and 19902 during 2005 and 2006 food prices rose 24 this report examines the cause of food price increases and eval uates their impacts on us consumers key factors behind higher commodity prices robust domestic demand corn soybean and wheat prices all reached 10year highs during the 2006 2007 crop year high prices for corn reflected increased use for ethanol 22 of the 2007 crop and strong expor ts high corn prices in turn encouraged growers to move acres from wheat and soybean s into corn contributing to tight supplies and higher prices for those crops us fa rm prices in 2007 for corn are estimated at 375 to 400 per bushel compared with 200 in 2005 soybean prices are estimated at 1000 to 1080 per bushel up from 566 in 2005 nd wheat prices are estimated at 650 to 680 per bushel up from 342 in 20053 global stocks are at low levels globally stocks of corn wheat and soybeans are at historically low levels dr ought in australia and eastern europe and poor weather in canada western europe and the ukraine have reduced available quantities with world stocks for wheat at 30year low4 buyers are turning to the us for supplies global consumption pa tterns are changing higher incomes are boosting demand for processed foods and m eat in countries such as indi and china these shifts require more feed grains and edible oil even in lowincome c ountries of subsaharan africa asia and latin america the vegetable oil share of diets has risen as processed food consumption rises in china consump tion of meats other livestock products and fruits has increased while consumption of gr ainbased foods such as bread has slipped5 improving food distribution systems are alteri ng chinese food preferences by introducing nonlocal

more competitive boosting demand and prices according to the us department of agricultures usdas economic research service ers the dollar adjusted for relative inflation rates is expected to depreciate 7 against the euro 6 against the chines yuan and 8 against the brazilian real in 20087 the exchange rate is an important determinant of agricultural trade the depreciation of the us dollar since 2002 s helped improve us agricultural export performance how do higher commodity prices impact consumers as commodity prices rise food prices follo w but to lesser extent on average about 20 cents of each dollar spent on food is the farm share the retail cost less the valueadded after the product leaves the farm and moves along the marketing chain to the retail outlet8 in less processed foods the farm co mponent of the final product is larger and changes in the farm price have greater impact at the retail level for instance eggs and fresh fruits and vegetables undergo minimal processing after they leave the farm they are consumed in essentially their orig inal form the retail value of such products tends to have large farm component and ch anges at the farm level have greater impact on the consumer on the other hand in hi ghly processed products such as breakfast cereal the corn wheat or rice used is completely transfor med and the final product bears little resemblance to the original commodity an 18ounce box of corn flakes contained about 33 cents worth of corn in 20069 higher corn prices in 2007 increased the corn share to 49 cents this is small part of th retail value of box of corn flakes most of the retail price represents packaging pro cessing advertising tr ansportation profit and other costs energy costs energy costs affect all levels of the f ood production sector recent record crude oil prices in excess of 110 per barrel affect costs throughout the marketing chain10 producers spend more for fertilizer for which natural gas is major input crop drying and transportation raising pr oduction costs at the proce ssing wholesale and retail levels the cost of transpor tation and operating packing hous manufacturing plants and retail stores has increased some of these costs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices in addition high petr oleum prices increase the competitiveness of ethanol further boosting demand for corn httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22859crs4 11 food cpis for 2007 and 2008 are from the usdaers food cpi prices and expenditures briefing room at httpwwwersusdagovbriefingcpifoodandexpenditures 12 us

for all meats advanced 33 during 200711 beef increased 44 pork 2 broile rs 52 and eggs 292 and dairy products advanced 74 in 2007 the farm share of th products is large compared with other foods so changes at the farm level are passe d to greater extent to the consumer in many cases higher feed and energy costs were behind these increases strong export demand spurred by the weak dollar and re duced flocks played role in the price hikes for poultry and eggs the cpi for meat s is forecast to increase by 15 to 25 in 2008 compared with other food categories these highvalue items also account for large share 111 of the average consumers food budget fruits and vegetables prices for fruits and vegetables gained 38 in 2007 and are forecast to increase 3 to 4 in 2008 pr oduction shortfalls aff ected some varieties especially bananas the largest by volume supplies of oranges were strong offsetting other declines energy costs were large factor in higher fruit and vegetable price increases fruits and vegetables account for 84 cents of the consumer food dollar cereals and bakery products the cpi for these items advanced 44 in 2007 and is projected to rise 65 to 75 next year tight global wheat supplies and acreage reductions to promote ethanol production have caused spike in wheat prices however shifts in wheat prices have relatively small impact on grocery store prices because the farm share of these products is small pr ices for these product are affected more by marketing factors such as tran sportation labor and energy costs than the cost of basic inputs oilseeds and related products low stocks and strong export demand for soybeans are reflected in th cpi for these products which gained 29 in 2007 while much of this category is supplied by soybeans substitutes exist and will help moderate increases in 2008 the cpi is set to rise 7 to 8 due to continue d strong export demand from countries where changing diet s require more vegetable oil impact on lowincome households although us consumers generally spend smaller share of their income on food compared with many other countries that share varies widely across income levels overall us households spe nd 126 of their income on food12 so changes in the price of food have to be large to affect their total budget ho wever the picture is vastly different for lowincome households in 2006 households with incomes in the lowest reported income category spent 171 of their income on food households with incomes greater than 70000 spent 113 of their income on food when food prices rise families with lower incomes f eel the pinch more acutely since food expenditures make up larger share of their total expenditures also higherincome families can shift foodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22859crs5 consumption to the home from

difficult to produce specific estimates of the effect of food price inflation on wic program costs however the ers forecasts of increases in egg and dairy pr oduct prices in the 2 to 4 range in 2008 indicate that relatively high wi c food costs are likely in the near term foreign food aid higher commodity and food prices reduce our ability to provide food aid to other countries without additional ppropriations food aid usually takes the form of basic food grains such as wheat sorghum and corn and vegetable oil commodities critical to developingcountry diets si nce there is very little value added for these commodities shifts in prices translate directly into high er prices for foodinsecu re countries or reduced food aid contributions per dollar spent also higher energy costs have increased shipping costs for both food purchases and food aid unlike some domestic nutrition programs foreign food aid is not adjusted to account fo r changing costs after long period of declining
