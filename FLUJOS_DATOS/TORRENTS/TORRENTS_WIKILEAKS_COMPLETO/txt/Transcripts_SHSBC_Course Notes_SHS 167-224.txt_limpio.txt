type 3 idate23162 volnum1 issue103 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec103 basics of auditing 6201c23 shspec103 basics of auditing person who is fairly new to scientology and in doubt about it is frequently someone who is just stuck in ridge where he has certainty that anything works or happens there is sense in trying to shove training down his throat he needs auditing first his whole life is in maybe and he will have to be run on positive and negative to handle the ridge another easily overcome barrier to training is pretended knowingness it is downscale mockery of knowing it gives the pc funny sensation being thoroughgoing fake but it doesnt buck your effort to train as much as the maybe case person stuck in maybe can make trouble as pc too he often sets extravagant unreal session goals and is in an obsessive games condition with the auditor where he is attempting 168 to give the auditor loses the pc will go out of session very easily he is not under the auditors control run him lightly fundamental processes give only light effects this is noeffect case and you must audit him with feather 8c is not low enough for them they go around touching walls with never comm lag the process doesnt bite because they are not really there sit them down with some small dull object like piece of chalk and have them get the idea that the chalk is there not there this will pick up lot of confusion and randomity work with the person take the chalk away let them see what that would look like run the process until the pc takes over the automaticity of notising physical objects and the room starts going solid on them keep on with the process it is very light you are dealing with the old effect scale as the pc goes down towards total effect the effect he can experience is breath of air noeffect case cant confront or even notice large effect only very small one if you blew them up they would never find out about it thats too much effect we see that clearly in the overtmotivator phenomenon the more motivators the person has earned the less motivators the person can have so what to you seems minor to the person is major disaster he thinks everyone is against him etc but he couldnt perceive large explosive action if it occurred his automatic notis takes care of large effects you could probably give him session full of gaes noauditing and he wouldnt notice the badness of it but if you missed one tick on an arc break he would notice the small error critics of auditing are always looking for small errors on this basis in country like spain or mexico there can be enormous misgovernment atrocious wars banditry etc and at the same time punctilious courtesy and honesty in small things they dont see the gross outnesses democracy is only as good as people can see what is going on it is the enoughmotivator of an old empire that results in the notis lowscale cases could be given very bad auditing without their noticing this is not advised but it could be done middle range pcs will be aware of both large and small errors and are affected by them when they come upscale they see the whole error and are less affected by it than the lowscale pc so as you audit people up the line your auditing has to improve forms rituals procedures none of these will see you through session all that will see you through is auditing the second you start leaning on your tools like model session you are in trouble what is phenomenal is that you can make gain with pcs using only ritual auditing is science not an art lrhs sessions contain lots of auditing covering the bare bones of model session student sessions have the bones showing through the pc even if he is trained auditor or especially if he is is very aware of your taking up beginning rudiments but what is the pc doing listening to the auditing bones he is supposed to be interested in his case and there he is listening to the bones rattle good auditing is when you didnt notice the auditor using model session when he was using it it is smooooth theres need to make production out of everything you do get so that you can shift gears smoothly from say running simple havingness process to finding what inval or eval has caused it to stop working the more the pc is in session the faster the pc will 169 blow an aberration the less afraid of things they are the less they duck and dodge and the braver they feel if the pc comes in talking about ptp he is stuck in handle it dont worry about formal start of session when it is handled get model session going so you either have to use tr4 when the pc comes up with any of the myriad things pcs can come up with or if it is something that really is in need of more handling you must know how to handle it you have the horsepower to head the pc in the right direction down through the slot the pc needs to get where he is going so use it and get him to the slot now there are four flows to the flow process 1 outflow 2 restrained outflow 3 inflow 4 restrained inflow all of these are selfdetermined they are easy for the pc to selfdetermine we have hitherto looked on inflow as motivators and restrained inflow as sort of motivator side of it but mixed up in the motivators is the pcs selfdetermined action to make the inflow occur and the pcs selfdetermined action to make the inflow not occur respectively flows three and four are not as important as withhold and outflow you handle flows one and two all the time pc can selfdetermine bad inflow in order to get motivator when you make an auditing error that causes the pc to arc break the action seems to be so much yours that you seldom notice the selfdetermined part the pc has in it maybe he did it so he could outflow makeyouguilty there are more than four flows of course theres the pc determining the flows for someone else for third dynamics etc how could you use flow processes in session to keep ruds in suppose the pc keeps coming up with session withholds how about tripping one of the other flows eg run what have you outflowed in this session to balance all his withholds then get when he started not wanting to outflow get the objection to the outflow off and the tendency to withhold vanishes or ask have you been inflowing the pc says yes auditing commands you dont have to q and with it just accept it and the pc has blown it you dont have to take up all the pcs withholds by the way let blown overts and withholds expire when they are blown dont try to remedy nonexistent situation on any flow line what you want to know is when it started roughly and how long it has been going on and whether the phenomenon whatever it is happened again etc just give it lick and promise when used as ruds pc who is going sporadically outruds has flow out that you havent spotted you could use onceover on beginning ruds too on flows this all gets what the pc is doing that he isnt communicating its all basically withholds that mess him up so the flows direct his attention to the things he hasnt told you as long as the auditor has the desire to assist the pc and to keep him communicating the auditor can straighten the pc up and keep the session going under almost any conditions an auditor can interfere with pcs comm to him in various ways there are obsessive withholds on other people for instance eg cop restraining people from committing crimes or tax collector getting people to outflow if an auditor is dramatizing some such valence he will prevent the pcs comm or make him talk after hes said all 170 auditors always talk too much an auditor who talks too much is for the pc confused area which the pc cant reach so the pc cannot talk into the area since the pcs havingness is often down anyway the auditors talking can reduce it to the point where the pc dopes off processes that clean up the auditor for the pc make the auditor more haveable who would i have to be to audit you or what dont i know about you would help generally its bad idea for the auditor to use his body for anything in the session one exception is that if the pc believes the auditor is too enturbulative you can run put your hand on my shoulder repetitively few commands of this will help by giving the pc the illusion of being able to reach the auditor the auditor who tries to put the pc on an obsessive withhold is of course poor auditor the other extreme is the auditor into whose zone one must never reach the auditor who runs away by say changing processes before they are flat the pc will be aware of this more than the auditor as noauditing the difficulties you have as an auditor are of your own making and stem from using ritual to avoid auditing there is substitute for sitting down with the pc using what you know of the mind auditing his case finding what it is squaring it up etc all for the pc with auditing intended if you have other considerations entering into it criticising the pc or whatever you wont get much auditing done l ron hubbard type 3 idate24162 volnum1 issue104 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec104 training duplication 6201c24 shspec104 training duplication there are two ways of getting someone out of apathy one on the route of making auditors the other on the route of auditing they are quite different to make an auditor the policy has to be that the auditor doesnt have case because if auditors had to get cases handled before they could audit one would ever audit anyone because there would be auditors so it is workable truth that auditors do not have cases you are not in such good shape yourselves these days compared to 500000000000000 years ago to make big stride towards actually making being is very fine this means that the thing can be bootstrapped even by auditors who have not had much case gain yet if it werent true we as people would never make it because the few able ones wouldnt be able to audit enough people to signify they have to train others furthermore if the few trained auditors only audited they could improve society but they would also be producing rich and poor society of aristocrats and slaves not all these more able people after auditing would suffer from lrhs peculiarity of wanting people to be free after few generations or decades we would have society of clears and slaves which is the route to chaos and destruction this is interesting as long look lrhs view of century hence includes several possibilities theres bound to be some effect with an effort of this size and effectiveness the more rapidly the job is done the better this is the same as with pc if you audit him slowly and poorly his progress is fitful part of our effectiveness is to make enough auditors if all of the students at saint hill trained auditors there would be enough auditors the job of clearing the planet is not oneman job 171 so therefore you are learning to audit and improving in training auditors dont go in the direction of being kind expend your time on people who can be trained to audit without huge handicaps even though your natural impulse may be to spend your time on the numbskull who is all thumbs trying to get him up to level of mediocrity let him drift dont let him go but put your attention on the apt students it is adventurous to estimate the amount of time it will take to train someone there is however simple test you can do take datum of scientology say it to someone and have him repeat it do this few times then have him give you an example of it this educational process can knock out noeffect case in training let them duplicate the words eventually they will duplicate the understanding it is therapeutic as well to get someone to duplicate datum any datum the first gradient is comprehension of the words it is shocking to find morale suffering in some hgcs because of being made to duplicate bulletin exactly suppose we were just trying to increase persons ability to learn his learning rate it wouldnt matter if we were using automotive assembly books or the wpas history of socialism in northern arizona any data at all would serve you could read it off have the pc repeat it as sounds he is in tremendous data confusion which blows off as he attempts to duplicate data he will learn he can duplicate it even if it has buttons in it he will learn that duplication is just duplication just obnosis observation of what is there people will often before duplicating go off on stimulusresponse mechanism of evaluating or interest or belittling etc etc eventually the thetan wakes up and just does what you have asked he says what you said people who are aberrated get upset about this and think you are making slaves or something you are not you are just asking someone to duplicate datum if someone can do that he can also cause himself to be duplicated incidentally you can paralyze committee if you want by introducing restimulative words or buttons into the discussion study is an excellent one for this purpose beyond duplication comes understanding the duplication has to come first although people will often try to understand before they duplicate that is why study is such an important button that is getting somebody else to understand which relieves one of the responsibility for understanding this is the operating mechanism of governments that results in noaction or action from understanding democracy doesnt work in the absence of understanding when you get someone to duplicate datum he is now capable of understanding it and evaluating its importance so the third step after duplication and understanding is ability to comprehend observe and eventually judge one has ever taught judgment before there isnt much in any bank or it wouldnt be bank so the three steps are 1 duplication 2 understanding 3 judgment this is new skill one beings never had before they were capable of observation before but they always put curve on it in order to have game or something pure observation pure study pure comprehension or judgment have never been studied or known about they have merely been touched on in philosophy and avoided in religion entirely we know the source of this the 172 greatest overt there is is enforcement of noncomprehension all the way down the responsibility scale dont know is still button when overts and withholds are over the pcs head study of notknowingness has been approached by two philosophers kant and spencer their conclusion was that what wasnt known couldnt be known so there was road to judgment for years lrh has been trying to teach auditors judgment about what was going on in the mind of another being and what to do about it it has been tough what bars you from it is notknowingness of it all it begins with duplication it cant be reached with processing because it is not already there the whole lesson of this universe is not to duplicate and not to communicate the two crimes in this universe are being there and communicating person has to become comfortable with the idea of being there and communicating and this can be approached by duplication of datum datum is location that doesnt have to be pinned down it is sort of cousin to thetan having mass thetans begin to use ideas for locations when they get driven out of places they start to use ideas as identities you can learn to have judgment by two steps duplication of data and then understanding you cannot go beyond that in teaching judgment you are learning judgment as you learn scientology this is fortunate since the very truth of the data if it were just swallowed and not understood would tend to destroy judgment since it would not have to be tested that is tests would always bear it out so there would be point in going through with the testing process you cannot go beyond getting person to duplicate data and understand in teaching judgment you cannot teach person how he should judge something and still have him judge it many students have run straight through being taught judgment without noticing that they have been taught it you have come up on the other side into realization of it not because you have been taught it but because you realize it this is what we know as making it your data when you are dealing with truth you always have this fourth step the ability to realize and to perceive your own selfdetermined comprehension that route has pandeterminism in it the person can understand why they learned the datum why they were taught the datum and the independent truth of the datum independent of having been taught it it may not be perfect route but it is the first route through to such an end product it has sidebenefit you will understand things you never understood before that have nothing to do with what you have studied an auditor must have this ability to understand what is going on without going into tryingtounderstand when the pc says something aberrated the auditor can and should just duplicate and acknowledge the pcs originations and not q and and go off into getting the reasons behind all the pcs originations so if you find an area where auditors cant duplicate bulletin you can tell how they have been handling pcs lots of q and efforts to understand before duplicating etc people who are going through having to duplicate first get into resentment they look gaunt apathetic then they get up to anger then sort of wandering routine and rote are poor substitute for understanding the place im trying to get you to is place where you can process by realization process by comprehension process by the exercise of judgment if i can get you to that point i will have considered it very well worth doing matter how heroic it has been on the way 173 l ron hubbard type 3 idate30162 volnum1 issue106 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec106 insessionness 6201c30 shspec106 insessionness assessing isnt to find something to run its running the case rudiments must be kept in throughout the session not just used to get the pc in session end rudiments are there to keep the session from perpetuating itself or hanging up beginning rudiments are to get the pc out of the physical universe into session and his own universe not still coping with his life outside of session if he has to put lot of attention on the auditor he is still in cope in having to handle another human being social situation not session an auditor who does poor job of getting rudiments in puts the pc into the physical universe coping with the auditor pc in session should be able to be in state of noresponsibility for the physical universe around him during the session that is the reason you can plumb the bank the less responsible you make the pc for the physical environment and the auditor and the auditing the more noresponsible the pc is for those things that sounds peculiar because it is also the state of an hypnotic trance but pc in session is not in an hypnotic trance the difference is interesting in an hypnotic trance it is demonstrated conclusively that he has control over anything the only person with any control is the hypnotist hypnotism is total overwhelm devoted directly to the physical universe the pcs body that has little in common with pcs attitude in session it was one of the few states man could induce on man along with cured dead injured etc it was the only one by which he could approach the spiritual and the infinite people can misinterpret this when it comes to getting pcs in session their past track in dealing with these other states can color their approach to pcs there are also the social states which have nothing much to do with auditing it is to play on that but auditors can get confused about what insessionness is what is the beingness of pc it is of course willing to talk to the auditor and interested in own case this is so simple that auditors can try to put additive states in on top of it using inval and eval they can turn the session into an hypnotic trance session by overwhelming the pc it cant happen easily it takes some doing but it could happen what you want is just someone who is longer fixated on the physical universe or in social state with the auditor but if you violate the auditors code he will still have the physical universe because he will have person not an auditor to deal with he will be too concerned with what the auditor might think what the auditor is doing etc that is normal enough to degree early in auditing so the first auditing person has should be the best because that is when he is most distrustful you dont want him to keep distrustful attitude towards an auditor pc in session can look at his own universe the auditor has to get him to look its interesting that he is in such state of noresponsibility for the physical universe since that is actually the state he has been in since the beginning of track it is his noresponsibility for the physical universe that makes it necessary for him to cope with it and be unsafe with it this is common denominator of bank at the most aberrated spots on the back track the person is 100 irresponsible for the lot so he goes into this state rather easily 174 we are more interested in the backtrack than in his present time physical universe the reason why we are trying to detach him from the pt physical universe is so that we can put him into communication with the pasttime physical universe if he stays stuck in present time he is in state of supercope the mind to such person is already an area of danger because his time track is fraught with insecurity even greater than the insecurity of ft but he is actually not stuck in pt he is stuck on the back track believing that it is present time so you must get beginning ruds in much better with new pc or green pc likewise if auditing gets into grind tear into the ruds dont just check them to see if they are in use them to audit the case dont just get them in for the session we are running get them in for all his past sessions particularly the first how many ruds processes should you use normally you can just flick the withholds off of any ruds question to get the pc into session but the available processes for getting ruds in are nearly countless any valid communication process old problems processes withhold processes there are lots of them you must recognize what rudiments are they are reasons why he might not be in session if you want to straighten him out on the subject of auditing get his ruds in starting with his first session having located the first session you could run what didnt that auditor know and what didnt you know about the environment if the pc has been an auditor you can run out his first pc with what didnt that pc know about you you could get all ruds in on every session he has ever had including end rudiments only the first session or two and few others will have any importance the best method to do this would be form 6 sec check see hcopl 7jul61 processing sec check this is intended for students who have done fair amount of auditing so if pc behaved peculiarly as pc if he was hard to get in session etc look for past bum session and get all ruds in for the first session hed had and given you could lockscan him to find where the pc is stuck lockscanning is very useful for that then you can get ruds in wherever he is parked until he takes time to get from the first session to pt you could do this over and over it shouldnt take more than four or five hours failure to do something like this wastes auditing time because of outofsessionness outofsessionness could arrive from another quarter either you didnt prepare the pc for assessment or ruds are out or there was at least one bad session which has been restimulated so that earlier auditing has to be cleaned up to get later auditing accomplished the pcs interest may be in later incidents but the trouble comes from earlier this has been the uniform mistake all down the track looking at the wrong end of the chain the pcs interest is in the last occurrence and his aberration is in the first occurrence the things person cant remember are the things he has taken responsibility for you can get an inversion where the pc has responsibility for things but has apparent full memory for them actually it is dubin dubin is an effort to take responsibility for something the pc has responsibility for this would be barrier to an auditor unless he could detect something under it for that you can use your emeter which will detect noresponsibility areas that the pc cannot remember 175 when lrh audits pc he makes sure that the pc is interested in finding out about the unknown areas of his past that he gets some familiarity with his own thinkingness that he gets some realization that he has had some causation over his actions in life one thing looms large over all technicalities the state of being in session the most gross auditing error there is is not to get and keep pc in session one can fail to recognize when the pc isnt in session or one can hope insessionness will materialize it never materializes it is not an accident or something you can put on automatic you put pc in session or you take advantage of pcs insessionness when it occurs the main thing that you dont notice is that the pc goes out of session in the middle of session you have to devote some time to putting ruds in when they are out during the session this is very necessary when doing 3d criss cross you are handling charged items the pc can hit one lack confidence in his ability to handle it and arc break with the auditor or something or they invalidate the situation or they withhold something the auditor has to keep these things picked up but the pc isnt telling you what is wrong with his case when he tells you one of these things he is telling you what has just blown that is why it is an error to q and with what the pc gives you in middle ruds if you do take it up you will put the pc out of session one way to get ruds in in midsession is to find what flow the pc has on automatic it is that flow that causes the others to materialize when you get that one cleaned up the ruds will stay in better because you know what the trigger is all you have to know is which flow is sticky which flow has his attention l ron hubbard type 3 idate1262 volnum1 issue108 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec108 flows 6202c01 shspec108 flows what is withhold it is nonflow it is also dont know but the knowingness is influenced by flows it is something the pc doesnt want others to know about or that it hasnt occurred to him to tell the auditor or he is incapable of telling someone about it pc can withhold about flows withhold is restrained knowingness person who is restraining something from being known is withholding he is withholding knowledge data or information any one of the flows can assist aid and abet withhold because knowledge can be buried under the flow given any point or any two points where there is location in space there are only two possible flows for any one of those points inflow and outflow the thing that causes flows is the motionlessness or fixedness of the point the point may or may not have mass all power is derived from holding two positions fixed in space the two points must be kept separate and are to that degree fixed in space the strength with which they are fixed has everything to do with how much horsepower you can generate between them this gives you an idea of how fixed some of the points in the pcs bank must be to generate flows between them as person gets weaker he is longer able to hold two points in space and he gets masses masses are collapsed locations therefore asking someone to locate things in space will generate flows identification is first and foremost identification of locations in space the identified locations then disappear as location because he can do nothing to them or about them 176 areas where one has been or expects to be overwhelmed tend to be identified with each other when lot of things get identified and one can longer differentiate but tries to compulsively you get disassociation he cannot locate anything but simply disperses off anything he tries to locate the mechanism of loss of memory is that several things become one thing identification then they become so much one thing that they cease to exist and you have forgettingness or lack of memory that is what happens to past lives the pc has lost all his power over that life and the locations of that life so he forgets that life factually he forgets things to get even he ceases to be able to place things to make another effect thetan never gets into situation where he is not making an effect axiom 10 is always in full throttle if you dont believe forgetting is getting even ask pc who would be affected by your forgetting about chronic somatic and you are liable to get an evaporation of the somatic however this is in the zone of postulates and considerations flows are just electrical phenomena you can do rather marvellous things with electrical phenomena when you run point out something he locates various points and he is located because the pc is located and another point is located this process can cause flows it can generate power and his bank goes whizwhiz and he can get funny feelings tingles etc various electrical phenomena at the border between flows and intention we have intention about flows until you try to do something with the flows you have only outflow and inflow now completely aside from electrical phenomena you move bit higher with his attitude about flows and in that region you can produce some interesting fireworks on case because you are in the band between electrical phenomena and knowingness that band is his attitude towards flows thetan decides to regulate flows with his intention at this first band of intention we get the cdei scale but at lower harmonic see fig 6 instead of desire we get something that is like desires lower edge permissible or allowable there is an enforced flow then relative to flows there are two kinds of inhibited prohibited meaning prohibited from without and inhibited proper meaning inhibited from within the point terminal we are talking about as you go further down you get an inversion of this scale so as the pc runs flow processes he comes up through eight attitudes towards flows inverted permissible inverted enforced inverted prohibit inverted inhibit inhibit prohibit enforce permit you only need four commands to run it to pick up both harmonics then there is inflow and outflow so there are actually sixteen flows but you only need eight since the harmonic is duplicate then if you did this with four legs in bracket you would have 16 x 4 types of flows or 64 flows 32 not counting the inversions but luckily we dont have to run these by brackets if we dont specify self or another or whatever point we are talking about the pc will automatically shift flows as we run the process so we only need four commands to run the process 176a figure 6 lower harmonic dei scale attitudes towards flows desire permit inflow outflow enforce enforce inflow outflow from without prohibit inflow inhibit outflow from within inhibit inflow outflow inverted inhibit inflow outflow inverted prohibit inflow outflow inverted enforce inflow outflow inverted permit inflow outflow 177 the rudiments get kicked out by triggering automaticities of flows the pc is so much the effect of electrical energy in the bank that he feels the flow and obeys it under the flow is consideration about it which is resident in some identity valence in the bank which routine 3dxx may some day discover all of the considerations about flows that we find in class ii auditing are in effect the considerations of identities contained in the bank that is what you are processing in class ii it is difficult to change the considerations of these packaged beingnesses but that is what you are doing these beingnesses in the bank have considerations about flows and when flows flow the beingnesses in the bank get ideas because they become activated electronically so current goes whiz and the pc goes ohh now im supposed to inhibit outflow and comm lags something else goes zap and the pc goes now im supposed to inhibit inflow so he gets the auditor to not talk or he prohibits inflow by talking back at the auditor etc so as you deal with pure knowingness pulling withholds ie notknowingnesses into view every now and then you run aground on flows the flow tells him to withhold he can have flow withhold as well as data withhold the data withhold can be pinned down by flows datum can actually substitute for thetan we do this all the time in education one of the most serious mistakes society can make is confusing ability with thetan such as with diploma or the old school tie if you look along the lines of datum you find that thetan in his bank has parked data which becomes fixed these data are all the nowimsupposedtos the most basic datum he can park the one he is withholding the hardest the one which forms most of the flows is an identity it is released by routine 3dxx this is datum which the pc thinks is holding locations in space one gets lazy here where bodies are all different on planet of doll bodies you would just know the guy even though the bodies were identical you thetan are carrying on nicely you are not datum or an identity the identity you were is datum that can park in the bank and be terminal from which the flow can charge and discharge this datum or identity had enemies john jones had the enemy bill smith and bill smith has been approximated in the bank someplace by john jones at an earlier time you see and now bill smith becomes lock on an earlier identification that john jones has made with an identity in the bank now you will get an electrical discharge between bill smith and john jones because theyre holding positions in space in the bank it is the interaction of flows between past beingnesses in the bank that causes all the bricabrac in the mind thus these beingnesses generate mass around them so that they appear to be like burnedout tar barrel past beingness is in itself mass because it has blocked flows so often it has gained mass its mass is dependent on its different positions in space as it has moved around and upon the number of positions it has held in space so the valences look very black sometimes with shape sometimes not it startles pc to come across one he tries to find something in one of these things and of course there is nothing in one he was in it its circuits are still operational it can still generate flows it looks like machine making pictures when it starts to come apart but it is really just an old beingness 178 you cannot process points in space you can spot them but they are stills you can process stills if you discharge them but attempting to process stills without discharging them results in disaster processing the identity of living body isnt processing still because it moves around but processing dead bodies wouldnt work if you had someone find something still then make it more still then make it be as still as it was before you would get gains at first it would restimulate feeling of power holding position it is not the same as keeping something from going away which does generate power and discharges number of flows in general you do better to process actions rather than inerts in the bank having datum in the bank withhold fixed in space we find that it tends to act as pole in motor it causes some odd flows in the body because he must not tell it to anybody it becomes duplicative pole for the anybody he mustnt tell you the auditor thus get duplicated as the withhold by the pc and we get this odd phenomenon of discharge going when you process the withhold datum it goes snap out and some kind of circuit disappears at the some time he feels good what happened was that he had this datum being restrained from all sorts of people this gave the datum as great magnitude as the people from whom it was being restrained thus he sets up motor he is at the receiving end the withheld datum operates as pole to generate flow which then makes ridge that is how his valence gets solid in the bank we can take an electrical lock at problem if two people have withholds from each other it only takes little opposed intention to set up two opposite poles which then discharge on the old withholds for instance fish for fish supper for supper that is why the prior confusion containing withholds holds the problem in place if you get all the withholds off the problem vanishes since the problem was only the visible result of the hidden charged poles when you miss withhold you trigger live pole which then triggers another and another until you get an avalanche and the pc tells you off having gone into an automaticity so if you are going to pull withholds do it thoroughly pcs have habitual flows at least one of the eight attitudes will be in force with pc as rule so you could list the eight flows assess the pc and sec check the pc so during listing if you notice that your pc tends for instance to have prohibited inflow on automatic and things get sticky you can put ruds in by asking question that adds up to what inflow did you stop just then the pc has withheld the data that this flow has occurred and you could pull this fact as withhold pc can also believe that some exterior force should prevent his outflow if he is on prohibited outflow here you will find pc with compulsive outflow he is waiting for the auditor to stop him german knight knew what he was supposed to do enforce outflow he was supposed to yap about his great deeds and knock people over the head who wouldnt listen 179 in fact to get total pattern of social conduct you could just apply the eight attitudes towards flows to the tone scale different societies have different ones characteristically the pc can apply all these things on the auditor he can try to enforce an outflow for instance or inhibit an outflow terminal can have flows for others as well as for itself since flows are caused by withholds running flows unburies withholds the pole of the withhold was buried by flows so running flows uncovers it you could assess the eight flows and sec check the most reactive etc pcs bank could not possibly be discharged rapidly by any machine or chemical because the flows are intricate and the ridges are composited flows you have to do something to straighten the flows out any method that got rid of the bank as whole block would never expose the understanding which is beneath it because that is the second inversion understanding has first involved flows electrical nonsense masses and the sixth dynamic and then inverts and goes under it all and electricity is capable of burying all the knowledge in the world in the pcs bank case makes progress by finding out something about himself empirically l ron hubbard type 3 idate6262 volnum1 issue111 rev0

this is good because where principle has been an amplification of survive it has worked like mad with pcs we also have the reason why an identity is aberrative an identity is that accumulation of withholds that make an individuation when the pc gives you his name you have one part of routine 3dxx already done where you have to recognize person from his identity rather than from his beingness there cant be much beingness present 3d item is maximal identity and minimal beingness every now and then you get identity and beingness crossed and you get an historic character lrh has used identity on the track to make effects but it was mistake to think that he was successful in creating the effects because of the identity it was really because of the beingness you could reach more and influence more than other people so you did the identity side of it was to be more of lump of than anyone else which defeats the reach you can conceive of beingness as the ability to permeate pervade communicate to or fill up an area identity is method of not having to identity puts it on automatic an identity is substitute for communication and reachingness beingness is current activity identity is past activity fame etc the only thing this universe punishes are being there and communicating it is an antibeingness universe and proidentity universe withhold is notreachingness it is not communicating this includes holding onto piece of information that would damage survival of course since thetan cant really be hurt withhold must be to protect the survival of an identity not beingness so withhold goes beyond matter of mores it is something person thinks would reduce his survival as an identity if it were not withheld if you are building an identity on repute which is the standard trick in this universe and working to enhance your repute you withhold those things which would depress 180 the survival identity thetan goes cautious on this and withholds more than he has to selfpreservation is of course misnomer it is really identitypreservation any identity that remains in the bank is the direct result of identitypreservation so we find these suspended 3dxx items hanging around the points that are really stuck however are the points where one failed to preserve ones life because those are the failed postulates the postulated impulse was to preserve the life so death hangs up more than life as failed postulate as an auditor finding some picture hanging up on the track you could ask what would you withhold about that picture and the whole incident would unreel as the pc found the identity that had to be suppressed for purposes of survival despite the fact that there may have been lot of survival in the action you get the withholds and the compulsive outflows off you could almost free up the track by asking what should you have told people about it will run at first with withholds then get into bragging that got withheld where there is conflict whether to withhold or let it out you get hung up on the track you could say that any difficult situation is an unequated or unresolved problem in survival so any hangup on the track is an unresolved problem in survival there were balanced factors involved in communicating or not each hungup identity is hung up with these computations such as the computation that to communicate or not to communicate is equally nonsurvival by pulling withholds off the case you release all these things an individual withholds an identity until it parks on the track when you find an identity you have key to tremendous section of track the identity is dedicated to hiding so finding it takes off tremendous amount of charge because the identity is withholding itself by hiding and you handle the withhold by finding the identity each identity has the feeling or computation they are probably still looking for if they find watch out he was trying to make the identity famous then failed to survive as the identity the pc gets very alert as you come near it feeling like wanted man this is the feeling of guilt which former therapies sought the source of the feeling of guilt is as much brag as anything else but it contains the feeling of being wanted when theres feeling that one has problem of survival which cant be solved on any of the dynamics it will come right up to pt and knock ones head off when one of these comes off identities come off and withholds come off with the identities pulling any identity off invariably involves getting connected withhold otherwise it wouldnt be in the bank and floating up to pt thats the common denominator of anything in the bank since it is there to solve survival of course efforts to survive are silly since thetan cant do anything else what the effort is really directed to is getting an identity to survive if there is an effort in the thing it must be built around lie that the person doesnt recognize the person doesnt realize that he is one thing and his identity is something else he also thinks his beingness and his communicatingness is his identity actually these are deteriorated because he is being joe doakes therefore all these things have withhold connected with them 181 whenever you miss withhold person gets restimulation of withhold and he gets the idea that he is in danger that is all there is to it q and stimulusresponse mechanism if person has withhold that he must withhold he must be in danger because the reactive mind works on an the conclusion can put into action the causation for instance we put george in wrecked car with blood on it not in his car or wreck if george was asleep or drunk or something when we put him there when he wakes up his conclusion will be that he has been in wreck he would mock up sequence to explain his being there the least he would get out of it would be little shock of should i tell anybody or what is this what are the consequences of having wrecked this car in extremis he would show psychosomatic injuries etc so if you give someone the end product of chain of responsibility he will attempt to assume some of the earlier responsibility given b one concludes from evidence this leads pcs to write script in session sometimes sometimes the pc doesnt know what led to the consequences so he figures he must have withhold from himself it is interesting to find the material he must be withholding from himself but isnt his anxiety about identity would cover the whole picture say you have found terminal on 3dxx an angry man you could run what responsibility have you taken for the continued survival of an angry man you would see the package an angry man fall apart into separate identities if you have been responsible for something and then ceased to be responsible for it you can get your block knocked off thats about the only way you can get your block knocked off if you have taken wide identity then while in that identity have ceased to be responsible for it during decline or whatever next time around you take responsibility for the area that leaves the wide area permeated but responsibility for it matter what your identity is because it is only beingness after all people can try to shift their identities to change everything but it is only beingness that counts if he has beingness in his background which is associated with his identity and then suddenly cuts his beingness down to nothing in order to limit his identity he will be in trouble every time he cant function in his limited sphere because he has already accepted much larger sphere so he is always in trouble we could then ask him what responsibility have you taken for the survival of the wider zone thetans are always doing this having taken responsibility for the whole of europe and having battered europe to pieces in order to liberate it all nations who took part in that activity then drew back and said well have peace now and let the whole of europe go to hell sure enough thats what happened world war ii that is withhold of magnitude because it is withhold of ability so withhold can be withhold from anything that the pc has had permeation into or communication with when communication is followed by nocommunication the advent of the communication operating as withhold reduces survival we have made huge area survive now we are only going to make little part of it survive there will be some countersurvival in the area where you were formerly taking full responsibility that is the mechanism of individuation first communication into then refusal to communicate into 182 you have established oneness with something by communicating into it or by taking responsibility for it you cant segmentalize responsibility into smaller zone without bad consequences once you have taken responsibility for energizing an area then retreat the area you retreat from is on your wavelength and clobbers you the people who cut your throat are your own police guard as soon as you decide that you can longer occupy the palace you cant take responsibility for the physical universe and then take responsibility for one room in boarding house in two successive lives and not have planets hit you in the head if the huge zone of responsibility is cut down by series of withholds which it always is then because it is now energized it can kick your head in survival process therefore discharges all withhold processes so the principle of survival is senior to all overtmotivator sequences responsibility processes survivaltype processes persistency processes and identity processes are all senior processes the most horrible opponent being can have is himself of course its got his wavelength in scientology we are making man his own best friend if one finds oneself withholding one automatically assumes one must be trying to survive hence that one must be in danger so if you miss withhold on pc that is the conclusion the pc comes to so he takes defensive actions at once the sequence is as follows 1 the pc finds himself withholding 2 therefore he reactively assumes he must be in danger 3 therefore he must take action to survive ie attack or defend himself if you miss withhold you get 2 and 3 above wild animals are only savage because one pulled their withholds they are individuated any withhold restimulates them though they are not natively savage as beings wolves interpret almost anything as withhold of theirs or yours so they attack rather easily so they must withhold in the vicinity of almost anything so you seldom run into them in order to handle wolf so he wont bite you you have to demonstrate to him conclusively that he is not withholding anything lrh handles wolves that way very successfully the trick is to show them that there is point in withholding anything because they are not going to damage you and you are not going to damage them you can get remarkable results this way but walk up to wild animal as though you are withholding something and you have had it go up to him as though you are not withholding anything and he will look at you and wonder what you are doing so you show him what you are doing dont excite his curiosity so you dont have withhold from him now if you have given the pc the impression in sec checking that he is withholding then dont pull the withhold to show the pc that he is not now withholding he is liable to go into defending himself by attacking pulling his withholds is the only thing that keeps him from individuating missing his withholds however will restimulate them and make him feel that he is in danger and must attack not pulling withhold is ok as long as you dont restimulate it otherwise you would have to get all his withholds in one session it is the missed withhold the one that is restimulated and not pulled that causes the trouble information available and not asked for or information asked for and not gotten is what makes wild animal out of the pc 183

needle action you should realize that there is something strange to get out of the road so you could ask about aspects of havingness and see if there is anything that would keep the pc from having etc clean it up always audit with the meter in direct line of sight so that by merely lifting or dropping your gaze you can see pc and meter without turning your head turning your head signifies to the pc that you are not interested in his case in organizations keep students and pcs missed withholds well cleaned up similarly with staff auditors what missed withhold is is subject to misinterpretation people are apt to ask for withholds when that is not what is wanted it is not unpulled unrestimulated withholds that cause trouble it is the whatshouldhavebeenfoundoutandwasnt it is not withhold it is shouldhavefoundout empirically it turns out that all arc breaks blows upsets natter etc stem from missed withholds the mechanism and the theory may be what was outlined in the last lecture or it may not but this is still true as an empirical fact christ was crucified because he missed withholds the withhold can be inadvertent or didnt know matter what the pcs modifier of his main goal line will be thrown into dramatization when the withhold is missed you can prevent this by cleaning up arc breaks as soon as they happen pulling withholds as soon as they happen and keeping ruds in rigorously or if you know the modifier you can chant it to the pc to turn off the dramatization this is poor way to do it but possible you can get list to read in this way but just running shouldhaveknown to death would get all ruds in with clank this can be used at any time not parked in ritual of pattern random rudiment dont drop are you withholding anything from ruds but realize that the missed withhold is totally different question and proposition and area using missed withholds you can shortcircuit all the other outruds one caution if you open up whole new area of track the condition of the case has changed and you will want to check missed withholds again since new crop may have come to light from the change auditors dont always expect or allow for change in the pc they should the consequence of change is that aspects of the case shift this is quite apparent in 3dxx every identity you go through has its own bank its own package of engrams if you are listing effectively the pc is sitting right next to the terminal you announce so you are pulling up bank every item if the pc is really in session even though they are only lock valences the pc will dramatize the last item you found when you get these case changes you are getting bunch of shouldhaveknowns you hadnt seen before you handle them in sloppy fashion with middle rudiments dont distract the pc with them or make big fuss over them but when you notice the pc even one tenth out of session dont wait for more upset get in the shouldhaveknown since the pc is in valence with missed withholds that werent there for the valence he was in minute earlier catch it the instant the pc starts to slip out of session 184 the quality of an auditor is observable at the stage of arc break where the auditor acts the less arc break needed to get action the better change of pace is enough lrh cleans up the session before the pc knows he has an arc break but not to the extent of patching up nonexistent arc breaks and causing one pc who has shouldhavefoundout is always on the verge of an arc break he is the arc breaky pc anybody who gives you bunch of upset disagreement with the organization etc has continuous missed withhold this principle is responsible for more loss of dissemination loss of scientologists and of public to scientology than any single factor pe foundations and coaudits need this datum you could run them on the basis that everyone in the pe foundation is professional findoutabouter then anyone who walks in on pe course should be assumed to have continuous missed withholds which they have come to see if you can find out about they dont really come in to find out about scientology or to be helped or anything else if you dont find out about them they arc break and go out and badmouth you you can create an antiscientology public by doing tests on people since doing so can result in just missing their withholds you would never lose people who you checked on meter with what should we find out about you what should the last group you were in have found out about you that they didnt and cleared up the reads knowingness to most people is knowledge of their ows the reason coaudit doesnt build up is that when auditing without meters withholds are missed and people blow knowledge as knowledge of overts is the bottom rung of knowledge it is past withhold that is restimulated an auditor is locked on by pcs as an expert if he can get the missed withholds off the case any criticism the pc throws at you is just caused by the shouldhavefoundout you didnt ask for even if you are actually worthy of criticism in your auditing tech so add missed withholds to both ends of the session and use shouldhaveknown in mid ruds cases that have reputation for being rough to audit should be approached by finding an area of shouldhaveknown prior to scientology and shooting it full of holes then get all the shouldhaveknowns from scientology cleaned up 620zc12 shspec110 prepclearing sec checking is out prepclearing is newly born it sounds better for one thing and it is preparatory to clearing hence the prep auditors havent learned sec checking very well despite lots of efforts to teach them to do it so it is probably hard to do there must have been some element missing so lrh has been working on the subject of withholds realizing that if nothing was missing he should have been able to articulate it well enough so that auditors could get it and do it easily he has done remarkable things with pulling withholds now and then but maybe there is more to the mechanism he had been aware since the first of the year that if he couldnt relay it so that auditors could get resurgence after every time it was done then there must be some kind of variable in it missed withholds was the first discovery that resulted from this research they have proved out as the source of all the arc breaks and natter you get the proof is that when you pull the missed withhold the arc breaks and natter disappear and the pc gets case gain that had been missed before this is not variable it is not true that every 185 time you miss withhold you will get an arc break but it is true that every arc break comes from missed withhold the only effective thing to do about it is to pull the missed withhold punishment has been tried in the past and it hasnt worked explaining and protesting also dont work so you have business trying to handle the pcs arc break with you except by pulling the missed withhold which is most likely to have been in the session you are running since to the pc present time things are more important than the past what the missed withhold is composed of monitors what rud goes out ptp is missed withhold in life an arc break is missed withhold in session etc shouldhaveknown is an unknown which puts us back to sec checking with unknown auditors doing that were putting people into engrams and trying to run the engrams with them it wasnt running well although it was successful at shaking up the bank the whole subject of withholds is notknow and unknowns missed withhold is halfknown halfunknown there seems to be enough charge to cause polarity that sets off godawful agitation in the bank it can be halfknown to the pc being halfknown analytically and half reactive hence half unknown unknow plays heavy part in 3dxx the notknow that is most important is the shouldhaveknown this is regret it bunches up the bank something half known is very disturbing it seems dangerous and makes one freeze up the regret mechanism is what turns 3dxx valence into ball and loops the time track the mechanism of looped time track is due to just one thing shouldhaveknown this smashes everything into the one time zone of valence it adds up to feeling that one shouldnt have done shouldnt have confronted shouldnt have experienced so the prior pictures of having experienced are invalidated at once so he tries to say this never happened and we get the occlusion of the whole track shouldhaveknown is apparently the most important button in the bank this is the sequence leading to occlusion 1 he should have known something 2 he didnt know it 3 one gets regret this smashes everything into the one timezone of valence 4 this adds up to feeling that one shouldnt have done confronted experienced 5 he invalidates prior pictures of having experienced 6 he tries to say they never happened 7 we get whole track occlusion the only thing that reduces pcs profile after auditing is arc breaks but what produces an arc break is should have known via missed withhold so you can remedy arc breaks with should have knowns this universe has quantitative button it isnt the number or size or gruesomeness of the withholds you get that gives you case gain it is just the thoroughness with which you get withhold the quality of your auditing which gives the degree of case gain freud was always trying to get the one button that would produce big resurgence in the case he must have done it at least once to have such faith in it he never taught it to anyone but he must have had some success with it he was looking for 186 withhold he was looking in one area sex and one time childhood which circumscribed it too narrowly his occasional successes were what gave psychoanalysis its success and repute even though they didnt know what they were doing you have two choices when dealing with missed withhold 1 do full dress job of knocking out all the shouldhaveknowns on the subject in this lifetime or 2 just get and knock out the latest keyin which way you do it depends on how successful you are with the light shouldhaveknown touch on the latest keyin if the pc stays arc broken or quickly rearc breaks you will need the full works per hcob 12feb62 how to clear withholds and missed withholds starting from the difficulty being handled finding what the withhold is when all and who should have known repetitively per the rules in that bulletin if you work this system you will find all of the basic buttons on the case will just roll out if you can do it by the numbers exactly per the above bulletin even chronic somatics will straighten out they will come back during 3dxx but this withhold system does give the resurgences that freudian practitioners are looking for prepchecking is the system of getting each rudiment in so it stays in fairly permanently during 3dxx it uses the same elements as the withhold system given above you could also do joburg form three with one of these things form three is the sec check form for new students see hcopl 22may61 the only valid sec check the zero question from form three would be any question from the form that you are trying to clear on the pc if you get read you move on to question number one what was that and more specifically what about subject of the sec check question write this down because you will have to clear that question it should duplicate as nearly as possible the pcs reply to the zero question and its read pc never refuses to tell the auditor but he sometimes doesnt tell because he doesnt know it is the auditors job to get the pc to look and to help him find the answer it may be so charged that he doesnt want to look but it is up to you to get him to look it is ok to be positive in getting him to look but if you ever imply he knows and wont say you have admitted that he is out of session and you have got games condition going so that point never comes into the session you must clear questions 0 and 1 if they clear without 2 3 and 4 fine when you first get into question 2 you dont have to be precise but if you have to cycle through it again get it more precise so as to spot it exactly if it doesnt clear question 2 is when the withhold occurred to clear question number one run 2 3 4 until 1 is cleared when it is clean check 0 again etc questions 2 3 and 4 are the way to blow the withhold to halifax so it never comes up again if in compartmenting the question you get read on subquestion that now becomes the zero question it is more important to handle one withhold question well than thousands indifferently it is not the quality of the withhold that counts it is how much of it is submerged out of sight if he has done something horrendous and knows about it it isnt going to aberrate him matter how tempting it may be to blame his condition on it you will find that it is out of some stupid little incident run back on stack of things the pc did that you recover recollections on bring them back to view and the pc confronts them and his case will tend to resurge 187 it is good idea to take up any sec check question the pc has gotten reads on recurrently take it as the zero question get the what clean it thoroughly with 2 3 and 4 because it must be halfknown or it wouldnt be reading recurrently any difficulty could be handled that way it is fundamental question you may not get much in the way of cognitions for awhile as your zero question keeps reading but eventually things will begin to blow and it will all fall apart nothing will read on an emeter that is not significantly charged and nothing will fall on an emeter that is not unknown in part to the pc if the emeter registers there must be something unknown at least in part the only thing you will get into and difficulties with is converting the zero question to the what question dont vary the zero or what questions 2 3 and 4 neednt be rote though you shouldnt get yappy on them just be natural with it you only use the meter to test one and zero do not take past life answers when using this system pcs will duck into the unreality of yesterday to avoid the withhold in this lifetime or they are trying to run the whole bank on this process and this process wont run the whole bank 3dxx is for handling past lifetimes you wont get any gains running past lives on this withhold system l ron hubbard type 3 idate14262 volnum1 issue117 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec117 directing attention 6202c14 shspec117 directing attention if you cant easily release an arc break or easily get rudiment in it is always safe to assume that havingness is out when the pcs attention is distracted havingness drops and the bank tends to collapse on him details of running routine 3dxx dont hesitate to check ruds question twice if you are in doubt about read be careful be precise dont put looking good over doing good job put accuracy first the only person who loses otherwise is the pc it is the same with being kind to the pc or failing to direct the pcs attention or anything that adds up to noauditing and keep the should have knowns cleaned up and you will never get arc broken pcs it is interesting to note that if you look over an old sec check and find the missed withhold at the point where the pc went into past life you will find one in this lifetime it is connected and it restimulates the past life and maybe it is hot one that got missed by going backtrack it is true that withholds in past lives are causing all the pcs real difficulties but they are handled in 3dxx not missed withholds the pc never forgives you if you let him give up if you dont direct the pcs attention you will get gains in session if you let pcs attention wander that is more productive of arc breaks than directing his attention even if it doesnt seem nice or kind your attitude to the pc mean kind or whatever doesnt much matter as long as you are effective you dont overwhelm the pc with mood you overwhelm the pc with inval and eval it is not being ladylike or gentlemanly that gives the pc gains it is directing the pcs attention however crudely and badly and being effective the liability of prepchecking and the withhold system of hcob 12feb62 is that every time the pc comes close to the key withhold he is likely to get cross with the auditor it is an indicator the missed withhold mechanism with curve in it you innocently ask the pc who didnt know about that who should have known 188 or whatever get down to all and have the pc irritated now you are on the edge of it thats all if you dont head the pc on down the alley to face that withhold you will have an upset pc primary withhold pulling flubs 1 the pc natters about joe the auditor gets only motivators thus letting the pc commit more overts by making damaging statements 2 letting the pc give you other peoples withholds that being interesting gossip waste of time 3 taking critical thoughts without getting the underlying overts this gives gain 4 stenographic auditing failure to direct the pcs attention it lets his run his havingness down and commit overts of defaming people critical thoughts are an indicator of overts and can be used to trap the pc into leading into the overts fifteen or twenty seconds of listening to them is enough under the withhold system critical thought can be one question all will get the rest where you can coax the pc into revealing the rest the one question is never the question you work hard on it is just used to test this is especially true when it is critical thought you are after all the done the critical thought question wont clear until youve got all the done the withhold system helps you direct the pcs attention to where it should be put but it is still not rote robotic action put little invitation and coax into it plus little insistence to look if you want to know the answers and you are interested you will operate much more effectively you can meterdate to help the pc to look because withholds do scramble or group the track and make it difficult for him to spot when your rancor if any should only be directed at the aspect of the pcs looking not at his telling you even if the meter reacts the pc doesnt know in fact it is because the pc doesnt know that it reacts if you imply that he is deliberately not telling you put him into games condition use whatever trickery persuasion or skill you like to direct the pcs attention but direct it get the pcs interest in it too if you get an irregular response to the withhold question ask the pc if repetition of the question is causing an arc break because the emeter has confusion point data in the bank and an arc break can both give response cleaning clean will produce an arc break on the missed withhold of nothing lot of auditors ran goals and terminals lists up to thousands of items by getting protest reads on the demand for more items commonly though after you clean up the arc break in running the withhold system the pc will have more on the withhold the pc gets misemotional with the auditor because the auditor represents all the people who should have known about the withhold and didnt if the pc doesnt get misemotional it is sign that you are not getting anywhere because you havent hit anything hot if the pc stays bright and cheerful through the session and never gets anything that makes him feel bad or look bad he is liable to arc break after the session feeling that it was wasted time dont expect the pc to go on gradient scale of getting better on the withhold system he goes on gradient scale of looking worse life has begun to loom as grim serious proposition they may go into this curve and out in twenty minutes or in four sessions depending on the beefiness of the zero 189 question how hot button it is with how much avoidance in it the hotter the question the more charge there is to be bled the milder the charge the shorter the cycle of action this cycle is not the usual processing cycle it is is alerted goes down to the bottom then shoots up to the top see fig 7 the entire force of an aberration is directed to pulling the attention in while buffing it off you dont have to pull the pcs attention to the middle of any aberration because it is fixed there dut every aberration has buffer that bounces the pc out again it is not clear inflow or outflow the mind is actually concentrated on it 100 so the more you get him to look in that direction the paler and worse he will look until he gets it all cleaned up then you get to the last remnants of it you really have to help the pc out because he is stonied he just cant force his attention into it so letting his attention ride all over the place is letting the pc be the effect of the withhold and the charge and he will never forgive you as the cognition figure 7 the cycle of pulling withhold graphics inserted approaches the attention is harder to direct into the center of the withhold given something the pc has really nonconfronted at the time he will often have some bit of it that he has utterly fictionalized written script for etc he backs out of all responsibility for it and as his attention gets directed at it he tends to veer off and gets chargy and irritated at the auditor you must differentiate between the pc who is arc broken because he is in games condition with the auditor and one who is introvertedly arc broken and snapping at everything they look quite different if you direct the pcs attention terminatedly to the whole precise withhold you will get fine resurgence if you dont the pc will be miserable because his whole bank is kicking him in the head because there is one helping him hold it down you have to keep your eye out for the pcs tendency to go general on you to never give you anything specific and to just gloss over the top of it all you have to get the pc to look he has to tell you when he has seen it but he will tell you only when he knows if he says 190 i dont know just say lets find out lets look lets dig bit dont think the pc is upset with you when he is upset with the bank emphasize looking not telling the pc will tell you what he can see you can clean up pc who has had some auditing some sec checking with recurring withholds by getting what withhold kept coming up and using the withhold system steps 2 3 and 4 when all and who see page 186 above used repetitively to discharge the what question or one question on it to find what has been missed in it you can also start from who the pc has complained about lot but knowing 3dxx you wont sail in towards target that is terminal your zero question should be on doingness knowingness or havingness not beingness probably any terminal that has been located on 3dxx could be moved in on and prepchecked by this system this hasnt been tried yet but those would be the beingnesses to take up if any l ron hubbard type 3 idate15262 volnum1 issue118 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec118 prepchecking 6202c15 shspec118 prepchecking details on running of prepchecking see hcob 1mar62 prepchecking class ii skill for an outline of the procedure prepchecking can be used in problems intensive as given in tapes shspec65 to 67 and pages i23 to i27 above and well outlined in hcob 9nov61 the problems intensive use of the prior confusion taking the terminals from the prior confusion you can make up zero1 question with what about your difficulty with eg fred then you can get the one1 question and do the withhold system on that to clear difficulties with fred if you get new what question you could call it one2 etc you can also make zero questions out of the dynamics eg zero1 are you willing to talk to about yourself zero2 are you willing to talk to about sex and family etc an auditor has to get the highest possible degree of relaxation on the part of the pc if it is built up the pc will stay in session come hell or high water even if he is mad at you prepchecking is particularly liable to send the pc out of session because in it you are asking for very intimate activities also just before he hits one of those big withholds it is missed withhold and has been for several seconds at least ie for as long as he has spotted it and before he has told you he is actually influenced by it before he hits it but misattributes it to the auditor so it pays to clear the auditor well early on when you are pulling withholds self is the one the pc feels he is damaging because giving up withholds threatens personal survival sometimes pcs run themselves down and make the overt worse than it is in desperate effort to make it blow if you are going to be handling some subject in the body of the session and it comes up on ruds dont try to handle it with the ruds you can let the pc know there is something there and that it is what is in the session if you are caught short without knowing the pcs havingness process nearly surefire one is one that has him reaching and touching things within his reach the only danger in it is with some small number of pcs that it takes long time to flatten and can turn on tactile pain if so this process was what was needed prepchecking solves an old problem how to bring pc who is reading below 20 on the meter up l ron hubbard type 3 idate20262 volnum1 issue113 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec113 what is withhold 6202c20 shspec113 what is withhold the common denominator of withholds is that withhold is something that person believes would endanger his selfpreservation if it were revealed this is the reason why whole track memory is occluded someone with little wholetrack recall considers himself to be in great danger this gives you the exact reason pc gets off withholds which arent withholds such as other peoples withholds all withholds students tend to get off on each other are safe withholds we get into this tacit consent on withholds because of overts on other peoples withholds eg spreading their overts around making them guilty for the overt sort of punishing them for having gotten it off after doing that it seems unsafe to get off withholds the more unsafe you make it to get off withholds the battier it becomes until you get civilization like this one for instance laws against perversion can be used by communists as means of blackmailing people the state lends itself to punishment of withholds which lays it open to undermining by the people in high positions who have those withholds likewise if the auditor makes it unsafe for the pc to get off withholds the pc will only get off safe withholds ie nonwithholds the hyperindividuation of the pc stems only from his withholds the pcs idea that to get it off would injure his survival is in fact aberrated it is the aberrated idea of what they dare to get off that brings about the condition of aberration everyone has some withholds which would in fact bring harm to him if they were revealed these get deeply buried encysted and the others build up on them if someone comes close to these withholds one gets the feeling that all hell will break loose and one will be imprisoned in some dungeon and tortured so naturally the auditor seems dangerous in reality dangerous auditor is one who doesnt pull withholds these auditors will always be involved in arc breaks cause pcs to natter about auditing orgs etc have loses etc the auditor who only gets off safe withholds is dangerous pcs whose withholds have been missed do not make their goals and gains the auditor who cannot get result with prepchecking will simply not audit the definition of withhold makes it not ok to let pcs take items off their lists because those become missed withholds because of the pcs considerations about safety as mentioned above he will want to withhold items from lists but you must not let this happen the items are on the list because they were dangerous at one time and were withheld in the first place prepchecking and 3dxx both are devoted to making the pc realize that it isnt dangerous to reveal himself the pc will mention some hot area then as the auditor starts him looking at it he will feel little reactive regret that he brought it up see page 185 above during the time you are going through this regret band you are still crossing over into the zone of what is unknown you hit should have known on the way up and you have to get through this to know in prepchecking when the pc gives you motivator you know you are an hot ground so you always ask an overt what question criticalness leads you to look for the overt doingness behind it explaining why something happened is milder phenomenon but it too requires new what question if the withhold itself is given it is the what question 192 the withhold is measured by the amount of danger the pc conceives to be present in getting off the withhold if the withhold is not dangerous he will just give it if it is somewhat dangerous he will explain around it if it is rather dangerous he will criticize if it is super dangerous he will give you motivator we are taking about dangerousness in the eyes of the pc this gives you an index to the case case is as bad off as he considers it dangerous to reveal himself the insane person is dramatizing total motivator on the subject of punishment insanity is the last protest against punishment i cannot feel your punishment i dont know about it you have driven out of my mind etc length of time it takes to achieve result in auditing is indexed by danger of revelation from the pcs viewpoint how can you cut down this length of time dont pull safe withholds use prepchecking in 3dxx there is new line something like what identity would it be unsafe for you to reveal relief line could be what identity would it be safe for you to reveal to throw the others into view the pc actually wants the relief of the revelation but doesnt know how to get it safely so he is always hoping for some oneshot button for clearing without revealing anything unsafe to reveal type questions give you good zero prepcheck questions eg is there anything you have done which would be unsafe to reveal gives you what questions old age must be the consideration that it is unsafe to show up with mest body at first you must figure its safe to show up with mest body then you get the idea that it is unsafe so you take it down that must be what old age is the basic trick of this universe is if you withhold it it wont hurt you which is total lie offering fact seems dangerous withholding the fact is apparently not dangerous this is lie the thetan just builds up mass and gets less space this way it makes his withhold himself more and more occupy less and less space permeate less and less etc cant go outside case is someone who has lots of withholds stacked up an one fairly serious one he is the one who is afraid the police are after him phobias fit in here this is most salient in prepchecking some withholds you just let go by the safe withholds which are really red herrings l ron hubbard type 3 idate21262 volnum1 issue114 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec114 use of prepchecking 6202c21 shspec114 use of prepchecking in prepchecking you are trying to find underlying overts that is what the when all who refers to you are not just getting withholds you are interested in chains of overts the anatomy of the mind is that the basic incident holds she chain of incidents in place you are not looking for the hidden part of single incident you are looking for the hidden earliest incident the pc sees only the most recent incident until you get him to asis by telling you the when all and who we arent looking for basicbasic on it because that is anchored in valence which you will only find in 3dxx prepchecking is limited to this lifetime the chain will blow if this lifetimes basic is found so what questions never apply to only one incident neither do the when all and who you have great fluidity in what questions you ask the what question however should be specific enough to find chain different dates come up on question two you try to clear the what youve got if you cant find the subsidiary chain and clear it if you cant clear that clear the subsidiary chain it depends on etc etc stay on the same subject 193 the zero question is just rudiments question that gives starting point you can go with these by dynamics get kind of one question then follow that down to withhold and get real one question lrh has used eg for the initial one question what about your physical difficulties the question what physical difficulty would it be unsafe to reveal got list got an item reading well which now gives proper one question what about rectum trouble and one can go back to work the only riskiness in this case was that it led to an identity the pcs little brother we try not to use identities in prepchecking but if that is all you can get well the inevitable question if some subject doesnt clear up is what have you done to _______ there must be something there just from the basics of the overtmotivator sequence you dont treat every withhold as new what question when the pc gives one ask what about this chain of withholds that is you should phrase it as more general action but not so general as to take in the whole reactive bank you work your way down to something that clears then work on back you may get hung up along the way back requiring some new chain the pc could jump chains follow along as necessary but be sure to retrace your steps it all depends on the fact that hidden information exists on the chain someplace when you get that the whole chain will unravel the overt may be quite mild you are looking for needle in haystack so dont look just run the system and it will show up the best way to establish the question is by the approach described here it is called prepchecking because it is preparatory to clearing prepchecking gets the pcs rudiments sufficiently cleaned up so 3dxx can be done with more ease that is why the basic prepcheck questions are ruds questions for the withhold rud use form 3 see p 186 and form 6a see hcopl 3feb62 auditor processing check this is shortened form of form 6 and is intended for students who have done fair amount of auditing for problems you have the problems intensive you prepcheck the withholds the pc comes up with in prior confusion areas you can do the same with end ruds halftruths untruths etc for the question about influencing the emeter you can handle it more broadly with meters electronic gear mind reading etc so the pc can be at ease with the meter get his ruds in with thud and they wont get in the way during 3dxx when you change valences because of 3dxx new areas will come to view but finding new valence because of 3dxx doesnt mean the pc moves out of and abandons all his old valences the 3d problems mass pulls apart bit it has less influence on him than before but just before you find this the pc will dramatize the new valence coming up that dramatization influences the case and tends to throw ruds out put if the pc is already capable of being kept in session the influence of it is minimal you dont have to pay lot of attention to it the pc will have cognitions come up with withholds not as part of ruds but as part of 3dxx you could omit the prepcheck in fact but then the 3dxx would take about four times as long to do because of the upsets that 3dxx tends to produce anyway prepchecking tends to improve stability on case by handling ows so the pc is not in for big shock when running 3dxx uncovers new material well done prepcheck is like complete psychoanalysis every three or four hours 194 person can become very morose upset and low doing 3dxx if you will ever have trouble with his ruds it is now so it is nice to be able to get ruds in prepchecking is also valuable just in itself after you have all the pcs terminals and oppterms all laid out on their line plot dont be sure that you have seen the last of prepchecking probably similar technique will be used to take these items to pieces therefore you are not concerned before you have the gpm isolated with any pastlife activity those are the withholds of whole life which you find with 3dxx since the basic holds the chain down you dont struggle too hard with some sticky withhold if it keeps reading and doesnt clean up with your 2 3 and 4 there is something else to look for l ron hubbard type 3 idate22262 volnum1 issue119 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec119 prepclearing and rudiments 6202c22 shspec119 prepclearing and rudiments terminology its prepcheck and the whole activity is prepclearing one index that withhold chain is working well is that the pcs havingness doesnt drop as much as before ta motion is another indicator one could clear up environment as part of ruds by prepchecking rooms this would in effect be prepchecking havingness to some extent we can locate withholds about games conditions what has the pc denied people what has he pushed people out of if you prepchecked this for broke you would find that his havingness would stay in without havingness process provided that he was willing to talk to the auditor at all times so use havingness while getting the pc to talk to the auditor then use things like the joburg form 3 for new students and form 6a for oldtime auditors to clean up withholds for problems find what problems he has caused people in this lifetime and prepcheck them as overts the problems intensive gets you to the problem he is sitting in you could go at it that way getting prior confusion etc or you could shortcut it by getting what problems he has caused in this lifetime as the zero question prepchecking might get you mest clear clear for this lifetime psychoanalyst would be able to learn to do this he would be flabbergasted by it especially when he learned that it was only preparatory action this system can be adapted to whatever the pc is doing you dont want the pc to give you whole lot of unconnected withholds if he does give them take up the one that reads and clear it up keep to the withholds on the same chain mine chain subject there is an art to converting what the pc says to what question you have to listen to what the pc said there are some rules it must not be too general so wide as to miss chain it must not be so narrow as to pin the pc in single incident it should be aimed at the part of the withhold that is most dangerous to the pc you must not take motivators or criticisms other peoples withholds or explanations if you get one of these you turn it around given motivator ask what overt the pc has done to that class of people many motivators are untruths anyway at least in part so it throws ruds out for you to accept one just convert it do an overt with q and criticism likewise leads to an overt it is hope that they can damage with an inability to do so it is bit higher toned than straight motivator 195 motivator is based on an unknowingness criticism isnt necessarily criticism is also confession of an overt it converts as question to what have you done to _______ it is not always true that criticism is based on unknowingness but motivators always are it always seems safe to the pc to get other peoples overts off this is below motivators actually if the auditor lets the pc get these off you will get session where the pc made goals or gains when the pc says that said b did something ask the pc which person he knows then get what the pc has done to that person on explanations you know there is an overt so this also converts to what have you done actually the explanation itself is perfectly innocent but it leads to target eventually it is an extenuating circumstance for some overt you have to figure out what one way to open up some areas is to ask what should be done about _______ with the dynamics in the blank the pc goes off on some point and you can mine it whatever you get on some target convert the question to handle it in doing this you are steering the pc down chain of incidents that he considers relatively discreditable because he considers them discreditable he is not in communication with the subject matter he feels at the effect point of the subject matter the pc is the source of the aberration with which he is boxing as far as one lifetime or valence is concerned the individual has chosen certain areas as his randomity if he is giving other peoples withholds however he is not even on the causeeffect line motivators being effect victim criticism the impulse to destroy explanation lines in dispersal you are walking the pc back to being cause by knocking out any reason he has to attack certain points or defend himself from them or to retreat from certain subjects on his track so he can communicate on all subjects naturally on areas where he is not being cause he doesnt know if you want to find person who is in total ignorance pull other peoples withholds here the pc doesnt even know he has bank or aberration on the subject on the motivator he knows that he is in trouble but he doesnt really know why critical pc may understand the situation but he wants to make nothing of it similarly with explanation there may not be any unknowns see fig 8 cf the ow cycle as given in hcob 5jan61 0w limited theory what you handle is determined by what is real to the pc as shown by what reads on the meter if you get read it is the charge generated between the notknow and the know the pc must know something about it to have clash with the notknow on the subject if it is totally known there will be charge and read if it is totally unknown to the pc in the bank and everywhere else it doesnt register on the meter when the pc gets audited he will know more something that didnt show up before may well now read on the meter similarly the more pc knows about his own life the more charged up the bank will appear to be so you are always getting new withholds off the pc as areas of occlusion are located better it is not an endless situation since the pcs ability to find withholds and blow them increases at first withholds are few and blow slowly as the pc gets audited he gets more withholds and they blow faster and faster 195a figure 8 withhold manifestation scale openness pc just gives the auditor the withhold this is withhold that is not dangerous explanation equals lines in dispersal the withhold is seen as somewhat dangerous there may be unknowns in the explanation he might understand the situation but want to make nothing of it nevertheless it is an extenuating circumstance for some overt criticism equals the impulse to destroy the pc hopes that he can cause damage but is unable to do so the withhold is seen as rather dangerous it is not necessarily based on unknowingness he might understand the situation but wants to make nothing of it it is confession of an overt motivator equals being effect victim he has elected himself to be at the effect point the withhold is seen as superdangerous motivating is always based on unknowingness the pc knows that he is in trouble but doesnt really know why it is confession of an overt other peoples withholds the pc is not even on the causeeffect line withholds are seen as so unsafe that it is only safe to get off other peoples the pc is in total ignorance he doesnt even know he has bank or aberration on the subject 196 dont go for backtrack incidents with prepchecking the pc will just get mired down if you dont get this lifetime straightened out by getting ruds in on it he will get wins on it and have gains if you were crackerjack expert on 3dxx you could probably produce all the gains of prepchecking in terms of clearing up this lifetime blowing things into view etc but you would probably run into things like missed withholds which would make the pc blow and lots of outruds etc one of the things you could show the pc with prepclearing is that his ruds can be gotten in more details on prepclearing procedure and ruds l ron hubbard type 3 idate27262 volnum1 issue115 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec115 prepchecking 6202c27 shspec115 prepchecking dont take withholds you the auditor have and assume the pc has them this does tend to happen if you ask an auditor to list the withholds he thinks the pc has he will list his own especially if he doesnt know the pc very well you could take that list and check it against the auditors list of withholds and come out pretty close sometimes the auditor doesnt even realize what chain he is running he may recognize it afterwards this happens especially if the auditor doesnt take some time at the beginning of session to sort out the area for instance once lrh started from ptp then after 5 12 hours he realized that the subject of the chain was women once the auditor knows the basics of metering and repetitive questions trs etc and the mechanics of prepchecking he just needs to practice doing it until one day he finds it quite natural nobody can lay down what the pc will give you as withholds so you cant make it into totally rote procedure dont try to impose your moral code on the pc and dont let yourself get talked out of pulling withhold because it doesnt offend your mores when it does bother the pc 3dxx item that gives the pc pain is the pcs terminal an item that gives sensations and misemotion is the pcs oppterm to prepcheck terminal take whatever the terminals doingness is and get what the ow in the area is even if it is totally backwards eg the item could be moral man the zero question for this would be have you ever been moral you can get into the whole area of laudable withholds if the terminal was withheld all the terminals actions were also withheld there is also lot of withholding just in the laudable withhold area which could add up to withholding oneself from living more details on running routine 3dxx an item isnt winner it is only an apparent suppressor of other things and items there are two kinds of withholds for each terminal the withholds of dramatizing it and the withholds of not dramatizing it so if you dramatize the item you are obviously wrong and if you dont dramatize it you are wrong so you get withholds off both doing it and not doing it the easiest time to start to clear the pc is when the pc is clear of course now you have all the data you need to do it you know all about it but you have to apply the mechanics of scientology to case at time when you dont have all the data what you do have is all the rules axioms parts of the mind be do have etc you also have procedural systems like the withhold system to get what is keeping the pc from communicating but what are the withholds how are they formed up it is up to you to find that out you will find that if you give the pc good controlled session going right down the groove of something the 197 pc can talk about because it is on the chain of withholds the pc can talk to you about that are real to the pc as withholds and if you can keep the pcs attention directed and if you make the pc go on and look you will find that the pc makes his goal and gets gains test of whether you are doing well with the pc is whether you know more every few hours about what makes this case tick whether you have higher understanding of the pc and of the human mind that is what you would expect of prepcheck activity as well as the pc making his goals and gains if your prepchecking is bad it could be because your auditing is bad or it could be that you can audit but you cant prepcheck you may have been expecting the pc to grow wings during prepchecking if prepchecking seems very arduous to you you are probably not doing it right it is really easy when you are doing it well like riding bicycle it is easier than other auditing and gives more gains per unit of time than any other auditing l ron hubbard type 3 idate27262 volnum1 issue116 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec116 auditors code 6202c27 shspec116 auditors code the auditors code is to make auditing possible it is practical tool like most of scientology the auditors code was compiled in 1951 in wichita all of the points of the auditors code are empirical points the first theoretical code in dmsmh had greater appeal but was not the practical code lrh still favors it because it includes the idea that an auditor is courageous see dmsmh p 178 the first dianetic axioms were written in 1951 they are quite practical as auditing axioms and should be given more attention similarly with the prelogics the logics are interesting as synthesis of all education but there you are on theoretical material the mind as discussed in dmsmh is still what you are working with there is also some data in the original thesis that is very applicable to auditing the auditor as thetan plus the pc as thetan is greater than the pcs reactive mind etc the auditor cannot condemn the pc and expect the pc to overcome the reactive mind that set of formulas is what the auditors code was set up to put into effect the rules help the auditor avoid invalidating the pc as thetan and thereby beefing up his reactive mind the reactive mind is made up of machinery circuits and valences where machinery fits in is unclear unless it is the valence of machine circuit is specialized function of an identity or valence it is balledup automatic nothetan valence the thetan gave the identitywhichnowisacircuit orders for so long that now the circuit is giving the pc orders its the stuck flow mechanism the backflow the pc thetan has been resident in this body the identity giving it orders say to eat all of the mechanical actions of eating etc this has gone on for so long that the pc gets as backflow the idea that the identity should feed him so it becomes circuit this is all pertinent to 3dxx since all the things that make this life difficult went on in the lifetime of the earlier identity in an even more arduous and sincere way doubt that life has been lived and it is now neatly packaged as engrams ridges circuits etc all floating free longer located on the track package is the accumulated life experience of past identity 198 just as this present lifetime can get grouped the black v case in the same way you can have valence going into grouper and becoming round black ball circuit which gives orders does various things etc as we pull this apart we will find all the picture manifestations and mechanisms you have in engrams chains etc all present in that circuit that circuit belongs somewhere on the time track in relation to the other circuits but if it is part of the gpm it has floated free from its position on the time track and every moment of time is now time it is instant time hence your instant read on the emeter instant read occurs because there is need to look or think and key anything in to get the read that which reads with an instant read is already there and keyed in in an eternal present time the following data is pertinent the above plus the phenomena of matter energy space and time the association of incidents the confusions and the early axiom that life is composed of differences similarities and identities the mind resolves problems related to survival utilizing its ability to conceive similarities and observe differences dianetics the original thesis p 59 the analytical mind is that portion of the mind which perceives and retains experience data to compose and resolve problems and direct the organism along the four dynamics it thinks in differences and similarities the reactive mind is that portion of the mind which files and retains physical pain and painful emotion and seeks to direct the organism solely on stimulusresponse basis it thinks only in identities dmsmh pp 589 all time is identified with this time and we get all these identities giving pcs all these orders dictating all these reflexes and that is really all you are handling all the counterpoints of morality that do exist and have existed give us so many confusions and conflicts on rightness of conduct that we can then get people seeking right conduct until they go nuts most laws are passed to prevent earlier laws from being applied if you are an egyptian then persian then greek then roman if you set up rightnessofconduct circuit for one culture you will be nutty in your next culture your circuit will have points of conflict with current mores if you set up new circuit you have more new automatic impulses which have to cancel the previous ones etc etc overlaid and confused by the builtin stops after few lifetimes we may feel less than free unable to decide etc this wouldnt be so bad if rightness of conduct was light matter but we get into cultures where it is life and death matter then the solution may be to forget it all to notis it to say that we have only lived once to shove it under the rug but now having hidden the source of the nowimsupposedtos its even worse we go around getting strange ideas which we cant even stop feeling peculiar if it were just rightness of conduct that we were concerned about it wouldnt be too bad but the moral codes are usually enforced with somatics the somatic is most intimately connected in mental phenomena with rightness and wrongness of conduct punishment just the physical universe enforces punishment for wrong estimation of direction and effort for instance if one makes mistake in ones footwork one may fall downstairs rightness of conduct enforced with pain inevitably becomes an enforced conduct so these valences and circuits enforce rightness of conduct on the pc with pain as the enforcer the somatic we 199 try to run them out and get somatics the somatics appear so formidable that it seems we had better not touch the valence this protects it and allows it to keep up its flow of orders to the pc if you want to see how much command value the valence has over the pc note what he is saying doing and thinking in the few minutes just before you nail the item at that time it is in its highest level of restimulation its command value is extreme when it is found and identified its command value drops off but if it is also very unsafe thing that has tremendous withholds in its own lifetime if it is valence that keeps dropping out of the pcs sight and is unsafe to reveal the pc will dramatize it more when it has been brought to view he wont dramatize it much but he will still feel its impulses and feel upset about having the impulses that makes him feel very odd pc who is running his 3dxx terminal can find himself equating all his normal activities as being those of the terminal it can make him feel that he is on the verge of being found out all the time he is being it not being it and deciding he doesnt have to be it these are identities the person has been residual training patterns and facsimiles from those lifetimes every facsimile from that lifetime is in that bundle the pictures are there but smudgy and out of focus then as you try to run them you find that they have been laid in with tremendous cold this makes winter bad time to run 3dxx these black masses are drained of heat energy mostly however like cinders they contain occasional hot spots so you can get fevers off of them after death between lives people often go off into the ionosphere or into space where it is very cold here the track collapses and they get all their stuff keyed in because cold motion time every one of these bundles contains pictures in greater or lesser degree of decay the pictures are already burnt out and deteriorated to some degree and dont show up too well the pc may be disappointed not to have better pictures of those lifetimes this could be the way it goes the item itself was scarce so he made picture of it then because he didnt have the item but did have the picture the picture itself became scarce and therefore very valuable it could become so scarce and so valuable that the pc couldnt have it at all that is the condition of most of these circuits and valences at the same time the pc wants these pictures and has to have them he wont have anything to do with them and cant have them so you have nohavingness of the pictures so he uses the picture he depends on it to orient himself and to tell you what he is doing so he remains in state of godhelpus as you remedy his havingness and bring these things back prepcheck them get his overts off etc this state of affairs will improve persons havingness deteriorates to the degree he commits overts per the overtmotivator sequence only when an individual has done something to another can he receive the same action as an inflow fortunately it is not oneforone mechanism it is the sensibility of having done something that counts when you have done something to something you have cut down your havingness you get individuated to the point where it is their havingness and my havingness and therefore i can protect my havingness by destroying their havingness this totally overlooks the point that it is all your havingness if you destroy someone elses havingness you destroy your own because you have what others have havingness 200 as personal ownership is misconception you actually own that which you can perceive this has degraded down to the idea that you can only own that which you can personally use freedom of use is the final idea of havingness to lot of people but it isnt really the final idea of havingness at all that is why the communist and the socialist etc can make such an effect on society because he is talking on harmonic that is mockery of what is basically true all ideas of ownership are postulated ownerships nobody really owns anything except those things that one owns by the right of having created them therefore some people fall back on creativeness as the only way of life because it is the only possible way of declared ownership what they neglect to point out is that what the other guy made is theirs too community property is lower mockery of this fact i dont even know that you own everything you create you can continue responsibility for the things you create without owning them in auditing the problem is to understand what fundamentals are important and what are not fundamentals dont think all data are equally important the things mentioned in this lecture are the basic important things the importance of datum in relation to other data is the sole criterion of the value of the datum in all study one must evaluate the importances of your data relative to the purpose and activity you are going to do it is not enough to be learned and to know data to be wise you have to be able to relate data to actions people tend to make data of monotone value not all this data in dianetics and scientology is equally important but if you know the basic and fundamental data you can easily decide what to handle and how in session l ron hubbard type 3 idate1362 volnum1 issue120 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec120 model session i 6203c01 shspec120 model session i model session was instituted because auditors were varying patter to degree that session was hardly recognizable and because as early as 1954 scientologists were arguing about the proper way to do auditing there was need for standard way to do it also it was found that if all sessions were on the same pattern subsequent sessions tended to run out earlier sessions this has considerable value there is predictability because of the application and auditing thereby becomes better communication the rudiments value became extreme at the moment auditors began having difficulties finding goals and terminals rudiments in present form are less than four to five months old ruds began in 1955 having them in can make the difference between auditing and noauditing model session is tailored against clearing it is not tailored so much for prepchecking the ruds are vital for assessment since prepchecking takes up lot of the things found in the ruds there could be confusion between prepchecking and ruds rudiments can be used by the pc to throw the session if you use any form cf ow in the rudiments because the pc can now get into whole new channel of overts while you had some previouslystarted chains you wanted to get handled rudiments are vital to session they get and hold pc in session however they can throw pc out of session as well as into session if they are used to prevent pc from communicating with the auditor if the pc comes in with all the answers to yesterdays prepcheck questions he is already in session the process of checking rudiments can create an arc break if the pc is already in session the emeter wont tell you if the pc is in 201 session since the process of checking to see if the pc is ready can throw the pc out of session also the emeter will not register when the pc is so arc broken that the auditor has command value over him the pc must be way south very arc broken for this to be the case so before you start model session ask if it is all right for you to start the session if you get answer or you can tell that you will get reads on ruds pay attention to the pc get what is wrong before you expect to get much on the meter if the pc will talk to you pretty easily the meter will read if he wont it wont if the auditor rejects the pcs data that he is arc broken because the meter didnt read the pc will get arc broken with the meter the reason you start the session is to be sure the pc knows he is on specialized section of track that what is going to happen is not social relationship but that there is special auditor pc relationship to ensure that the special auditorpc relationship is in existence ask the pc if the session has started for him if he says give start of session again and ask again if he says again assume that it has started anyway and that the pc has an arc break with life somewhere the beginning rudiments are designed for the order of logical progress for session if you put ptp first you would be running session without goals havingness clearing the auditor etc for model session patter of this time period see hcob 21dec61 model session script revised the order of actions in model session tends to clear out the other things ie starting with goals tends to put him in session by putting his attention on his case having can clean up arc breaks etc you can put pc in session by clever use of goals in ruds if your definition of goals is broad enough the pc has some goal some hopeful postulate for the future which one has recognized or acknowledged even if the pcs goal is to die if you acknowledge it and grant him the beingness of having it he can then change it if the pc isnt giving any goals explore some future possibilities with him one way or the other find such things as what the pc is sure is going to happen in the session and sort out the goal involved with that dont go overboard as far as number of goals is concerned but get the pc to make some this presupposes of course that the pc doesnt come in already in session telling you something he really wants to tell you goals for life or livingness are there to differentiate from session goals this is not very vital and you never check up on it it is there to expose ptps of long duration if the same life or beingness goal keeps recurring you will know that there is ptp to take up if they dont contain problems fine this shows the pc that you are interested in him the next step havingness is easy to audit and beneficial for all concerned the pc will usually run it too matter what else he may or may not run finding the havingness process can take awhile but it is easy enough if you find one early in the pcs auditing it will be changed before too long so watch it closely the more complex processes will work better early on it is especially useful to find the havingness process early on if the pc arc breaks easily the havingness of the pc in the session is directly proportional to the smoothness of the auditing it is arc breaks that reduce havingness whether created by the auditor the environment or whatever when using havingness to heal an arc break be sure to flatten it run it for half an hour or an hour not doing it this way is why auditors dont have 202 reality on the fact that havingness clears up arc breaks they dont see that it is working stopping it prematurely can give the pc quite jolt dont cause arc breaks with havingness process for gods sake make it part of the process to inquire how he is doing during the process so it doesnt become signal that you are about to end the process an intelligent use of havingness would be to use it when there is shadow of dropped interest on the part of the pc less comm etc but it should not be used to interrupt the pcs insessionness the stable rule is not that you run havingness whenever the pc dopes off you can get the same read during assessment whether the pc is conscious or not so there it is not necessary you

session ii if your pc hasnt been gotten into session by the time you have run havingness the rest of the ruds probably wont do it for you the next step is often too steep gradient if the pc isnt already fairly willing to have you audit him ow has liability for getting the pc into session it can miss withhold throwing the pc wildly out of session dont use an arc break process to handle an arc break when the pc wont be audited it works to get pc who is somewhat out of session better in the rud will improve the pcs insessionness not create it the pc has to be in session enough to run process dont use havingness to heal an arc break except in extremis if you are using havingness to handle an arc break you will notice that the last thing the pc will point to is you the auditor therefore dont use are you willing to talk to about your difficulties unless you are desperate and there is nothing else to do or unless it is not heavy arc break just sort of cooler pc the pcs arc breaks always stem from from noauditing if he is still fussing and arguing with you he is in session enough to be audited but if he is totally absorbed in his case and not willing to talk to the auditor he is not in session missed withhold is an absence of auditing which creates an arc break in the withhold system it is the who should have known which gives you most ta because it points up absence of auditing to help get the pc into session during prepchecking since you dont want to run any ow run something like who would i have to be to audit you or the arc 61 process several questions about talking to people about difficulties see hcob 30nov61 arc process 1961 there is one process you can run that must be flattened and not get stuck in the second dynamic restimulation it creates touch my body part repetitive it is flat when there is longer any misemotion love anguish etc on it it does cure the pc falling in love with the auditor details on use of ruds in prepchecking and routine 3dxx sessions goals and gains let both auditor and pc know whether there has been progress gains is particularly for the auditor it gives the auditor wins when you end the session make sure it is ended if there seems to be any question ask has the session ended for you if necessary have the pc touch parts of the environment get him into present time then end the session not really ending the session 203 is not very serious error but it is very common one you can tell if the session is ended by whether the pc is still talking to you about the session afterwards or still treating you as his auditor

hcob 8mar62 the bad auditor and hcob 15mar62 suppressors person who becomes bad auditor has concentration on single ability like all aberration insanity is nothing else than an insane person does something to the exclusion of all else the psychiatrist errs in thinking that the conduct of the insane is insane when what makes it insane is the concentration on one area or behavior exclusively to an intensity that is contrasurvival if you did everything insane people do you would be acting sane this avoidance mechanism is present in everyone to some degree but the case we are talking about the bad auditor gets extreme reactions to running the revelation process see hcob 8mar62 the bad auditor there is an interesting approach to terror charge case that lrh used once he had the pc move to the beginning of track and scan forward to present time this got the pc stuck in the engram necessary to resolve the case which was where he was anyhow and the terror turned on so hard that all four legs of the couch started chattering on the floor the pc found and ran the incident and got the terror charge off if person can have as much charge as that imagine how much charge could be trapped in valence that is terrified through and through terror is the result of something having appeared engramically and then threatening to appear again an emotional charge always has an incident of physical pain underlying it person cannot experience misemotional charge independent of having received physical pain hence the term secondary if someone has the pain incident subsequent similar incidents can be associated with it and can restimulate the past pain if the pc hasnt become accustomed to such events one way or another he will suppress perception of the environment as being similar to the first incident and hence unsafe if the auditor is restimulator for the pc the pc will always omit pointing at the the auditor during havingness until he gets sufficiently familiar with the environment and aware of it to key out at this point the pc sees the auditor and breathes sigh of relief ie the pc finds the auditor the guy who has somatic and hence suppressor if asked have you ever had something happen to your stomach will say yes probably has the one who has had mysterious stomach somatic would say which is dead giveaway of the suppressor person suppresses environmental restimulators using the suppress in the original incident the original impulse to unmock for instance the car in the original incident is used to unmock the restimulator just before he was hit by the car he tried to unmock the car crunch it hit him anyway that made him lose but that same crunch later comes down to unmock the restimulators and the first incident appears to be unmocked thetan never gives up he has pictures of the car unmocked in the bank when you run it out you have to run out the unmock before you get the actual incident doing touch assist the time it takes to run out the suppressor is the time it takes for the physical pain to turn on if he wasnt suppressing and if he wasnt in such 204 games condition with mest here is what would happen the car hits him splat he hits telephone pole splat he lands on the road and gets run over by bus splat if he didnt feel so undignified he would simply have said splat splat splat and picked up the body uninjured the somatic would have run out instantly but because of his notis the somatic stays in place that is the source of disease somatics etc person goes through various phases of notis and persons impulse towards notis if failed can turn into an alteris his alteris can turn into notis and his notis into alteris so he can have suppression stacked with change and that is dubin dubin follows failed suppression below the level of unconsciousness dreams are dubins alterises of the things you cant notis when as an auditor you feel bit leery about auditing somebody you have entered into specialized field of suppression some auditors have difficulty only with certain types of pcs their suppression on particular type of being is the prevention of restimulator they are afraid something is going to appear they are suppressing something the result is to prevent the pc from talking to the auditor in thousands of guises the pc mustnt originate he mustnt give up withholds change get acknowledged etc there are zillions of variations of ways to produce this effect including premature ack eval inval overcontrol undercontrol q and etc etc all these ways combine to produce every auditing fault formerly the only cure we had was to keep the student at it long enough to run it out by gaining familiarity with pcs and discovering that they didnt reveal anything which damaged him some however never did get used to it they took the route of suppressing pcs about 20 about 30 got over it rather slowly and 50 rather easily with varying degrees of speed the length of time required in training is directly proportional to the number of suppressors you are trying to overcome in the student they are dealing with the root stuff of aberration of course there is likely to be revealed from the pc some restimulator in the likely event that this occurs these students will suppress the pcs comm the way to handle this requires drills and familiarization with suppression and finding who or what would suppress get these things sorted out to clear up the mechanism who is the person with the field black v invisible field etc its the person with tremendous suppression blackness is difficulty of recognition invisibility which is rarer is suppression of glass objects person with black field is more likely to suppress at night than during the day the person who is suppressing thetans also gets an invisible field whenever you suppress something in given timestream you of course suppress time so time becomes the primary suppression giving the instantaneousness of all time in the reactive mind because of the notising of the reactive mind everybody is trying to suppress some things normal survival conduct calls for suppression of countersurvival impulses we go down from that to suppressing things that are liable to appear thence to suppressing things that are likely to become known the withhold then suppressing things which are likely to think this gives lots of failures and invisible fields and various complications and automaticities of suppression it is only the person who has suppression of banks on total automatic completely out 205 of his own control who is dangerous as an auditor he wont let pc ever reveal anything so the pc gets stuck in everything he utters if process works today this auditor will drop it he will only run processes that are flat the auditor will q and goof only pick up safe withholds and miss all the ones that it could do the pc good to reveal which the pc is willing to reveal if asked this auditor is dangerous because missing withholds will arc break pcs and drive them out of scientology the auditor doesnt intend this he just intends to do good safe job where one gets upset or reveals anything in study if the person never lets the sense of the bulletin or tape to come through nothing will be revealed everyone to some degree has staggeringly bad memory thanks to their overts the person who has lot of overts is the last to be aware of it because of her suppression person will help another to the degree of tolerance he has for something being revealed this works into blackmail if you dont help ill reveal something about you the reverse is to help someone unless they are likely to reveal something that is the bad auditor and the bad student this is what keeps people from employing the technology even when they know it l ron hubbard type 3 idate19362 volnum1 issue123 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec123 mechanics of suppression 6203c19 shspec123 mechanics of suppression the axioms always have been way ahead of us trying to get scientology tech to catch up with them is tough job the axioms contain the basic data on suppressors under the heading of notisness notisness is suppressed isness it is the effort to put an isness out of existence running lies out of bank runs out alterisness and notisness alterisness is change it sits between an isness and suppression time mechanically is change cycle of action runs from nonexistence to an existence to nonexistence the first material on this is science of certainty see pab 3 certainty processing p 4 the earliest reference is to journal of scientology issue 16g this is scientology the science of certainty the somethingnothing process the cycle of action never entered in it was just alternate something and nothing used to unstick maybe most people consider maybe as an unknown though it isnt really an unknown except perhaps mechanically maybe is really the nomansland between the certainty that something is and the certainty that it isnt cycle of action can be stacked alongside maybe and you could say that change is maybe it looks in the reactive mind as though the middle of cycle of action is maybe so that all change is maybe and therefore if anything is changed maybe it isnt start change stop certainty maybe certainty we get new process out of the above the somethingnothing process it is hard to word this so that it is comprehensible to mind we have had trouble processing notis somethingnothing lies etc lies get into creating which beefs up some banks this new process somethingnothing which is class i process class i auditor is relatively unskilled and is only permitted to audit process that he has had success with on pcs see p 152 and hcopl 29sep61 hgc allowed processes 206 needs refinement on wording perhaps it is just it is it isnt repetitively if he is run awhile on this the pc will move on the track he will also before long deliver up his chronic somatic ptp current difficulty or whatever by applying the process directly to his case what you are doing is running him on the cycle of action you havent said whether the it isnt is vanishment or notisness but the pc will always run it as notis or suppressors so you are running direct suppressors and the thing he is most immediately suppressing is most likely to come into view his hidden standard or chronic ptp the thing he is trying to make up his mind about is something he has said it is about then not liking it has said it isnt this has left him in the maybe or whether it ever was is or will be you would get nowhere processing someone on maybe because basically there is such thing as maybe there is only creation and the conditions of the creation even when cycle of action has been completed it is still there as memory this gives the pc recording of the it is you never get pure nonexistence after an existence the only pure nonexistence was before the existence so this fantastically simple process can produce practically every other phenomenon in scientology it stems from existence and nonexistence which stems from perception and dontwanttoperceive which goes over into creativeness and destruction and wild bands of change in between most people avoid isnesses like the plague in the course of running the above process the uncertainty of the case blows off the openminded maybe case is the normal frame of mind for modern scientists they think lrh isnt scientific because he is so positive because he is not full of maybes scientists are always on the verge of something being revealed suddenly which scares them therefore they make bad auditors people that have lot of withholds dont want their minds to be invaded people are hung up in revelations the catholic church is against the idea of investigating the mind they are big on revelations which are all delusory modern sciences revelation is the hbomb but this is too big revelation so people wont look at it similarly with scientology it would be more successful to oppose the hbomb by cutting back the revelation to an investigation of the guy who pushes the button than to try to impress people with the whole picture of the hbomb with scientology revealing that it clears people is too much revelation you will have more success with do you have pain scientology would probably take quite awhile to do anything about that the person could confront that much you could run get the idea that there is pain there get the idea that there is pain there this would tum on the pain he could confront it because it is slightly on unlike his suppressed pains so he wont be faced with an unexpected revelation check every five or six commands to make sure he has followed the commands pains which appear in some previously nonpainful areas where the person has some malfunction will turn on he will be completing old cycles of action only two things can happen to person to have nothing appear and to have something appear so the two conditions of any game are appearance and nonappearance so we get the anatomy of games which is the context in which lrh originally studied this subject the opposing player in game either is or isnt the middle between it is and it isnt is what reads there 207 are all kinds of ramifications of it is anything can be represented by it the opposing player the team either team etc the amount of is the person can conceive compared to the amount of isnt the person can conceive finds the disagreement between the isnt and the is that gives the read all the meter reads on is the disagreement between the it is and the it isnt two valences in one mind can produce quite disagreement eg an atheist and presbyterian it is the disagreement that gives the read so in the case of the atheist and the presbyterian you will get big registry on the meter from either one because of the other on 3dxx you will get as much charge off running terminals as oppterms the whole mass goes out of balance when you discharge one but that one wont discharge totally until you can discharge the other why are they counteropposed it is because one says certain principles are and the other says certain principles arent and viceversa they are violently opposed you will find that this is characteristic of every gpm package you get identities which are opposites which make problems so all these isnesses are opposed by all these notisnesses it is heavily charged and violent because of all these disagreements you could probably put this theory into any process for instance you could make prepcheck zero question out of it have you ever considered that another didnt exist or have you ever insisted something was with that you would get tremendous number of overts since trying to damage something is trying to make it not exist and when you are creating something you are asserting it is every overt is an assertion that something is or isnt this is all very black and white unlike nonaristotelian logic which insists that positives and negatives dont exist it is true that there are gradient scales and that ultimates are unattainable but you would be speaking nonsense to say that positives do not exist though ultimates dont general semantics see alfred korzybskis general semantics and modern science shy completely away from positiveness and certainties as time drags out positiveness reduces the less concept of time person has the less positive things seem all you have to be is aware of the nowness of the instant and you get quite bit of isness and notisness coming in this occurs during havingness the walls seem brighter what happens is that the notisness disappears and is replaced by nonexistence it ceases being suppression and becomes so to speak an awareness of nonexistence rather than suppression of existence person sits surrounded by masses these are all notisnesses the first thing the pc would say about them is that they dont exist as he runs havingness and comes up to pt the walls get brighter and these things would disappear but when you run some people on havingness it goes from notisness to nonexistence on such clearcut track that as you run havingness on them and make the walls more real their bank materializes and they have people standing in the room you run off the notisness by running on the isness of the wall the notisness that pushed the picture into invisibility released as the persons reality on the wall increased you ran out the invisibility of the isness the people have always been there but he has notised them and has had to be quite careful about them all this time 208 the fellow whom you audit on and on who never gets any pictures is classic he is totally suppressing because there is something he is deathly afraid will appear you could make list of who or what would be afraid to find out oppterm the terminals etc as this ran awhile the dead bodies that he has notised would start to to show up sometimes someone in weakened condition will take his attention off these things for awhile and one will materialize and spook him he will say that he has been blanketed many people dont have time track they have only series of notisnesses these are the calm people hah there are some pretty hideous phenomena that can occur while running this out but continuing to run it will turn them off auditors used to get upset by this while running notknow they would get curious when the pc actually notknew something to the point of its vanishing and go off in q and and never flatten the process of course this was terribly restimulative on the subject of notfindout the notis button when the notis disappears the isness materializes and scares the pc to the point at times where the pc decides never to let that happen again the pictures that turn on can be more real than pt for awhile this is quite surprise pc gets afraid to find out when an identity in the bank has been asserting isness and somebody else has been asserting notisness various bank phenomena turn on and off and the pc gets stuck then he gets afraid to find out something is liable to materialize to appear this makes bad auditor he is just shaky on the subject of things appearing he can be gotten over it educationally andor with processing it is it isnt does it 3dxx would do it as would various prepcheck and notisness questions etc another method is change in the withhold system see pp 186 190 above also see hcob 21mar62 prepchecking data p 2 to use the withhold system on suppressors add appear before who this might even run an engram go when all appear and who appear is what might have appeared or revealed itself or should have shown up at that point or is there anything that didnt show up this mechanism helps get suppressors off the withhold beefed up in this way it might be strong enough to run an engram l ron hubbard type 3 idate21362 volnum1 issue124 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec124 prepchecking 6203c21 shspec124 prepchecking pcs attention can become so concentrated on particular part of the gym that he does not recognize that the gpm has some 40 or 50 combinations in it trying to get the pcs attention off the last combination you found and onto the next combination you have found sometimes takes some doing the gpm is areas of stuck attention on identities the pc ordinarily runs through this cycle 1 they didnt want it then 2 they think it is fine some items are hotter than others and explain more than others you have twenty or thirty items before you get to the middle of the gpm the ones at the middle are the last ones the pc finds 3dxx bypasses and cuts through running items by the process of finding items 3dxx gets the bank down to the point of what is holding the bank together it is rather difficult since it is over the pcs last hundred thousand dead bodies fortunately only 209 few of these items are remarkable the pc has probably been every item he puts on the list we are only trying to find the items that he is stuck with the process of listing keys out fifty to hundred of these at crack and we are left with the one that doesnt key out the gpm item the rest are locks on that what is holding that item is in some more basic deeper combination thus after you have found some more some of the ones you found earlier may drop out but only when you run the central package will you get rid of some of them the most horrifying ones the pc finds early on are liable to blow as locks later on though they may seem very important at first the reason auditors had so much trouble doing routine 3 for definition of this see p 34 above is that it is really much better though less accurate way of getting the actual package it reached deep into the gpm and the case and is more accurate when done absolutely right done poorly it was deadly to the pc running the wrong terminal was awful routine 3dxx doesnt require the some degree of accuracy and the pc shows continuous progress running it eventually too you get much more fundamental items than the original routine 3d items the object of prepchecking is to find chains of withholds and relieve them on the pcs case auditors seem to be having trouble duplicating this datum they dont seem to realize that you dont ask what question until you have specific withhold delivered into your lap auditors keep confusing zeroa questions with what questions see hcob 1mar62 prepchecking class ii skill the zero question gives you vast generality the zeroa question gives somewhat less generality the what question should give you more specific withholds not just generalities the zero question is about whole dynamic the zeroa gives generality it is not what question even though it can begin with what when you do get the specific overt then ask what about overt get when all appear and who if it doesnt clean up ask for an earlier one dont take something else which is vaguely similar but is not the same doingness run the whole chain of doing what you started on there must be an earlier one if it doesnt free on two runs through the withhold system chain gets charged up only because the first part of the chain is suppressed and forgotten finding the data of something will cause it to blow so if you have taken off the when the all the appear not appear and the who should have known from some incident it would blow if that were all there was to it all that will keep it reacting is some earlier withhold you can help the pc tell you by the murder system suggesting incomparably exaggerated overts so his dont look so awful sometimes you will hit chain which goes way back probably as part of the gpm you can still run it it just takes long time and sometimes your pc throws you red herring he gives you ptps and missed withholds in the beginning ruds this can lead you off on some new chain which has nothing to do with what you had started and left unflat the pc has moved into control of the session which enables him to stay away from some almost uncovered area sometimes you can get away with ignoring the outrud sometimes it is fatal dont in any case use withhold processes to handle an outrud in checking for missed withholds in ruds ask severely limited question sc you only pick up the ones between sessions 210 dont let 3dxx session become prepcheck session because of the pcs out ruds at the beginning of session if his ruds keep being out and needing repair take few days off 3dxx and prepcheck for awhile otherwise the pc will feel he is getting auditing if it takes more than three days to find 3dxx item you will never get it because the pc will be arc broken about auditing ruds will just go further and further out you can even get the pc to put his own outruds in by insisting that you are going to find his item this

prepchecking data 6203c27 shspec130 prepchecking data details on correction of errors in prepchecking pc doesnt prepcheck all the way to the bottom of the deck not all levels of pcs prepcheck prepchecking is not as broadly good an approach to all cases matter how lowtoned as the cchs or even 3dxx both cchs and 3dxx go much farther south than prepchecking which requires some responsibility for thinkingness thus 1 prepchecking takes responsibility for doingness 2 3dxx takes responsibility for existingness beingness 3 cchs take some responsibility for mass and repetitive action havingness note that this is be do have situation 3dxx and cchs both go further south than responsibility for doingness which is what prepchecking attacks it is odd that the beingness processes 3dxx go further south than doingness but it is empirically true that this is the case the reason fur this is probably that doingness is the main punishment factor in this part of the universe one will admit to beingness and havingness before admitting to doingness if you are having lot of trouble with prepchecking if you are not making much gain if you have tried for several sessions to find an area that produces ta without success you should run cchs the problem is not necessarily the pc it could be lack of auditor skill but in any case cchs will give the pc more case gain and more auditing it could be that the auditor is timid or that the pc is new and the auditor doesnt want to upset or embarrass him or the pc may be in the middle of ptp of long duration that is undisclosed the cchs will discharge ptps of long duration even if they are undisclosed or the pcs moral code could be so different from the auditors so far outof this world that the auditor misses the boat on it or the pc could have confidence in the auditors prepchecking or the pc has insufficient responsibility to respond to any doingness that will be handled with cchs cch2 is less embarrassing to start new pc with than prepchecking also 211 after an intensive of cchs the same things that didnt produce ta before will now give ta the only thing that breaks an auditors heart is getting nothing done so dont abandon responsibility for yourself by running things which get nothing done most auditor errors are from not flattening processes lrh doesnt care what you run on pc as long as you flatten it and as long as you get results if you are getting ta on something run it however running limited processes beyond the point where they stop producing ta is hazardous operation pcs sometimes get off lies and feel relieved that is just because you didnt get near their overts you should know how to crack the problem of social mores in 3dxx you get the terminals social mores by asking the pc what would be considered antisocial by the terminal you then use the mores to make up zero questions using the overt with the biggest meter reaction first you are liable to come up with the pcs oppterm and overts of failure to damage the oppterm pretty quickly so you have to find out if it is plus overt or minus overt ie whether it is what you would expect or whether it is from the other side of the fence every race every species having fourth dynamic tends to fixate on that dynamic and the thetans running those bodies tend to keep running those bodies as long as they are available but when the species got scarce or extinct they had to move over into something else there is reason you shouldnt have been an animal at one time or another it is actually quite relief you pick up your nowimsupposedtos easily animals tend to stay with their nowimsupposedtos because they cant talk about them that is the only thing wrong with being an animal as far as nationalities are concerned thetan transfer can really scramble things up say some indian gets new body as an englishman the us is now getting lots of exnazis exjapanese etc on the track the pc has often gone round and round on the greeceegyptpersia line getting all confused about his nowimsupposedtos however there is dominant moral code in the 3dxx package dont forget overts of omission as well as commission plus the fruitful area of makeguilty and being victim you could investigate the makeguilty aspect of any zero question to get his efforts to get motivator on the subject which would make someone else guilty of the overt if the pc tends to dodge into past lives to avoid his thislife overts when you get in endruds about halftruths untruths misses withholds etc you will pick up the avoided areas some pcs need lot of cleanup on halftruths all the time others dont you will get to know the pc and see if it is necessary dont use any form of ow to handle ruds in prepcheck sessions or you will pile up unflat chains and the pc will use ruds to avoid uncomfortable hot areas 212 l ron hubbard type 3 idate29362 volnum1 issue126 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec126 cchs 6203c29 shspec126 cchs the cchs were developed when the hgc in london was finding out that there were pcs that werent gaining and were getting results the cchs dont run things out the cchs familiarize the pc with control communication and havingness the pc does an upgrade on cchs in the teeth of the adage that the pc must be at cause actually there is gradient of causativeness from very slight at cch1 to considerable at cch4 the cchs are way to get the pc to sit there and look at something so he finds out he can confront it the pc becomes aware through familiarization that control communication and havingness are not necessarily horrible as the case goes downscale it gets to level where it is predominantly motivator and wont respond to anything else the person does not have an adequate enough idea of cause to be causative above that point persons cause can be increased easily below that point it can only be increased to the point of getting him to confront something going on someplace else that is where cchs take over instead of letting the pc run up further overts by being accusative and critical we get him to confront communication control and duplication just communication and duplication in itself gives case gain havingness is the concept of not being prevented from reaching or the concept of being able to reach havingness process is continuous duplication of being able to reach havingness wasnt quirk cch1 getting the pc to reach you enables him to communicate with the auditor it establishes the auditor as terminal this should get the pc being at cause he cogs that he can reach and will therefore communicate to you cch2 the pc has had his body running on machine for ages it operates all by itself cch2 lets the pc take over the automaticity of body motion that he has relinquished he does this knowingly cch3 this was developed to get the pc in the same communication time and space span as the auditor some people cant put dispatch on comm line because they cant tolerate distance on the line they always bring body cch3 gets the pc over the necessity to be touching something in order to feel in comm with it this is an effort at gradient how far can the pc be from the auditor and still be in comm for instance some people have to be there in person to deliver message cch3 lets the pc enter space into communication his causedistanceeffect has been one of minimal distance just causeeffect with distance so if the pc were in the auditors head he could be audited the pc gets the idea of communication by duplication cch3 enters space into the communication and some duplication the pc cogs that he can talk to the auditor and understand what the auditor is telling him to do keep it very simple the word contributed introduces the idea of cause you are gradually bringing him around to this idea that is why you ask if he contributed to the motion you dont care what he answers you are just planting the idea 213 cch4 you are actively asking if the pc is satisfied that he duplicated the motion its the pc who should be satisfied not the auditor necessarily if the pc is satisfied when he hasnt really duplicated the motion the auditors only mistake is to contradict or criticize him or invalidate him if the pc is wildly off but says he is doing it find simple motion the pc will duplicate so he doesnt keep making himself into lier every time or get off the misduplicated motion for two or three turns and then come back to it he will eventually improve it he will get better the above is the only reason why cchs actually work it is peculiar fact about cchs that they dont even require the pcs agreement or approval to get gains from them they worked in 1956 then got altered to point where they didnt work because they had stopped being run as combination which is as important as how each is done individually if pc gets run on cchs when they are not producing change he gets the idea that he is being punished so you run it to three times through with change then go on to the next cch it is as important for the pc to not mind doing it as it is for him to do it perfectly the pc will start nut doing them on the auditors determinism running just cch1 for hours with change doesnt offer enough randomity to cause change that is the trouble you get into tackling each one just by itself the pc will run for two hundred hours on cch1 with results an exception is that you can only run cch1 on an unconscious person similarly with touch assist engram running you make that body lie on that bed and others with an unconscious person you should also cycle through three or four processes do the rotation and the case will unsettle go through cchs to get them to bite there should be enough randomity in it so it will bite otherwise it might just go on and on the cchs unflatten each other they are run tone 40 upper indocs are vital training eg put thought in that ashtray helps the auditor get thought into pcs head that is the way they should be run they are tone 40 process ie cchs 1 and 2 you lay the commands into the pcs head not necessarily even verbally just command the pc without reservation the cchs are nonverbal processes they could be run on deaf person they are action processes with common denominator of solids not thoughts so do them when you are not getting ta on thinkingness processes for several sessions if discussion of auditing produces ta motion consistently put the pc on cchs the pc in such case is not familiar enough with control communication and havingness to be willing or able to go into session fairly easily the other pc who should get cchs is one who gets ta on tactile havingness cchs are not only for psychotics though they are the only process you can run on psychotic cchs reach far higher than was previously realized the need to keep doing cchs as long as they produce change and stop doing one when it produces change goes in the teeth of time and the physical universes q and you would think you should change one when there is change and not change when there is change but this isnt so 214 l ron hubbard type 3 idate29362 volnum1 issue127 rev0 rdate000 addition0

stage four needle but on the ta it is the case shifting between two valences this is not the same as ta motion it is sudden shift not gradual change if running cch turns on somatic you run it until the somatic turns off if it is not matter of somatics run cchs until the pc can do them all willingly and well run out gross changes somatics are the most gross little objections and raggedness are less gross if you cant detect the somatic by physical manifestations it doesnt exist for the purposes of cchs too many pcs dramatize victims and make up somatics etc if you wanted the greatest possible gain and the least possible blow on pcs who were pretty sensible anyway you would do ruds on the meter along with cchs this makes different breed of cchs when it is done this way you would ease up any tendency to blow and it would make it easier for the pc to stay in session on many cases you cant do ruds but if the pc is fairly upscale it would probably go better with ruds put in details on running 3dxx the pc is his terminal the terminal has pain on it and it is always facing outwards against enemies so you give him an enemy an enemy an enemy and he will get dizzy from too many enemies but on the pain phenomenon he is simply being someone else you wont get 3dxx turning on constant pain if the pc has the same pain grief or fights you for 20 minutes that is change but the pain must be something more than the pcs statement about it you must see some physical manifestation since cchs are nonverbal if the same grief or whatever has gone on for 20 minutes with change it wont just run out so that is why it is ok to leave it why the pain is on the pcs terminal it is just an observation however it doesnt seem too unreasonable that he should get pain as himself if he has created pain he will feel it as himself as the motivator that is highly probable you can run an oppterm flat sometimes and the pc will feel better the terminal will still be live on cchs 3 and 4 you handle pc originations but only out of courtesy you dont really care about how he says he is feeling because what you are running off can cause the pc to say the damnedest things most of them lies it runs out all sorts of countercreates verbal and nonverbal they will throw you all sorts of red herrings pc running cchs never originates he only dramatizes you dont have to get into games condition with the pc just run the process as an rfactor for cchs you can and should tell the pc what you are doing and why you are doing it as sort of rudiment to start the session try to get the pcs agreement before the session starts and then you run the session anyway after session you can talk about the cchs provided you dont evaluate for him if the pc wants to talk about them when cch session goes into screaming fits it is probable that the rfactor could have been established better you can tell the pc anything like its drill im gonna do it lets see if you can do it etc 215 dramatizations on cchs are closely connected to oppterms and terminals but nothing can be read out of it the worst the pc is sitting in will discharge because circuit is unable to 1 duplicate 2 have or 3 be controlled so giving someone control communication and havingness inevitably gets them into 3dxx items that are banging in and out usually there will be one major circuit that tries to discharge via the pcs dramatization the circuit he is sitting in cchs knock out the notis on masses he is sitting in and he will see them for the first time weird things show up from the vanishment of the notis heavy masses he has never had before somatics he hasnt felt etc he will move on the track in the valence he is in to more comfortable position cchs knock out notis you get an is the phenomena you see with the pc is the valence the phenomena that occur around the pc is the oppterm cchs also familiarize the pc with phenomena that he will encounter later on in 3dxx sensation that which is produced by reason of other beingness and dislocations of space pain alteration of form pain is produced by direct contact between the thetan and an identity fain is heat cold electrical shock combined the pc is always more directly connected with the terminal than the oppterm and thus feels pain he must be touching the mass with the idea that he is it in order to feel pain one of the biggest mistakes someone can make is to regard his body as self l ron hubbard type 3 idate3462 volnum1 issue131 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec131 the overtmotivator sequence 6204c03 shspec131 the overtmotivator sequence the solution to what you do with 3dxx items is the resolution of what makes the overtmotivator sequence there are processes that undo the overtmotivator sequence for long time lrh has wanted to undo it instead of running it knowing that it is junior sequence how could you live if you had to get motivator for every overt it is evidently very junior idea invented to prevent people from attacking if the only thing that ever affected anybody was himself ultimately one would have perfect alibi one would never do anything to anyone anyplace lrh knew the overtmotivator sequence was limited but he couldnt find the entrance point he must have tried 1500 to 2000 combinations trying to blow the thing as itself if you are the only one that affects you numerous things apply for one thing you wouldnt be able to keep the same time track as others so there is something wrong with the overtmotivator sequence but at the same time everybody has fallen for it and can be processed the overtmotivator sequence runs nicely when handled as mechanism to prevent people from attacking one process you could use is what shouldnt _______ attack what shouldnt you attack or synonyms for attack it could also be varied with couldcouldnt and havehavent if you got someone who was sitting in bunch of overts and motivators to list what they shouldnt attack you might get somewhere that was the leadin on the research level not 216 wanting to be attacked one tells others that they shouldnt attack you and what they shouldnt attack they do the same to you so eventually it looks like you have an overtmotivator sequence the most sensible thing in the world is that there are things which you in human body shouldnt attack the physical universe teaches the lesson that if you attack these things you get hurt this is basic learningness and it underlies all the overtmotivator phenomena when you attack mest you lose havingness then having learned not to kick paving blocks you have learned that what you do to others will happen to you this is actually not true at all it is merely philosophical extrapolation it goes back to newtons second law inertia which is physical universe law withhold is basically nothing more than your unwillingness to attack or to be attacked you could take any withhold person has and run off who shouldnt attack you about that or what shouldnt you attack in that way and the withhold will evaporate lrh never learned not to attack people have tried to teach him but they have failed he was once looking to see what on the track he felt worst about doing it looked for awhile as though doing anything to anybodys mind was the most destructive thing you could do there was some sense and workability to this but it proved not to be true it was the attacking of energy involved that seemed bad it is not even bad to attack energy its just that people have tried to convince each other that it is so you become allergic to energy the definition of being good is the same as the definition of being overwhelmed every fighting man lrh ever had under him was always in bad with other people at time when they needed fighting men the shore patrol only liked the people who werent worth damn of 100 men six or seven would be totally able competent active fireballs it bugged lrh that these were the guys who were always in trouble there would be dozens of nice guys who got commendations and bonuses but who were ineffective in action the world has built up series of superstitions about people the animal psychologists textbooks are full of them the mirage of oughttobe the message is beware of anybody who is active the civil defense manuals of the us government in the section on psychology has provisions to nab and put away anyone who gets active and tries to do something about the situation the civil defense system is based on the idea that there is thing called government that is composed of people they are going to take over the country in case of attack at the moment of attack one is supposed to do anything but be taken over by the government as early as 1941 lrh noticed that war is the antithesis of organization in combat it breaks down to the being the man on the job not the wellorganized machinery which actually is just men anyway if you are going to organize organize for chaos and count on the individual not some great third dynamic shadow individuals are quite destructable in areas of disaster so plans fall apart for this reason in space opera societies there were indestructable dolls incidently in planning something pin your schedule to event not to the clock 217 all the systems are geared to good people there is supposed to be some great reservoir of good people to draw on but where is it these people are supposed to appear and make everything go right then in case of attack they are supposed to stop anyone who isnt wearing their magic badge from directing or organizing people the people who handled civil defense in various war areas in chaos conditions arent even in the civil defense organization all you have got ultimately is being not punchtape card systems not magical creatures the individual is the building block they are either competent or not when an individual ceases to be able to run his own life you can always have some group idiocy like communism which takes responsibility for conduct out of the hands of the individual and give it to some godhelpus monster one way they think they will create the reservoir of good people who will then tell everyone what to do is to use selective breeding etc the basis of the individual is his ability to observe to make decisions and to act he has to be able to inspect and know what he is looking at and where he is looking he must be able to make sensible summary of it and be able to act in accordance with what he has inspected this is true of student soldier or anybody if any of the above abilities are missing you will get bad result in making anything from perfect government to more livable world the basic building block you are working with is always and only the individual then the question arises is he competent or incompetent can he do his job if someone cannot observe and make decisions about what he has observed he is in bad way you will never have workable utopia unless you have individuals who can observe decide and act if you go in the direction of system that isnt designed to make individuals it is system which will fail it will end in slavery and denial to the individual of the right to observe decide and act the only system that is justified is one which pushes people in the direction of observation decision and acting the reason for the form of the org is to create agreement amongst its members one odd thing about scientology organizations is that as people get their cases better together the organizations get more able to act on their own and at the same time to be more in concert to the degree that individuals can observe decide and act systems are unnecessary if we have systems that depend utterly on making people good without inspection or decision but only on some nowimsupposedto automaticities the systems will fail such system is only achieved by overwhelming person with energy showing him that he will get into more action than he can stand if he does not concur with the right actingness the message is we can create more actingness and energy than you can so therefore you better get into this small actingness it is the outcreate of action that brings about the fixed actingness that is known as being good you can thereby snarl people into line system only works in the direction of consulting peoples observation of things but the world operates on the basis of things like faith and discipline people fixate on the good action when the alternative is confronting some supposedly unconfrontable action when you have totally disciplined nation you have total failure this is the route to decadence people observe less and less this is how civilizations decay and become 218 old and decadent such society can be overwhelmed by any hostile energy mass that shows up since its people have been trained not to confront energy masses it gets licked up by any chaos the way an individual ages and dies is to give up his power of observation and decision and to act on the basis of not being able to do as much as he used to be able to do or to stand as much as he used to be able to stand he attributes this to advancing age not to being able to stand less the source of advancing age is being able to stand less aging is caused by lessening ability to confront action it is not that the individual cant confront as much action he ages because he believes he cant confront as much action the concern of an individual with action is 1 coaction 2 attacking energy or 3 being attacked by energy an individual is first as big as the universe and then he selects out half of it to fight and so becomes half the size of the universe and then selects out half of the remaining universe to fight and so becomes one fourth the size of the universe and then selects nut half of the remainder to fight and so becomes one eighth the size of the universe and i could go on and enumerate these steps but why should i when here you are your size in relation the universe is directly determined by only one thing the amount of randomity you can confront or the amount of attack you think you are subjected to or care to subject the universe to this determines thetan size it is how much you feel you can take on or how much you feel may take you on this is the mathematics of civilization say we have 100000 people at first one says i can take on any one or more of you who messes up they all feel like that at first then one day someone gets hurt and cant fight so he and some other weaklings invent justice justice says that when one person errs everyone else in the society is banded together against him as the government so its one person versus the government representing some tens of millions of people civilization is rigged in this way the thetan conceives this to be toomanyness so he is overwhelmed and obeys the law of the realm when you get old and creaky you subscribe to the idea of justice honest force is better then collective myth lrhs method of justice is not based on this will of the people it is based on his own preference for peace and order all goodness is brought about by force never by philosophic persuasion action based on observation and decision is fine action based on police threat threats from parents etc is something else true civilization would be based on observation the oddity is that man is basically good he gets synthetic bad valence that he can get into and then be bad every 3dxx item is either live that you have lived or your idea of somebody else the oppterms there isnt actually any somebody else in the bank all that is wrong with man is his imprisonment in evil but the evil is false we tell fellow that he is evil and convince him that he shouldnt attack because everything else is good this can be put as karma whatever you have done will be revisited upon you you will pay for everything you have ever done this isnt quite the same as the overtmotivator sequence which is 219 the rule that you have to lay yourself open to feeling bad about something to motivator by the commission of an overt that rule holds but only because there is an area you have conceived you mustnt attack the reason the wall is stably there for you and can trap you is that somewhere down deep you consider it sacred you have certain sacred valences they mustnt be attacked you have convinced everybody that they mustnt be attacked people get upset when you attack temple priestess or sacred cow actually however all mechanisms of slavery should be attacked the toughest valences in 3dxx are also mechanisms to prevent you from being attacked as you know you would be if your deed were known the idea is to have good nonattackable beingness the only catch is that we fall from the other nonattackable beingnesses around us the basic mechanism of getting people not to attack is to show them that attacking will hurt them that is the whole lesson they teach in war if the mest universe is still here it must be that we consider that it shouldnt be attacked otherwise it would have been asised and that is also why it can hurt you when you attack it sometimes it attacks and hurts you even when you havent attacked it eg when you are hit by lightning or cliff falls on you having learned the lesson that one will harm oneself if one attacks we get the overtmotivator sequence if you teach enough people this you will have civilization but they will all be enslaved they will all be trapped and none of them will be able to observe clearly or decide clearly or to act decisively sooner or later they will all go crazy that is really all that is wrong with the human mind the only real penalty of attack is that if you attack something it will disappear there is liability actually in attacking anything but there is tremendous liability in not attacking overt attack as opposed to uncontrolled attack left on automatic doesnt do anything except get rid of havingness if it was undesired havingness what is the difference l ron hubbard type 3 idate5462 volnum1 issue128 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec128 the sacredness of cases pandeterminism selfdeterminism otherdeterminism 6204c05 shspec128 the sacredness of cases pandeterminism selfdeterminism otherdeterminism why is your case sacred if it is sacred dont attack preserve protect survive now we understand theetieweetie case to theetieweetie case everything is sacred his attitude is mustnt attack it mustnt be attacked must protect preserve survive this attitude especially applies to his case that is the only reason anyone ever has for results in processing the secret of this universe is that it is sacred universe and shouldnt be attacked it is too sacred this puts every poor thetan who comes into it on shouldnt attack which has the result of putting attack on automatic there are three states of mind 1 pandeterminism one can control or attack or whatever one chooses on ones own choice on either side of the situation this gets into bad repute when it is confused with shady control 2 selfdeterminism this carries with it the idea that the other side of the group or situation is bad 3 otherdeterminism this nuts he is never for himself he is always for the other guy in any argument he is reasonable he will defend whatever you attack he claims to be impartial but he is not he is for whatever you are against 220 all kinds of conflicts arise with pandeterminism over how you will continue it people generally dont continue it but slop off into selfdeterminism politics is based on the inability to choose successor benevolent monarchy is ideal for example except for that problem any form of politics is only necessary because you cannot guarantee that good successor will follow benevolent monarch so existing forms of government are all out of pt in the future good king would be pandetermined but people cant guarantee that if he died they would get another one so they have to become specialists or fascists or whatever when government cant guarantee that you wont get choice of government by civil war you have an unstable government this is what sank the roman empire for the next thirteen hundred years you got the divine right of kings lineal succession etc this all resulted from the failure of the roman republic this is essentially asking the ge to take over the rule otherdeterminism is hard to see because it is lower scale mockery of pandeterminism this person is never selfdetermined always otherdetermined such person is not for himself if everybody is against you then you must be against you also otherwise you are out of agreement with the whole universe this is the first level of case that will give you trouble since he is not for himself being appealed to to run out his engrams to benefit himself wont have any effect all cases at various parts of the track get stuck in one of these phases periods of illness demonstrate this phenomenon people who are under heavy attack or heavy responsibility can get into it easily leader in war gets otherdetermined partly because of overts committed during the war the state of mind can differ for different areas of life and different activities only in the area where person is consistently otherdetermined do you have persistent somatic he is attacking himself so he can have somatic when we get to the point where the whole individual is pandetermined selfdetermined or otherdetermined we have chronic states of sanity 3dxx terminal can be in one of several different states 1 pandetermined you wont find it because it will never have hung up 2 selfdetermined it will be somewhat troublesome and part of gpm 3 otherdetermined it will nearly whip you because you can never help the pc in the vicinity of the otherdetermined valence people are most likely to keep and protect otherdetermined valences that are totally against their best interests it is difficult to move person on the track near one of these because every time you hit them they survive and the pc doesnt the pc is always the loser the pc will get very reasonable about the terminal he appears pandetermined and helpful but he is actually being otherdetermined 221 it doesnt stop there when you get into that area the terminal will attack the pc this accounts for the selfdestructive impulse in man death wish as in freud the world operates on the idea that everyone else is on kick of selfpreservation but they are not some are on succumb to an auditor or organization they look to be executioners we only get in trouble when we refuse to fill the complementary role the thing to do when someone goes around slandering the organization is not to sue him for slander but to present him with confession and an award of damages for having slandered all legally drawn up present it to him and he will go ahead and sign it and you can execute it in court the guy has only one enemy himself if you keep worsening the deal in legal matters he will eventually settle up in auditing dont make the prepcheck questions easier make them tougher since the pc will only buy things that make them think they are bad succumbing person in this state will make things worse than is actually true he will admit to more things than he has actually done when prepchecked this is the best stuff to audit since he is nuttiest where he is otherdetermined he is also hard to audit insofar as he is trying to succumb he will convert whatever you give him in the way of help into motivator otherdeterminism is successful sacredity an otherdetermined person has agreed 100 that certain valence or identity is something that shouldnt be attacked otherdetermined valences have as their least common denominator shouldnt attack and must be preserved if you wanted to be perfectly safe in this society what would you be your answer is sacredness item anything that you cant attack becomes an otherdeterminism never selfdeterminism to some degree all 3dxx items are otherdeterminisms and the whole gpm itself is an otherdeterminism that is seeking to destroy the person who has got it sacredity is trap if you operate on the principle of dont speak evil of the dead dont attack the dead you are essentially saying dont asis the dead and what you get is bank stacked up with the dead when you operate on the principle dont be mean to communicate with the sick you get sick this is the result of the idea that sickness is sacred anything sacred is safe and mustnt be attacked it is very attractive to become such thing and thetans do valence is sacredity shouldnt attack shouldnt really look at shouldnt comm with therefore you get more and more otherdeterminism the most sacred of all the pcs items will be the one of highest otherdeterminism and the one that is most destructive of the pcs own selfdeterminism if it cant be attacked it cant be controlled or reached havingness it cant be communicated with or defeated so it will completely determine the pc it will overwhelm him it is dangerous it is sacred so that is the key to the gpm the person is it while it destroys him it slaps the guy back with somatics every time he puts his head up or tries to be anything other than this otherdetermined valence 222 l ron hubbard type 3 idate5462 volnum1 issue129 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec129 asisness people who can and cant asis 6204c05 shspec129 asisness people who can and cant asis things that wont asis include 1 things you dont know about 2 things you cant communicate with and that cant communicate with you 3 things that are not asised because there is nothing there to do any asising an operating ge doesnt asis things so any mechanism that makes nothing out of the thetan is nonasisable thetan is nothing only in regard to mest attributes it still has abilities if you had something that made nothing of the thetans ability to look create do cause etc there would be reverse notis where instead of the person notising the item the item notises the the person that of course is the most dangerous valence religions often have campaigns to get rid of all the evil spirits earlier religions often admit the existence of nonmalignant beings spirits like leprechauns etc when religion has been totally successful it manifests itself in society where the spirit is totally unknown and there are spirits beware of that society it is pretty far south it is total overwhelm of you the thetan the soul is something you take care of an otherdeterminism which you send off at your demise to some pieinthesky sanitarium how is this manifested in our present world take the exact science of physics for example the first fundamental of elementary physics is the conservation of energy and mass this is very reasonable we cannot destroy or create energy and mass is really energy the question is how can you have an expanding universe with constant amount of energy why is there conservation of space wonder physicists go nuts they are dealing with something they can neither create nor destroy so it is sacred however you are likely to find times on the backtrack when you violated the conservation of energy if you cant do anything to energy time becomes inexorable time is postulate it is not monitored by the change in space of particles but one becomes aware of time through change of space of particles the physicist is actually just priest gone mad he discovers that the principles he has sworn to conservation of energy etc are bit shaky so he gets to be like boy whistling past graveyard this happens when he studies nuclear physics now he is trying to maintain one set of principles while experimenting with contradictory set so it is wonder that nuclear bombs are the main threat to civilization the first thing fellow who is in the condition the physicist is in would do is to destroy himself he is asking for an executioner we hear of the dedication of science which means all for science nothing for individual should have right to his own inventions patents belong to the university or corporation the scientist will accuse the scientologist of maintaining secrecy person in that condition is defending the sacredness the unreachability of the mind he thinks that there is nothing there to do the asising therefore those valences which you have the most trouble running out are those which deny the existence of the thetan because then there is one there to asis the valence the least asising situation is that of being an object 223 when you look over items to run the emeter will indicate not the toughest to asis but the easiest after it is run and the individual has increased his own beingness to the extent of not being what you have just run out now he can be assessed again and become aware that he is not quite the nothingthere valence it didnt read before but now it will register lots of vegetables and flowers read on the meter the more endurance there is in the plant the mestier it is the less it will register the greater the effort to survive something has the mestier it is tomatoes read more than trees so in the early stages of sorting out 3dxx you will get reaction on those things that should be run the pc is in the condition of notknow about them they are there but he isnt there this adds up to total overwhelm when you start differentiating items and nulling items the pc starts feeling that there is some beingness to them you at least have the pc in pt exterior enough to say yes somewhere on the track there is whizzer up to then he couldnt say whizzer was on the track because he was whizzer without being there at all until then all you had was whizzer not thetan plus whizzer or inspecting whizzer so assessing and differentiating these items leaves person more and more able to inspect and lessens his identification with mest because all these valences are composed of matter energy space and time and trapped postulates ie gpms have trapped postulates in them the person doesnt see himself come out of them he sees the ideas come alive so 3dxx is gradient scale of bailing someone nut the items which the pc cant asis are the ones where there is nothing to asis them with he is just in them but not there in them they just are and look to him like packages of mest when he first looks at them when you first encounter them he is that mest so your approach could be to notice doingness he has and to list who or what would oppose that from this he will get some item which he sees as an actual identity off his own past track you can find what opposed that continually getting him more and more able to observe these identities hence more and more aware of self so he can asis more that is why 3dxx gives constant gain if you are not getting ta action during listing on 3dxx you are not there and they are not there enough to have you there so nothing is asising at this point you can use cchs then the beingness of auditor and pc appear and there can be observation of an identity there is an extreme gradient of case state south 1 picking up future items 2 picking up pt items cchs cut in here 3 picking up present life items north 4 picking up past life items cchs cut the person in on this scale at pt with the identities of the auditor and the pc the pc gets higher and higher ability to differentiate between himself and the auditor op pro by dup run long enough gets the pc out of the body and able to observe the body doing the process op pro by dup shows the pc forcefully that he is not an it exteriorization by some more sudden process can shock him he will go back in into some other valence or something blowing him out of his head on an otherdeterminism is very unstable if you exteriorize someone on your determinism he wont remember it or he will invalidate it 224 because he cant have not being thing 3dxx is an exteriorization process with very gentle gradient the last item to come off is the most sacred the one which was him it is not something that can be in any way characterized described it is just how does person get so interiorized he asserts that an identity or an object will react that is the clue to all future interiorization this is the first gradient on the overt motivator sequence if you do something this paper will react then it will do something to you l ron hubbard
