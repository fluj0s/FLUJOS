the present report first provides background it then summarizes 15 findings from the longer report that show the role of production and present investment people and technology problems facing production last it examines alternatives for maintaining the stockpile and discusses the relationship between the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt and weapons research development and production related topics such as arms reduction agreements environmental issues at the production plants and laboratory issues per fall largely outside the scope of this report this report will help congress in considering 1 annual funding for production in the national defense authorization bill and the energy and water development appropriations bill and 2 us ability to maintain nuclear weapons for the long term critical issue in hearings and debate on the ctbt that may occur in 1998 and 1999 this report is most appropriate for staff with an interest in nuclear weapons production though parts of it

all by jonathan medalia nuclear weapons production capability issues summary of findings and choices summary the united states shows every intention of retaining nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future thus committing itself to maintaining their safety reliability and performance maintenance requires rd and production while the former require ment is well understood the latter is not this report provides information on production and associated investment people and technology issues production is done for many reasons problems with existing warheads have historically emerged over time and seem likely to do so in the future warhead maintenance requires modifications life extension programs replacement of defective components disassembly and reassembly for surveillance and similar activities plants and labs make complementary contributions to production it appears that all five nuclear weapon states perform maintenance and that all but the united states produce weapons of new or existing design production as any industrial process requires ongoing investment in planning budgets for the plants doe attaches highest priority to production operations because they are fundamental to its ability to support the stockpile this priority though has led doe to defer some longerterm investment in such areas as maintenance facility upgrades infrastructure and equipment such deferral impedes work at the plants at the same time doe is investing in some technology and other programs to aid the plants production depends on people there are adverse demographic trends among scientists and engineers at the plants trends for skilled trades personnel are potentially more serious negligible hiring of new personnel and the initial hiring of most current personnel between 1977 and 1981 raise the prospect of mass retirements in decade or so while the plants mission is weapons work nonweapons work helps them retain staff members and maintain and develop their skills the labs and plants are developing vast amounts of weaponsrelated technolo gies the plants focus is on evolutionary advances in products and processes that of the labs on revolutionary advances this technology has profound impact two examples software is changing how nuclear weapon components are designed engineered and produced with computer models becoming the medium for conducting and linking these steps and new technologies and declining work volume are changing the skill mix needed for production often requiring trades workers to increase skills new technology holds differing implications for different groups the united states has signed the comprehensive test ban treaty some who would abolish nuclear weapons support the treaty and reject all but an interim low level weapons maintenance effort others believing that this nation can obtain the confidence it needs in weapons only through nuclear testing would reject the treaty support more effort on weapons maintenance and resume testing there appears to be confluence of interest between many who favor the treaty and many who would increase effort on weapons maintenance as the two are arguably

and ctbt 32 nuclear weapons production capability issues summary of findings and choices introduction congress and the president have made clear that the united states will retain nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future whether or not the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt which this nation and 148 others have signed enters into force1 as part of its effort to maintain these weapons the department of energy doe is conducting twopart program called stockpile stewardship and management or ssm2 its rd element is sciencebased stockpile stewardship the production element is stockpile management the role of rd in maintaining weapons has at tracted much attention3 that of production has not rd may discover the need for and guide weapon modifications and such weapon maintenance activities as refurbishments repairs life extension programs and replacement of components at the end of their service lives but production is needed to implement them this report seeks to explain and clarify production issues that congress may consider this chapter first provides background it then presents four main points 1 production is needed to maintain nuclear weapons and is done in the united 1 presidential decision directive of november 1997 affirms for example that the united states will continue to rely on nuclear arms as cornerstone of its national security for the indefinite future according to robert g bell special assistant to the president and senior director for defense policy at the national security council r jeffrey smith clinton directive changes strategy on

this report is slightly modified version of the first chapter of longer crs report4 does office of declassification reviewed that document and found it to contain doeclassified information background in 1992 congress directed that the united states pursue ctbt and tempo rarily halt nuclear tests5 president clinton extended the moratorium three times and vigorously sought ctbt multilateral negotiations at the conference on disarmament cd in geneva began in january 1994 and produced draft treaty acceptable to all cd members except india in august 1996 the general assembly adopted the treaty in september 1996 by vote of 158 to 3 as of june 1998 149 nations including the united states had signed it and 13 including france and the united kingdom had ratified it its key obligation is not to carry out any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion6 although the united states observes ban on nuclear testing congress and the president plan to retain us nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future and to maintain confidence in the safety reliability and performance of these weapons in july 1993 the president stated to assure that our nuclear deterrent remains

stewardship which the president reaffirmed in august 1995 i consider the maintenance of safe and reliable nuclear stockpile to be supreme national interest of the united states i am assured by the secretary of energy and the directors of our nuclear weapons labs that we can meet the challenge of maintaining our nuclear deterrent under ctbt through science based stockpile stewardship program without nuclear testing9 in announcing at that time his decision for zeroyield ctbt president clinton set forth six safeguards unilateral actions the united states would take to enhance its security consistent with the treaty on which he conditioned the decision all of them relate directly or indirectly to stewardship in brief they are safeguard conducting science based stockpile stewardship program b maintaining modern nuclear laboratory facilities and programs c maintaining the basic capability to resume nuclear testing d continuing to improve us treaty monitoring capabilities continuing programs to ensure complete information on nuclear weapon and related programs worldwide and f the understanding that the president in consultation with congress would be prepared to withdraw from the ctbt under the standard supreme national interests clause in order to conduct whatever testing might be required if serious problem developed in critical warhead type that could not be resolved without testing10 congress has consistently supported and funded programs to maintain nuclear weapons senate resolution of january 1996 stated in part the united states is committed to

updated regularly by amy woolf according to norris and arkin the term stockpile refers only to those nuclear warheads held in defense department custody the stockpile contains three categories of warheads those with active operational forces usable in minutes or hours along with spares kept at the bases where nuclear weapons are deployed augmentation or hedge warheads not necessarily associated with active nuclear delivery systems and reliability replacements kept in storage there are also retired warheads and pits and strategic reserve of pits and secondaries robert norris and

some believe that does ssm program can maintain weapons while others hold that amount of resources for maintaining weapons without testing can provide the assurance that testing does and would reject ctbt these alternatives and others were detailed in the 1995 crs report cited above the present report has much narrower focus nuclear weapons production within the current policy assumptions that the united states will 1 enter the ctbt or continue its moratorium on nuclear testing if the treaty does not enter into force and 2 retain and maintain its nuclear weapons for the long term without testing doe is developing its ssm program to maintain weapons without testing it defined the program in july 1995 as follows stockpile stewardship includes activities required to maintain high level of confidence in the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons in the absence of underground nuclear testing and to be prepared to resume nuclear testing if so directed by the president stockpile management activities include dismantlement maintenance evaluation and repair or replacement of weapons and their components in the existing stockpile17 any program to maintain weapons is sure to rest heavily on an extensive program of nuclear weapons science and technology because that is the only way to perform certain essential tasks without testing monitoring warheads in the stockpile conducting experiments to investigate nuclear weapons physics and supply data for computer models evaluating problems that emerge with warheads over time devel oping computer models to predict and help solve problems modifying designs or veloping new components materials and processes to solve problems certifying that new or rebuilt weapons will function as intended and more most in congress and elsewhere accept this sciencebased approach as necessary if the stockpile is to be maintained without testing though some doubt that any nontestbased method can work the role of production in maintaining the stockpile is far less well understood for several reasons doe has emphasized the role of rd in maintaining the stockpile policymakers arguably are more familiar with science than with manu facturing and the practical meaning of production has changed during the cold war the term referred mainly to the manufacture of large numbers of warheads of new design now it consists of activities that require facilities for such industrial processes as component manufacture warhead refurbishment dismantlement of warheads being retired and others described beginning on page 10 does

description introduces key terms and shows the relationship between weapon components modern nuclear weapons have two stages short distance apart that metal radiation case encloses in the primary stage layer of chemical explosive surrounds hollow pit containing fissile uranium235 plutonium239 or both as well as nonfissile materials detonating the explosive creates an implo sion wave that compresses the pit making it go supercritical neutron generator injects neutrons into the compressed pit initiating nuclear fission explosion hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium are inside the pit the heat of the fission reaction makes them undergo fusion releasing more neutrons that enhance the fission reaction and boost explosive yield sharply the secondary stage containing lithium6 deuteride and uranium adds most of the yield20 xrays from the primary explosion flow inside the volume enclosed by the radiation case to the secondary they transfer energy to compress and ignite the secondary causing fusion of tritium generated from lithium6 and deuterium fusion releases energy and produces high energy neutrons that fission more uranium the nuclear weapons complex the department of energy owns eight sites for research development testing production and assemblydisassembly of nuclear weapons their components and their materials each is operated by contractor four sites focus on rd

with the former producing detonators and preparing to produce pits and the latter preparing to produce neutron generators nuclear tests were conducted at the nevada test site the last us test was conducted there in 1992 now the site is in standby mode it is maintained in way that it could conduct nuclear test within two to three years of receiving notice to do so but in the event of high

work is purifying tritium22 should the united states build new linear accelerator to produce tritium it would be located at srs the main role of the pantex plant in texas during the cold war was final assembly of nuclear weapons it mated high explosives to plutonium components and then combined the resulting element with other weapon components it also disassembled and dismantled weapons disassembly refers to taking weapon apart for inspection replacement of components refurbishment etc with view to subsequent reassembly dismantlement refers to taking weapon apart in the course of retiring it now most of its effort is spent on dismantlement of weapons storage of plutonium components and disposal or reshipment of other components and materials it also monitors weapons in the stockpile the end of the cold war resulted in sharp cuts in the nuclear weapons complex the number of sites dropped from high of about 14 to the current eight23 nuclear weapons work halted at several large sites notably hanford wa pinellas fl mound oh and rocky flats co the number of people working in the weapons complex rose from 53859 in fy1986 to peak of 57935 in fy1990 then fell to 24384 in fy1997 and 23874 projected in fy199824 as specific illustration 21 information provided by department of energy office of defense programs in telephone conversation with the author december 8 1997 22 tritium radioactive isotope of hydrogen is an essential ingredient of modern nuclear weapons without it their yield would be much less than the design specification the united states has not produced any tritium since 1988 it decays radioactively to helium3 at rate of 55 percent year accordingly there is need to purify it remove the helium3 to maintain weapon performance and to produce new tritium 23 the figure of 14 was provided by department of energy albuquerque operations office november 3 1995 the years in which the complex had this number of sites was not specified but was probably in the

secondary and case component fabrication at y12 and fabrication of nonnuclear components at kcp doe report of october 1997 updated the program its strategies and its accomplishments it noted today the program is characterized by three integrated strategies or phases of stockpile stewardship they are surveillance predicting and detecting problems assessment and certification analyzing and evaluating effects of changes on warhead safety and performance and design and manufacturing refurbishing stockpile warheads and certifying new parts materials and processes it further stated the accelerated and greatly expanded use of strategic computing and simulation tools is the fundamental innovation of this recent evolution of the program33 it continued the approach of retaining but downsizing the plants as noted earlier doe changed terms in 1997 stockpile stewardship and management became stockpile stewardship as this report focuses on production it retains the earlier terminology to help differentiate between production and rd organizational aspects of stockpile stewardship and management the department of defense dod is responsible for developing the us nuclear deterrent strategy and if need be for executing it in this role it is does customer outlining the actions it needs doe to perform in order to meet dod needs during the cold war dod would specify military characteristics for doe to meet in designing warhead these included weight yield safety requirements etc and by reference to the stockpile to target sequence document that specified temperature cycles shock vibration and other conditions warhead might encounter defined the environments warhead would have to survive and the abnormal conditions in which it would have to remain predictably safe now dod has requirements for newdesign warheads for the foreseeable future and the united states has signed the ctbt this shifts the doddoe relationship from developing and producing new warheads with nuclear testing to maintaining and modifying existing ones without such testing for example dod has set requirements for an assured supply of tritium to support the stockpile for the development of the b6111 bomb to replace the b53 bomb see page 12 and for safety study for each warhead type every five years the president has established requirement for an annual certification for warheads and has set conditions under which the united states might resume nuclear testing both require reporting 32 continued 1996 6801468026 and department of energy final programmatic environmental impact statement for stockpile

presidents signature that specifies how many warheads of each type shall be in the us stockpile it also among other things develops stockpile options and their costs identifies options for scheduling of nuclear weapons production and considers safety issues for existing and proposed weapons34 it can make decisions such as scheduling tasks for weapon life extension programs within the constraints of the nuclear weapons stockpile memorandum35 much of the councils work is done by its standing and safety committee its main mission is to advise and assist the nwc and to coordinate and provide

this report is taken broadly to mean any industrialtype activities performed on nuclear weapon from or destined for the stockpile as well as on its components or materials these activities include but are not limited to fabrication of components modification of warheads replacement of components or materials the assembly of components into warheads as part of life extension 34 the nuclear weapons council was established by pl 99661 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1987 sec 3137 100 stat 40654066 35 the office of program analysis and financial management in does office of defense programs provided the following information to the author april 1 1998 the secretaries of energy and defense are required to submit nuclear weapons stockpile memorandum nwsm to the president annually the memorandum transmits draft presidential decision directive containing the requested nuclear weapons stockpile quantities for the current year and five planning years along with the departments strategy for maintaining and supporting the stockpile the table of stockpile quantities in the presidential decision directive is called the nuclear weapons stockpile plan crs11 programs dismantlement of warheads for subsequent disposition disassembly of warheads for modification or for detailed examination and nonnuclear testing and subsequent reassembly remanufacture of copies of warheads to more or less the original specifications and modification of warheads for flight tests the hallmark here is physically changing warhead or component from or destined for the stock pile or changing materials into such warheads or components as distinct from performing rd developing computer models or building prototypes production activities would also include making complete warheads for deployment but the united states cannot do this at present for reasons noted on page 8 production capability is taken here to mean the ability to produce one war reserve warhead or component it is distinct from capacity which refers to rate the number of units that can be produced in given time current usage of two terms is imprecise warhead refers to the complete nuclear explosive device including its case arming and firing system and so on delivered by missile or artillery it sometimes includes nuclear gravity bombs as well in current usage weapon means warhead or bomb as in nuclear weapons complex or an aircraft or missile for delivering them this report uses weapon in all instances to mean warhead or bomb and uses warhead to mean warhead or bomb except where the context makes clear that the reference is only to missile warhead what are new weapons and weapons maintenance and what difference do the terms make definition is possible for two terms that appear throughout this report new weapon and weapons maintenance because the terms are themselves weapons in struggle over the role and future of nuclear weapons the debate over the definitions which masquerades as matter of semantics cloaks this larger struggle opponents of new weapons and advocates of weapons maintenance are at opposite ends of the debate all would view weapon of brandnew design with new desig nation number w97 b102 as new weapon all would view remanufacturing component to identical specifications to replace aged units as weapons maintenance in between spectrum of activities might or might not depending on ones point of view produce new weapon or maintain weapons policy treaties interpretation and criticism may frown upon new weapons accordingly those who would delegitimize the use of nuclear weapons shrink the stockpile and abolish these weapons as soon as possible here called denuclearizers use new weapon inclusively in hopes that broadening the list of new weapon activities will narrow the scope of us weapons activities those who see strategic value in the nuclear stockpile for the foreseeable future and would maintain weapons in ready reliable state here called maintainers use weapons maintenance inclusively if new weapons are only weapons of completely new design from top to bottom then modifications life extension programs and so on may proceed because new weapons and weapons maintenance intersect many of these groups core issues definitions of these terms are pivotal for both groups crs12 denuclearizers would agree with the statement by dod setting as dod requirement to doe newdesign nuclear warhead production36 they criticize some rd and production activities on grounds that they are leading to new weapons despite this requirement maintainers counter that the same dod statement also requires doe to maintain capability to design fabricate and certify new warheads and to demonstrate capability to refabricate and certify weapon types in enduring stockpile37 two dod officials emphasized that the statement on production of newdesign warheads is not ban on production of such warheads and that dod does not want to foreclose production of them rather dod has military requirement for warheads of totally new design at present so there is need for doe to produce them38 denuclearizers respond there is currently such military requirement partly because policy facto opposes new warhead types on two seemingly contradictory grounds such warheads would provoke criticism that the united states sought to evade the spirit of the ctbt and would probably be unacceptable to dod without testing denuclearizers favor first use of nuclear weapons yet see some new weapons or modified ones able to perform new missions as more usable main tainers believe that if weapons are not usable they can scarcely be credible as deterrents case at issue is the b6111 bomb this project modified the case of an older b61 version to enable it to penetrate the earth thus increasing the damage it can do to buried structures it replaces the b53 an older bomb with much higher yield that does not meet current standards on safety use control etc denuclearizers see the b6111 as new bomb designed to do new mission39 maintainers extend weapon maintenance to cover stockpile maintenance and see the b6111 as needed to permit retirement of the b53 by retaining in the stockpile the latter weapons capability even as the b6111s reduced yield makes it more usable40 denuclearizers want to extend the ctbt beyond its basic obligation of conducting nuclear explosions to include what they see as its original purpose stopping weapons development they want to proscribe rd and production activi ties leading to new weapons they claim that advances in technology enable

new weapons without testing subverting the ctbt they could not make this claim if new weapons covered only warheads of entirely new design it is generally agreed that such warheads require testing because an allnew untested warhead entails too many uncertainties for the labs to certify dod to accept or congress to fund maintainers counter that the basic ctbt obligation cannot be stretched to mean more than what it says because the denuclearizers interpretation is at odds with the nuclear weapon states intention to maintain their weapons which requires rd and production maintainers see confidence in weapon reliability as essential to credibility and believe that if weapons are to be maintained in reliable condition changes to their design materials and production processes are inescapable for example the warhead protection program aims to redesign warheads for submarinelaunched bal listic missiles to make them less sensitive to aging certifiable without nuclear testing producible by current or future processes and so on denuclearizers see this effort as design leading to production of new weapons maintainers see it as maintenance denuclearizers attack work on new weapons or even the maintenance of existing ones as contrary to the obligation the united states assumed in signing the nuclear nonproliferation treaty each of the parties to the treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament and on treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control article vi if the united states cannot honor its own obligations in this area they ask how can it take the lead in asking others to desist from nuclear proliferation maintainers counter that the nuclear arms race has effectively ceased the united states and russia are rapidly reducing their nuclear stockpiles and the world is not pursuing complete disarmament seriously if at all they believe that us nuclear forces help deter nuclear proliferation on grounds that abolition or even deterioration of these forces would magnify the advantage potential adversaries would gain from possessing few weapons and could lead us allies to hedge against that risk by developing weapons of their own they agree with us policy viewing nuclear weapons as of value in deterring possession or use of chemical and biological as well as nuclear weapons41 this form of deterrence requires in the 41 three statements on this policy follow 1 even if we could ignore the russian nuclear arsenal entirely there are unfortunately range of other potential threats to which nuclear weapons are deterrent one cannot survey the list of rogue states with potential

article robert bell special assistant to the president and senior director for defense policy national security council said clintons nuclear targeting directive reflects much greater sensitivity to the threats posed by chemical and biological attacks since the previous directive was issued in 1981 but he added that it only reiterates what senior administration officials already have said about the issue during the past year namely continued crs14 maintainers view that weapons be credible both in terms of readiness which requires maintenance and usability different groups use the terms to their advantage for antinuclear activists condemning new weapon is more fruitful for mobilizing protests gaining media attention and generating public interest than pointing out minor modification similarly nuclear weapons complex managers describe their work as weapons maintenance or stockpile maintenance terms that seem more benign than building new weapon the longer report presents in detail with many references the 15 findings that support the main points these findings are summarized next findings on production 1 problems with existing warheads have historically emerged over time and seem likely to do so in the future if current warheads were perfectly designed and built and retained their initial physical condition indefinitely then the united states would not need to make an effort to maintain them however agerelated changes such as cracks in components and decay or corrosion in materials may impair warhead safety reliability and performance warheads sometimes have design or production flaws that are not discovered until many years after deployment or vulnerabilities revealed by improved understanding of potential accidents these problems ultimately can be expected to occur more often because warheads will be deployed far beyond the length of service for which they were designed drop in the number of warhead types in the postcold war stockpile can be expected to increase the fraction of that stockpile affected by problem with one warhead type without production the united states would have to choose between continuing to deploy unsafe unreliable or ineffective warheads or retiring them 2 warhead maintenance and modification require substantial production work which is done on an ongoing basis warhead production is limited in scope because doe cannot produce complete warheads of 41 continued that if any nation uses weapons of mass destruction against the united states it may forfeit its protection from us nuclear attack under the 1995 pledge r jeffrey smith clinton directive changes strategy on nuclear arms washington post december 7 1997 10 the pledge by the united states britain china france and russia as paraphrased in the washington post article was that those nations would not use nuclear arms or threaten their use against countries that are not trying to develop or acquire nuclear arms ibid 3 if any nation were foolish enough to attack the us its allies or friends with chemical or biological weapons our response would be swift devastating and overwhelming as secretary perry said in 1996 we are able to mount devastating response without using nuclear weapons nevertheless we do not rule out in advance any capability available to us edward warner iii assistant secretary of defense strategy and threat reduction prepared statement before the strategic forces subcommittee senate armed services committee hearing on nuclear deterrence march 31 1998 p 9 crs15 new or existing design as noted earlier this is source of concern to dod42 production is limited in quantity because the stockpile is smaller than it was decade ago yet large production effort is ongoing or scheduled in the near term for seven of the nine types of warheads in the enduring stockpile43 several examples illustrate the scope of production the b6111 bomb is new modification to some existing b617 bombs so they can penetrate the earth and detonate underground44 kcp and y12 are producing new case tail ballast aircraft attachment mounts and similar components for this bomb refer to pages 68 for description of labs and plants in the nuclear weapons complex pantex maintains some warheads by disassem bling them replacing old components with new ones and reassembling them it disassembles and reassembles other warheads to conduct surveillance it dismantles warheads that are excess to us needs reservoirs hold tritium and deuterium in nuclear warheads they must be replaced from time to time kcp is producing reservoirs of new design savannah river site is cleaning and filling them life extension program underway for the w87 warhead will rebuild the warheads to refurbish them and enhance structural integrity y12 and kcp are producing parts pantex uses them to replace old parts in rebuilt w87s joint test assemblies transmit data on warheads performance during flight test kcp and y12 produce components which pantex assembles warheads to be flight tested are returned from the field to pantex which disassembles them removes the nuclear explosive com ponent inserts the joint test assembly and reassembles the warhead as test unit there are some laboratory production assignments such as neutron generators sandia and detonators and pits alamos the labs are also responsible for the design and reliability of modified and existing weapons thus production involves the entire nuclear weapons complex and is done for many purposes 3 the other four nuclear weapon states seem certain to continue warhead productionrelated activity for as long as they have warheads united kingdom once gravity bombs are withdrawn from deployment by the end of 1998 the only deployed uk warheads will be on trident submarinelaunched ballistic missiles these warheads are currently being produced to maintain its weapons and weapons complex once serial production of these war heads ends britain is focusing on an expanded experimental program to address future weapons problems and attract top scientists ongoing maintenance of trident warheads and perhaps continuing production as needed to maintain stockpile levels 42 the nuclear posture review contained requirement that doe be able to demonstrate the capability to refabricate and certify weapon types in the enduring stockpile the new weapons complex regardless of its structure must be able to perform this task as yet this capability has not been demonstrated harold smith jr prepared statement april 9 1997 p 8 43 statement of dr victor reis

nuclear force without testing france is producing warheads now and plans to replace warheads reaching the end of their service lives with newlyproduced robust warheads while they will resemble earlier ones their performance would be less sensitive to minor changes in materials and in production processes russia former secretary of defense james schlesinger stated unlike ourselves the russians continue to produce some thousands of weapons each year to replace aging weapons in their inventory45 russian nuclear weapons also reportedly need more maintenance and have shorter life cycles than their us counterparts46 china is evi dently developing new missiles to upgrade its nuclear forces its recent nuclear test program was apparently done to develop smaller lighter warheads for these missiles47 the concurrency of nuclear testing and missile development implies that china will design new warheads then produce copies of them for these forces for some time these four nations then are producing complete warheads or are likely to do so soon china will apparently build newdesign warheads france fabricates warheads now and will produce warheads of modified designs on an ongoing basis and britain and reportedly russia are manufacturing warheads of existing designs it can be assumed that these nations conduct weapons maintenance activities as well 4 in the united states plants and laboratories make complementary contributions to nuclear weapons production as weapon or component moves from an idea to finished product the labs and plants take certain steps in more or less the following progression basic research applied research design engineering development of the design engineering for production production and surveillance of the unit in the field or in storage these activities are complementary all are needed because each makes unique contribution to the enterprise the first four steps belong mainly to the labs the fifth and sixth mainly to the plants and the last to both interaction occurs mainly between design engineers at the labs and production engineers at the plants though its nature has changed over time in the cold war days the weapons complex emphasized moving new warhead types into the stockpile the plants often went into production with hardtoproduce component designs recently however there has been an increase in concurrent engineering which means taking production concerns into consideration earlier in the process this is implemented in particular by product realization teams formal groups of lab and plant staff representing key skills appli cable to various stages of part team members design the part engineer its produc 45 james schlesinger implications of zeroyield nuclear test ban statement before the subcommittee on

crs17 tion and offer suggestions based on their differing perspectives in this new approach not only is feedback sought and used but it is sought proactively before problems arise this approach makes for closer labplant links summary of findings on investment 5 in planning recent budgets doe has deferred investment at the plants for the longer term in order to fund daytoday operations doe sets priorities at the plants it assigns top priority to meeting operational needs because production is fundamental to does ability to support the stockpile given funding limits this priority has led doe in formulating budgets for the plants to defer investment in areas as diverse as repair maintenance infrastructure facility upgrades technology capital equipment hiring and training as investment is delayed the funds needed to bring the plants to given level of capability cumulate karen clegg who heads kansas city plant said due to overall budget constraints in the department of energy we have not been able to apply this funding provided by congress for modernization to address pressing recapitalization and infrastructure requirements as intended even though the workload and mission at my plant are expanding48 it is unclear if does priorities are changing doe is planning substantial investment for the plants for fy1999fy2003 but it projects total expenditure for stockpile management for fy2003 to be slightly less than in fy1998 6 plants have much obsolete equipment obsolete equipment can impede the plants work it may break often and is hard to maintain it often lacks capabilities that new technology offers it impedes recruitment as prospective recruits may not want to work with it it may undercut technical tasks for example kcps materials evaluation laboratory has three tensile testers machines bought in 1984 that measure materials and finished parts for strength when stretched or com pressed they perform well but the computer that controls them pdp11 from the mid1980s does not the pdp11 prints paper charts that must be analyzed by hand it requires inhouse maintenance because the manufacturer longer supports it one spare circuit board is left when the pdp11 can longer be maintained the tester will have to be operated manually personal computerbased controller one of which is in use runs complex test routines reduces setup time automates data analysis and can link to an electronic data storage network obsolete equipment may also undercut production kcp has some milling machines that cut design features like channels and holes in metal parts these have been used for two or three shifts day for some years are six years beyond their design lives are in bad condition have archaic controllers and have downtime of 30 to 40 percent as they wear out they are less able to hold tolerances yet are called on to make smaller components requiring tighter tolerances 48 statement of karen k clegg president government services and federal manufacturing technologies alliedsignal inc before the subcommittee on strategic forces committee on armed services united states senate march 19 1997 p 4 crs18 7 infrastructure problems impede the work of plants and laboratories much of the nuclear weapons complex is old and in many instances the infrastructure has deteriorated as lack of funds forces deferral of maintenance examples cited by nuclear weapons complex staff include leaky 73acre roof at kansas city plant that has led to damage of some weapon components rundown maintenance building at livermore steam distribution system at y12 that has numerous breakdowns and failures at alamoss plutonium rd facility of archaic computers recently replaced used to monitor hazards these problems increase operational costs require funds to be spent on piecemeal repairs and pose risks to production schedule and to safety summary of findings on people 8 demographic trends among engineers and scientists that impede nuclear weapons expertise at laboratories also occur at plants crs study on lab demographics found trends that are adverse for maintaining weap ons expertise49 these include an increase in average age few new hires and few or people in some skill areas these trends flow from downsizing if total staff size must be reduced then new hires would compel the dismissal of veteran staff members step that managements prefer to avoid because of staff morale and loss of expertise retention of the few staff who are newly hired is difficult junior staff fear that they would be most vulnerable to involuntary layoffs and have the mobility that comes with not having made career commitment to the labs with few new staff and with veteran staff members staying average age increases separations are often done on voluntary basis such as by offering retirement incentives which may open gaps in expertise these trends are also in evidence for engineers and scientists at the plants at kcp for example there are few young degreed science profes sionals of the 554 such professionals at the plant as of march 1996 only 73 were hired in the decade from 1986 through 1995 with few new staff there is little opportunity for veteran staff members to pass on details of the work and the organizational culture or for new staff to pass on their familiarity with new methods and techniques 9 demographics of key skilled trades personnel if uncorrected may leave plants unable to do weapons work over the long term us policy is to maintain nuclear weapons for the long term so doing requires production agency that can sustain itself for the long term yet hiring of machinists welders and other skilled trades workers doing direct weapons work here abbreviated stww who make nuclear weapons and their components has been negligible at the plants since the mid1980s stww are all union members and under seniority system many were hired in 19771984 with downsizing beginning in the mid1980s the least senior staff were laid off but had recall rights the right of first refusal to be rehired for specified time in seniority order if 49 us library of congress congressional research service nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship the role of livermore and alamos national laboratories report 94 418 f may 12 1994 75 p by jonathan medalia crs19 position in their skill areas reopened as result stww were concentrated by date of first hire at kansas city plant 72 percent of those on the payroll in october 1996 were first hired in 19771981 in workforce made up mostly of experienced workers of similar age workers know the culture of the plant are skilled at operating their equipment have security clearances and have acquired the specialized skills required for nuclear weapons work on the other hand with mix of ages more experienced workers can hand off skills and institutional memory to younger workers while the latter can bring in familiarity with new technologies and methods with hiring of new workers all but impossible and with many workers concentrated in narrow band of age and length of service it is likely that many will retire over short period of time opening gaps in critical skills these trends cannot sustain the work of the plants beyond the next decade or so doe though envisions further staff reductions at the plants that seem likely to intensify the patterns just discussed for example crs projects that downsizing under specified assumptions could result in 93 percent of kcps stww as of 2003 being first hired between 1977 and 1981 it appears that the plants would benefit by hiring new staff this might be done through apprenticeships slowing the pace of downsizing and buying out recall rights of laidoff workers 10 nonweapons work can help plants retain staff and develop skills in 1989 the navy requested does participation in making the propulsor for the seawolf submarine this part essentially complex propeller is about 20 feet tall and weighs tens of tons y12 was tasked with the job in 1990 after the navy failed to receive an acceptable response to three requests for proposals y12 completed the propulsor prototype in 1993 and as of february 1998 continues to manufacture critical components of it and provides technical support to companies doing most of the followon work y12 believes that work of this type 1 exercises weapon skills such as development of electronic models tooling design welding and machining 2 helps y12 adjust to workload fluctuations by retaining people whose skills are needed but who would otherwise be let go and 3 reduces costs to does weapons program to maintain staff not involved at all times in weapons work by charging some overhead to clients as another example sandia and kcp have researched and developed miniature lasers for initiating weapons high explosive laser initiation it is hoped would make weapon less vulnerable to unauthorized use and to detonation by spurious electrical signals kcp recently reached an agreement with an aerospace contractor to develop this technology for igniting fuel in aircraft engines work began in march 1996 and continues into fy1998 kcp points to similar technical requirements for lasers on weapons and on aircraft engines such as operation while cycling between extreme heat and cold as such kcp expects the work to help develop weapon skills summary of findings on new manufacturing technology and its consequences 11 the plants have substantial expertise in manufacturing techno logy and are using it to make evolutionary advances in this area the plants have expertise in areas crucial to their mission such as materials process development and improvement and solving problems that arise in production one crs20 participant calls it dirtyhands engineering examples include 1 molten uranium picked up carbon impurities during casting y12s development division cut carbon pickup in half by injecting argon an inert gas into the casting crucible 2 some manufacturing demands increased precision which requires improved ability to measure y12 has laboratory for metrology the science of measurement its precise measurement of production units enables operators to adjust their equipment and allows y12 to certify parts and processes 3 pantexs engineering and design division designs tooling and test equipment and works on disposition of weapons and their components it also develops processes for weapons assembly disassembly and dismantlement these processes must be developed for each warhead type because of differences between warheads for example high explosive might be removed from one type of warhead by mechanical means from another with pressurized water and from third with solvent the labs also have expertise that supports production 12 laboratories are developing revolutionary technologies in such areas as components materials and processes for use in weapons examples include chemistry laboratory on microchip that can be placed inside warhead to monitor the warheads condition laser that can make such thin cuts in some weapon components that they can be reassembled and reused rather than remanufactured and laser that fabricates components by melting powdered material building the components layer by layer hundreds of such projects are underway they may increase reliability and ease of fabrication while reducing waste cost and worker exposure to dangerous materials they are often well suited for the smaller lot size likely in future production on the other hand there is concern that these technologies might introduce uncertainties that would reduce weapon reliability weapon designers analyze potential changes to weapons very closely before approving them but mechanical electrical chemical or other interactions between new and existing weapon components might have unforeseen results for these reasons dod is uneasy about using some of these technologies 13 software is changing how nuclear weapon components are signed engineered and produced with computer models becoming the medium for conducting and linking these steps much software is being developed commercially the nuclear weapons complex uses some of it as is modifies some substantially and designs some itself software packages coalesce into new process in which product moves as computer model from requirement through design engineering and production this process enables work to be done faster more effectively at lower cost and with less waste design and production knowledge can be stored and retrieved designers can address producibility concerns early on avoiding some problems and improving quality designers can simulate and compare the performance and manufacture of alternative designs expanding choice one organization can hand off computer models to another so that nothing is lost or embellished along the way and changes can be tracked and linked to requirements machine tool operators can better preserve design intent software developed by the weapons complex should also help industry on the other hand some software packages are hard to use engineers may lose physical touch with the entities they are designing electronically integrating the pieces is often difficult ex ploiting the potential would require added investment at the plants in electronic and crs21 other capital equipment electronic infrastructure and training some skilled trades staff adapt readily to this new process others do not security is an issue as work moves electronically from one computer to another might it be vulnerable to inter ception might the accessibility that software provides enable an employee to steal vast amounts of information undetected issues of this sort are being addressed 14 new technologies and declining work volume are changing the skill mix needed for production often requiring trades workers to increase skills50 technology often requires skilled trades workers to become more skilled many machinists longer operate machines directly rather they operate computers that operate machines at sandia some machinists making proto types take electronic files of parts design off the intranet and use computeraided manufacturing program to design plan to make the part at kansas city plant and y12 workers who used manuallycontrolled machine tools now use personal computercontrolled machine tools technology creates demand for new jobs people must program computers train workers and set up and maintain computers the electronic infrastructure and sophisticated manufacturing equipment training in manufacturing technology has taken on increased importance during the cold war worker might have performed single process step for years now with lower production rates that approach is unaffordable so workers need training in multiple skills while new technology may eliminate or downgrade some jobs it creates new ones makes workers more productive opens avenues for advancement and often requires increased skill on balance then contrary to the general perception new technology may well benefit workers 15 new manufacturingrelated technology holds differing implica tions for the stockpile laboratories plants antinuclear groups and russia this technology will affect each of these entities and doubtless others differently this section sketches what this technology might mean for three of them potential benefits and risks for the stockpile new technology should increase reliability by reducing worker error and increasing ease of fabrication it may lower cost it may also create risks modified components may not behave just like the ones they replace possibly causing weapons to fail wouldbe proliferators might find new technologies using simpler designs easier to exploit electronic networks offer wellplaced agent access to much information stakes for the plants new technologies benefit the plants by reducing cost and waste streams and increasing quality replicability and worker safety yet disconnect between technology used by the plants and that used by the labs and industry could arise the labs have the final say over nuclear weapons production if the plants cannot embrace new technology they will be decreasingly able to meet lab requirements to work with equipment and software used by labs and industry and to negotiate expertly with external vendors they could become unable to 50 this section is based on discussions with managers and technical staff at kansas city plant sandia national laboratories and y12 plant and with machinists inspectors and metal workers at sandia crs22 produce to new standards and use new methods even though replicating old components identically would be extremely hard at best concerns for russia nuclear weapons arguably play larger role for russian than for us defense yet russian weapons are said to be much shorterlived than their us counterparts and russian nuclear weapons labs are in serious trouble russia would have difficulty approaching the pending advances in technology discussed in findings 11 to 13 because of lack of funds and lessadvanced technology infrastructure russia might feel that it can maintain warheads without testing by remanufacturing them to existing designs if it interprets the us effort as indicating what must be done to maintain weapons without testing however its confidence in its weapons would decline increasing pressure to resume testing choices the united states has three fundamental policy choices on nuclear weapons it could seek worldwide nearterm abolition of these weapons and enter the ctbt as step in that direction it could reject the treaty and maintain weapons through robust program that includes underground nuclear testing or it could enter the treaty and try to maintain weapons for the foreseeable future without testing this section discusses alternative approaches for implementing the latter choice which is current policy it critiques these approaches from the perspectives of opponents of nuclear weapons and opponents of the ctbt it concludes by discussing the relationship between stockpile stewardship and management ssm and the ctbt approaches to maintaining nuclear weapons under the ctbt various approaches might maintain weapons without nuclear testing this section presents three they are crafted to illustrate the range and consequences of alternatives they are definitions of ideal types not descriptions of actual plans as noted on page 8 does ssm plan is to have robust laboratory effort while re taining but downsizing the plants of the approaches discussed next ssm is closest to lab dominant omnilab the first approach here called omnilab would close the plants and conduct all rd and production at the labs it is divided into two subapproaches under omnilab small the united states would shrink its stockpile to few hundred warheads and would forswear any surge capacity whether to respond to foreign threat or to replace quickly one type of warhead that had been found defective the labs would maintain this stockpile with mainly existing facilities and staff laboratory staff would be familiar with individual warheads and would maintain them on firstname basis using laboratory rather than industrial processes there would be only little new construction to install production processes not already in place on small scale at the labs omnilab large in contrast would maintain stockpile of few thousand warheads it would require building many production facilities sized for larger workload than the labs can currently handle hiring and training many new production workers and using industrial methods crs23 either version of omnilab would help maintain the labs by drawing resources to them maintaining the labs is important because only they can certify weapons and must do so annually certification requires strong science especially without testing moreover if the plants cannot resolve the demographic issues and potential for technology disconnect discussed earlier an omnilab could be the nations only choice it would be easier to establish omnilab small which would use mostly existing lab facilities than omnilab large which would not yet either version would require extensive regulatory approvals and environmental impact analyses and could face legal challenges and public protests it would take years to implement either version and qualify it for production of stockpiled weapons everything would be changed from the way things were done at the plants the facilities computer models using new vastly more powerful supercomputers production sites which can affect the product51 production processes and for omnilab large workers even the scientific approach would be new it would use predictive methods and scientific experiments that lead more to firstprinciples understanding of weapon issues rather than emphasizing nuclear tests and empirical models that are based on past nuclear test data as result either version of omnilab would add great uncertainties that could reduce confidence in us weapons omnilab large or small would arguably place the labs at risk it could divert them from rd their core mission to production mission for which they have little recent experience and which appears to be at odds with their culture according to one report when ta55 alamoss plutonium rd facility was proposed as the future site for pit production at first lanl alamos national laboratory director sig hecker blanched at the proposal worrying that weapons production role would crowd out research and scare away talented scientists52 omnilab large could become trojan horse if the need for capacity suddenly were to increase such as to modify hundreds of warheads of one type to correct newly discovered flaw the labs would have to devote many more resources to expansion of capacity the nation would have choice but the adverse consequences for the labs would multiply omnilab small would avoid this problem because the national decision establishing it would accept sharp limits on capacity move to force that omnilab small could maintain few hundred warheads would hold implications that the other approaches do not some involve management of the us stockpile the us strategic force comprises bombers ballistic missilecarrying submarines and landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles the triad with few hundred warheads there would be strong pressure 51 for example llnl developed and demonstrated metalinertgas process for using aluminum to weld beryllium components when it was put into production at rocky flats plant it failed the problem took about year to figure out rocky flats is at an elevation of about 5800 feet while llnl is near sea level at the lower pressure of rocky flats gases come out of solution creating bubbles in the weld the solution was to use pressurized system pressurized inert gas metal arc welding source telephone conver sation between the author and alamos national laboratory staff december 1996 52 jonathan weisman alamos takes step back to its roots science march 8 1996 1356 crs24 to eliminate one or two of these elements to save money bombers and submarines are especially costly to operate and maintain spending vast sums for bomber force carrying say 100 warheads would incur immense costs per deployed warhead simi larly there would be strong pressure to reduce the number of warhead types deployed as maintaining each type entails cost maintaining each warhead type requires some unique surveillance and production capabilities and fixing problem in one warhead type would likely require dedicated experiments and calculations the foregoing concerns could be dealt with by spending the requisite sums which with fewer warheads involved would be less than current spending otherwise questions might arise regarding the credibility of the us nuclear force this small stockpile would involve international issues as well the united states would be unlikely to go to force of few hundred warheads unless parallel large reductions in british chinese french and russian forces could be negotiated even so britain china and france could surely not agree to proportional reductions reducing their nuclear forces by 90 to 95 percent would leave them with perhaps few dozen warheads apiece scarcely viable or costeffective force very small nuclear force would also magnify the value of each warhead visavis the us force arguably increasing the incentives for nonnuclear weapon states to go nuclear or for china or revanchist russia to hold warheads covertly this in turn would increase the importance of monitoring and might necessitate agreements permitting onsite inspection lab dominant under the second approach lab dominant the labs would have robust rd program while the plants would do production at low rate much of the plants capacity would be in cold storage or dismantled the labs would develop more expertise in technologies supporting production they would have more responsibility in manufacturing technology such as producing some components leading and integrating the weapons complex effort to develop advanced manufacturing technology and overseeing weapons surveillance testing at the plants lab dominant would arguably help maintain nearterm confidence in weapons better than omnilab large or small doe and dod claim that their joint involvement in nuclear weapons is beneficial because this arrangement provides checks balances and complementary perspectives53 livermore and alamos make the same argument regarding two separate design labs by the same token conducting rd at separate organizations from production should provide the same benefit by leaving most production at the plants lab dominant would protect the labs from pitfalls of production moreover retaining more production capacity some of it in cold standby than under either version of omnilab would let doe meet requirements for large production runs should they be needed to correct warhead flaws that emerged with little or warning despite the best efforts of stockpile stewardship 53 for dod perspective on these points see secretary of defense william j perry letter to senator strom thurmond chairman senate armed services committee march 29 1995 crs25 on the other hand this approach would undercut production capability at the plants by sacrificing investment to meet the daytoday needs of production it might ultimately provide less total steadystate plus surge capacity than omnilab small if the demographic technology and recapitalization problems facing the plants were not addressed and steps were not taken to put in place the requisite capacity at the labs if capability at the plants is in jeopardy the expenditures for recapitalization might have to be compressed into few years perhaps making them unaffordable or demographic problems and technology disconnects could worsen to the point where restoring the plants becomes impossible as such lab dominant could under mine the confidence of us policymakers in us ability to maintain weapons for the long term lab dominant has potential strategic implications declining confidence in us ability to maintain its weapons for the long term could undermine us confidence in its deterrent or less likely the confidence of potential adversaries in the effectiveness of us weapons it could also weaken the us position in strategic arms reduction negotiations russia or china might feel less need to make concessions in this area if either felt that us inability to maintain its weapons adequately under lab dominant made unilateral us reductions inevitable plantlab partnership the third approach plantlab partnership is defined as follows the plants would continue production and would invest more in infrastructure capital equipment etc correcting problems noted in findings 57 technology investment would strengthen their ability to continue productionrelated development of the sorts noted in finding 11 to address production problems and to adapt new technologies such as in findings 12 and 13 to production plants would continue to reduce floorspace in order to consolidate operations and save money the labs would continue strong stockpile stewardship program labs and plants would have partnership centered on technology labs would be more responsive to plant needs such as in developing processes to meet production demands or software to track development and production efforts the balance between production needs and technological opportunity as drivers of lab rd would shift toward the former at the same time the plants would provide feedback on lab technologies would consult on producibility issues and would help industrialize lab technology for commercial use compared to the other approaches plantlab partnership would provide more capability as well as capacity for maintaining weapons and would most clearly demonstrate us commitment to do so it would let the plants make the most of technology developed by the labs and would encourage the plants to influence development of that technology strengthening technical expertise would help the plants retain their autonomy the shift in labplant relations from one of tension few years ago to one of more cooperation now should make plantlab partnership more sustainable on the other hand plantlab partnership would require substantial investment its scope could also raise arms control problems many nonnuclear weapon states are pressing for nuclear disarmament and cite the nuclear nonpro liferation treaty as committing the nuclear weapon states as states party to that treaty to work toward that end nonnuclear weapon states could view plantlab partnership the most robust approach as signaling us disinterest in nuclear disarmament crs26 critiques the three approaches just discussed omnilabs lab dominant and plantlab partnership are consistent with the us policy of 1 maintaining nuclear weapons and 2 doing so without testing some disagree with that policy so would reject all three approaches one group would eliminate all nuclear weapons worldwide as soon as possible and until then would have minimal stewardship program at most another group would resume testing on grounds that that is the only way to maintain weapons this section presents views from these perspectives critique by opponents of nuclear weapons those who oppose nuclear weapons hold that the three approaches by trying to maintain weapons indefinitely evade what they see as the central purpose of the ctbt halt to weapons improve ment as prelude to nuclear abolition the nuclear weapon states by maintaining their nuclear monopoly perpetuate discriminatory regime with nuclear haves and havenots this conveys to the world the message that nuclear weapons are important that they are an essential trapping of great power status that their use is possible and legitimate and that the nuclear weapon states will keep them that message in this view undercuts us nonproliferation efforts us security and the ctbt as paine and mckinzie wrote in 1997 if implemented over the next decade as presently planned the ssm program is poised to seriously erode important nonproliferation policy objectives as well as undermine political assurances the us government provided other nations in connection with the indefinite extension of the npt and the negotiation of comprehensive test ban treaty indeed over the long term the ssmp poses threat to the strategic relevance of the ctbt itself54 these observers would have curatortype weapons maintenance program at most until nuclear weapons were abolished or program of monitoring and guarding warheads until they are dismantled they view nuclear weapons as robust so see all three approaches as spending far more effort and money than is needed even if the united states wants to maintain weapons for some time as 1997 press release by three antinuclear groups stated numerous scientific studies have shown that nuclear testing is not needed to maintain the safety and reliability of the nuclear arsenal said robert tiller director of security programs at physicians for social responsibility our nuclear weapons arsenal can be maintained in the future with the same nonexplosive tests and inspections that have been used in the past does approach to the nuclear stockpile should be drastically revised and redefined into passive curatorship not huge pork barrel program for the weapons labs 54 christopher paine and matthew mckinzie end run the us governments plan for designing nuclear weapons and simulating nuclear explosions under the comprehensive test ban treaty washington natural resources defense council august 1997 p 24 crs27 maureen eldredge program director of the military production network denounced the skewed spending priorities congress needs to ratify the ctb kill the ssm stockpile stewardship and management program and in its place create truly passive curatorship program for our nuclear arsenal55 adherents of this position fear the many efforts to advance technology as leading to new weapon types and increasing pressure to test both to ensure that changes made to existing weapons will work and to enable certification and production of new ones some view these plans as porkbased stockpile stewardship and management not jobs to do work but work to save jobs they see some of the concerns by ctbt opponents discussed next as overstated even if russia were to have more warheads than the united states what difference would that make if iraq were to develop nuclear weapons how would 2000 warheads be more of deterrent than 500 even drop in the reliability of us warheads would not be critical in this view deterrence arises not from us confidence that us weapons will work but from lack of confidence by others that us weapons will fail this latter is an easier standard to meet of the various approaches advocates of nuclear disarmament would probably dislike omnilab small the least it would support the smallest stockpile and have the lowest cost it could readily be ratcheted down to maintain fewer warheads but its less formal procedures limited operating capacity and lack of surge capacity would increase the time and difficulty involved in ramping up production or supporting larger stockpile also if serious defect emerged in warheads of one type this approach would make it difficult for the united states to replace them in timely way while maintaining other warheads omnilab small might thus encourage the united states to reduce further its reliance on nuclear weapons and to enter negotiations for further reductions on the other hand the great fear of advocates of nuclear disarmament is development of new weapons mission the labs would dominate omnilab large or small would enhance the labs whereas plantlab partnership by strengthening plants as well as labs would place greater emphasis on routine maintenance of weapons two ironies attend this critique robust ssm program might promote nuclear disarmament by delaying the need to test to resolve weapon problem it may be that ssm works well enough to avoid that need but even if it does not the better ssm does the longer testing might be avoided us technical ability to conduct nuclear test might diminish over time under the ctbt or test halt as happened for atmospheric testing in the 195861 nuclear test moratorium and in the years after the nuclear test ban treaty of 1963 us political will to test might also decline over time as happened with atmospheric testing after the 1963 treaty and as appears to be happening with underground testing following the current moratorium that began in september 1992 the longer that ssm can delay the need to test then the less politically likely and technically capable the united states would be to test even to 55 military production network peace action and physicians for social responsibility national grassroots groups criticize nuclear weapon stewardship plan call for early ratification of ctb press release october 29 1997 p 12 crs28 resolve stockpile problem and the more likely it would be instead to withdraw questionable weapons or make whatever fixes could be made without testing second while disarmament advocates believe small us effort would suffice to maintain nuclear weapons it does not follow that wouldbe proliferators could readily develop such weapons especially without detection and response true these nations would not need to approach the complexity of us weapons yet this report suggests that even much simpler weapons would require an elaborate production complex planning building and operating it would involve many steps nuclear testing would be but one of these steps and an unnecessary one for simple weapons discovery of any of these steps could reveal the existence of clandestine weapons program accomplishing such program would therefore be exceedingly difficult costly and timeconsuming though not as the iraqi case shows impossible critique by opponents of the ctbt opponents of the ctbt agree with past and current us policy to maintain nuclear weapons indefinitely and argue that confidence in weapons must be high to maintain effective deterrence as the only way proven to maintain weapons they would conduct an ongoing program of nuclear weapons rd design testing and production though sized to meet postcold war needs as gaffney states responsible and effective stockpile stewardship program requires an ongoing program of lowyield underground testing at least until such time as the various hightech facilities and technology envisioned under the present ssp are fully validated56 they see nuclear weapons as complicated and note that they deteriorate over time any changes to weapon design materials or production processes or even trying to rebuild warheads to original specifications would they believe inevitably introduce changes the armada of weapons related technologies large and small being developed at the plants and labs hold the potential in this view to magnify these problems these changes may cumulate over time to affect weapon performance drastically moreover without testing the united states could not introduce new weapon types that might be needed to counter advances in weapons or defensive measures by other nations and might be unable to introduce some new safety features57 us confidence in its deterrent would thus erode encouraging wouldbe nuclear states to develop nuclear weapons and compelling us allies to develop their own nuclear weapons to compensate for lack of confidence in those of the united states this they believe is recipe for nuclear proliferation and for undermining us security in this view only testing can assure confidence as the 1996 republican platform stated to cope with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction the united states will have to deter the threat or use of weapons of mass destruction by rogue states this in turn will require the continuing maintenance and development of nuclear weapons and their periodic testing the clinton 56 center for security policy warning to the nuclear labs dont count on stockpile stewardship to maintain either overhead or confidence decision brief 97d 183 december 1 1997 1 p original emphasis in text and title 57 see statement by dr kathleen c bailey before the united states senate committee on governmental affairs subcommittee on international security proliferation and federal services march 18 1998 prepared statement p 910 crs29 administrations proposed comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt is inconsistent with american security interests58 as omnilabs lab dominant and plantlab partnership all assume that the united states can maintain its nuclear stockpile without testing ctbt opponents would view all three approaches as doomed to failure ctbt opponents would find particular problems with omnilab small because they feel that the force of several hundred warheads that that approach would support would place us security at great risk while the united states could spend the funds needed to maintain triad and multiple warhead types for each triad element ctbt opponents fear that cost pressures would lead to cutbacks with severe adverse strategic effects eliminating one or two triad elements would simplify an attack on the force and increase us vulnerability having each triad element carry only one type of warhead instead of two or three as at present would in their opinion make the force fragile serious defect emerging in warhead type would eliminate the entire triad element that carries that warhead another vulnerability would be to hidden weapons or covert weapon development programs if russia were to hide several thousand warheads and retained missiles to carry them it would suddenly have much larger force than that of the united states onsite inspection in this view would have little prospect of finding such weapons in any nation let alone the worlds largest yet us agreement to such inspections would permit intrusions by other nations still another vulnerability would be that russia and china would have much greater production capacity than would the united states under omnilab small so that even an overt decision to break out of an agreement mandating small forces would leave the united states at disadvantage in sum ctbt opponents fear that the small force associated with omnilab small would increase in vulnerability and decrease in credibility over time sharply eroding its deterrent value critique by those who would maintain nuclear weapons under the ctbt those who would retain nuclear weapons under the ctbt would likely choose among omnilabs lab dominant plantlab partnership or similar approaches rather than rejecting all of them they would see cost as an issue in the choice omnilab small would probably be the least costly approach for the long term if the united states were to have stockpile of few hundred warheads the labs could maintain the stockpile using mainly existing staff and equipment the operating savings from closing the plants would in this approach probably far outweigh the combined costs of smallscale new construction and lowrate operation at the labs plantlab partnership would be costly the plants have deferred much investment in order to fund operations not formula for success in technologydriven industry 58 republican national committee 1996 platform at website httpwwwrncorghqplatform96plat8htmlstren crs30 omnilab large would arguably be the most costly approach because of the large investment needed indeed doe study that considered six major weapon production activities found that except for plutonium component production it would be less costly to do the work at the plants even for stockpile of thousand warheads59 that figure is well below the 2000 to 2500 accountable strategic warheads that the united states and russia listed in the march 1997 helsinki summit statement as an objective for start iii60 more recently russia has suggested that the two sides reduce further to perhaps 1500 such warheads in start iii the reason is that establishing production on an industrial scale at the labs would entail high costs requiring the design and construction of new facilities buying production equipment hiring and training new workers and qualifying the production processes moreover the cost of installing and qualifying new equipment at the labs for surge capacity would likely exceed that of maintaining existing equipment in cold standby at the plants for the same purpose any decision to close the plants and move production to the labs would therefore need to weigh the cost of establishing new production capability and capacity at the labs against the cost of maintaining the plants lab dominant is likely the cheapest for the short term for stockpile of currently foreseeable size because it defers investment yet for precisely that reason it is arguably the least stable for the long term as its shortcomings became manifest lab dominant would likely lead to either form of omnilab or to plantlab partnership lab dominant may thus be seen as default approach the result of an unwillingness to move production to the labs or to upgrade the plants cost however would not be the only issue or even perhaps the most important one the choice among omnilabs lab dominant and plantlab partnership is basically choice of means and ends plantlab partnership is endsdriven if the united states wants to retain capacity to maintain stockpile of several thousand weapons and surge capacity it needs the plants maintaining the plants requires addressing the three issues that are the core of this report demographics techno logy and recapitalization current demographic trends at the plants will not enable the maintenance of capability over the long term the data presented later in this report see finding 9 show this for kcp discussions indicate that the situation is similar at other plants as well the problem must be solved in the face of downsizing and for crafts personnel the seniority system if this problem cannot be

findings 1113 will compel the plants to enhance their ability to work with new technologies the labs and plants have many hundreds if not thousands of projects in many areas of technology underway at any time and commercial technology is advancing across an even wider front many of these projects will affect production potential technology disconnect between labs and plants as discussed on page 21 threatens the plants over the long term the plants could minimize this risk by more focus on and investment in technology the plants claim to have large unmet needs in the areas of maintenance infra structure capital equipment technology personnel and more as findings 57 suggest recapitalization however would take money if the united states is unwilling to spend the money for plantlab partnership an endsdriven approach it could take meanslimited leastcost approach it could close the plants shrink the stockpile drastically forgo surge capacity and implement omnilab small according to doe if the us were to support stockpile of only few hundred weapons small production capability collocated with its weapons research and development capability would probably be sufficient61 lab dominant seeks the ends of plantlab partnership without the requisite means there may be reasons for so doing the stockpile level is in flux pending russian ratification of start ii start iii negotiations that would follow start ii ratification and possible future agreements certainly the stockpile trend has been downward delaying commitment to plantlab partnership or to omnilab large would avoid spending money that could be wasted if the united states were to move to very small stockpile moreover funds may simply be unavailable for plantlab partnership even as it is clear that the stockpile will be larger for the foreseeable future than that supportable by omnilab small yet lab dominant has severe problems as noted on page 24 if they cannot be resolved the united states might be forced by default to omnilab large the need to institute that plan quickly would magnify its high costs risks to the labs and stockpile uncertainties given the costs and implications of the three approaches then those who would maintain weapons under the ctbt might favor making an explicit decision among these or other approaches as decision by default is likely to produce poorer results at higher cost lab dominant is in effect decision by default result of an unwillingness either to spend on facilities for maintaining the current stockpile or to shrink the stockpile to level that can be maintained at lower cost lab dominant in turn could lead to omnilab large as another default decision it would be the only choice available if the plants were to become unsustainable the decision on approach will likely determine us ability to maintain its weapons for the long term it is too important to be made by double default 61 department of energy stockpile management preferred alternatives report p 2 crs32 conclusion ssm and ctbt if the united states chooses to enter ctbt as prelude to abolishing nuclear weapons or to resume nuclear testing in order to maintain weapons implementing either choice is conceptually simple implementing decision to enter the treaty and maintain nuclear weapons while avoiding default approach to maintenance is more complicated the ctbt might be vehicle for assuring production capability needed to maintain weapons as noted on page 3 president clinton has set forth six safeguardsfor maintaining us security under the ctbt62 safeguards and b make the treaty vehicle for assuring weapons rd at the same time placing pro duction on stable footing seems crucial for obtaining the ctbt as result it may be possible to link the treaty and production each side in the ctbt debate has placed itself in somewhat difficult position ctbt opponents are certainly correct to point out that the united states can maintain its weapons more confidently with testing than without yet it seems unlikely that the united states would conduct nuclear tests other than for stockpile emergency the exception that president clinton spelled out indeed it is uncertain if the united states would conduct test even then because of concerns over international protests ending the ctbt and advertising the existence of major us weapon problem if the senate were to reject the ctbt and the united states did not conduct tests other than for stockpile emergencies some might wonder why the treaty was rejec ted if the united states tested several decades of nuclear testing history suggest that domestic and international firestorm of protest would surround each test the perceived link between the ctbt and nuclear abolition places the treatys advocates in an awkward position as well neither congress nor the administration has shown serious interest in nuclear abolition indeed both have acted in tained manner to retain and maintain us nuclear weapons even under the ctbt the treatys ratification prospects would dim if the senate saw the treaty as leading to abolition yet obstacles to production as described in this report undercut us ability to maintain weapons if these needs continue they could raise questions about the us commitment to maintaining weapons and about whether the longterm result of the ctbt would be abolition neither concern would help ctbt prospects moreover as production is needed to maintain weapons production difficulties could make more likely stockpile emergency of the sort that could lead the united states to resume nuclear testing linking the ctbt and stockpile management might avoid some difficulties just noted to do so however would appear to require substantial added stockpile management funds such funding commitment would likely have to be on long term scale because the treaty itself is of indefinite duration funds would be spent on investment at the production agencies including sandia and alamos in their production roles as well as the plants in areas noted earlier these funds would be 62 us white house office of the press secretary fact sheet comprehensive test ban treaty safeguards august 11 1995 1 p crs33 needed even if production were to move to the labs the plants might spend say tenth of their added funds to buy technology meeting their specifications from the labs plantdirected rd would make for closer labplant relationships by strengthening the technology link between the two and would increase the amount of technology the labs generated in response to the demands of production the six current safeguards deal with the labs intelligence and test resumption they do not deal with production or acknowledge that it is indispensable for main taining nuclear weapons for the long term and that it requires ongoing investment in people infrastructure equipment and technology possible way to address this concern would be to provide that the united states shall make adequate funds for investment and operations available for production activities at nuclear weapon pro duction facilities this provision would refer to production activities instead of production to clarify that the concern is not only fabricating complete warheads which is what most people think of as production but also manufacture of components life extension programs repairs modification of warheads for flight tests and so on it could refer to production facilities rather than plants because it might be in effect long time while added investment would help the plants survive one cannot predict whether production would be done at the labs or plants many years from now given uncertainties on future arms control agreements stockpile size weapons complex demographics and the impact of new technologies such provision if linked to the ctbt could come into effect with that treaty and maintain production on the same timescale as the treaty or until the world moved to nuclear disarmament ssm and the ctbt then are complementary strong program of rd and production counters though cannot eliminate the argument against the treaty that the united states will be unable to maintain its nuclear weapons indefinitely without testing unless the nuclear weapons complex is maintained on an ongoing basis though its capability will diminish that would undermine confidence in weapons over time prospect that could lead the senate to reject the ctbt and the united states to resume testing as an inadequate program of rd and production could lead to defeat of the ctbt and as strong program would weaken the case against the treaty advocates of strong program for weapons maintenance and advocates of the ctbt share sometimesuneasy confluence of interest for other versions of this document see
