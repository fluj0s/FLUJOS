03abalbcm270 with expenditure of us 15 llion our review concentrated on the activities implemented by child rens first foundation cff expenditure of us 387000 refugee and migrant ser vices in albania rmsa expenditure of us 173000 the institute for polic and legal studies ipls expenditure of us 95000 international catholic m igration commission icmc expenditure of us 350000 and comunita internazio nale di capodarco cica expenditure of us 83700 we also reviewed activi ties directly implemented by unhcr with expenditure of us 247000 7 the audit reviewed the administration of br anch office tirana with administrative budgets totalling us 542000 for 20 02 and 2003 and assets with an acquisition value of us 39 million and current value of us 11 million in april 2004 17 persons were working in unhcr office tiran 11 on authorized posts on the staffing table two on temporary assistance ta 2 project staff unv and the receptionist on contractual agreement 8 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applica ble data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations programme issues 9 oios assessed that project financial monito ring was competently performed visits to the implementing partners were performed regularly and organized in order to cover the most significant aspects of finance an d administration written recommendations have been issued when improvements were required and records of the verification work performed were kept and made available for oios review due to the vigilance of unhcr the consequences of the misallocation of expenditures by icmc have been kept below the unhcr materiality lev programme management 10 the 2002 and 2003 programme was character ized by the continuing downsizing of activities the number of refugees an d asylum seekers approximately 200 at the end of 2003 was reduced significantly s well as the budget for the programme which had been us 39 million in 2000 c ompared to only us 664000 for 2003 11 the major modification in the orientation of the programme was the signing of an agreement with the eu for the implementation of the project community assistance for reconstruction democratization and stabilization cards for the implementation of this project unhcr was designate d the lead agency consequently unhcr would report on expenditure of uros 2 million and ensure the planning of the programme the coordination and mon itoring of the partners for this 3 project the government of albania international rganization for migration iom and organization for security and cooperation in urope osce 12 in view of the commitment taken by unhcr t coordinate and monitor the activities of the partners of the cards project cu rrent project monitoring procedures should be further strengthened unhcr will be ulti mately accountable for financial reporting to the eu considering the size of the p artners and their international status we believe that international staff should be direc tly involved in the monitoring process which was not the case in 2002 and 2003 the representation has confirmed that in future international staff would be involve d in monitoring rehabilitation of the babrru centre 13 the most significant project expenditure s ince the end of the emergency operation was the furnishing and rehabilitation of the babrru centre used for accommodation of asylum seekers since 2001 unhcr albania has spent all 56 million us 541700 on rehabilitation works whe n unhcr launched the rehabilitation of these former military barracks i t was understood that the government of albania would take over the management of the ce ntre however significant progress has been made since the end of the reconst ruction work in 2002 it seems that the albanian government is reluctant to take over there is also legal problem due to the transfer of responsibility of the office for refugees ofr from the ministry of local governments to the ministry of public order in addition the buildings renovated were military barracks that belong to the ministry of defence which implies multipartite agreement b review of implementing partners 14 for the five partners reviewed reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disburs ed in accordance with the subagreements with the exception of ipls due to the lack of cooperation and refusal to give access to records of disbursements oios could not conclude that the ipls internal control and accounting systems can b relied on 15 oios assessed that internal controls of mo st partners were generally in place and operating effectively proper documentation of financial transactions was accessible procedures were in place for authorizat ion of expenditure approval of payment and the expenditures were properly supporte d in cff the internal controls were weak in terms of segregation of duties with h usband and spouse cosigning transactions oios recommended that the unhcr re presentation in albania request cff to revise the delegation of authority t ensure adequate segregation of duties and to avoid any conflict of interest cff stated that measures have been taken to avoid any conflict of interest 16 audit certificates for the 2003 subprojec ts have not yet been provided unhcr has done bidding process and action was bei ng taken on this matter for 2002 an audit certificate was required only for ic mc the consolidated financial statements submitted by icmc as audit certificate d id not include an opinion by the auditor that the funds provided by unhcr were spent in accordance with the terms of 4 subprojects agreements in addition the financia l statements showed as total amount granted by unhcr in albania us 332000 which had not been reconciled with the subproject expenditures us 350581 contribution to local partners capacity building 17 during the downsizing the international n go partners have been gradually replaced by national ngos most of them newly estab lished and with experience of working with unhcr in 2003 subagreement was s igned with an international ngo three partners cff rmsa and ipls were blished between 1999 and 2001 and signed their first subagreement with unhc r in 2002 18 since 2002 unhcr tirana has significantl contributed to rmsa and cff capacity building in terms of salaries and various administrative expenditures in order to pursue such assistance unhcr needs to be informed on the progress made by the partners in improving their financial sustai nability and fundraising capacity unhcr also needs such information to determine its contribution to the ip common costs to avoid overfunding of common costs unhcr should be aware of contributions received by its partners from other d onors the partners have not provided such information oios recommended that th unhcr representation in albania remind cff and rmsa of their obligation to provide information on the progress made in becoming selfsufficient rmsa indicated that the records of contributions from other sources are available to u nhcr tirana cff did not comment on this issue recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in albania should obtain from its implementing partners the necessary inform ation to assess the progress made in becoming selfsuffic ient and reduce its financial contribution on capacity b uilding rec 01 financial management 19 all partners cff rmsa icmc and cica with the exception of ipls maintained separate accounting records for unhcr bprojects which consisted generally of cashbook bank journals and genera l ledger they also provided quarterly comparison of the expenditure and the bud get for all the subprojects audited the data provided by the accounting system could be reconciled with the expenditures reported to unhcr on the spmr 20 ipls did not adhere to unhcrs instruction s regarding the maintenance of project records the records made available for the audit consisted of payment vouchers and compilation of amounts charged per b udget line which ipls consider to be an accounting system despite the fact that ll the payments for project expenditures were made by cash cash journal was maintained or was made available to the auditor there was also record of cash advances made for payments related to training activities taking plac outside of ipls premises we 5 recommended that before signing any further partner ship agreement with ipls unhcr should ensure that the ip is aware of its res ponsibility in terms of maintenance of project records and understands the evaluation inspection and audit clause of the subagreement with unhcr budgetary control 21 the budgetary rules need to be better unde rstood and strictly adhered to comparison of the expenditure and the budget was do ne on quarterly basis by most of the partners which allowed revision of the bu dget when necessary due to misunderstanding of budgetary control requirements rmsa icmc ipls recorded some payments incorrectly recorded to budget line where funds were still available in order to avoid over expenditure at the end f 2002 because of an expected balance of funds several advance payments were mad the budgets of the 2002 sub projects were also unnecessarily complex in partic ular for icmc unhcr expenditures for office premises were incorrectly c harged as project expenditures due to unclear budgetary procedures we could not verif the appropriateness of salary charged for the director of the project in their reply to our recommendation most of the partners indicated that they had followed instr uctions received from unhcr tirana banking arrangements 22 implementing partners operated separate ba nk accounts and performed bank reconciliation regularly however the instalments received from unhcr and deposited in the separate bank account were subsequ ently withdrawn to replenish cash common to other activities implemented by the partn er thus defeating the purposes of using separate bank account for the unhcr project in rmsa all payments in 2002 had been made in cash but improvements took pl ace in 2003 with payments of salaries and for shelter made by cheque vocational training 23 unhcr tirana spent approximately us 500 00 for vocational training activities to be implemented by cff and rmsa the outcomes of the project implemented by cff were low in regard to the resour ces involved some us 46000 only eight out of the 16 initially selecte d beneficiaries completed the programme and only four trainees were successful in getting jobs international catholic migration commission icmc 24 despite the fact that some key internal co ntrols were in place oios could not assess the icmc albania internal control system as satisfactory icmcs controls for approval of payments were not properly performed i cmc did not pay attention to prorate the expenditure common to various projects and first charged common costs to unhcr ie salaries charged by hqs and other paym ents made locally office rental communication maintenance of vehicles etc as result in june 2002 the budget for some lines was already overspent at the end of 2002 it was decided that icmc will absorb the overcharge of us 34523 and unhcr will consent for expenditures 6 up to the budget allocated despite the fact that t hey did not necessarily represent the actual project disbursement 25 icmc was allocated an amount of us 19748 as support costs however corresponding ips contribution to the project was reported to unhcr in accordance with the rules icmc needs to provide unhcr with ev idence of its contribution to the project or to the same beneficiaries with its wn funds oios recommended that the unhcr representation in albania request icmc to provide evidence of its contribution to the project for an amount at least equivalent to the support costs allocated by unhcr the expenditures of us 34523 initially overcharged by icmc and rejected by unhcr should not be considered as facto contribution from icmc to the unhcr project icmc did not provide hcr with evidence that the overcharges were directly related to assistance to unhcr beneficiaries c supply management 26 oios review of supply management activiti covered 2002 and 2003 the internal controls on asset were found weak mainly d ue to the rotation of staff inadequate training lack of supervision and lack f the verification of records and physical assets since asset management is an area which the board of auditors has again highlighted as problem area attention needs to be given to address the issues identified in our review of the procurement activities we considered not only the transactions made during the period covered by the audit but also the requirements related to the implementation of the cards project which involve significant procurement the representation stated that the problems in asse t management dated back to the 1999 kosovo crisis when huge qua ntities of vehicles computers and other equipment had been received and subsequen tly redeployed to the neighbouring countries oios appreciates that many of the problems have bee n inherited from the initial emergency operation and that it takes major efforts to address them now in the view of oios this demonstrates on ce more the need for unhcr to put proper systems and procedures in place at the b eginning of largescale emergency operations asset management 27 assettrak records maintained in albania we re not up to date and had not been reconciled with hqs records there was differenc of some us 312000 between the total acquisition value recorded at hq us 37 74437 and recorded in albania us 4086365 field records had not always been updated to reflect the decisions of the lamb and hamb some items already donated were still recorded as active assets other items which the controller recommen ded for redeployment sale or transfer of ownership were still recorded as nona ctive assets in two cases where the hamb did not endorse the recommendation of the lamb the corresponding assets which are longer with unhcr tirana were still shown in assettrak the hamb recommended the sale of computer equipment which u nhcr tirana had already donated to hospital prior to seeking the approva l of the hamb 28 the inventory of active assets included as sets with an acquisition value of us 163000 which had been handed over to implementing partners who were longer 7 working with unhcr it was not possible to find out whether these assets still existed nor to determine their location furthermore the records showed 63 items intransit with an acquisition value of some us 270000 incl uding two light vehicles and one heavy vehicle although there was recent redeplo yment the representation stated that these assets had been redeployed long time ago and has initiated correction of the assettrak data 29 there were 16 light vehicles currently use d in tirana in april 2004 compared to 20 recorded in assettrak review of the recor ds revealed that three vehicles have been sold four vehicles could not be found ne vehicle had been transferred from active to nonactive status following lambs decision and two vehicles currently used by unhcr were not in assettrak one of them had been incorrectly recorded as redeployed for computer equipment ass ettrak records indicated 128 active items while only 63 were used by unhcr or w ere in stock waiting for lamb decision total of 28 portable and 21 deskto p computers were missing only 34 power supplies ups were found during the physi cal inventory of computer equipment when the records indicated 190 items in t he power supply and generators category assettrak also showed two warehouses and water equipment of whose existence we could find evidence the representation has taken action to determine the actual situation of these assets and to update the assettrak records accordingly 30 physical inventory was completed during the period covered by the audit except for communication equipment but this exerci was not efficient since it was carried out without comparison with the assettrak r ecords physical inventory and an attempt of reconciliation with the records were carried out during the audit for vehicles and for computer equipment including powe r supplies ups oios recommended that the representation conduct physi cal inventory reconcile its assettrak records with the corresponding records ma intained at hq and reflect the hambs recommendations in the assettrak records the representation confirmed that physical inventory had now been conducted t he office would put full efforts to reconcile the assettrak records and would seek the assistance of hq as required procurement 31 oios reviewed the records for bidding proc esses made in 2002 and 2003 for both administrative and programme purchases we ted that three bidders for office supplies issued quotations for all the 37 items req uired the same bidder quoted the lowest price for all items which is somewhat unusu the same situation was observed for warehousing loading and transport ser vices made in january 2002 the successful bidder submitted the lowest price for l types of warehousing services the bidding process resulted in renewing the ct of pelikan with an increase in cost this raised doubts in the reliability and th transparency of the bidding process the representation assured that unhcr procurement p rocedures would be adhered to taking into consideration the local pro curement conditions 32 in view of planned local procurement for t he cards project additional measures should be taken to ensure that any bidding process leads to more competitive price and purchasing conditions for instance s urvey of the market price for 8 significant items should be done and documented in order to be compared to the bid received oios recommended that the unhcr represent ation in albania improve its internal control to systematically analyse the bids received and compare the offer with general conditions in the open market procurement by the implementing partners 33 none of the local partners were prequalif ied for procurement as consequence procurement activities exceeding us 20000 have been delegated to them however for cff budget of some us 235000 had been allocated for phase ii of the rehabilitation of the reception centre u nhcr tirana authorized cff to award the contract to the contractor for phase i wi thout tendering process the ex post facto justification given to the hcc for selec ting this contractor was that the contractor had agreed to execute the works at the p riceunit cost of the original bid made in 2001 which would imply substantial savings for unhcr 34 cff was also in charge of recruiting train ers for vocational training which was done without price comparison cff could not exp lain how the trainers were invited to submit their offers the contracts with the tra iners were not properly drafted which lead to some implementation problems 35 the implementing partners are not register ed for vat reimbursement to obtain vat refund contractors invoices must there fore be issued in the name of unhcr cff did not follow unhcrs instructions in t hat regard as result unhcr might not be able to obtain the refund of vat totalling some us 25000 d security and safety 36 basic security measures are in place in hcr tirana they consisted of the use of guards 24 hours day unhcr official part icipating in the weekly inter agency security meetings training session for curity has been carried out purchase of protective glass film etc however there was evidence that proper assessment of the guard service has been made recently to ensu re that the services provided are in accordance with standards the representation stated that the unfso would be requested to undertake periodical assessment of t he services provided by the security company 37 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr representation tirana generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the peri od under review administration medical insurance plan 38 the dental fees corresponded to between 40 and 60 per cent of the total amount of the reimbursement of medical claims unh cr tirana took some measures to verify whether the services had been pr ovided this control does aim to assess whether the costs incurred by the staff are reasonable the most significant 9 claims should be analysed and any high value claim s should be compared to the monthly salary of the claimant in order to determin its reasonableness the representation stated that ceilings for each type f medical treatment had been established on the basis of recent survey communications costs 39 communications expenditures for 2002 and 2 003 amounted to some us 115000 which is considerable in regard to the siz of the office in order to reduce these charges new type of arrangement for electr onic communications was initiated in april 2004 other actions should be envisaged ch as limiting the access to international calls and reducing the access to the internet there was in each section telephone with access to international calls and th ere was 2424 hours access to the internet with an annual cost of us 8400 the representation has discussed cost saving measures in meeting with all staff members 40 the number of private calls was exceptiona lly high because the cost of using unhcr communication facilities were only about 40 p er cent of the cost of commercial provider the office had system in pla ce to collect the cost of private calls from the staff however the calculation of t he charges to be reimbursed by the staff and the recording of the reimbursements was t ime consuming for the finance section the representative stated that in future staff memb ers would be requested to calculate the cost of their private calls for verif ication by the finance section this new procedure is expected to reduce the administrat ive workload human resources management 41 human resources management in tirana was m arked by the reduction of the number of authorized staff from 75 in 2000 to 11 in april 2004 which required the termination of contracts revision of the structure and job descriptions etc the rate of downsizing was however reduced in 2003 since unhcr was identified as the lead agency for the implementation of the cards project two staff members on ta who remained with unhcr after their posts were cut wil l work for the implementation of the cards project for the duration of this project 42 oios noted that among the national staff the only persons having background in finance are the two ta staff working for the implementation of the cards project given that an extension to their emp loyment contract is not expected after the end of the project unhcr tirana may face difficulties in running the financial system and maintaining accounting and fin ancial project records the representation stated that the incumbent of the adm inistrativefinance assistant post would be trained in unhcr financial procedures and systems 10 v acknowledgement 43 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditor by the staff of unhcr
