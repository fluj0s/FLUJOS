advertisements on their sites advertisers will pay premium for greater assurance that the advertisement they are purchasing will be seen by users that are most likely to be interested in the product or service offered as result technology has been developed which enables online advertisements to be targeted directly at individual users based on their web surfing activity this practice is widely known as behavioral or ehavioral advertising this individual behavioral targeting has raised number of privacy concerns for instance questions have been asked whether personally iden tifiable information is being collected how the information collected is being protected and whether current laws are being violated if data are being collected without the consent of the parties involved it is often unclear whether current laws such as the electronic communications privacy act and the communications act apply to online advertising providers that are collecting data through click tracking capturing search terms and other methods however it is likely that in many cases these laws could be held to apply to such activities and that these methods of data collection would be forbidden unless consent is obtained from one of the parties to the communication this report will examine the application of these statutes to online behavioral advertising in more detail there are current federal regulations specific to online behavioral advertising the federal trade commission ftc has put forth number of guiding principles intended to aid the industry in creating selfregulatory

selling advertising space on their sites advertisers will pay premium for ads that are more likely to reach their target demographic in other media such as broadcasting advertisers engage in targeting by purchasing advertising time during programs that those who buy their products are most likely to watch the internet presented new challenges and opportunities for advertisers to re ach their target audiences technology has been developed that allows advertisers to target advertising to individual web users this is seen as an advantage for advertisers because rather than aiming their ads at groups of people who visit particular site their ads are aimed at the individual user this maximizes the odds that the user who sees the ad will be interested in the produc t or service it touts targeting advertising to individuals involves gathering information about that individuals web surfing habits the collection of this information has raised concerns among some over the privacy of web activity particularly if the data collected are personally identifiable some have alleged that online advertisers are violating privacy laws by collecting these data in online advertisings simplest form commercial website rents out space on its site to another website which places hot link banner advertisement in that space 1 the banner ad when clicked sends the user directly to the advertisers website in this scenario matter who visits particular website that user will see the same advertisement regardless of whether heshe may be interested in that product or service however many advertisers will pay premium for the increased likelihood that users viewing their advert isement would be interested in the product or service offered as result technology has developed to more accurately target online ads to the desired audience online advertising providers such as doubleclick and nebuad have developed the ability to target ads to individual internet users who would be most interested in seeing those ads these techniques are known generally as behaviorally targeted advertising behaviorally targeted advertising delivers ads that are geared toward specific internet users by tracking certain though not necessarily all web activity of each user and inferring each users interests based on that activity most online advertising providers monitor individual internet users by placing persistent cookie on that users computer cookies are small text files that can store information persistent cookies reside on hard drive indefinitely unlike most cookies which expire when browser window is closed generally online advertisers give the cookies they place on user computers unique alphanumeric code that identifies that user to the advertising company purportedly without revealing any persona lly identifiable information cookies may be placed on an individuals computer when an individual visits website affiliated with the online advertisement supplier however the exact moment of cookie placement may be different when the relevant advertising partnership is between users internet service provider isp and an online advertising provider 1 for basic description of

that users online activity on continuous basis and relays that information to the online advertising provider the advertising provider assembles that data into an individual profile that is then used to target advertising to that users interests this process is ongoing but in general the user may opt out of continued monitoring at any point assuming they are aware that it is occurring in most types of behaviorally targeted advertising technology the advertising firm gathers information about user activities on websites that are affiliated with the advertising firm the behavioral advertiser doubleclick for instance operates on this model information on individual users is transmitted to doubleclick by doubleclicks clients in newly emerging behavioral advertising model the advertising provider is attempting to partner with the users isp this partnership will presumably grant the advertising provider access to all web activity in which an isps subscribers engage both of these types of potential partnerships raise number of questions regarding potential violations of existing privacy protections in federal law

providers websites and isps that agree to collect certain data generated by internet traffic to behaviorally target advertising may be violating the electronic communications privacy act ecpa100 stat 1848 18 usc 2510 2521 2 ecpa is an amendment to title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 87 stat 197 18 usc 25102520 1970 ed which prohibits the interception of electronic communications unless an exception to the general prohibition applies3 this section will discuss the potential application of ecpa to online advertising providers and the potential application of ecpa to isps g22g145g142g561g17g151g149g146g151g142g561g3g141g159g142g155g157g146g156g146g151g144g561g18g155g152g159g146g141g142g155g561 the first question that must be addressed is whether ecpa applies to the activities of online advertising providers online advertising providers are acquiring information such as the fact that user clicked on particular link an action which is the equivalent of asking the site providing the link to send the user information and they are acquiring that information while the communication is in transit 4 furthermore these advertisers may acquire information such as words entered into search engine or answers to online forms while it is in transit5 under ecpa it is illegal with certain enumerated exceptions for any person to intentionally intercept endeavor to intercept or procure any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept any wire oral or electronic communication6 it is important to lay out the statutory definitions of each of the key terms in order to assess whether the ecpa prohibition andor any of its exceptions applies to activities conducted by online behavioral advertisers 2 testimony of ms leslie harris ceo of the center for

wire electronic or oral communication through the use of any electronic mechanical or other device7 contents when used with respect to any wire oral or electronic communication includes any information concerning the substance purport or meaning of that communication8 electronic communication means any transfer of signs signals writing images sounds data or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by wire radio electromagnetic photoelectronic or photo optical system that affects interstate or foreign commerce 9 because the advertisers record that particular user requested information from website by clicking on particular link or sent informati on to website via search entry or other method the advertisers appear to be intercepting the contents of those electronic communications therefore the interceptions are likely covered by ecpa10 merely determining that this type of data acqui sition by online advertisers is an interception for the purposes of ecpa does not end the analysis ecpa excepts certain communication interceptions from its prohibition the exception to ecpa that would most likely apply to these types of interceptions is the exception that allows for interception of communications with the consent of one of the parties11 the question of when and how consent to the interception may be given is addressed below g22g145g142g561g11g151g157g142g155g151g142g157g561g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g561g18g155g152g159g146g141g142g155g561 the second question to be addressed is whether ecpa applies to isp providers that would allow online advertising providers to gather data from traffic over the isps network ecpa prohibits any person or entity providing an electronic communications service from intentionally divulging the contents of any communications while in transmission on that service to any person or entity other than an addressee or intended recipi ent of such communications or an agent of such addressee or intended recipient12 the same definitions outlined in the previous section apply here this section seems to apply to isps that would agree to allow online advertising providers to acquire portions of the web traffic of isp customers because the isp would be allowing the advertising providers to acquire the contents of communications while they are in transmission 7 18 usc 25104 8 18 usc 25108 9 18 usc 251012 10 it is worth noting that there has yet to be court case to decide definitively that ecpa applies to this type of data collection in the cases cited here the online advertising providers made their cases by assuming but not conceding that ecpa applied to the data collection see in re pharmatrk inc privacy litigations 329 f3d 9 1st cir 2003 in re doubleclick inc privacy litigation 154 fsupp 2d 497 sdny 2001 11 it shall not be unlawful under this chapter for person not acting under color of law to intercept wire oral or electronic communication where such person is party to the communication or where one of the parties to the communications has given prior consent to such interception unless such communication is intercepted for the purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act in violation of th constitution or laws of the united states or any state 18 usc 25112d 12 18 usc 25113a httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34693g18g155g146g159g138g140g162g561g14g138g160g561g138g151 g141g561g17g151g149g146g151g142g561g3g141g159g142 g155g157g146g156g146g151g144g561 g561

the addressee or intended recipient of the communications again determining that the data collection is likely an interception for the purposes of ecpa does not end the analysis an ecpa exception may apply isps are allowed to intercept communications while in transit if such interception is part of any activity which is necessary incident to the rendition of that service or to the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that service 13 it does not seem likely that this exception applies to isps when contracting with online advertising providers though the service for which they contract may help keep the websites of the advertising providers clients free to the public by producing advertising revenue the interception is not necessary to maintain an isps proper function or solvency and therefore likely is not necessary to the rendition of internet access service14 isps also are allowed to divulge the contents of communication in transit with the lawful consent of the originator or any addressee or intended recipient of such communication15 if the isps obtain the consent of their customers to intercept some of their online activities this exception to ecpa would seem to apply again the questions of how and when consent may be obtained and what constitutes lawful consent arise and are addressed in the following section g22g145g142g561g5g152g151g156g142g151g157g561g7g161g140g142g153g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g7g5g18g3g561 as noted above interception of electronic communications is not prohibited by ecpa if one of the parties to the communications has consented to the interception consent is not defined by ecpa nor do precise instructions of how and when consent may be obtained under ecpa appear in regulation therefore it has been left largely to the courts to determine when consent to intercept communication otherwise covered by ecpas prohibitions has been granted 16 there have been few cases dealing with ecpas application to online advertising providers and none examining ecpas application to agreements between isp providers and online advertising providers as result many openended questions exist regarding how to obtain adequate consent this section first will examine whether the consent exception to ecpa applies to data collection agreements between online advertising providers and website operators it will then examine whether and how the consent exception applies to data collection agreements between isps and online advertising providers 13 18 usc 25112ai 14 see

provider and the website operators seeking to have ads placed on their sites the advertising providers receive information about user activity on participating websites and aggregate that data to better target ads in litigation against the online advertising provider doubleclick for violations of ecpa the court examined whether websites were users of electronic communications services under ecpa 17 ecpa defines user as any person or entity who uses an electronic communication service and b is duly authorized by the provider of such service to engage in such use18 the court reasoned that websites are users and therefore parties to the communications at issue because they actively respond to requests they receive over electronic communications services by deciding whether to send the requested document breaking the document down into tcpip protocol and sending the packets over the internet 19 because websites are users of electronic communications the court found that websites are also parties to the communications in dispute therefore website owners have the ability to consent to communications interception20 the court also held that the website operators had consented by virtue of their contract with doubleclick to allow the company to intercept cert ain traffic on their websites in order to target advertising to website visitors21 consent for private interceptions of electronic communications cannot be granted if the purpose of the interception is the commission of criminal or tortious conduct22 the court noted that the focus of the determination of criminal or tortious purpose under ecpa is not upon whether the interception itself violated another law it is upon whether the purpose for the interceptionits intended usewas criminal or tortious23 applying that standard the court found that the plaintiffs had not alleged that doubleclicks primary motivation for intercepting communications was to injure plaintiffs tortiously in the courts view even if doubleclicks actions ultimately proved tortious or criminal there was evidence that doubleclick was motivated by tortious intent as result the court found that the consent exception to ecpa was satisfied24 in similar suit against online advertising provider pharmatrak the court outlined limitations to the consent exception regarding these types of agreements in that case pharmatrak had contracted with certain drug companies to provide advertising on their websites included in the agreement was permission for the advertising provider to record certain web traffic that did not include personally identifiable information25 perhaps inadvertently the online advertising provider did collect small amount of personally identifiable information though it had pledged 17 in re doubleclick

such interception the court disagreed according to the court it is for the party granting consent to define its scope and the parties in this case had not consented to the collection of personally identifiable information26 in collecting personally identifiable information by intercepting data without the consent of one of the parties the online advertiser potentially had violated ecpa but may have lacked the requisite intent to be found liable under the statute27 the appeals court directed the trial court to conduct further investigation into the matter given the conclusions in the above cases it appears that online advertising providers like doubleclick that partner to collect data from individual websites generally are not violating ecpa because the websites are parties to the communication with the ability to consent to interception based on these cases the advertising providers will not be seen as running afoul of ecpa so long as the data the advertising providers collect do not fall outside the scope of the data the advertising providers clients have agreed to disclose

on the other hand when the partnership is between the isp and the online advertising provider neither of the parties to the agreement to intercept web traffic is party to the communications that are being intercepted therefore it would appear that consent for the interceptions must be obtained from individual customers of the isps the questions in these circumstances are whether consent must be affirmative or if it can be implied and if consent must be affirmative what process must be used to obtain such consent from individual users

circumstances of communications while consent may be implied it may not be casually inferred 28 it seems unlikely as result that merely by using an isps service customer of that service has implied her consent to the interception of her electronic communications by online advertising providers if consent likely may not be implied simply from use of an isps service then form of affirmative

online advertising providers the debate centers around whether isps and advertisers must obtain optin consent or if they may continue to obtain optout consent for these interceptions optin consent is obtained when party to the communication is notified that his or her isp has agreed to allow an online advertiser to track that persons online activity in order to better target advertising to that person the advertiser however may not begin to track that individuals web activity until the individual responds to the tification granting permission for such activity 30 if the individual never responds interception can never begin optout consent by contrast is obtained when party to the communication is notified that his or her isp has agreed to allow an online advertiser to track that persons online activity and the advertising provider will begin such tracking unless the individual notifies the isp or the advertiser that he or she does not grant permission for such activity31 if the individual never responds interception will begin currently it appears that companies such as nebuad are obtaining or planning to obtain optout consent for the information gathering they engage in with isps32 the present question is whether opt out consent is sufficient to satisfy the ecpa consent requirement this question has yet to be addressed by federal court or clarified by legislation or regulation however as discussed below if section 631 of the communications act applies to this type of data collection optin consent may already be required for cable companies acting as isps though this may not be required of telco companies such as verizon or tt that operate as isps

and must take action to prevent unauthorized access to personally identifiable information by anyone other than the subscriber or cable operator37 nebuad has argued that section 631 does not apply to the activities of cable operators when cable operators are acting as cable modem service providers38 section 631 governs the protection of information about subscribers to any cable service or other service provided by cable operator other service is defined as any wire or radio communications service provided using any of the facilities of cable operator that are used in the provision of cable service 39 in its order classifying cable modem services as information services the fcc stated the belief that cable modem service would be included in the category of other service for the purposes of section 63140 furthermore in 1992 congress added the term other services to section 631 as part of the cable television and consumer protection and competition act 41 the house conference report on the law clarified that provisions redefining the term other services were included in order to ensure that new communications services provided by cable operators are covered by the privacy protections of section 63142 section 631 is judicially enforced however and it is for the courts to interpret the scope of its application absent more specific guidance from congress43 it is unclear whether all of the provisions of section 631 encompass internet services other services have been interpreted by at least one district court to encompass internet services44 on the other hand in 2006 the sixth circuit court of appeals found that the plain language of section 631b precluded its application to broadband internet service45 section 631b prohibits cable operators from using their cable systems to collect personally identifiable information without the consent of subscribers46 the court based its decision that internet services were not covered by this prohibition on its interpretation of the definition of cable systems47 the court found that the systems that deliver internet services are not the systems that section 631b addresses and therefore cable operators were not prohibited by section 631b from collecting personally identifiable information over systems that delivered internet access services the supreme court has yet to rule on this issue even if section 631b does not prevent cable operators from collecting personally identifiable information over broadband internet services ction 631c may prohibit the disclosure of such information to third parties

operator shall not disclose personally identifiable information co ncerning any subscriber without the prior written or electronic consent of the subscriber concerned and shall take such actions as are necessary to prevent unauthorized access to such information by person other than the subscriber or cable operator49 if cable operator as an isp agrees to allow an online advertising provider to inspect traffic over its cable system and to acquire some of that information it seems that the cable operatorisp is disclosing information to the online advertising provider such disclosure would apparently be violation of the communications act if 1 the information disclosed is personally identifiable information and 2 the cable operatorisp is disclosing it without the prior written or electronic consent of the subscribers to whom the information pertains whether online advertising providers are gathering personally identifiable information in order to provide their services is matter of much debate section 631 does not define what personally identifiable information is it defines what personally identifiable information is not according to 631 personally identifiable information pii does not include any record of aggregate data which does not identify particular persons 50 online advertising providers claim that they do not collect any personally identifiable information51 public interest groups and other commentators disagree citing scenarios in which data which was not supposed to contain personally identifiable information was used to identify individuals52 because section 631 is judicially enforced it is likely that whether online advertisers are acquiring personally identifiable information as opposed to aggregate data that do not identify particular persons will be determination made by federal trial court to date there have been cases addressing this question assuming even that online advertising providers are gathering personally identifiable information cable operators are allowed to disclose personally identifiable information as long as they obtain the prior written or electronic consent of the relevant subscribers essentially an opt in standard 53 in the event that online advertising co mpanies are determined to be gathering personally identifiable information and that section 631c applies to cable operators in their provision of cable modem services cable operators would be required to obtain consent for such disclosure under an optin regime 48 47 usc 551c1 49 47 usc 551c1 cable operators however may collect such information without consent for the purposes of obtaining information necessary to provide cable services or other services provided to the subscriber or to detect

express consent to use sensitive data for behavioral advertising implementing reasonable security for data collected and limiting the time such data is retained 55 the ftc has also suggested that every website where data are collected provide clear concise consumerfriendly and prominent statement that 1 data about consumers activities online is being collected at the site and 2 consumers can choose whether or not to have their information collected56 these principles were published on the ftcs website in december of 2007 the ftc also sought comments from the public on the principles the comment period closed in april of 2008 the comments received were posted on the ftcs website in order to aid in the development of selfregulatory programs57 the ftc noted that though the agency
