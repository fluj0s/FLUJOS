najaf as the epicenter of shia islam carries significant importance for iran and its overall campaign to expand its sphere of influence in iraq and the region the city is home to many iranian pilgrims and traders eager to profit spiritually and financially from the citys religious and commercial offerings there is general awareness and acknowledgment among many iraqis that irans influence albeit historic reality does not always translate into mutual benefit for najafis many also acknowledge that iran will continue to capitalize on its ties to the city in order to foster greater socioeconomic dependencies the extent of its ability to influence the ways of the marjaiyyah are more limited particularly during sistanis tenure given the clerical establishments unrivaled theocratic and geographic prominence when compared to its sister city qom hill
