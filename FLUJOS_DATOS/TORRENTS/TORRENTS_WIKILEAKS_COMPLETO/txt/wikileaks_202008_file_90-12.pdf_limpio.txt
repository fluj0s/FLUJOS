defense of joint base executive summary this publication provides doctrinal guidelines commanders and staffs may use to establish the defense and security of joint bases the joint base defense coordination requirements and basic principles described herein should remain relatively constant although variations in size and type of us forces hostnation agreements and unique command relationships may require modification of selected procedures operational concepts joint bases could be setup almost anywhere in the world to support wide variety of missions and national objectives the threats to such bases can range from terrorism to large conventional forces for purposes of defense planning these threats are divided into three levels thorough knowledge of types of conflict and levels of threat are fundamental to base defense analysis and planning base defense includes all active and passive measures that commanders can take to secure their facilities equipment and personnel they must analyze organize and plan their defenses using the same tenets of any successful military operation they must use the terrain effectively position facilities and equipment advantageously create an effectual indepth defense and provide defense forces with clear areas of responsibility they must assess such concerns as enemy avenues of approach fields of fire entrance control and fire support command and control commanders and staffs must understand the command relationships for base defense precisely they must organize their available forces in the most effective manner possible for defense they must outline and transmit defense missions and responsibilities for all elements assigned to or transiting the base because of the special threat that terrorism poses commanders must make it particular concern from commanders on down personnel should be familiar with the legal aspects of base defense deriving from international laws us laws and hostnation laws as well as from treaties and agreements intelligence and communications success in countering the threat depends on the ability of intelligence activities to collect analyze produce and disseminate userspecific threat information as quickly as possible commanders of bases must use all vavailable assets to develop viable intelligence programs for defense they must develop reliable and redundant communications systems flexible enough to support the overall security scheme hostnation support integrating us base defense assets and hns is vital to successful base defense hns will help relieve us assets for other missions and complement the overall base security program planning for hns must occur within the framework of established nationtonation agreements however hns must still function as an

to menchapter 1 operational concepts joint base could be established in support of treaties and agreements between the us and friendly country or in support of military mission us bases present lucrative targets because friendly forces and equipment performing missionessential functions concentrate there to disrupt such operations the enemy will devote high degree of effort ranging from conventional military attacks to random terrorism joint base defense prevents degradation of base functions by detecting engaging and destroying enemy forces before they can succeed in accomplishing their mission in most parts of the world this objective will be met not only by joint operations but also by combined operations that depend heavily on hostnation support hns assets and coordination due to the unique environment of lowintensity conflict lic and the special challenges it represents considerations peculiar to lic are highlighted throughout for purposes of base defense operations significant definitions are shown in figure 11 types of conflict an indepth understanding of the threat to the joint base is vital in the overall development of defensive plan therefore both military and civilian intelligence and security forces must coordinate closely when planning the base defense and when they carry it out mid and highintensity conflicts during fullscale war nations will use conventional forces to seek satisfactory conclusion of hostilities forces will conduct large scale operations joint bases that support us operations will likely be prime targets for attack during mid and highintensity conflicts bases could be subjected to largescale air attacksnuclear biological chemical nbc attacks or major ground attacks such attacks intend to disrupt base operations discredit us forces and display enemy prowess the enemy may also try to sway us public opinion against the conflict by inflicting heavy losses on us personnel and equipment deep operations soviet doctrine stresses the concept of deep operations so do many warsaw pact nations whose leaders are trained in soviet doctrine whose equipment follows soviet design and whose forces are generally configured after the soviet model soviet doctrine stresses 11combination of massed fires on key objectives and rapid concentration of maneuver forces to seize the offense after opening breach in order to conduct highspeed deep attacks into the opponents rear area these operations are executed in close coordination with airborne heliborne and amphibious assault landings tactical missile employment and highspeed deep ground penetrations these operations may use conventional and nuclear arms chemical fires and deep recon the purpose of such operations is to disrupt our rear area reducing our efficiency and ability to support close and deep operations recon and sabotage special purpose forces such as soviet spetsnaz or north korean commandorangers are specifically trained for recon and sabotage they may secretly try to enter and disrupt joint base they may also activate sleeper agents and cell networks to develop and control partisan operations in the rear area lowintensity conflicts lowintensity conflicts lics are political military confrontations between contending states or groups below conventional war and above the routine peaceful competition among statesthey frequently involve protracted struggles of competing principles and ideologies lics range from subversion to the use of armed forces they are waged by combination of means employing political economic informational and military instruments lics are often localized generally in the third world but contain regional and global security implications1 lic involves the actual or contemplated use of military capabilities up to but not including sustained combat between regular forces the factors which lead to lic are complex often shortterm actions cannot resolve them success in lic environment depends upon applying all elements of national power effectively and defining goals and objectives clearly political objectives establish the limits and constraints for military operations and for social political and economic programs lic is not new form of aggression throughout history groups have sought to achieve their goals through various limited actions embargoes blockades demonstrations of military capabilities incitement of and support for 1dod dictionary of military and associated terms jcs pub 102insurgents harassment at borders incursions and intimidation conflict remains at the lic level when at least one of the belligerents has limited resources or when both want to avoid either the greater cost or greater risk involved in more intense effort lics may arise as an integral part of eastwest worldwide rivalry or may develop independently of usussr competition in lic us military forces may have four general kinds of missions peacekeeping operations combating terrorism peacetime contingency operations and insurgency counterinsurgency see glossary forces may have to conduct several of these missions at the same time and in the same area of operations ao during several lics us resolve has been highlighted in all parts of the world for future lics the us will probably use joint force incorporating elements from all the services to support such force the us may need to establish base from which to conduct operations the us could establish joint base in passive or potentially hostile hn in such case the political environment in the us hn and the world could generate lowintensity conflicts that would adversely affect joint base defense operations restrictions and constraints on our ability to reinforce buildup or enhance security at joint base could result therefore the entire chain of command including state department representatives constantly needs to know aboutany possible situations which may adversely affect our ability to safeguard us personnel and equipment levels of threat defense is normally an incremental response to perceived threats as the threat increases so does the level of defense defenders hope that threat increases will occur well ahead of an actual attack dividing enemy actions into three levels serves to guide base defense planning all three levels that could confront joint base are discussed below level i level i threats are those which can be defeated by base or base cluster selfdefense measures level ii level ii threats are those which are beyond base or base cluster selfdefense capabilities but which can be defeated by response forces normally military police with supporting fires 12level iiiconcentrate at critical times and places level iii threats are those which necessitate the command decision to commit combined arms tactical combat force tcf to defeat the threat the fundamentals of base defense understand the enemy defenders must be thoroughly familiar with the capabilities and limitations of enemy weapons and equipment they should know enemy force organization deployment and tactics ultimately the us commander must determine the intent of enemy activity see the battlefield prior to the battle defending commanders must organize to defeat any type of attack from all possible directions during the intelligence preparationofthebattlefield ipb process commanders acquire knowledge of the enemy and terrain using this knowledge they predict threat operations they must then conduct operations to learn enemy location organization direction of movement and strength commanders must have continuous flow of information on which to base decisions they must also have effective operations security opsec to deny similar friendly information to the enemy see appendix b section iii use the defenders advantages defenders advantages are numerous and could permit numerically inferior force to defeat much larger one defenders must become totally familiar with the terrain before battle if possible they must prepare the ground in advance by building obstacles firing positions and routes between positions defenders can fight from cover fire from stationary platforms or positions shift forces among prepared positions plan communications control measures fires and logistical support to fit any predictable situation defenders must force attackers to canalize their forces and minimize their chances to maneuver attackers must be forced to adhere to their initial plans or risk annihilation attackers may also have to alter plans as the situation develops and risk an uncoordinated effort defenders can also camouflage their positions and use deceptive measurescommanders who understand the enemy see the situation and the developing battle better than the enemy and use the defenders advantages to shift forces quickly commanders must concentrate forces at critical points so that locally engaged forces can generate combat power to defeat enemy attacks locally engaged forces must then shift to other positions to concentrate combat power against other threats during the battle coordinate available defense assets indirect fire systems air defense artillery tactical aircraft engineers dismounted troops armored vehicles and helicopters can each make vital contribution to overall base security but none by itself is the answer to successful base defense they must combine with one another in order to maximize their strengths and minimize their vulnerabilities balance base security with political constraints in lic base security measures must balance with political constraints this fundamental can be the most frustrating but the most critical in joint base defense during lic base security will have to be designed around numerous political constraints and often under the scrutiny of the pressfor example constraints could involve restrictions on defensive construction limitations on the number of security personnel or stringent rules of engagement roe coordination between us state department officials and the staff of the area commander in chief cinc will be essential to ensure that base defense is within us strategic objective guidelines finally the presence of friendly civilians in the area requires commanders to use minimum force against the enemy unintentional harm to local civilians could enhance support for the enemy and adversely affect the success of military operations know the law and rules of engagement us commanders an senior advisors and their subordinates must be familiar with the legal basis for their presence in foreign country in order to assist its government and armed forces us personnel should understand the basics of international and domestic law that authorize base defense operations and the restrictions the law imposes upon personnel see chapter 3 further the theater cinc will develop clearly stated specific roe for all us forces 13chapter 2 analysis and planning commanders at all levels must continuously monitor local threat indicators and essential elements of enemy information they must ensure that their intelligence officers develop realistic priority intelligence requirements pirs see chapter 4 timely receipt and proper analysis of such information enable commanders to tailor their active defense plans while maintaining their primary missions local commanders must set up both active and passive plans to defend bases against conventional operations and various lic threats2 analysis after carefully reviewing the threat against the base commanders and leaders at all levels must organize their defenses using active and passive measures such as establishing guard posts in the immediate vicinity of vital areas deploying forward patrols to prevent insur gents from closing vital areas this defense should be based on mission enemy terrain troops and time available mettt mission the unit mission statement should specify who will defend where the unit will defend when it will be prepared to defend why it will defend what it will defend the unit mission or other missions on base may seem more important to us efforts than the base defense mission however base defense is fundamental to the success of missions that support the overall operation therefore commanders must stress the importance of base defense to all personnel and ensure their direct involvement the five essential actions of the base defense mission are detect an enemy attempt must be detected in its earliest stageswarn the detected attempt must result in an alarm the base must be warned that an attack is imminent or under way and all us forces must report to their assigned base defense positions deny allowing the enemy to damage its target jeopardizes the defense mission the defenders must minimize the damage and deny the enemys attempt at the target destroy to prevent future attempts by the same force defenders must destroy the enemy before it can withdraw in lic the enemy may be hard to identify and may blend into the population thus collateral civilian casualties are possible in lic and could adversely affect the overall success of military operations fenders must take great care to identify the enemy and to point combat efforts directly at it delay if the initial defenders cannot deny or destroy the enemy alone they must delay it until adequate combat power arrives enemy commanders consider how their defenses will 2this chapter describes an ideal security posture political andmilitary situations may dictate more austere and restricted measures use this chapter as the basis for viable security plan see also the sample base defense plan in appendix and the additional unit tactical security precautions in appendix bidentify and counter the location direction size and method of attack anticipate enemy ground and aerial avenues of approach counter the effects of enemy firepower mo bility and electronic warfare ew negate the enemys strengths such as speed of attack and numerical superiority exploit the enemys command scheme ofand control maneuverweaknesses such as difficulties and rigid 20terrain the us could establish base almost anywhere from an existing hn airfield or port to jungle clearing the choice of terrain may be more significant than subsequent improvements or decisions when selecting base location commanders should consider elevation occupying or controlling high ground is especially important to deny an enemy direct observation or fire into the base commanders should also consider the economic political and psychological impact on the local area as well as on the hn in general hn agreements and considerations may restrict base construction and security enhancements before site selection and construction defenders should conduct an extensive ipb analysis such an analysis will prevent construction in major threat areas and place the base in defensible trafficable terrain list of specialized base defense equipment and materiel is at appendix c terrain forms the natural structure of the battlefield joint base defense force commanders must recognize terrain limitations and possibilities using them to protect base operations and to put the enemy at disadvantage to do so they and commanders at all levels must personally examine the terrain starting with map recon reinforced by terrain walks and if possible aerial surveys commanders analyzing terrain must consider all military aspects including observation and fields of fire cover and concealment obstacles and movement key terrain and avenues of approach ocoka observation and fields of fire contour and vegetation affect observation and fire our directfire weapons are less effective and the enemy can move with less risk where visibility is limited by large forests jungles builtup areas tracts of broken ground commanders increase the defensive posture of their bases by having vegetation cleared by properly siting observation posts and directfire weapons and by compensating with indirect fire and aerial observation for example hilltops and the tops of buildings make excellent observation posts or radar sites but are rarely satisfactory positions for directfire weapons tanks directfire missiles and machine guns must be sited where they have the best fields of fire and their effects aregreatest indirect fire can cover areas not directly observable remote sensors can detect enemy movement and cue artillery aircraft can provide overwatch from flanking positions in woods and valleys inaccessible to ground troops cover and concealment cover is protection from observation and fire whether maneuvering on the ground or in the air forces should seek the best protection of covering terrain slopes folds and depressions can protect unit from observation and fire or hide forces serving to preserve the strength of the force covered positions are as important to command posts indirect fire units reserves combat support cs units and combat service support css units as they are to close combat units dispersing units among multiple covered positions can provide considerable cover concealment is protection from observation urbanized terrain broken hills high ground and forests can be used to hide forces but terrain alone cannot conceal force or facility in operations against sophisticated forces to conceal units and headquarters commanders must also limit electronic and thermal emissions use camouflage to conceal personnel and equipment use covert relocation to help prevent the tection of hidden units even in fluid conditions forces will be able to find concealment for short periods concealing force can be great tactical advantage defenders can use concealment to draw the enemy deep into prepared defensive areas attackers can use it to avoid being detected or engaged as they approach defended positions deceptive measures such as decoys or simulated forces also give significant tactical advantage obstacles and movement few areas are truly impassable thus commanders should protect difficult approaches into their positions against surprise enemy attacks roads ridgelines river valleys and plains are highspeed approaches on which fluid battles may develop rapidly combat elements move slowly on soft sand and through swamps thick forests and broken or mountainous terrain traversable only through defiles or by dismounted forces urban areas also can constitute formidable obstacles 21season and weather can affect trafficability snow and ice on hills can slow mounted movement considerably thaws or rains can quickly change plains to quagmires fog and snow not only adversely affect trafficability but can be excellent concealment for terrorist attack normally an ao will contain mixture of obstructing terrain and avenues suitable for air assault mounted movement or dismounted movement terrain that canalizes movement allows defenders to economize in difficult ground and to concentrate on the dangerous approaches if the terrain is open the attacker will be able to choose among many different approaches and defenders may have to fight mobile battle in depth natural or manmade obstacles parallel to the direction of movement can protect the flanks of attacking or counterattacking forces obstacles across an avenue of approach form lines of resistance for the defenders rail lines small streams and villages along roads do not significantly impede dismounted forces but can significantly slow mounted ones adequately guarded forests and marshes are difficult for unassisted armored forces to penetrate but dismounted infantry can traverse them and air assault forces can envelope them the best approaches are often those which appear unlikely forces can often gain access to highspeed ridge approach by crossing difficult terrain immediately to its front old roadbeds also offer good movement potential because they follow solid ground and are usually not as well defended as improved routes key terrain key terrain is any feature locality or area that affords marked advantage to the controlling force since such an advantage is situational the commander designates key terrain only after analyzing the mission the commander may designate certain key terrain as decisive terrain if the mission depends on retaining it the commander designates decisive terrain in the concept of operation to communicate itsimportance to the staff and subordinate commanders many areas will not have decisive terrain avenues of approach defenders must determine the main approaches to the base that attackers might use as well as internal avenues that permit maneuver againstattackers defenders must evaluate avenues of approach in terms of speed of movement along their entire length potential to accommodate enemy forces of specified number and type access to important areas and adjacent avenues degree of canalization cover and concealment effect on lineofsight communications obstacles defenders must also consider likely drop zones dzs and landing zones lzs for threat airborne or heliborne insertions troops defending against level i threats each base must defend itself against lowlevel threats base defense forces should be organized trained and equipped to defeat level i threats they must also maintain limited capability to detect delay and disrupt level ii and iii forces until friendly response or tactical combat forces tcfs arrive many reararea personnel do not have the training or resources to conduct sustained defensive operations against threat levels ii and iii conducting such operations could disrupt vital support functions and in effect permit threat forces to accomplish their goals however bases must provide their own selfdefense until friendly response forces arrive defeating enemy incursions in rear areas could be us command responsibility or hn agreements may place primary responsibility upon the hn such agreements however do not negate or lessen the responsibilities of us commanders to defend their bases against level i threats and to respond to level ii and iii threats defending against level ii and iii threats designated area response forces will be called upon to defeat level ii threats directed against bases these response forces could be military police or combat forces located in the area tcfis required to defeat level iii force whose capabilities exceed organic base defense forces or area security assets as combined arms organization assigned to fight specific threat 22tcf may contain its own organic artillery or attack helicopters the appropriate echelon commander taskorganizes the tcf through operational channels the tcf commander is assigned an ao and normally assumes operational control opcon of all external base defense forces in the ao until the threat is neutralized the commander of the base may need to retain control of sufficient assets to maintain security of critical resources such needs will be closely coordinated with the area security force the commander of the base and tcf commanders once the threat is neutralized control of external base defense forces will revert to the established command channels evaluating the defense commanders of bases must evaluate how the defense will use organic and hn

appendix d planning after considering the factors of mettt joint base defense force commanders develop defense plan that they and leaders at all levels should use in organizing defense employing forces in base defense areas successful defense of base depends on an aggressive allaround indepth defense the base defense operations center bdoc normally plans such defense for specific details on bdoc responsibilities see chapter 3 to provide an in depth defense commanders of bases establish defense forces within series of defensive rings the screening force area sfa the main defense area mda and the close defense area cda see figure 21 they also establish mobile reserve 23mr or reaction force in reinforce any of these areas defense forces in each area must develop fields of fire and nofire areas and use other control measures keeping in mind the locations of other friendly elements doing so prevents friendly casualties and ensures that fires overlap to create an indepth layered defense screening force area the screening force area is the outer defense ring extending from the mda far enough to keep attackers from surprising base defense forces sfa forces provide early warning to the remaining base defense forces screening forces sfs maintain surveillance over the entire front of the defensive perimeter screening forces provide timely warning of enemy approach gain and maintain visual contact with attackers and report their movement destroy or repel small enemy forces impede the advance of larger enemy forces by engaging them with longrange organic and supporting fire screening forces use series of dismounted observation posts ops listening posts lps and mounted and dismounted patrols in front of the perimeter line ops and lps detect the enemy as far out from the perimeter as possible report sightings to the commander and where rules of engagement allow engage with organic weapons or call for indirect fire on the enemy whenever possible ops and lps will be equipped with remote sensors ground surveillance radar gsr forwardlooking infrared radar flir nightvision goggles nvg night observation devices nod trip flares and other items that will aid in establishing continuous detection capability across the front to be effective ops and lps must have sufficient personnel to operate for sustained periods and good radio and telephone communications ops and lps should report to their sector command post at predetermined intervals taking care not to reveal or highlight their locations for maximum observation ops and lps should be positioned in front of the perimeter line the distance from the line should be determined by the terrain the mobility of the ops and lps the availability of fire supportthe availability of communications the location and mobility of the enemy hn agreements patrols will cover areas that stationary elements cannot observe and the areas between ops and lps the sf usually consists of elements from or attached to the main defense force mdf depending on mettt the commander may elect to use elements from the mr to perform all or part of the sf mission in such case the commander should taskorganize the forces to place the sf elements from the mr under the operational control of the security elements who have been tasked to perform the mdf mission unit integrity should be maintained to the maximum extent possible when available aviation assets can add flexibility response and extended observation to the sf for the most effective employment and integration of aviation assets into the sf commanders must coordinate with the bdoc to request aviation assets early enough to permit proper coordination and mission planning once integrated into the plan such assets normally coordinate directly with the leadership of the sf to ensure unity of effort where possible and where nationtonation agreements exist hn forces should be used as the sf when hn forces are the sf they must be in constant touch with the bdoc for early warning and overall defense coordination to ensure effective coordination us liaison officers and ncos should be attached to the hn force main defense area the mda extends from the cda to form the background of the base defense forces in the mda referred to as the mdf usually comprise the bulk of the defense force the mdf depends on mettt but normally it deploys in an area from 15 to 3 kilometers past the base perimeter these distances are representative and based on the typical effective range of most mancarried weapons main defense forces detect enemy forces and warn the defense force and the base command post of impending attack destroy the enemy when possible or delay disorganize and canalize the enemy into areas suitable for counterattack by the mr 24portions of the mdf may reinforce the mr to in any case mdfs must use surprise to their counter direct landings on the base by airborne advantage to optimize the capabilities of their airmobile airlanded or sealanded forces weapon systems and to be most effective against mdfs are assigned to defend specific portions orthe enemy they must select blocking and fixed fighting positions carefully and clear fields of firesectors of the perimeter the width and depth of these sectors are determined byout as far as possible by doing so they can the terrain to be held to keep the enemy from curtailing or terminating friendly operations the size location and type of enemy force the likely avenues of approach into the perimeter the key terrain within the perimeter concealment and cover from direct and indirect fire that the perimeter area provides for the mdf and priority resources mdfs deploy so as to provide mutual support doing so keeps the enemy from penetrating the perimeter or bypassing forward elements undetected figure 22 suggests how to divide perimeter into sectors of operation commanders may defend from series of supplementary positions along key avenues of approach or from well prepared mutually supporting fixed fighting positions choices restrict enemy freedom of movement disrupt enemy leadership engage the enemy in series of small actions that sap its strength and impair its ability to carry out its mission essential to the mda defense plan fire support planning includes mortar field artillery naval gunfire ew and tactical aircraft tacair assets defenders plan fires on likely avenues of approach as well as in front of on top of and behind likely objectives defenders also need to plan indirect fires to cover and take advantage of all natural and manmade barriers and obstacles indepth coordination with fire support assets from each service must occur during planning the bdoc has overall responsibility for base defense fire support fire support planners must make collateral damage and possible civilian casualties primary considerations fire support planners must consider countermortar and counterbattery assets their radar can provide quick response to enemy indirect fires depend on theaviation assets could be integral to the mdf size and mobility of the mdfboth fixed and rotarywing assets can extend type size and mobility of the enemy observation and give immediate combat response terrain in the mda in the outer areas of base defense planned for and 25requested early aviation assets add flexibility and combat power to the defense where possible and where nationtonation agreements exist hn forces may serve as the mdf close defense area the cda is the innermost ring it contains all elements essential for daytoday base operations unless legal base boundary exists commanders determine the base perimeter on casebycase basis to accommodate local conditions regardless of the legal base boundary the perimeter along which the defense is prepared and conducted should be determined by the terrain and the forces available to conduct the defense the cda perimeter is usually within the base perimeter the cda may be adjusted along the most defensible terrain and the terrain from which best to detect the enemy forces assigned to defend in the cda protect the most critical base elements forces in the cda are the close defense force cdf its soldiers occupy positions on the perimeter and perform internal security missions against sabotage and covert threat to increase observation and security the cda can be sectored according to base dimensions and internal security missions mobile patrols in the cda also enhance overall security cdf may occupy entry control posts boundary sentry posts and base entry control posts static defense positions around fuel depots ammunition depots communication centers supply facilities medical facilities and other highvalue targets and along likely avenues of approach into the cda they also provide security response force for aircraft parking areas or other restricted or sensitive areas as well as mobile patrol throughout the cda also the cdf must help the mr to prevent hostile forces from landing aircraft helicopters amphibious craft or troops directly on the base if the base is an airfield the cdf will perform runway denial mission by positioning forces at covered and concealed mutually supporting positions around active runways on naval installations the cdf will be positioned around ships and vital harbor facilities these combat elements engage any attacker that may have survived engagements with the mdf and mr heavy weapons teams will support the cda antiarmor teams will occupy strong points alonglikely avenues of approach for vehicles attempting to crash through the defensive perimeter machine gun teams will augment critical positions strong points throughout the cda and static positions around the perimeter an hn force on base should be directly integrated in the cda in sector or around its own restricted or sensitive resource areas its organic indirect fire weapons must be integrated into the commanders defense plans except in special cases its chain of command should be used to preserve unit integrity and unique logistical and administrative systems employing the mobile reserve forces penetrating the mda will be met by additional vehiclemounted forces performing as the mr its main mission is to block any penetration of the base or any direct landing on it until the enemy can be repelled or destroyed the mr must concentrate enough firepower to destroy the enemy force to function as blocking force the mr must be positioned where it can best respond to the most likely avenues of approach into the cda and other critical areas its composition should be based on mettt for example on flat open terrain an mr in lightly armored vehicles could be the most effective the mr will counterattack to regain critical battle positions or terrain or to reestablish the base perimeter counterattacks can restore integrity to the defense when penetration or disintegration threaten it or when the enemy gains terrain from which it can place direct weapons fire on the base the mr should launch counterattacks immediately to eliminate small penetrations or infiltrations while the enemy is weak disorganized and susceptible to isolation part of the mr may also reinforce forward mda when heavy enemy pressure or casualties reduce its relative combat power the mr may also perform part or all of the sf mission the commander prescribes what sf responsibilities the mr will have and the command and control relationship between the mr and the mdf the mr may be moved by helicopters to increase its flexibility and responsiveness hn forces on us bases may be directly integrated by unit into the mr agreements spell out the command relationships for such units mr planners should consider having them reinforce or counterattack in their own sectors or areas of 26responsibility to avoid language problems us and hn forces of the mr should exchange personnel to provide language translation ability and disseminate orders and information such liaison must start as early as possible and be available from then on if hn forces are not integrated into us operations the tendency may be to americanize lic especially during counterinsurgency this tendency may be counterproductive in most cases therefore us forces cannot operate unilaterally in lic employing antiarmor weapons to employ antiarmor weapons defenders should identify avenues of approach that enemy armored vehicles could use cover the approaches by assigning positions and sectors of fire for antiarmor weapons select primary alternate and supplementary positions select routes to and from all the positions so that crews can occupy and vacate them quickly without unnecessary exposure plan obstacles that force the enemy into open areas where antiarmor and antipersonnel fires can target them the obstacles too must be covered by fire alternate positions located to the rear of primary positions provide depth to the antiarmor defense likewise supplementary positions protect against an armored attack not covered from primary positions these positions provide for allaround security positions should use all the cover and concealment advantages that the terrain can provide fields of fire should be unobstructed out to the maximum effective range of the weapon crew members may have to clear them employing mortars and other indirect fire systems mortar field artillery and naval gunfire could support the mdf to ensure immediate fire support and complete coverage defenders must preplan indirect fires on likely targets throughout the sfa and mda such targets include enemy avenues of approach and areas in front of on andbehind friendly blocking and fixed fighting positions in the mda defenders planning indirect fire must consider minimizing collateral damage and possible civilian casualtiesfire support planning defenders will plan targets on likely lzs and dzs near their bases on avenues of approach from such zones to the base in support of manmade and natural obstacles on critical terrain features on possible enemy positions for support of the perimeters the bdoc is the focal point for defense of the base it coordinates and executes all action necessary to secure the base and its support facilities bdoc maybe responsible for several subordinate bases in the area in such case it would be in charge of all the bases in what is called base cluster the bdoc reviews and incorporates the target lists and fire plans of surrounding bases into an overall fire plan the base forwards copy of the target list and fire plans to the command post of the commander responsible for the commitment of response forces response or tcf commanders and the supporting fire support element must have copy of the target list and fire plans before the forces are committed fire support planners must consider and publish any restrictions on the type of munitions some though excellent for destroying an attacker could inhibit or prevent continuation or resumption of the base mission if such munitions are to be used as last resort the approving authority and command channels must be clearly delineated generally indirect fire should not be used against level i threats since they are usually individual or smallunit operations limited in scope and duration and too fleeting to be engaged successfully larger enemy forces could be level ii or iii threats they have the size combat power and identifiability which might require fire support assets response forces and tcfs used to counter level ii and iii threats maybe tailored to include attached or direct support ds artillery they will include observers and may have fire support elements fses with communication equipment they may also include air force tactical air control parties tacps with associated maneuver units of the tcf the tacps will perform their primary mission of directing offensive air power against an enemy force fire support coordination measures fire support coordination measures permit or restrict fires in and around bases where hn 27support is used these measures can restrict fires without revealing the functions of classified sections of the base not accessible to hn forces for all bases and especially those in or near populated areas us and hn commanders will have to coordinate the types of fires authorized into surrounding areas the severity of fires the circumstances that permit return fires permissive fire support coordination measures can increase the response to requests for indirect fires employing aviation assets when available aviation assets should be integral to base defense both fixed and rotary wing aircraft can extend the range of observation in the sfa and give immediate combat response in the outer areas of base defense specially designed aircraft such as those equipped with flir or the air force ac130 gunship are particularly well suited for supporting base defense planned for and requested early aviation assets can add flexibility and combat power to the base defense using mines and obstacles antitank and antipersonnel mines complement obstacles and indirect fires defenders should emplace them on all enemy avenues of approach to break up assault formations and inflict heavy casualties mines and obstacles such as barbed wire canalize and slow the enemy to increase exposure to defensive fire defenders should employ obstacles in depth reinforce them to increase their effectiveness and cover them by observation and fire the commander exercising control over response forces and the tcf must obtain obstacle overlays and obstacle target lists before committing response force in an area of dangerous obstacles establishing security measures the commander of the joint base defense force sets up security system to prevent observation and surprise the sf should provide early warning however security measures must be in force throughout the entire area of operations identifying and setting priorities for critical base assets will emphasize likely targets and help economize defense force effortsactive active security measures include ops lps patrols and standto alerts the defense force commander may direct set number of ops and lps or let subordinate commands decide their needs ops and lps must be placed strategically however careful random positioning of them will help to confuse enemy recon forces and frustrate an attacking force in terrain that restricts fields of fire and during periods of limited visibility more ops and lps are necessary security requires aggressive patrolling patrols reconnoiter dead space in sectors and gaps between sectors standto alerts held both morning and evening ensure that all soldiers in the defense force adjust to the changing light and noise are awake dressed and equipped check their weapons and are ready for combat morning alerts should start before first light evening alerts should continue until after dark the starting and ending times should vary to prevent establishing pattern but each alert must last long enough to serve its purpose the commander may also specify set number of troops to be on security at all times the number will vary with the enemy situation terrain and visibility when an attack is expected the entire defense force should be on security such high security should not continue for long periods because troops need rest in order to function security however cannot be sacrificed for rest passive passive security measures include camouflage concealment movement control light and noise discipline proper radiotelephone procedures ground surveillance radars and ground sensors establishing work priorities the commander must set priorities for the many tasks involved in base defense work may occur on several tasks at the same time see the sample that follows in figure 23 28developing counterattack plan reserves or lightly committed forward elements conduct counterattacks counterattacks begin after the enemys main effort has been identified and an assailable flank has been created their timing is especially important because they must synchronize with the overall defensive effort like spoiling attacks they usually revert to the defense after local exploitation rather than turn into full exploitation and pursuit in some cases they may be the first step in resuming offensive operations by the larger defending force counterattacks may be counterattacks by fire only such tactical actions position force so it can bring flanking or rear fires against the enemy but it does not assault enemy positions establishing area damage contro l measures area damage control adc includes the measures taken before during and after hostile action or natural disasters to reduce the probability of damage minimize its effects and aid in the continuation or reestablishment of normal operations engineers perform most of these tasks other forces and assets contributing to adc include ordnance policy nbc civil affairs maintenance medical signal supply transportation and transiting unitsestablishing air defense measures air defense nullifies or reduces the effectiveness of attack or surveillance by hostile aircraft or missiles after they are airborne3 air defense assets on or near base will be integrated into the overall defense plan for the theater the commander of the joint base should set up communications link with the air defense net for earl warning of impending air attack if the joint base is also an air base local air defense units and the air base operations center must coordinate and establish returntoforce and identification friend or foe iff procedures establishing nbc defense measures commanders of bases must ensure that their facilities can operate with maximum individual and unit effectiveness in an nbc environment they must understand the nbc threat including likely weapon systems and threat tactics and they must ensure all soldiers know precisely how to use their own nbc equipment they must enforce strict opsec procedures to reduce the enemys ability to acquire lucrative targets against which it may use nbc munitions all personnel and units must be prepared and trained to operate under the worst possible battlefield conditions training must be realistic continually reinforced and fully integrated into unit exercises to survive personnel must maintain their equipment properly and use it training in the use of detectors and mission oriented protective posture mopp ensembles and procedures is the key to protecting the force operating with suits masks detectors and alarms is necessary part of base nbc defense defenders look for both enemy activity and contamination when they establish an nbcdefense plan personnel should be assigned additional duties of various chemical detection and radiological monitoring or survey the data they collect gives the bdoc picture of nbc activity in the area they mark and report detected contamination so others will not encounter it nuclear weapons will cause heavy casualties materiel damage and obstacles to movement they will restrict the use of critical facilities communications and terrain the effects of initial nuclear radiation can range from temporary mild radiation sickness to immediate incapacitation 3joint doctrine for air defense ics pub 3013 joint doctrine for theater counterair operations jcs pub 2012 29and early death thermal radiation can severely burn exposed personnel enhanced radiation weapons dramatically increase radiation casualties without corresponding increases in materiel destruction fallout and neutroninduced contamination will require defenders to expend time and resources for monitoring and survey radiation exposure control and decontamination operations the primary means of protecting us forces against biological weapons is maintaining current inoculation status as they process for overseas deployment once deployed they counter biological threats through rigorous field sanitation program incor porating water and food inspection by qualified personnel certification program for hiring local nationals medical programs to closely monitor the health of the command medical personnel must be alert to any significant increase in infectious disease rates and keep the commander informed as they occur medical observation continues to be the primary warning method because reliable field detectors for biological agents are not widely available protective measures against chemical attack fall into two categories sanitary inspection and physical protection thorough food and water sanitation program greatly reduces the chances of covert chemical assaults achieving their goal to counter overt chemical attacks or indirect exposure base commanders have readily available physical protection measures and supporting equipment for detection protection and decontamination developing threat response contingency plan combating terrorism the threat response contingency plan outlines specific duties and responsibilities to combat terrorism it describes the circumstances for its implementation notification procedures concept of operations mission priorities options for using forces decision making parameters local and higher levels resource requirementsit provides checklists of actions to be taken by emergency operations center eoc members crisis management team cmt members and the threat management force tmf see appendix d the defense force commander normally develops the plan in coordination with the installation staff including the staff judge advocate the g3 or deputy chief of staff for operations and plans dcsops normally implements trains tests and revises the plan all concerned including all potential response agencies must understand and coordinate the plan determining the physical layout of the base the physical layout and placement of equipment on base can be as significant to its defense as the size of the force guarding its perimeter commanders must always stress continuous upgrading for base physical security surveys of the defense including intruder drills and mock attacks must be part of defense training and serve to identify any shortcomings of base defense defenders especially those in highthreat areas must be cautious not to confuse drill with an actual attack plans for base construction must consider adc defenders need to use fire fighting equipment and practice procedures often to maintain adc proficiency should an attack occur intrusion detection defenders can emplace sensors on likely avenues of approach locating them as far forward as the sfa directed gsr and airborne flir systems can improve the chances of detecting intrusions early remotely monitored sensors trip flares and other nonlethal warning devices can also be useful depending on the threat situation and roe antipersonnel and antivehicle mines may also be emplaced noncombatants nearby may restrict their use observation to improve observation defenders should clear the ground to the front of the cda and from near the base perimeter fences by cutting foliage or applying defoliant using defoliant or cutting foliage can expose the base to aerial observation balancing the needs of ground defense and aerial defense is best defoliant must be used only on areas immediately around the defensive perimeter because it can affect large areas and destroy food production 210bromacil is the defoliant of choice inmost cases presidential approval is mandatory prior to using herbicides executive order 11850 perimeter roads on either side of the base fence improve observation combination of concrete barriers concertina wire lighting surveillance cameras and intrusion sensors should be used to form solid mutually supporting defense see figure 24 observation sites in guard towers or atop buildings can increase the surveillance capabilities of perimeter guards communications defenders should install reliable and some type of duress or general alarm signal fire alarm or loud speaker to alert the entire base and activate the mr the base should also have alarms for nbc and air attacks entrances the base should have as few entrances as possible offset concrete barriers at the entrance will prevent vehicles from accelerating counterbalance beam should be used as gate in addition heavy vehicle bus or dump truck should be stationed nearby to be driven in front of the entrance as an additional barrier redundant communications system at all guard locations it should consist ofhydraulic barriers can improve entrance security entrance guards can use telescoping land line poles with mirrors attached to check under telephone hookup to central switch in thevehicles dogs trained in explosive detection are base operations centeralso useful dogs must be tested often especially in extreme weather conditions when their abilities radio links to the bdoc may be severely degraded 211personnel on foot should have separate entrance an encased turnstyle would provide effective control especially where foot traffic is heavy badge system of identification should be established and personnel need to be timelogged in and out security personnel must constantly guard against complacency in such system and be alert for any paperwork mistakes an area for searching personnel should be established and equipped with portable metal detectors buildings housing personnel and sensitive equipment should be out of grenadethrowing range from the exterior fence and if possible away from direct sight protecting the base working and living areas bunkers with reinforced and sandbagged roofs should be near all working and living areas they should not only provide protection but also serve as fighting positions trenches between bunkers would increase safety the bunkers should be equipped with communications and first aid kits the defense of onbase dependent housing areas and other nonmilitary facilities could require extraordinary security precautions personnel and equipment in lic environment the defense must protect both us and allied personnel and equipment without degrading the overall objective given political constraints such as limits on security personnel or restrictions on building defenses commanders will probably have to translate broad strategic guidance into definitive operational objectives and viable security plans terrorists and other dissidents who wish to embarrass the hn or the us may target us military personnel for attack or incite behavior discrediting to the us commanders must consider the following in defending deployed units the potential threat for terrorist attack hn agreements on responsibilities and procedures for protecting personnel on leave liberty or pass coordination between hn civil authorities and military law enforcement agencies actions expected of officers and ncos in developing situation advance training in personal defense techniques for deploying units 212 organization of those on leave liberty or pass into two or fourperson teams with each member responsible for the wellbeing of the others internal and external territories defenders must retain or deny terrain facilities and activities and preserve forces essential to base functions while minimizing the impact of security efforts on local politics area security forces which defend territory outside the base and base defense area could consist of us or hn personnel they respond to requests for assistance in base defense they could be placed under opcon or attached to the base medical facilities medical facilities should be well marked and placed away from possible lucrative targets these facilities must have their own means of security since they could be primary terrorist targets they must have backup energy sources ready to use in case of power failure the backup system must be at separate site from the primary source port and harbor facilities port and harbor facilities can be attractive targets because access is so varied and activity is normally so heavy defense is difficult developing mutually supporting elements to control access and to defend against air land and surface or subsurface waterborne attacks requires indepth planning the area commander coordinates with the commander of the base to plan organize and equip resources for port security and available naval and special operations forces sof assets because port and harbor facilities are inherently complex single set of defensive measures can apply to all of them defenders integrating port and harbor security with landbased security must pay close attention to the concerns in figure 25 protection for choke points security forces should be placed where an entering or exiting vessels maneuvering is restricted making it susceptible to shorebased attack protection against attack from high ground security forces need to identify high ground and protect against attacks from such sitesprotection of structures structures especially if they could be effective sniper locations must be secured or manned by security forces protection of fuel supplies fuel supplies should have remote closure valves for cutting off the flow of fuel in case of an attack tides and currents local tides and currents must be studied their effects on swimmers and floating explosive devices must be handled by the overall defense plan water clarity and depth to plan the use of antiswimmer devices or nets security forces should be familiar with the clarity of the water and consider the chances of swimmer delivered attacks pier clearance if the piers clearance above the water and piling configuration is such that small boat or swimmers could operate under it it must be barricaded or patrolledlighting lighting must be adequate and positioned so as to illuminate incoming personnel but shadow security forces vehicle control points security forces should set up such points at all roads into or out of the facility use of patrol boats defenders must have patrol boats equipped with searchlights radios appropriate weapons and concussion grenades the number of boats will vary based on facility size and level of threat picket or patrol boats must guard vessels at anchor defenders must establish security perimeter on the water and patrol it to keep all unauthorized boating clear of the security zone for deployment checks see figure 26 communications net all elements of the security forces should have access to common communications net check for explosive devices swimmers and divers should be available and trained to check the hulls of vessels for explosive 213devices when they arrive and periodically during their stay in port for port checks see figure 27 inspection station checkpoints checkpoints should be established to inspect incoming and outgoing cargo rail and highway entrances security clear lines of demarcation must separate port areas they should be fenced and patrolled air defense measures if an air attack is probable or anticipated defenders should establish defensive positions and point air defense weapons security for individual vessels maintain the engineering plant so the vessel can get under way as quickly as possible each unit should have an internal security force and the facility security officer should be informed of its size and capabilities the commanding officer or master of each vessel should inform the facility commander of the support it can provide to existing security forces the facility should be aware of what weapons if any vessel can employ in support of securityforces the commanding officer or master of each vessel must be briefed on actions to be taken in the event of an attack all crew members must be givenan uptodate briefing on terrorism awareness and personal security for individual vessel checks see figure 28 using tactical deception the use of deception is proven force multiplier that can improve base security deception operations should include visual sonic olfactory and electronic measures the measures must be mutually supporting and believable dummy minefield can be integrated with actual minefield sonic simulators can imitate armor convincingly if tanks can periodically deploy in the mda olfactory electronic sonic and visual measures can simulate defenses in depth these measures are especially effective at night to degrade enemy intelligence defenders should vary guard rotations vary internal patrol times and routes move high value items such as aircraft to different locations on an unscheduled basis use camouflage for sensitive areas mockups of living areas weapons and fuel storage tanks and deception operations can further degrade the enemys ability to successfully attack base assets tactical deception is also critical within the cda and must be integrated with the overall deception plan as directed by the commander of the base 214chapter 3 command and control defending joint base involves normal command and control responsibilities however commanders of bases in foreign countries must be familiar with the legal constraints imposed by international and domestic law section i responsibilities the potential complications of the presence of multi service bases in an area must be overcome by effective communications responsive reporting and timely reaction if base defense is to be successful situation which includes base defense will probably also place other concurrent high priority requirements upon military forces the base defense task organization can incorporate available regular force units and provisional units organized from base resources to provide maximum defense sample defense organization of joint base is shown on the next page in figure 31 theater command the following are the normal country and command responsibilities and relationships for theater of operations national security council the national security council advises the president on all national security matters and critical foreign policy issues secretary of state the presidents representative in supervising directing and coordinating us foreign policy affairs is the secretary of state the department of state is the lead agency responsible for developing policy and operational guidelines for dealing with terrorist incidents involving us citizens and us interests abroad ambassador and country team the presidents representative in each country is us ambassador the president gives the ambassador full responsibility for directing and coordinating the activities of all elements of the us diplomatic mission the ambassador promotes positive program direction by ensuring that all usgovernment activities in the hn are efficiently and economically administered and effectively interrelated so that they will contribute fully to us interests in that country as well as to our regional and international objectives the ambassadors overall authority title 22 us code section 3927 must be recognized unless the military commanders troops are actually in combat the ambassador is responsible for initiation of noncombatant evacuation operations however he does not have the authority to direct us military forces under the command of us area military commander the term country team describes incountry interdepartmental coordination among key members of the us diplomatic mission in practice the composition of country teams varies widely depending on the desires of the chief of the diplomatic mission local situation us departments and agencies represented in country problems that the team has to consider 31 32 an appointed contact officer who is usually the chief security assistance organization sao or in some cases the defense attache represents the unified commander on the country team chief security assistance organization saos manage security assistance functions in foreign countries saos are responsible for foreign military sales and other forms of materiel assistance the sao chief is under the command of the cinc as member of the country team however the sao chief is under the direction and control of the ambassador the cinc normally appoints the sao chief as his point of contact to the ambassador in certain countries the defense attache may have security assistance manage ment responsibilities as an extra mission the sao may be known as the office of defense cooperation odc the military assistance advisory group maag or another name mutually acceptable to the us and hn governments joint chiefs of staff the jcs assists the secretary of defense by developing joint plans to guide unified commands also program recommendations coming from thesaos and unified commands are fully coordinated through the jcs to ensure consistency with us global security plans only the national command authority nca representing the executive branch of government has the authority to commit us military forces combat forces assigned to geographic area are usually under the operational command of the appropriate unified cinc commanders in chief the cincs of various unified commands are critical in committing us forces they advise the jcs on significant events in their areas of responsibility cincs have operational and regional responsibility the exception is the cinc united states special operations command who has global responsibility cincs must identify and apply the necessary resources for achieving us national strategic goals cincs have the responsibility and authority to communicate with the chiefs of the military services the jcs and the secretary of defense on all militaryrelated matters cincs have an established linkage with the ambassadors in their ao through their appointed contact officers and close coordination through them is essential see figure 32 33joint task force commander cincs will normally delegate authority and responsibility for particular operation to joint task force jtf commander if the jtf needs base single commander for security and operations will normally be placed in charge regardless of the level of service involvement at particular base clearly defined chain of command for controlling operations must be established to ensure unity of effort to provide for the effective defense of base within his command or for joint planning within his area of responsibility the jtf commander assigns the responsibility for local defense of the base establishes the method of command or coordination to be used by the local base defense commander ensures that appropriate command relation ships between subordinate area and local base defense commanders are established ensures that local defense areas are delineated ensures that defense plans are published area command an area command consists of the organized elements of one or more armed services designed to operate in specific geographic area that are placed under single commander such as the commander of unified command smaller areas may be assigned as necessary to commanders subordinate to the commander of unified or specified command the purposes for such area assignments are to secure unity of effort for assigned operations to coordinate defense css and available facilities the commander of an area or subarea with numerous us bases must ensure their defenses are adequate and complement applicable hn security plans the commander may be responsible for overall security of the area outside us bases depending on local hn agreements and capabilities the commander must ensure us base defense plans are properly focused against enemy forces including distant forces that interfere with the operation or security of the bases joint base command the designation of commander of joint base is influenced in part by the purpose of the base and its geographic relationship with other commands and bases overall command responsibilities forjoint base defense are specifically defined in the directives activating the base in some cases commander of base may also be an area commander the commander of the base establishes the defense organization as well as the planning preparation and execution of all defense measures the base may support or protect the operations of two or more services at noncontiguous facilities within the base as base defense coordinating authority the commander of the base plans and directs the use of noncontiguous facility forces in base defense roles the primary mission of base support elements usually conflicts with planning and training for its secondary role in ground defense the commander of the base coordinates both thus ensuring that time and effort are equitably allocated the current threat against the base influences this decision necessitating greater emphasis upon accurate intelligence the base command can consist of single base or cluster of bases organized under one commander it may be land mass an island an island group or combinations of them commander of joint base who is also designated as cluster commander must coordinate the defense of all bases within the cluster base headquarters the base headquarters exercises command control and administration of the base and the necessary control of resident and transient units not part of the base command it does so through centralized bdoc base defense operations center the commander of the base creates bdoc from available base assets it is the bases tactical operations center and focal point for security and defense it frees the senior unit staff to concentrate on primary support missions the bdoc may be composed of elements of the senior commanders headquarters hq alone elements from each of the tenant units or both each tenant will provide an appropriate share of the staff needed to run functional operations cell around the clock the bdoc plans directs coordinates integrates and controls all base defense efforts it has three critical functions operations intelligencegathering and analysis and communication 34operations the operations section is primarily concerned with planning and coordinating current and future operations it prepares and implements base defense plans and serves as the central point of contact for coordination with higher echelon area defense counterparts other bases area security and response by military police mp forces tcfs hns adc teams large bases occupying critical sites or performing sensitive missions may receive permanently stationed liaison teams such teams help coordinate defensive efforts with adjacent bases hns and area security elements the operations section maintains defensive status boards prepares overlays develops andor coordinates response force plans prepares fire support plans and requests it requests response forces or tcf from higher echelons when attacks exceed the capability of base forces the operations section is the interface for the commanders of the tcf and the base during combat operations against sustained level ii and level iii threats intelligencegathering and analysis the bdoc intelligence cell may or may not be distinct from the operations section depending on the size of the bdoc this cell serves as the conduit through which the commander of the base receives and transmits intelligence information about the ao it develops information through exploitation of all indigenous sources area security patrols mp convoys adjacent bases theater intelligence communications higher echelon sources it also serves as focal point for the bases contamination control effort if bases are near population centers transpor tation routes communication links their intel ligence assets can provide higher echelons withearly warning and realtime assessment of local nbc conditions such information enables the overall rear area commander to discern potential problems and develop responses to minimize the impact of threat nbc operations in the rear area intelligence is then analyzed to give the commander the best advantage possible over the enemy communications dedicated communications assets must closely link all base defense activities the communications system among the bdoc higher echelons and base defense elements must be secure robust redundant and highly efficient an automated battlefield communication system that includes inter and intracommunications links is essential to base defense operations communication systems of hn and us response forces must interface for coordinated response alternate base defense operations center defenders should set up an alternate bdoc if possible if the base does not have the resources to support this requirement headquarters elements of units opcon to the base for defense may be designated for this purpose the alternate bdoc can be located on or off the base but command control and communications c3 of base defense should be the main factor in decisions about the alternate bdoc emergency operations center the commander of the base has operational control of base resources during terrorist incident counterterrorism actions however are typically planned coordinated and directed by an eoc which is activated immediately when terrorist incidents occur jcs has defined four terrorist threat conditions threatcons in combating terrorism as progressive levels they place units in increased postures of defense to reduce the vulnerability of us military personnel their dependents facilities and equipment for specific information on the threatcons and eoc refer to appendix d base defense forces base defense forces are those specifically charged with the security of the base they are under operational control of or attached to the bdoc they include the sf mdf cdf mr and any other immediate response forces that are part 35of the base defense plan base defense forces must detect an impending attack as soon as possible repulse or disorganize all forms of ground attack contain enemy forces that have established lodgment in the base area repulse or destroy the enemy by counterattack the responsibilities of the base defense force include preparation of ground defense plans organization of defensive elements execution of security tasks execution of ground defense plans preparation and execution of local air defense plans and tasks defense force commander is normally appointed by the commander of the base to supervise the preparation of ground defense plans conduct the required training provide for css and conduct and control ground defense operations as special staff officer of the commander of the base during planning he coordinates the efforts of all elements scheduled to defend the base and during the defense exercises operational control of them commanders of base elements may be given responsibility for defense training of their force or for making their forces available to the commander of the base for training they may be given additional requirements such as procurement and storage of essential supplies construction of defense installations medical care communication assistance if terrorist situation develops special considerations tactics and coordination are necessary given the unique threat that terrorism poses and the worldwide attention it brings us forces require specific handling for specific information see appendix d screening and main defense forces the defense force commander normally exercises decentralized operational control of the sf and the mdf doing so permits sf and mdf leaders to exercise their own command and control in their sectors to carry out their missions the sf and the mdf in sector are taskorganized to meet the needs of the mission and generally operate semiautonomously by engaging the enemy withavailable firepower and reasonable tactics in depth coordination and control measures are essential however to ensure that adjacent elements do not receive friendly fires depending on the situation and roe each subelement of the sf and the mdf can engage the enemy without prior permission of the defense force commander the subelement must make an immediate report of the engagement close defense forces the defense force commander exercises operational control of the cdfs during operations thus ensuring they can respond quickly efficiently and effectively to enemy attacks but avoid firing on the sf the mdf and the mr mobile reserve the defense force commander should exercise centralized operational control and decentralized execution of the mr the commander keeps close control over when and where the mr deploys preventing premature use of the reserve caused by an enemy feint once the mr is deployed to its designated sector it is free to engage enemy forces within that sector without prior approval from the defense force commander such decentralized execution allows the mr force leader to use proper tactics to defeat the enemy naval forces naval local defense forces are comprised of units having local naval tasks in base defense these tasks include harbor defense offshore patrolling explosive ordnance disposal eod search and rescue operations and additional tasks asrequired navy security forces mobile construction battalions seabees and administrative maintenance and supply units and personnel are expected to perform ground defense force duties certain related operations affecting base defense such as strike force operations submarine and antisubmarine activities and the control and protection of shipping are normally outside the responsibility of the commander of the base and are not usually directly connected with local naval defense operations however the commander of the base may be authorized to employ such elements in emergencies air forces air force elements stationed in the base area could augment base defenses security police supply and maintenance units and personnel stationed on the base can also augment base 36defenses usaf security police normally act as part of the cdf as such they have primary responsibility for providing entry control boundary sentries and security response forces in and around usaf resources disaster control forces disaster control consists of measures taken to minimize the effects of damage caused by hostile action the disaster control forces include fire fighting units nbc defensive units engineer units medical units4 eod units other units capable of satisfying disaster control requirements further all units initiate passive defensive measures such as the employment of shelters dispersion camouflage and blackout these same units can help minimize the effects of damage caused by natural disasters base service forces base service forces support the active defense they furnish food water ammunition and other supplies of common demand the major elements of the industrial and maintenance forces are assigned to the ground defense force storage points should be hardened and guarded depending on the threat base engineer forces base engineer forces consist of construction units and civilian engineer operations these forces perform construction and destruction tasks prepare the base demolition plan and supervise the installation of demolitions their support in building firing positions and clearing fields of fire saves critical time for the defense force civil affairs authorities civil affairs includes all interactions between the military and civil authorities or people in the area such interactions may range from military civic action projects to the exercise of authority that normally belongs to the local government see chapter 5 psyop assets and units may augment civil affairs personnel 4in the defense medical personnel should protect their patients themselves and the medical facilities and provide medical support to defense forceshostnation forces diplomatic agreements between the us and hns determine whether hn forces will support the defense they may be totally integrated in the base defense force or in any part of the defense they may have total authority and man the sf mdf or mr they could be responsible for the perimeter with us forces sharing control of internal security the relationships and authority that the commander of the joint base has with hn forces are decided at the nca level for totally integrated security plan the commander of the base must coordinate closely with the hn the hn is responsible for responding to terrorist activities statusofforces agreements however may grant to us forces the rightnot the responsibilityto do anything necessary to maintain order and security on the base us response procedures to terrorist activity on the base are set up according to us and hn law and statusofforces agreements and in coordination with hn governmental agencies psychological operations forces defenders must plan and coordinate psyop with appropriate us diplomatic mission and hn personnel to ensure unified approach to our tactical and strategic objectives psyop missions include developing campaigns to provide positive explanation of the goodwill intent of ongoing us activities providing assistance to hns to gain the support of their people through various local programs and incentives identifying local sensitivities to us occupation activities identifying local key leaders tribes clansreligions population and political groupings and their susceptibilities to hostile or us propaganda efforts positively exploiting the temporary nature of us involvement and maximizing publicity of plans for and execution of us rapid with drawal of forces projecting an image of the us as neutral third party between hostile groups during peacekeeping operations transient forces transient forces or other forces not part of the base command may be assigned to the operational control of the commander of the base for emergency defense these forces may be assigned missions using their organic capability 37they may be assigned as elements of the ground defense force the authority mutua l responsibility and command relationships for using such forces during an attack or under threat of an attack are covered in jcs publication 02 adjacent bases and base clusters totally integrated security plan requires all bases and base clusters in an area to coordinate their defense efforts area commanders will normally establish command and control for bases within their area liaison between bases and base clusters will be essential in developing an overall security plan section iitactical combat forces tcfs will normally assume opcon of any forces outside the base perimeter in sustained combat operations against level ii and iii threats once the threat has been defeated base defense forces revert to base control tcf near base maybe used for base defense even if the threat is only level i normally it would be given separate ao such as the sfa or sector and retain control of its own forces close coordination and integration of the tcfs c3i system would have to take place with the bdoc the base and tcf headquarters must exchange liaison personnel and set up direc t communications links they must also coordinate the tcfs movement in and out of the base defense structure to ensure continuity of security legal constraints treaties agreements and national interests determine relationshipsand support among allies and friendly nations and provide basis for specific roe issued by competent military authority roe must be clearly stated and dis seminated to all us forces commanders at all levels must be very concerned about the legal aspects of base defense three types of law relevant to base defense are international agreements us law and hn law together these laws regulate the status and activities of the forces in all levels of conflict should legal questions arise defenders should consult the staff judge advocate or other official legal advisor international agreements international agreements are the most important source of rules of international law

fundamental to base defense section i intelligence joint base intelligence activities are conducted in coordination with lead us agencies and hn intelligence activities intelligence agencies comply with federal laws presidential executive orders statusofforces agreements memorandums of understanding and applicable us military regulations ipb the primary responsibility of the intelligence organization is continuous process that should begin before combat operations do ipb enables the commander of the base to determine vulnerable areas analyze the threat upgrade facilities and procedures and prepare contingency plans for detailed discussion of ipb see fms 343 and 341306 responsibilities intelligence officer j2 or c2 intelligence officers who support deploying unit need to carefully consider the information in figure 41 when developing pirs at theater level intelligence officers direct coordinate and control all theater intelligence collection operations targeted against the threat collect receive process and disseminate all source intelligence on the threat perform liaison and coordination as required with national law enforcement intelligence and other government agencies intelligence representative the intelligence representative on the base staff and crisis management team facilitates the flow of threatrelated information normally forms the bdoc

training to other members of the joint base and to supported units expeditiously provides locally developed information to higher commands warns the supported commander of all threats to the command provides for realistic intelligence play during periodic exercises tactical unit intelligence staff in wartime the tactical unit intelligence staff collects and processes information according to current joint doctrinesupport trained intelligence personnel provide variety of services including presenting threat awareness training to military personnel and their families processing information into intelligence and disseminating it to users collecting intelligence information and analyzing it in support of counterterrorist operations providing the support detailed below threat briefings briefings about specific regional threats make personnel aware of enemy activity in the area of assignment or travel such briefings prepare personnel to observe and report unusual activity and may include measures they can take to reduce their vulnerability to attacktranslation and interrogation linguists and interrogators translate important documents interpret or participate in negotiations and interrogate captured and detained personnel use of specialized equipment and collection methods specialized equipment and methods of obtaining information are employed in strict compliance with federal law us military regulations statusofforces agreements and the applicable ushn agreements for example when authorized personnel may use technical surveillance countermeasures providing the area commander with the ability to detect the activities of hostile intelligence services in the target area the requirement for monitoring however must be consistent with the appropriate regulations only servicelevel departments can authorize such methods operations to counter the threat intelligence agencies collect analyze produce and disseminate user specific threat information quickly the resources and methods used to do so divide into four disciplines counterintelligence ci human intelligence humint imagery intelligence imint and signal intelligence sigint each provides pieces for completing an allsource intelligence picture integrating them with information from other civilian military and government agencies may produce composite so the commander can see what is happening or what is about to happen and plan accordingly collecting and storing information to provide critical and timely information the intelligence system must not only collect and process information efficiently but also organize store and retrieve information rapidly coupled with early warning careful observation and effective analysis these functions enhance the intelligence officers ability to predict the types and timing of strikes at the base orderofbattle factors can be logical starting point to guide information collection and to organize intelligence files they include composition disposition strength objectives tactics training logistics and personality the collection process is dynamic and constantly modified as intelligence accumulates 41as intelligence improves in depth and detail collection management efforts are refined in focus and orientation files are constantly reviewed and updated and information is quickly disseminated to users exchanging information intelligence activities are team effort for instance many us federal agencies actively involved in combating terrorism are sources for technical support evaluation and shared information controlled liaison with civilian and hn police and intelligence agencies is essential to exchange information prevent duplication of effort and reduce the likelihood of compromising ongoing collection efforts air defense units air recon assets the provost marshal and security police also have intelligencegathering capabilities the intelligence section at the bdoc must establish close and constant liaison with these and other activities to develop the most accurate intelligence information possible for base defense criminal information civilian and military agencies maintain information on known criminal incidents in their jurisdictions this data is of vital interest to military intelligence military law enforcement criminal investigators military intelligence and civilian police agencies must coordinate with one another outside the us the first three elements section iiconduct liaison with hn and allied law enforcement and intelligence agencies according to statusofforces agreements the local commander must be briefed about any exchange of information and intelligence opensource information the news media maintains the worlds most extensive information collection system relevant threatrelated opensource material is disseminated through intelligence channels to the theater j2 or c2 and appropriate law enforcement agencies personnel assigned to conduct psyop and civil affairs activities will routinely contact civilian personnel such as local officials clergy farmers and police these sources can often provide useful information local human intelligence local humint can be one of the most effective sources of information such information can come from friendly locals and those sympathetic to the us presence base intelligence may have to pay for such information and organize the sympathizers into local humint network normally such networks have few key local figures who recruit other sympathizers developing system to gather local information in support of base intelligence efforts these efforts must be in line with theater level j2 or c2 intelligence collection operations which reimburse and ultimately approve them communications base communications is similar to that of any fixed administrative unit of equal size and scope it involves centralized communication agencies that furnish services for all users from available resources some tactical communications such as those for offshore or aviation patrols may operate through or in conjunction with the base operational communication system other tactical communications should not be integrated into the base communication system although physical facilities may collocate with base communications communications for joint base defense presents numerous challenges such as the inability to net different service radios and lack of secure radios which must be resolved the bdoc as the central point for base defense c2 is normally the hub for the base defense communications system see figure 42 for sample bdoc communications net 42planning and construction considerations defenders must plan coordinate and construct fixedbase communications facilities to not only provide for base defense communications but also for other necessary communications considerations include organization and integration of communications capabilities and resources compatibility of equipment and systems selection and preparation of locations for communication installations and facilities including hardening plans for communication survivability determination of sources and types of communication augmentation available to base defense forces coordination and control of air support operations and communications requirements among controlling agencies communication systems and responsibilities pertaining to defense sectors areas and mobile defense plans command andcommunication responsibilities for counter terrorist actions ability to operate in an electronic counter measure ecm environment frequency management to coordinate hn and augmented forces secure voice communications communications links to the country team and us federal agencies entry to the defense

defense tenants units and sufficient spare ceois to facilitate an ingress and egress of transient units during fluid situation coordination and exchange of communications information with hn tcf and transient units 43capabilities plans provide for using base communications facilities to the maximum extent practicable plans also set up any alternate means of communication and cover their maintenance and use augmentation forces will rarely have the personnel or equipment for their tactical communications normally the bas communications officer or j6 is responsible for meeting these needs the base defense communications system should be extended and improved to the maximum capability of the personnel and materiel available the success of communications will reflect theeffort expended between the initiation of communications planning and the onset of hostile activity the primary carrier of internal communications is wire wire lines should be laid to primary and alternate defensive positions duress signal system such as buzzer or alarm should be installed among all posts and linked to the next higher command post to give instantaneous notice of attack the base should have loudspeaker or siren system to notify all personnel of ground air or nbc attack the base should use different signals for air and ground attacks so that personnel can differentiate between the two and know how to respond 44chapter 5 hostnation support hns is normally based on agreements that commit the hn to provide specific support in prescribed conditions agreements occur at various levels nation component command major command service and unit although formal agreements are the preferred means of obtaining and documenting hns they are not absolutely necessary overall hns will depend on the situation for example us bases could be located in countries whose governments fully support us policies in other cases the hn may show little interest in commiting forces to meet the threat in the vast majority of cases us bases locate in friendly hns treaties agreements or any of the four lic missions could be the reasons for us involvement us bases may also locate in friendly states adjoining the ao once joint base is established close cooperation with the hn and special considerations for its people culture and territory could be vital in attaining strategic us military goals the proper use of hns is key in conducting joint base defense planning factors the primary purposes of us involvement are to fulfill treaty agreements in support of us national interests thus commanders must not destroy the image of hn political control providing hns gives credibility to the hn and enhances the abilities of us forces to perform their missions hns can reduce requirements for us personnel materiel and services allowing flexibility in assigning forces to other missions or other theaters diplomatic agreements political situations or the mission itself may restrict the number of us military personnel allowed at joint base in such case hns would be necessary to supplement us security forces us forces should expect hns where the hn has total sovereignty for example within the communications zone commz during wartime factors to evaluate or consider in determining whether to use hns for specific missions and functions include capability dependability and willingness of the hn to provide and sustain resources shortfalls in us forces supplemented by hns and reductions in us forces made possible by using hns effects of hns on the morale of us soldiers effects of hns on the political structure within the hn reliability of support and effects on security including opsec us intelligence and security personnel in conjunction with hn authorities must develop system to check the background and loyalty of hn personnel employed on the base qualified personnel to inspect for quality and to ensure that goods have not been tampered with may be required hn agreements and treaties that specify us involvement in the ao capability of us forces to accept and manage hns availability of hns in the type and quantity agreed even if the level of threat should change facilities and systems hn government agencies build operate and maintain facilities and systems such as utilities and telephone networks and provide their services in support of us forces police fire companies and border patrols may be available to support us forces 51us forces use hn facilities for hospitals head quarters billets and maintenance shops the facilities may be owned by the hn controlled by the hn or provided by contract supplies services and equipment bases may acquire supplies and services such as laundry bath bakery transportation from us hn or thirdcountry contractors located in the theater such contractors use hn or thirdcountry personnel bases need such support personnel as laborers stevedores truck drivers supply handlersequipment operators mechanics linguists medical aides computer operators and highly skilled managers many will be available from the hn labor pool opsec certification for such workers should be coordinated and prescribed in nationtonation statusofforces agreements hn military or paramilitary units support us forces with functions such as traffic control convoy escortbase security and cargo and troop transport hns may be for special function in designated area or for particular organizations within national boundaries rail operations convoy scheduling air traffic control and harbor pilot services are examples certain services may come under hostgovernment control by authority of national power acts to avoid shipping supplies and equipment from the us bases may acquire them locally command and control us and hn personnel command their respective units and normally work in cooperation with but not under opcon of each other however opcon relationships between us and hn commanders may occur when appropriateagreements are negotiated to address specific circumstances the degree of command and control that us forces exercise over hns depends on the type of hns involved the location tactical situation and political environment and any agreements personnel who know the languages provide the interface between us and hns elements implementing plans must include request procedures and legal restrictions imposed by the hn the us coordinates its control of hn resources through local officials when possible and definescontrol through treaties or hns agreements civil affairs personnel nurture this civilmilitary cooperation by providing an interface with hn authorities or military forces depending on the agreements the hn may provide both exterior and interior security to us bases or share the responsibility for base security with us forces such situations require close coordination common communications and credible base defense plan nbc defense when required hn military paramilitary and civilians and thirdcountry civilians providing support are equipped and trained to operate in an nbc environment provisions for training and equipping are negotiated rather than unilaterally imposed by us forces training us personnel at all levels should be trained in hns functions all of them should get orientations on hn government regulations business practices social customs and military procedures proficiency in the hn language is vital to coordinating hns defenders should integrate hns into training exercises whenever possible intelligence friendly nations normally operate separate intelligence systems in support of their own police and military forces however the products of national collection that affect operations should be shared within limits of national security and early coordination of the intelligence operations of allies should be assured specific provisions for combined intelligence operations and the use of national systems are generally arranged at the highest levels for operational and tactical purposes defenders must arrange to disseminate military intelligence rapidly and to make intelligence assets available to all partners in the operation doing so usually requires formatting combined intelligence staff at theater level establishing an intelligence network with dedicated communications and liaison officers to link allied headquarters assigning tactical intelligence units through out the force so as to optimize their use 52technical intelligence collectors such as drones direction finders radars and ew assets of the partners will differ the combined intelligence staff should consider their capabilities and if advantageous distribute them throughout the force to ensure the commands full potential for intelligence collection hns will be particularly vital for data collection from the hns own humint sources commanders of joint bases must ensure that theintelligence sections link closely to the theater intelligence staff and to local hn assets such as police and paramilitary units current and accurate intelligence from those sources helps provide the best base security against the threat psyop forces can identify key local leaders significant tribes clans and religions important local sensitivities psyop can develop and conduct information and education programs to project positive image to hn citizens as to why us forces are in the area in so doing psyop forces can collect intelligence while in contact with the local populace civil affairs commanders at all levels can expect to be involved in civil affairs ca operations these include any activity involving relationships between the military forces and hn civil authorities or local population activities may range from military civic action project to the exercise of authority normally belonging to the local government the type of local government and the legal basis for us presence influence the scope of ca operations as do the economic social and political background of the country and people ca personnel monitor and assist efforts of psyop engineer medical logistics mp or sp forces base defense forces and administrative elements as these elements work to restore stability to coordinate security operations to contribute to national development to promote support for the government ca efforts coordinate closely with and directly support civilian efforts they supplement civilian efforts with activities such as construction inremote areas and extension of the lines of communications locs ca operations require good relationships with the population troop discipline courtesy and honesty are essential to good relationships in third world countries us soldiers want to hand out food or money especially to children an organized ca program should do this not individual soldiers indiscriminate giving can interfere with operations and harm relations with the host government where sound rapport has been established between hn forces and the population properly administered ca operations will materially enhance base security psyop assets such as loudspeakers and media production facilities can assist in actively promoting ca programs public affairs public affairs pa are closely linked to civil affairs pa are not directly relevant to base defense but they are very important in all operations because of their effects on public opinion us adversaries seek to exploit public opinion via news media when they succeed their results may far exceed their investment in time resources and personnel they use propaganda an d disinformation to intimidate and dishearten those they attack they try to shape public opinion to oppose the national policies that they oppose because fixed us base can attract lot of publicity the commander has to be particularly concerned about pa responsibilities commanders commanders are directly responsible for pa and often seek counsel from the public affairs officer pao member of the personal staff the pao has direct access to the commander the commander should include the pao in all planning the commander and his staff should be readily available for media queries and interviews whenever such requests do not infringe on the mission security or safety when they deal with the news media all members of the command should be friendly and professional not adversarial public affairs officer paos counsel commanders and staff on the positive or negative impact of actions proposed to carry out the mission in lic environments they 53assess the capacity of the insurgent or terrorist to exploit situations through news media and propaganda where such exploitation already exists paos advise commanders and staff on the best way to counter it paos plan flexible internal external and community relations programs that support the mission in dynamic threat environment paos advise commanders and staff on parelated matters across wide range of possible threats and disasters staff the staff must coordinate with the pao on all significant matters that may impact on internal or external policies along with other key staff members thepao should be notified of serious incidents and casualities considerations high levels of insurgent or terrorist activity may justify requests for augmenting public affairs at higher level than normally provided by tables of organization before their units deploy paos may need briefings on extremely sensitive missions by special staffs at departments of the army navy and air force headquarters marine corps hqmc and department of defense dod all news media contact and requests for interviews or information should be routed through the pao responses to media queries should be accurate and timely they should be staffed through appropriate staff sections certain information may be delayed or withheld only for security reasons accuracy propriety or policy the advance party should contact the host country team at the american embassy or consulate to determine local sensitivities and political concerns the hostcountry team should 54help evaluate proposed civic action and community relations projects hn media should be categorized by political religious and ethnic beliefs paos must consider these beliefs when granting access or agreeing to interviews joint information bureau may improve dissemination and simplify news media control the prevailing situation should determine bureau location and staffing in instance should the bureau be adjacent to the bdoc when circumstances permit joint information bureau annex may be located near media concentrations and away from tactical units in order to reduce unit profile and accessibility base personnel should always escort news media and control their access sensibly and tactfully media visits are opportunities to support the units mission to increase public awareness and support to thwart terrorist initiatives and propaganda being forthright open and ethical is the best way to establish credibility with the public while countering insurgent or terrorist propaganda defenders redeploying to familiar area should make every effort to exploit previous contacts between members of the command and friendly media and community leaders the commanders priority of public affairs concerns should be as follows national security mission unit safety internal and external information publics right to know countering propaganda and disinformation community relations and civic action a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7a8 a9 a10 a11a12a13a14a15appendix b security this appendix provides information on how units can protect themselves from attack when they have been deployed to either an urban or suburban environment it also includes guidance on maintaining operations security the security measures discussed here are not all inclusive they are included only as reference for more detailed guidance commanders and staffs should refer to their individual service publications section i tactical security units deployed to an area of operations must be constantly aware of the threat and take protective measures to minimize the danger of attack patrols patrolling may be necessary outside the base to provide additional base security the patrols main mission may be to show us presence other possible tasks may include supporting police operations gathering information on local terrorist groups checking clubs and restaurants coordinating planned apprehensions with local law enforcement agencies conducting hasty searches deploying hasty roadblocks with local law enforcement agencies patrolling urban areas involves different risks and considerations than patrolling open or cleared uninhabited areas the security operation may require the use of patrol dogs patrol dogs are the most versatile security dogs they are trained to assist the handler attack on command and track suspects the two types of patrols are the foot patrol and the vehicle patrol foot patrols foot patrols are normally carried out by fire teams multiple teams usually remain within 100 yards of one another patrol members should walk with relaxed confidence and be ready to talk to locals however they should also be prepared totake up proper firing positions keeping rifles constantly ready which is known as hard targeting hard targeting is appropriate under the following circumstances when crossing obstacles when reacting to possible enemy intrusion when leaving or entering static base observation post or area with history of highthreat contact and when breaking up movement patterns vehicle patrols vehicle patrols normally consist of two vehicles moving within sight of each other but not presenting double target vehicles should travel at more than 1015 mph vehicle crews should dismount at every stop to provide security and employ appropriate dismount tactics in order to reduce the risk of assault vehicle patrols should avoid establishing patterns defensive precautions include being particularly alert for strange people vehicles or incidents close to the beginning or end of the patrol route avoiding the same daily routes and times avoiding isolated routes and stops locking the doors stopping short of any unusual object or incident detouring around suspicious cars and obstacles bo continually checking to ensure nobody is following being aware of the vehicles dimensions and ability to sustain damage being able to make full use of the vehicles acceleration and turning capacity road blocks roadblocks may be constructed of permanent or semipermanent materials deliberate or rapidly out of materials at hand hasty roadblocks may be used to check identification to obstruct passage to perform spotchecks with or without prior intelligence to achieve surprise sentries should be assigned to protect roadblocks they should stop cars well short of the main search area to minimize the effects of possible car bombs the commander should assign an appropriate number of troops to meet the threat and effectively handle the expected volume of traffic local police females for searching females interpreters and eod experts may also be employed troops protecting roadblocks must be aware of their legal authority and their duties and limitations regarding search seizure arrest and use of force roadblocks require direct communication with the bdoc and any supporting defense forces in the area roadblocks should not unnecessarily hamper the movement of civilians troops employed on roadblocks will enhance public relations if they know their jobs thoroughly and act quickly and methodically they must be polite and considerate at all times and hand suspects over to the civil police quickly and efficiently when stopping vehicle for search at roadblock sentries should use the following procedure move occupants away from the vehicle and search the driver passengers and loose baggage once the personal search incomplete hold the occupants under guard nearby within sight of the roadblock commander while searching the vehicle direct the driver to open the trunk and identify its contents look under and around the spare wheel tool boxes luggage partitions spare wheel housing and spare tire check inflation direct the driver to open the hood look for items taped to the bulkhead or hood examineall containers and look behind the sound proofing front grill and heater when searching the interior be suspicious of strong odors such as perfume or deodorant check methodically look behind the dash radio and cassette fittings look in the glove compartment look behind panels under floor mats and between seats and cushions look in open windows in toys and in decorative animals and ashtrays when searching the exterior look in wheel wells and fenders behind bumpers around headlights and in hubcaps when searching commercial vehicles look in the following additional hiding places drivers cab space between body and cab external storage bins wooden bodies false floors and sides rear double wheels and wheel chocks that can be hollowed if possible use explosive detectors or dogs to search vehicles urban defense base forces may be employed in urban areas for security operations or for other tasks short of conventional combat for example protection of facilities or equipment required for base operations masonry structures and other urban features can be adapted to provide protection security precautions when employed in urban areas commanders must estimate the threat see chapter 1 and plan for the defense see chapter 2 in addition they should consider the following security precautions wire fences or barriers for additional protection screens made of canvas or corrugated iron for use outside buildings or inside windows mesh or chainlink barriers placed in front of bunkers or above ground fighting positions aid in premature detonation of rocket propelled grenades and other similar shaped charged explosive devices canopies of chain link weld mesh or corrugated iron will protect roofs if they are placed at least 1 meter above the roofs sandbags placed directly on roofs will absorb shrapnel obstacles in the approaches will slow or stop vehicles and personnel approaching the defended area however the entrance gate b1design must allow access to those authorized deny access to others and provide protection to those who must have access if possible illuminate fences entrance gates and obstacles cover with observation and fire sentry posts for roundtheclock security if field fortifications are required dig fighting positions rather than build towers ordinarily sentry posts are doubled during darkness or poor visibility sentries should report at irregular intervals within specified time period and be posted at entrances in order to check entry permits observation posts or rooftops in order to observe all avenues of approach and dominate buildings and grounds perimeter sites employment of sentries sentries must be properly trained and equipped they must pay particular attention to roe and appropriate use of force they must always have an mr on which they can call for immediate assistance sentries employed in urban areas must detect and deter anyone seeking to gain unauthorized access to the secured area prevent damage arson and looting within the secured area ensure maintenance of essential services remain on post until properly relieved the duties and conduct of sentries are detailed in fm 226 afr 1253 and fmfm 647 some security operations may require the use of sentry dogs sentry dogs are extremely aggressive and may work without handler they are best assigned to critical areas to prevent unauthorized penetration although longer available in dod inventory sentry dogs may be available as part of hns convoy defense depending on route classification convoys are arranged for control and protection using armored organic vehicles and military police escort if available road movement is always vulnerable in highthreat areas the convoy commander should plan convoy movements and practice using hardened vehicles if support from other units such as infantry and armor is not 7guard duty security police handbook marine rifle companyplatoonavailable convoys are organized into an advance party main body and trail party the convoy commander estimates the situation and develops plan the plan must include thorough predeparture briefing for all convoy members the briefing must include composition and order of march chain of command general posture communications and special signals objectives routes and schedules emergency actions and actions to be taken at halts convoy orders follow conventional six paragraph format as shown in figure b1 searches personnel many times personnel searches will be required to ensure the safety and security of operations when performing personnel search extend proper respect to the person detained the aim is to provide security without creating animosities which can be exploited in the future immobilize the person detained in position of disadvantage always work from behind the detainee employ two searchers one to cover while the other searches the quickbody search or frisk and the detailed body search are the two types of personnel searches quickbody search or frisk this type of search is used most often by base defenders the quickbody search is preliminary search to detect weapons in low threat areas follow the logical sequence from top to toe if possible use metal detection system be sure to carefully check hair armpits inside legs halfclenched hands medical dressings bags or cases walking sticks shoes bootsumbrellas crutches b2detailed body search this type of body search is best left to law enforcement officials special room or area should be set aside medic and female should be available to assist with the searches buildings planning for search operations should include the reason for the search team composition order of priority team tasking and specialist tasking damage limitation expected assistance and guards or escorts when preparing to search buildings use radios search net and command net and call signs for teams and specialists use grid references for location of teams control points and headquarters in addition consider electronic countermeasure constraints assume that any unoccupied house or building is boobytrapped visually scan the exterior for suspicious signs set up command post outside and detail one pair of searchers to make the initial entry avoid the obvious entryways if possible use holes in walls or roofs as entryways if you must use doors and windows check for booby traps before entering traps can be activated in many ways clearly mark with white tape the routes through the building which have been cleared of traps once the building is cleared of traps the team leader will make plan and allocate pairs of searchers to make detailed room searches figure b2 shown on the next page lists common booby traps explosive detector dogs can be used to search for arms ammunition explosive caches in buildings vehicles open areas and routes to be cleared however dog teams do not work in buildings that have not been cleared of booby traps handlers must never touch materials the dogs have indicated are explosive figure b3 shown on the next page is list of dos and donts for troops discovering unexploded devices or arriving at the scene of an explosion ambushes like patrolling setting ambushes demands patience skill and outstanding soldiering ability planned ambushes are primarily defensive b3urban ambushes are intended to arrest wanted person or persons not to kill them urban ambushes are always more difficult than combat ambushes because of the concentration of civilians it may not be possible to site an ambush in tactically sound position sites such as houses where wanted people are gathering may have to be used information about enemy movements is essential planners must know the routine movement patterns of local inhabitants and have an intimate knowledge of area terrain terrorist bombings or bomb threats may be intended to draw security forces away from protected assets into an area as targets for shooting ambush therefore security forces must always be cautious response to attacks when responding to an attack from an urban area defenders must try to kill or capture assailants while keeping the base secure in addition they must consider local useofforce requirements during immediate followup they must also consider returning fire according to roe submitting contact report including the location number of casualties and estimate of opposition dispatching fire team to engage the opposition force estimating the civilian situation establishing roadblocks on likely escape routes deploying cordon sentries as necessary alerting local authorities recovering and aiding hostages if necessary securing the scene for collection of evidence if you canestablish firing point crowd control crowd violence may be spontaneous emotional eruption or it may be planned event in the latter case the purpose may be to draw attention away from something else or to draw people to location where attack is easier crowd violence may involve civilian group interaction mob violence is highly contagious the aim of riot control is to restore order as quickly as possible with minimum of force and return control to civilian authorities as quickly as possible hn police agencies should assume principal responsibility b4for countering actions of indigenous personnel us forces should come into direct conflict with indigenous personnel only in emergency situations when hn police or military personnel are not present the best way to disperse rioters is to make key arrests and make it clear that further rioting will result in physical discomfort to lawbreakers leave an escape route open to allow rioters to section iidisperse the hn police force must assist once the crowd has dispersed and all is quiet return the troops to the assembly or base area exert caution not to escalate the violence by misuse of force use of chemical agents such as tear gas for riot control must follow stated national policy and hn agreements close coordination with legal counsel and us diplomatic missions is vital to the successful conclusion of such hostilities unit securit the threat to unit security exists throughout deployment whether personnel are on liberty leave or pass in transit on training exercises or on operations commanders must include security in their guidance and deter or create an obvious risk for terrorists through effective security programs the operations section should coordinate all security actions the followin g predeployment deployment and redeploymen t considerations are relevant factors in ensuring unit security predeployment fit alert and welltrained soldiers are the best protection against the threat in any conflict expand tactical thinking to include security against terrorism include security against insurgency and terrorism in all orders plans and training the following predeployment considerations are relevant factors in implementing unit security planning

information supervision evaluation and corrective action b8objectives opsec objectives are to avoid stereotyped operations to understand methods threat forces use to collect intelligence to deny intelligence and information to the enemy to integrate opsec into physical and personnel security and protection programs opsec requires close coordination between the operations officer who provides staff cognizance and the intelligence officer who estimates the threat is responsible for counterintelligence determines unit vulnerabilities see figure b4 identifies exploitable sources of

that is often symbolic and intended to influence an audience beyond the immediate victims combating terrorism consists of taking actions to counter the terrorist threat both offensively and defensively unit vulnerability commanders should evaluate how vulnerable the questionions in figure d1 are not allinclusive their units are to terrorist attack during rather they serve to suggest whether units are deployment vulnerability changes as units susceptible all negative answers do not guarantee change locations activities and quarters and as that the unit is safe from terrorist attacks reinforcements are available or vips conduct visits thus commanders need to update their evaluations continually d1threat conditions and responses warnings of terrorist activity against us bases will normally come from us security authorities or through the security agencies of the hn warnings may come from local police or even from terrorist organizations themselves in combating terrorism bases should use common terroris t threatens each with its measures and required responses assessment factors commanders of bases may declare threatcon and take implementation measures upon

the threat defenders use the factors in figure d2many of the indicators in figure d3 may appear to be normal rights until put in context with other activities they may then become indicators of potential violence threat levels positive evidence for any or all of the assessment factors above requires an appropriate threatcon the following guidelines apply only in assessing terrorist threats against us or dod interests each service may translate the threatcons into code applicable to its own forces local orders will include specific instructions on issuing weapons and live ammunition these orders must comply with the policy of the us command or agency concerned the detailed measures to be d2d3adopted by us headquarters sharing facilities with hn organizations must be coordinated with those organizations for the measures and required actions for each threatcon see figure d4 threatcon alpha low existence and capability are factors threatcon alpha applies if bases and personnel are subject to general terrorist threat the nature and extent of which are unpredictable such possibilities do not justify full implementation of the measures of threatcon bravo however defenders may have to implement selected measures from threatcon bravo in response to intelligence received or as deterrent defenders must be able to maintain the measures in this threatcon indefinitely threatcon bravo medium existence and capability are factors history or trends must also be evident targeting of us or dod interests is not evident threatcon bravo applies when an increased and more predictable threat of terrorist activity exists defenders must be able to maintain the measuresin this threatcon for weeks without causing undue hardship without affecting operational capability and without aggravating relations with local authorities threatcon charlie high existence capability trends and targeting are factors targeting is not specific or immediate history may be factor threatcon charlie applies when an incident occurs or when intelligence indicates an imminent terrorist action against bases and personnel implementation measures for more than short period will probably create hardship and will affect the peacetime activities of the unit and its personnel threatcon delta imminent existence capability immediate and specific targeting of us or dod interests and trends are factors
