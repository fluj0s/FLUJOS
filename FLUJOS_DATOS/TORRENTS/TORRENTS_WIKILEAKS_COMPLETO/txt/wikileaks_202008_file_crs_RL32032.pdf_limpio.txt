fy19982003 during the reauthorizati on process some state transportation departments and tran sportation construction organiza tions reported to congress that the process required to obtain various fe deral state and local environmental approvals and permits often needed for major highway projects was sometimes inefficiently implemented and overly timeconsuming in particular stakeholders expressed concern about the lack of eff ective interagency c ooperation when multiple federal or state agencies were required to participate in project congress attempted to address these concerns by including environmental streamlining provisions in tea21 although not defined in statute fhwa defines environmen tal streamlining as the timely delivery of federa lly funded transportation proj ects while protecting and enhancing the environment because majo r transportation projects may be affected by dozens of federal state and local environmental requireme nts administered by multiple agencies improved interagency cooperation was identif ied by congress as critical element to the success of envi ronmental streamlinin g the streamlining provisions of tea21 required the department of trans portation dot to develop and implement coor dinated environmenta l review process for highway projects that either do have or may have significant impact on the environment approximately 9 of all highway projects fall into one of these categories this coordinated review process encourages fu ll and early participation by all relevant federal and state agencies required to participate in highway project since the passage of tea21 numerous administrative activities have been undertaken to facilitate st reamlining however regu lations to implement the streamlining provisions have not been promulgated some members of congress have expressed the need for further legisl ation to expedite th environmental review process required of highway c onstruction and transit projects as result

impact upon the cost of project delivery if the delays are extensive enough for inflationary cost increases to result interagency cooperation projects requiring nepa documentation involve the

compliance with all applicable environmental requirements be coordinated under the nepa umbrella this means that for any given transportation project any study review or consultation required by law that is related to the environm ent should be conducte d within the framework of the nepa process depending upon the complexity of the project or resources impacted significant number of environmental

analysis issuing permits or providing an assessment of pr oject impacts to name few the role of cooperating agency is frequently set out in memorandum of agreement with the lead ag ency that agreement may i nvolve the cooperating agency drafting certain portions of the eis that relate to its jurisdiction or expertise for example if highway project has the potential to impact pr ime farmland usda may agree to provide fhwa with an analysis of those impacts project purpose and need and alternatives as required under both ceq and dot regulations the eis must include statement clarifying the projects purpose and need this section of an eis is the foundation upon which subsequent sections of the eis are built dot requires the discussion to be clear and specific and support the need for the

the standpoint of the agency or potentially affected stakeholder in his capacity as the chairman of the interagency transportation infrastructure streamlining task force established under executive order 13274 environmental stewardship and transportation in frastructure project review8 transportation secretary norman mineta sought guid ance from ceq chairman james connaughton regarding the role of lead and cooperating agencies with regard to developing highway projects purpose and need9 secretary mineta referred to the sometimes extended interagency bates over purpose and need stat ements as reason for delay in highway project development in his response chairman connaughton cited excerpts of nepa itself as well as ceq regulations that specify that th lead agency has the authority for and responsibility to define projects purpose and need further chairman connaughton referenced previous federal court decisions giving deference to the lead agency in determining projects purpos and need while not addressed in this correspondence ceq regulations also specify the selection of reasonable alternatives as within the authority of the lead agency designation of categor ical exclusions transportation projects that do not individually or cumulatively have significant social economic or environmental effect and which dot s determined from past experience with similar projects have significant impact are excluded from the requirement to prepare an ea or eis such actions ar processed as categorical exclusions in fy2001 almost 91 of all fhwa project s were classified as categorical exclusions10 common misconception is that such projects are categorically excluded from compliance with nepa such projects do require certain level of nepa compliance but are excluded only from the requirement to prepare an ea or eis unlike eas or eiss categorical exclusions are not type of document but are classes of dot actions that may be in effect preapproved for example transportation enhancements often fall into this category of action11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32032crs6 11 continued under 23 usc 101a35 for more in formation see fhwas transportation enhancement

whether or what type of documentation will be required will depend upon wh ich of the two groups the project falls the first group incl udes projects that call for or limited construction12 examples include the construction of bicycle and pedestrian lanes landscaping emergency repairs and the inst allation of pavement markings or traffic signals the second group consists of acti ons with higher potential for impacts than the first group but are generally determined to meet the crite ria for categorical exclusion because environmental impacts are minor13 an example of such project is the modernization of highway th rough resurfacing r econstruction adding shoulders or adding auxiliary lanes since the second group of actions has higher potential for impacts than the first dot may require that the state or local project sponsor provide analyses or documentation to allow dot to determine if the categorical exclusion designation is proper further although categorica lly excluded projects environmental impacts may not be significant as defined unde r nepa requirements of other laws may still apply for example the installation of traffic signals is generally considered an action with environmental impacts however if those traffic signals will be installed in historic district complian ce with provisions of the national historic preservation act may apply also for exam ple if the proposed route of bicycle path borders endangered species habitat biological assessment in compliance with the endangered species act may be required requirements applicable to parks

secretary was directed to identify all agencies required to participate in th coordinated environmental re view process at the earliest possible time and to require those agen cies whenever practicable to conduct required reviews concurrently rather than sequentially in accordance with cooperatively established time periods the review pro cess could be incorporated into memorandum of understanding betw een dot and particip ating federal and state agencies dot has undertaken variety of acti ons to meet the goals of tea21s streamlining requirements however final regulations were promulgated in may 2000 under the clinton administration dot proposed rule on nepa and related procedures for tran sportation decisionmaking14 some commenters indicated that the proposed rule failed to streamline the review process elements of the rule presented an increased burden of paperwork and procedural requirements they said and increased the potential for litig ation there was also concern that the proposed rule lacked specific provisions ddressing time frames comment deadlines dispute resolution and closing the record on decisionmaking at an appropriate stage due to these concerns the proposed rule was withdrawn by dot in september 200215 since withdrawal of the proposed rule came within year of the legislative reauthorization of surface transportation programs the agency stated it would wait for the outcome of the legislative process to see what further regulatory changes were needed in lieu of final regulations dot has implemented variety of administrative actions in response to tea21s streamlinin g requirements for detailed information regarding the streamlining provisions of tea21 and the administrations activities to implement those provisions see

may 17 2005 each bill s policy provisions ssentially the same as those included in bills passed during the 108th congress each bill had distinct provisions related to the environmental review process provisions common to each bill included statutory designation of dot as the lead agency for the environmental review process under nepa statutory delineation of the roles and responsibilities of the

of tea21 details of each bill particul arly details that differed fro m one bill to another are discussed below also brie fly discussed below are the positions taken by various interest groups on selected legislativ proposals groups interested in the streamlining provisions generally include transportation improvement stakeholders ie state departments of transportation or transportation advocacy or construction organizations and environmental stakehol ders ie state or federal resource agencies historic preservation agencies or advocacy organizations and environmental advocacy organizations establishment of new environmental review process each bill delineates new environmental review process for certain types of surface transportation programs under section 1511 the senate b ill proposes to establish new transportation project development process s opposed to building upon the tea21s coordinated nvironmental review process this process applicable to highway and transit projects could be implemented at the request or with the concurrence of the project s ponsor and carried out by the lead agency otherwise the environmental review process require d under current ceq and dot regulations would be implemented the house bill includes its version of streamlining provisions under title vi transportation planning and project delivery section 6002 efficient environmental reviews for project deci sionmaking tealus environmental review process was referred to as project development procedures the procedures in the house bill are similar to but in some instances not as detailed as those found in the senate bill unlike the senate bill the project development procedures in the house bill are applicable to all highwa projects public transportation capital projects and multimodal projects that require an eis if determined appropriate by the secretary the procedures may also be applied to projects that require an ea or categorical exclusion delineation of authority of the lead agency each bill proposes to designate dot as the lead agency for certain surface transportation projects requiring compliance with nepa the senate bill proposes to designate dot as the lead agency for highway and transit projects and to allow the project sponsor to serve as joint lead agency safetea proposes to gi ve authority to the lead agency to carry out certain responsibilities when imp lementing the transportation projecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32032crs10 development process for example the senate bill would authorize the lead agency to develop coordination plan to coordinate public and ag ency participation in the environmental review process as part of the coordination plan the lead agency would be required to develop workpl an and schedule in consultation with cooperating agencies and the project spons or for completion of the environmental review process and the collection of information needed to complete that process the schedule would be required to include deadlines on specific milestones in the environmental review process criteria for establishing those deadlines are specified in the senate bill and include the establishment of deadlines on agency comments procedures for extending comment d eadlines procedures for accepting late comments and procedures pplicable to deadlines for decisions under other laws further in the senate bill the lead agency would be authorized to determine the purpose and need and the range of alternativ to be considered for the project each of these elements of the environmental re view process would re quire the solicitation of comments from agencies and the public for 30 days the bill specifies factors that may be considered by the lead agency in determining the projects purpose and need and alternatives these factors incl ude transportation land use economic development and environmenta l protection plans adopted by the state local or tribal government responsibilities of cooperating agencies ar also delineated in the senate bill for example cooperating ag encies involved in the transportation development process would be required to conduct required environmen tal reviews concurrently to the extent practicable similar to the senate bill the house bill would designate dot as the federal lead agency in addition the project s ponsor if state or local government as opposed to private entity would be require d to be the joint lead agency for the environmental review process the joint lead agency may prepare any required environmental documents if the federa l lead agency provides guidance and assistance and approves the documents the environmental review process must be initiated by the project sponsor after proper notification to the secretary after participating agencies and the pub lic had an opportunity for involvement the house bill would require the lead agency to define the projects purpose and need and the range of project alternatives however unlike the senate bill specific criteria for involving the public and agencies are not specified the house bill would require the purpose and need statement to specify the projects objectives such as supporting transportation objective identified in st atewide transportation plan with regard to defining projects alternatives the lead agency would be authorized to collaborate with participating agencies to determine methodolog ies that would have been used for alternatives analysis and the level of detail required for each alternative also the lead agency woul d be given the discretion to develop preferred alternative to higher degree of detail in order to facilitate development of mitigation measures or concurrent compliance with other applicable laws if that determination would not prevent the ag ency from making an impartial decisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32032crs11 17 aashto represents highway and transportation departments in the fifty states the district of columbia and puerto ricotransportation advocacy groups such as the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto17 argue that the authority of participating federal nd state agencies particularly th at of the lead agency should be more clearly defined in statute th ey have supported establishing statutory authority that would reiterate the lead agencys authority to delineate projects purpose and need and the range of alterna tives to be considered environmental stakeholders are concerned that if the lead agency is afforded specific rights in statute the opinions or contributions of cooperating agencies will be diminished or dismissed they acknowledge that establishmen t of lead agency authority in law may serve to reassert dots authority to participating agencies however since this is right already afforded dot under current law and regulations some environmental groups contend that such provisions ma not significantly streamline the nepa process delegation of authority to state dots section 1512 of the senate bill would authorize the secret ary to assign to state dot the responsibility for processing the environmental reviews for projects classified as categorical exclusions the criteria for making such determination would be established by the secretary and would apply only to projects designated by the secretary such authority would be determined through mutual agreement between the state and the secretary and delineated in memorandum of understanding under the house bill similar authority would not be delegated to the states however in effect certain authority would be extended to the states inso far as they would be designated as joint lead agencies allowed to prepare environmental documents and initiate the environmental review process in practice project sponsors already assemble documentati on that allows dot to make the categorical exclusion determin ation if enacted provisions of the senate bill would have the effect of omitting the fi nal step in the process this final step currently requires dot to assure that n ecessary documentation or required analyses to determine projects categorical excl usion determination is legally sound and accurately reflects projects status transportation stakeholders such as aas hto have argued that project review may be expedited if states we re given the authority to process categorical exclusions such stakeholders argue that delegation of this authority to the states could speed up the environmental review process for highway projects by eliminating significant layer of bureaucracy that federal appr oval entails however environmental stakeholders have expressed concern that the delegation of authority to the states would create fox guarding the henhouse scenario they argue that if state which has vested interest in moving project forward is allowed to make certain determinations those determin ations would not have the vel of scrutiny that would be provided with fede ral oversight further they are concerned that any legislation that would reduce or eliminate fede ral oversight may ultimately limit public participation in the envi ronmental review processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32032crs12 18 fhwa newsletter successes in streamlining january 2002 19 aashto statement for the record regard ing stewardship and streamlining

secretary must promulgate regulations to clarify existing section 4f requirements in par ticular provisions of the senate bill would require the secretary in consultation with affected agencies to clarify standards required to determine the prudence and feasibility of projects alternatives see requirements applicable to parks refuges and historic sites section above amendments to section 4f included in the house bill would apply only to historic sites provisions of tealu would llow for the use of historic site if that use is determined in accordance with pr ovisions of section 106 of the national historic preservation act to ve adverse effect on the site some environmental stake holders have expressed concerns at what they perceive as an overall weakening of the current protections most transportation stakeholders are in favor of the senates proposed revisi ons to the current section 4f requirements which have been identif ied by state transportation agencies as significant deterrent to timely environm ental reviews of transportation projects18 further aashto has argued that the problem with section 4f is what it perceives as the laws lack of flexibility particularly with regard to privately owned historic sites19 aashto has expressed concern with th requirement to avoid section 4f resources even when the impact is minor resulting in situations in which historic property is protected at the expense of other more sensitive environmental resources or communities historic pr eservation groups such as the national trust for

not needed and any problem with section 4f is with imprope r interpretation by fhwa nthp asserts that fhwa sometimes avoids section 4f resource at all costs and has interpreted situations in which there are prudent and feasibl project alternatives too narrowly20 establishment of deadlines each bill either requires or allows for the establishment of deadlines on certain project milestones the house bill includes provisions that would establish various definitive deadlines applicable to agencies and the public for example under secti on 6002 the house bill would establish an extendable 60day deadline on comments to draft eis and an extendable 30day deadline on all other comment periods in the environmental review process also the house bill would establish 90day statute of limitations on legal challenges related to final agency actions the senate bill would not set specific deadlines applicable to all projects however one component of the transporta tion project development process is the development of project work plan that includes schedule with deadlines negotiated by the lead and cooperating agencies environmental groups argue that public involvement in highway projects will likely be restricted if deadlines are applied to the interagency processes further they argue that deadlines of 30 to 60 days are not sufficient to fully consider and consent on the major questions of impact exposed throughout the nepa process transportation stakeholders are in favor of the adoption of extendable deadlines on agency comments with regard to the creation of statute of limitations on legal challenges transportation stakeholders such as aashto are in favor of the adoption of time limits for legal challenges to project approvals they argue that the absence of statute of limitations in current law allows plaintiffs to file suit when project is at an advanced stage they are in favor of limits that would facilitate the resolution of legal disputes more promptly after th conclusion of the environmental review process some environmen tal groups have argued that the proposed statute of limitations of 90 days is too restrictive and does not allow sufficient time to prepare an appeal they argue that as result this time limit may lead to preemptive suits in an effort to preserve the right to sue pilot program for states section 1513 of the senate bill proposes to establish surface transportation project delivery pilot program that would delegate certain federal environmen tal review responsibilities i n addition to categorical exclusion determinations to more than five states including oklahoma responsibility could be assu med for environmental re views required under nepa or any federal law for one or more hi ghway projects within the state federal responsibility for any confor mity determination require d under the clean air act could not be assigned to the state the program would be administered in accordancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32032crs14 with written agreement between the participating state and the secretary the secretary is directed to promulgate regulations to implement the pilot program within 270 days of enacting the law the house bill did not include comparable provision requirement to prom ulgate regulations the senate bill would require the secretary to promulgate regulations to implement each of the provisions discussed above unless otherwise specified within one year of enacting the law this provision relates to the cerns of some members of congress that regulations to implement the streamlining provisions in tea21 were not finalized after its enactment the house bill does not include similar requirement
