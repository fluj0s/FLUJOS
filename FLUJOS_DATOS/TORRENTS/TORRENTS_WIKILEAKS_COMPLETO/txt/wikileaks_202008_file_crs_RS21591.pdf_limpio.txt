who are not otherwise exempted exempted residents include residents who are 62 years or older disabled and can certify that they cannot comply with the requirement caretakers of person with disability engaged in work activities or exempt from work activities under the temporary assistance for needy families program tanf 10 or state welfare program andor members of family in compliance with tanf or state welfare programs work requirements given the data that are currently collected it is hard to gauge exactly how many families are impacted by this requirement hud has estimated that approximately 100000150000 households out of the approximately one million households that live in public housing include members that are not exempted and therefore must comply with this requirement the community service provisions require that residents of public housing unless exempted participate in eight hours of community service andor economic selfsufficiency activities per month the hours do not have to be completed in minimum monthly increments as long as 96 hours are completed over the course of year phas have broad discretion in defining what counts as community service or economic selfsufficiency allowable activities include volunteer work at local public or nonprofit institution caring for the children of other residents fulfilling the community service requirements participation in job readiness or training program and attending two or fouryear college the pha must review and verify each member of households compliance 30 days prior to the end of the households lease if any member of the household fails to comply with the requirement the entire household is considered out of compliance the tenant must agree to make up the communityservice deficit in the following year in order to renew the households lease if the tenant does not come into compliance the pha can not renew the households lease however phas may not terminate households lease 9 section 12c of the united states

grievance to dispute the phas decision each pha must develop local policy for administering the community service and economic selfsufficiency requirements and include the policy in its annual plan phas may administer community service activities directly partner with an outside organization or institution or provide referrals to tenants for volunteer work or selfsufficiency programs if the pha does not administer the activities directly residents must provide phas with signed certification from thirdparty that they have completed the community service activities public housing tenants required to fulfill the community service requirements cannot supplant otherwise paid employees of the pha or other community service organizations g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 the community service and economic selfsufficiency requirement for residents of public housing is consistent with the movement towards required work and selfsufficiency activities in the tanf program supporters of mandatory work policies often argue that low income families should earn the benefits or subsidies they are receiving they also argue that by compelling families into selfsufficiency activities such policies can improve the lives of poor families and their children by potentially increasing their incomes those who argue against mandatory work requirements contend that such requirements are paternalistic and do not promote real self sufficiency but rather lowwage deadend work there are additional arguments that are made specifically for and against the public housing community service requirement when the provis ion was originally debated in 1998 those who supported the requirement specifically for public housing residents argued that if the requirement resulted in increased earnings for residents of public housing then the amount of rent paid by tenants would go up if rents paid by tenants increase then the cost to the federal government for the program could potentially decrease some members of congress during floor debate on the provision argued that it is unfair to put this requirement only on residents of public hous ing and not on recipients of section 8 vouchers or section 8 projectbased rental assistance since the programs serve similar populations pha advocacy groups such as the national association of housing and redevelopment officials nahro argue it is administratively burdens ome although only small number of tenants may actually be subject to the requirement phas must certify either the participation or exemption status of every resident of public ho using furthermore the grievance andor eviction process for tenants who are found to be noncompliant with the requirement could be very costly industry groups contend that this requirement is an unreasonable burden for phas who they argue are chronically underfunded some of these opponents speculate that phas will not aggressively implement the provision rather they will try to exempt as many families as possible and set very broad definition of eligible activities in order to avoid costly grievances and evictions and keep administrative burdens low there has also been some controversy surrounding huds implementation of the community service requirement the statute states that in order to meet one of the exemption criteria tenants must be engaged in work activities as defined in the social security act the social security act definition of work activities does not include minimum number of hours person must perform the listed activities in order to be considered engaged in work activities huds 2003 notice to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21591g5g152g150g150g158g151g146g157g162g561g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g561g20g142g154g158g146g155g142 g150

therefore exempt from the requirement only if they were working at least 30 hours per week this guidance initially prompted confusion as to whether phas were required to set 30hour standard while the guidance states that phas are encouraged to set 30hour standard they do not appear to be required to set such standard g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 in recent years members of
