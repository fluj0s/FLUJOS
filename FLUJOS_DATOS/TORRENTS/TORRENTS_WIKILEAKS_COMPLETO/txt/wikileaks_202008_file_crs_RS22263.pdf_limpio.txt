bank locations moved check clearing operations to atlanta and mainta ined the discount window to assist all depositories in meeting their needs for liquidity among other actions1 by september 7 in briefing with house financial services committee members financial regulators were able to report that the financial system was functioning well in the crisis with banks coming to the aid of other banks in handling cash and checks and variety of regulatory relief initiatives beginning to take hold many protective protocols put in place following the terrorist attacks of 911 and the hurricanes of 2004 appear to have proved their worth those protocols which were required of ll but the smallest depository institutions included maintaining critical pe rsonnel and data storage with at least daily backups at sites at least 20 miles distan t from banks headquarters2 apparently in almost every case backing up data has worked despite loss of electricity as of september 20 the federal deposit

institutions examination council8 depository institutions the view of most regulators is that the banking system both in terms of safety and soundness and in terms of financ ial infrastructure is well on the way to overcoming the shortterm difficulties presented by katrina the systemwide view may miss serious problems at individual institutions particularly smaller banks whose business activities were concentrated in the hurricane area banks whose depositors have an urgent need for cash and whose loan collateral is believed to lie under water or otherwise to have been destroyed could face at least temporary financia l distress if not failure federal reserve actions can maintain liquidity but there is some anecdotal evidence that major depositors are withdrawing their funds from smaller banks out of concern that the banks may fail and they may lose amounts that are above th deposit insurance ceiling since bank can withstand serious run on posits some bankers have ca lled for temporary increase in the deposit insurance ceiling to reassure depositors during the emergency9 another concern is that the need to provide emergency rvices to hurricane victims may conflict w ith antimoney laundering regulations intended to keep drug lords and terrorists from using the banking system the gulf is said to have largely reverted to cash economy10 and large cash transactions are normally subject to stringent reporting and knowyourcustome r requirements in addition many evacuees lack the records or forms of identification that bank would usually requi re while regulators have issued advisories that appear to susp end or relax rules cerning money laundering customer identification and other requirements11 they have also left banks some discretion in following those advisories so bankers have expr essed concern that ifhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22263crs4 12 matter of perspective american banker sep 12 2005 p1 13 see

temporary re lief from these regulatory requirements12 finally it is not clear that all existing financial institutions will ultimately survive the disaster the most important reason is the loss of
