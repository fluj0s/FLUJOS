new york city was formerly in the department of energy it was transferred to the st directorate by sec 303 of the homeland security act historically the focus of eml was detection and monitoring of lowlevel radiation releases the transfer of eml to the st directorate required realignment of emls activities to meet homeland security goals according to some experts this realignment process was contentious3 dhs officials reportedly debated whether eml is most appropriately positioned in the st directorate or the domestic nuclear detection office dndo discussed more below whether eml should

universityaffiliated activities provide the main connection between the st directorate and the academic community as such the university centers of excellence are the primary mechanism for the st directorate and the academic community to interact on rd topics the details of these centers have been an issue of congressional focus with special interest given to how research at university centers of excellence relates to dhs rd needs and st directorate priorities in 2007 congress considered but did not impose limited terms for the university centers of excellence and it has since established new university centers of excellence in specific research areas stakeholders resisted congressional efforts to curtail the duration of the university centers of excellence but response to under

give the st directorate concise statutory mission instead it listed variety of responsibilities and authorities for the under secretary these were summarized at the beginning of this report and are reproduced in full in appendix different people at different times have had different conceptions of the directorates mission this section discusses three aspects of that debate whether the directorates customers are the other components of dhs the ultimate end users such as state and local first responders or both the scope of the directorates rd mission relativ to other dhs components such as dndo and the extent to which the directorates role should include operational and other responsibilities as well as rd g5g158g156g157g152g150g142g155g156g561 during the tenure of former under secretary charles mcqueary 20032006 customers were described as being both internal other directorates and units of the department and external state and local homeland security officials and first responders24 the needs of such diverse group are broad and varied and identifying and meeting those needs proved to be challenge in may 2006 the house committee on appropriations reported that st has failed to adequately convey its role or how it supports missions of dhs component agencies many dhs components express skepticism or even ignorance about the value of st in serving their agencies 25 since the appointment of under secretary cohen the directorate has identified its immediate customers as the dhs components although still in formulation that recognizes end users in congressional testimony in september 2006 the under secretary referred to his vision for and realignment of the directorate to better meet the mission needs of our customersthe dhs components and the customers of our customersthe first responders and men and women that st enables to make the nation safer26 he emphasized the need for the directorate to be more attuned to the needs of its dhs customers 24 see

research projects agency darpa some experts in the scientific community believed it would as darpa does fund high riskhigh reward research endeavors instead the st directorate used hsarpa to conduct its extramural research activities while funding mainly traditional rd activities under secretary cohen as part of his reorganization of the st directorate has redirected the work of hsarpa the role of hsarpa is much reduced from past years when it was responsible for nearly all of the directorates extramural rd it is now focused on activities with high risk and high reward through its homela nd innovative prototypical solutions hips and high impact technology solutions hits progra ms hsarpa now performs research activities more in the darpa model the best way to use hsarpa and its attendant funding may continue to be topic of congressional interest supporters of the darpa model point out that while the risks are high successes from such investment may yield great benefits few investments in this model will be categorically successful though so it may be that many research endeavors will need to be funded before success is realized thus such highrisk research may require sustained financial commitment be made in order to realize the high reward success g8g158g151g140g157g146g152g151g156g561g17g157g145g142g155g561g157g145g138g151g561g20g493g6g561 although the directorates main

this program as the scholars and fellows receiving financial assistance from dhs do not necessarily enter into homeland security employment or rd 29 over the next few years the st directorate plans to reduce the numbers of scholars and fellows and align scholarship and fellowship activities with those of the university centers of excellence this may lead to greater synergies and effectiveness between the two programs but also may limit the scale of involvement of universities students and scientists interested in homeland security whether dhs as an rd funding entity should continue to

about their relative importance for the first few years of its existence the st directorate lacked publicly available longterm rd plan as required by presidential directive31 it worked with the white house office of science and technology policy to develop an annual rd plan for critical infrastructure protection 32 but there is similar requirement for other rd topics the directorate had an annual planning process but the results of that process were internal to the directorate and were not publicly reviewed33 some conclusions about the success of individual program elements could be drawn from the results of ombs program assessment rating tool part in the absence of an overall plan however it was difficult for those outside of dhs to gain holistic multiyear perspective in june 2007 the st directorate released separate strategic plan that includes fiveyear rd plan34 this document and its attachments briefly discuss the directorates organizational structure rd goals prioritization procedures and workforce but they focus more on describing the directorates rd topics and programs and providing milestones budget projections and program mission statements although these documents provide proposed future funding levels they do not describe the process by which the allocation of these funds among the different homeland security research areas and projects was determined they describe number of specific choices such as the topics of the six divisions the relative emphasis placed on different threats the selection of particular rd projects and the percentage target for

explicit strategy the st directorates funding allocations give insight into its priorities most notably they reveal strong focus on developing countermeasures to weapons of mass destruction countermeasures to biological agents have always constituted the largest single component in the directorates rd portfolio the establishment of dndo and its growing share of the departments rd expenditures imply decision to increase the priority of nuclear and radiological countermeasures this may affect the st directorate even though it is longer involved in nuclear and radiological rd because such decision implicitly reduces the relative priority of other rd topics that remain in the directorate in part this focus on unconventional lowlikelihood highconsequence threats may reflect the programs transferred to the directorate at its inception which were heavily focused on biological chemical and nuclear weapons 36 the rapid increase in budget emphasis on radiological and nuclear threats starting in fy2006 appears to be strategic choice however although the white house has explained its rationale for establishing dndo37 dhs has given public explanation of its decision to increase dndos funding in the past the directorates focus on unconventional threats has drawn into question its ability to meet the conventional needs of other dhs compone nt agencies in the directorates old budget structure funding for support of other dhs agencies was consistently less than for either biological or radiological and nuclear countermeasures see appendix c the new budget structure integrates support for other dhs agencies into each of the research divisions so this issue has become difficult to track through budget trends the new ipt process includes representatives of the dhs operational agencies however which may help ensure that future rd efforts meet the departments conventional needs

in this context the risk that different threats pose to homeland security45 while risk methodologies are under exploration in the st directorate the extent to which they are incorporated into decision making is unclear for example presidential directive tasks dhs with completing biennial biological risk assessment 46 although the content of that assessment has not been made public many observers expect that it provides sufficient analysis and detail to identify priority areas for short medium and longterm r d investments for example its results are being used by the department of health and human services to help prioritize biological countermeasure procurement through project bioshield47 another presidential directive requires dhs to develop an integrated risk assessment for chemical biological radiological and nuclear threats48 the connection of these two risk assessments to the directorates rd budgeting process is not apparent however nor is it clear whether the directorate applies or plans to apply similar risk assessment methodology to prioritysetting in other threat areas or across all its activities it should be noted that these risk assessments may contain information relating to national or homeland security vulnerabilities and as such might be incorporated into the directorates planning processes through nonpublic mechanism interagency and intraagency coordination plays an important role in ensuring that rd plans and strategies are informed by threat information the techniques used and considered by terrorists adapt and evolve technological countermeasures may be available that provide protection against these modified techniques but they will be ineffective if they are not deployed prior to the techniques use transfer of pertinent threat information from the intelligence community to dhs and then to the st directorate may provide an advantage in developing counterterrorism technologies and enhancing preparedness 44 homeland

broad its rd activities address the whole range of threats to homeland security with the exception since 2005 of most nuclear and radiological threats which are addressed by the domestic nuclear detection office discussed more below it spans the spectrum from basic research to operational systems though most operational functions have now been transferred to other dhs organizations it conducts some activities directly in its own facilities and others indirectly through arrangements with the national laboratories industry universities and other government agencies this section

st directorate allocates its resources between research and development is of interest to both policymakers and other stakeholders the extent to which the st directorate invests in basic research in particular is an issue of continuing congressional interest 49 investment in basic research is generally believed to address longterm needs provide basis for future applied research and development and lead to advances in knowledge across disciplines investment in development focuses more on the near term with re sults that are typically narrower in scope but more immediately applicable the directorates rd portfolio has been criticized as being skewed too much toward development with not enough expenditure on basic research50 as noted below the directorates stated goal is to increase basic research to 20 of its budget this goal was not reached in the directorates fy2008 budget request which included 13 basic research51 in contrast the fy2009 budget request the first budget request developed entirely during under secretary cohens tenure meets this goal including 20 basic research funding52 in the administrations annual budget documents the office of management and budget omb

three of these categories as follows 49 see for example questioning of under secretary mcqueary at hearings of the house committee on homeland security subcommittee on cybersecurity science and

or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications towards processes or products in mind applied research systematic study to gain knowledge or understanding necessary to determine the means by which recognized and specific need may be met development systematic application of knowledge or understanding directed toward the production of useful materials devices and systems or methods including design development and improvement of prototypes and new processes to meet specific requirements53 the dhs portion of ombs analysis is summarized in the upper portion of table 1 note that these figures do not distinguish between the st directorate and other dhs organizations they therefore include rd activities in the domestic nuclear detection office the us coast guard and perhaps other organizations as well as in the st directorate54 the national science foundation nsf also produces annual statistics on federal rd spending the nsf figures describe obligations and outlays which reflect how budget authority was actually spent and therefore they are only available after fiscal year is complete55 like omb nsf uses four categories basic research applied research development and rd plant it uses the same definitions as omb does for basic research applied research and development and its rd plant category appears to be equivalent to ombs facilities and equipment category 56 the lower portion of table 1 shows the nsf obligation figures for dhs as whole and for just the st directorate there appear to be discrepancies between these two sets of figures see figure 3 in the nsf figures for the st directorate basic research is 11 of the nonplant total each year applied research 25 and development 64 these proportions are identical within rounding in each of the three years for which data are available the omb figures show much more variation particularly in the balance between applied research and development they also show much smaller proportion of basic research the nsf figures are obligations whereas the omb figures are budget authority so some of the differences may be explained by unobligated balances carried over from year to year the issue of unobligated balances is discussed more below some of the nsf figures are preliminary however crs has been unable to determine the cause of the differences 53 office of management and budget analytical perspectives budget of the united states government fiscal year 2008 54 because of consolidation and deconsolidation of rd activities the proportion of dhs rd budget authority located within the st directorate varies dividing the rd appropriation for the st directorate by the total dhs rd budget authority reported by omb yields st directorate contribution that ranges from 58 in fy2007 to 89 in fy2005 55 for more explanation of how budget authority obligations and outlays differ see crs report 98721 introduction to the federal

academia and others and intramural rd conducted by government employ ees at dhs and other federal facilities before the 2006 reorganization most extramural rd was managed by hsarpa that is longer true categorization of the directorates activities as extramural or intramural is complicated by its sponsorship of ffrdcs and university centers and its use of the doe national laboratories the ffrdcs and university centers are established and overseen by dhs but operated by outside organizations and funded by contracts and grants the doe national laboratories while governmentowned are also managed and operated by contractors the extramural or intramural status of rd performed at these facil ities is therefore potentially ambiguous annual budget documents typically do not provide breakdown of funding between intramural and extramural activities among industrial academic and nonprofit organizations or between publicsector and privatesector performers this type of information is sometimes provided in hearing testimony or in briefings by directorate staff however an example is given in figure 4 g17g153g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g3g140g157g146g159g146g157g146g142g156g561

departmentwide data on the funding balance among basic research applied research and development see table 1 above budget analysts have several causes for concern however about the quality of these data for dhs one issue is the consistency of how activities are categorized another is the scope of the activities included sometimes the figures include expenditures that are not rd and sometimes they omit expenditures that are rd the data include wide variations from year to year particularly in the balance between applied research and development for example they indicate that the share of the departments rd budget authority devoted to applied research went from 23 in fy2004 up to 71 in fy2005 and then back down to 45 in fy2006 over the same period the share devoted to development went from 46 to 11 to 45 while such swings may reflect annual changes in the nature of the departments rd activities they may also indicate that in some years development activities have been recategorized as applied research or vice versa as the result of unexplained changes in accounting or definition in addition the analytical perspectives rd data include some dhs activities that are not rd for example the fy2006 edition shows total requested dhs rd funding of 1467 billion even though the fy2006 request for the entire st directorate including salaries and expenses was only 1368 billion the difference of 99 milli on is not accounted for by rd programs in

than the st directorate request not more because not all the directorates expenditures are for rd62 similarly the fy2009 edition includes 2175 billion of advance appropriation for project bioshield medical countermeasure procurement program as rd facilities construction funding63 as consequence the apparent funding for rd activities for fy2009 is several times greater than the requested budgets for all rd programs combined conversely the analytical perspectives data sometimes appear to omit dhs rd activities that should be included for example in the fy2006 edition the estimate of total dhs rd for fy2005 is 1185 billion in the dhs fy2006 congressional budget justification the total fy2005 funding for the st directorate excluding salaries and expenses and the rd programs of the transportation security administration coast guard and customs is 1244 billion the difference of 59 million is not accounted for by nonrd activities in the st directorate instead it appears to reflect the omission of the transportation security administration and customs programs from the analytical perspectives data

organization of the directorate in many cases the major reorganization in 2006 makes it impossible to compare programlevel budgets before and after fy200764 smaller organizational changes also present challenges for specific programs before that date for example when the transportation security laboratory was transferred to the directorate from elsewhere in the department its funding was first pooled with some smaller unrelated programs in category called rd consolidation fy2006 and then merged into the existing explosives countermeasures category fy2007 starting in fy2008 it became part of the laboratory facilities category the budget justifications for these years do not allow the laboratorys funding to be tracked across the organizational transition another challenge is that the figures reported in the directorates budget justifications have sometimes appeared inconsistent for example past year data is sometimes reported as budget authority and sometimes as obligations without clear identification g8g146g151g138g151g140g146g138g149g561g15g138g151g138g144g142g150g142g151g157g561 when the st directorate was formed it had to establish an entirely new financial and

the former tsa and customs rd activities which were being cons olidated into the directorate for the first time and the coast guard rd activity which was proposed for consolidation even though it was ultimately kept separate 62 these nonrd expenditures include for example the directorates operational activities its program of scholarships and fellowships and under some definitions the salaries and

that has drawn the attention of congress is the persistence of unobligated balances from prior fiscal years the st directorate has not always obligated the full amount of its annual appropriation in the first few years after its establishment possible reasons for this included appropriations that were consistently higher than the directorate had requested and the directorates inability to spend funds rapidly because of its slow progress in hiring program managers because funds appropriated to the st directorate do not expire 69 significant unobligated balance accumulated see table 4 in response congress rescinded 20 million in unobligated prioryear funds in the department of homeland security appropriations act 2006 pl 10990 and an additional 125 million in the department of homeland security appropriations act 2007 pl 109295 it should be noted that because congress places expiration date on funds it appropriates to the st directorate it may be that congress intends for some unobligated balance to persist in st directorate accounts even if that is the case the magnitude of the existing unobligated balance may mean that it will take several fiscal years to reach the level of carryover desired by congress 65 government accountability office financial management department of homeland security faces significant financial management challenges gao04774 july 2004 66

secretary of the department from carrying out research development demonstration or deployment activities as long as such activities are coordinated through the under secretary for science and technology 76 for the first few years of the departments existence trend toward consolidation of its rd activities tended to simplify this coordination role the conference report hrept 108280 accompanying the department of homeland security appropriations act 2004 pl 10890 gave this trend explicit direction the rd activities of the former customs service were transferred to the st directorate in fy2005 the rd activities of tsa including its transportation security laboratory followed in fy2006 in both years however congress disapproved the departments proposals to transfer the coast guards rd program the coast guard program continues to operate independently consolidation was seen by its advocates as having the potential to foster collaboration increase synergy between programs reduce duplication streamline processes and procedures and improve budgeting and oversight critics however expressed doubt about the st directorates ability to balance rd priorities across growing spectrum of responsibilities one concern was whether the directorate would effectively support the departments nonhomeland security missions the fact that the coast guard has both homeland security and nonhomeland security responsibilities was key factor in congresss decision to keep its rd efforts intact 77 another concern was whether the directorates heavy empha sis on countering weapons of mass destruction would result in the neglect of other smaller programs the directorates experiences with consolidation have been mixed the integration of the customs service rd program and several other smaller activities seems to have gone smoothly in contrast absorbing tsas rd program was perceived as being so difficult that in 2006 the senate committee on appropriations proposed transferring the transportation security laboratory back to tsa the committee is also aware st and tsa have not come to agreement on the research priorities for this portfolio given these issues the committee believes tsl would be better managed by tsa 78 this proposal was abandoned after the st directorate and tsa signed memorandum of understanding in august 200679 the establishment of the

beginning of more general trend toward deconsolidation remains to be seen one apparent motivation for its establishment as separate organization was congresss displeasure with the management of the st directorate for example the house committee on appropriations expressed its dissatisfaction with removing dndo from the st directorate but nevertheless appr oved the move because of the liability it would face otherwise hrept 109476 sinc the appointment of under secretary cohen congress has appeared more confident in the st directorates competence81 if that confidence continues further

dndo as freestanding office outside the st directorate like the continued existence of small rd activity in the coast guard raises questions about how effectively the under secretary for st will be able to carry out his responsibility of coordinating and integrating all research development demonstration testing and evaluation activities of the department 82 in providing statutory authority for dndo the safe port act required that the under secretary and the director of dndo provide joint notifications to congress regarding nuclear and radiological dete ction and directed dndo to coordinate with the under secretary on basic and advanced or transformational research and development efforts relevant to the mission of both organizations 83 it is unclear how effective this coordination has been the rapid growth of dndo both in absolute terms and relative to the st directorate arguably represents shift of rd authority away from the under secretary if st directorate budgets decline or remain constant while dndo budgets increase the dhs rd budget may become increasingly weighted towards dndo efforts although much of dndos activity is operational and operational activities have been transferred out of the st directorate with little objection dndo also funds substantial amount of rd it also conducts substantial testing and evaluation some of which has been heavily criticized 84 finally as noted above the establishment of dndo appears to reflect an increase in the priority dhs places on countering radiological and nuclear threats if that priority should shift the separation of dndo from the st directorate may make it more difficult to rebalance the departments rd activities

the terms of the special statutory arrangement previously mentioned the doe national laboratories also frequently provide the directorate with technical experts for program planning and oversight in some cases these experts work for the directorate for limited period under the intergovernmental personnel act ipa 5 usc 337176 with the expectation of subsequently returning to their original laboratories the directorates extensive use of national laboratory employees including ipa employees has been an issue of congressional interest especially with respect to the influence these employees have on the choice of contractors and the formulation of funding opportunities 85 in addition the national laboratories can compete for the directorates rd funding each year the directorate issues several broad agency announcements soliciting rd proposals from outside the department proposals submitted in response to these announcements have largely come from industry but because the broad agency announcement process is an open competitive solicitation national laboratories may also participate unless specifically excluded questions have been raised about whether this situation is appropriate and sound whether the national laboratories have an undue advantage over industry for example because of their long history of conducting classified and sensitive r d for the federal government and whether the department has an explicit or implicit policy about the balance between awards to industry and awards to the national laboratories soon after its establishment the directorate tried to resolve these issues by designating some of the doe national laboratories as intramural and othe rs as extramural the intramural laboratories would have had closer relationship with the directorate but would have been ineligible for competitively awarded contracts such as f unds awarded through broad agency announcements the extramural laboratories would have been eligible for competitive awards but not for other funding from the directorate this plan was soon abandoned when it encountered congressional opposition 86

homeland security as result he said it had very difficult time coming to fruition87 few months later he explained that the directorate had originally interpreted the requirement to work in consultation with other agencies as requiring the concurrence of those agencies process that he described as tortuous he stated that he would reinterpret consultation as giving other agencies an opportunity to comment and under that interpretation he would work to get this through omb to the best of my ability before the end of fy200788 in december 2007 the st directorate released

participate in tswg the st directorates strategic plan notes that within the directorate the interagency programs division facilitates governmentwide coordination and the office of national laboratories coordinates with doe regarding the national laboratories the rd plan accompanying the strategic plan does not explicitly identify areas of overlap or synergy with other federal agencies one prominent program for which interagency coordination has been an issue is project bioshield under this program the secretary of homeland security is responsible for assessing whether particular biological chemical radiolog ical or nuclear agent poses material threat to national security in practice the analysis that underpins this assessment is performed by the st directorate the office of health affairs also participates once the secretary makes material threat determination the department of health and human services hhs may procure countermeasures for that agent using 10year block of funds that were appropriated to dhs in fy2004 congress and other stakeholders have criticized dhs for making material threat determinations too slowly and thereby slowing the pace of countermeasure procurement by hhs management and oversight of the program are complicated by discrepancies between dhs and hhs about the amount of funds that remain available for more details see crs report rl33907

its optimal investment strategy was unclear the range of threats and vulnerabilities was broad and the directorate initially placed premium on identifying technologies in an advanced stage of development transitioning them into deployable equipment and providing this equipment to end users one dhs official believed theres lot of lowhanging fruit out there capability that alre ady exists either commercially or in laboratory prototypes 93 as the directorate matures and its rd results are implemented and deployed this focus on lowhanging fruit may need to evolve into more diverse strategy that also includes more fundamental research and riskier investments fundamental or basic research is often identified as key source of future technologies and research with innately higher risk but also higher reward may have more potential for significant breakthroughs some experts advocate more st directorate investment in these types of research failure to invest in longerterm research limi ts the prospects for future breakthroughs that could dramatically improve dhss ability to fulfill its mission as the st directorate matures so must its st portfoliowhich means investing in portfolio of both nearterm and longterm research i understand that the st directorates leadership now shares this view i particularly welcome admiral cohens plans to fund some highrisk but potentially very high payoff projects serious pathology that can overtake technology development program is to become failure intolerant forcing it to settle on safe bets that are less ambitious than its mission requires admiral cohen will need your support if he hopes to avoid this 93 comments of penrose albright assistant under secretary for science and technology department of homeland security

accountable if he doesnt94 key component of such strategy is assessing the progress of funded research projects without effective assessment it may be difficult to sustain investment in longterm research activities that appear to be progressing slowly or conversely it may be difficult to terminate projects that appear productive but are not leading toward an appropriate goal depending on the stage and purpose of the research activity criteria for success and thus for continued investment by the directorate may vary substantial investments in planning may be needed to establish appropriate criteria and assess programs effectively the difficulty of establishing quantitative goals and metrics for rd effectiveness is well known challenge for the evaluation of rd programs 95 the impact of longerrange research may not be evident for years after its completion even if success can be measured success rates may vary widely between comparably effective programs depending on the character of the rd undertaken for example the defense advanced research projects agency darpa funds high risk highreward rd the likelihood of succes s for any individual darpa activity is low but that is expected the success of the program overall is judged by the impact of the activities that are successful in contrast an rd program engaged mainly in incremental endstage development where there is lower risk of failure might be expected to have higher individual success rate but less impact for each individual result the government performance and results act of 1993 gpra pl 10362 attempted to address metrics and goals for federal agencies creating greater efficiency effectiveness and accountability in federal spending and requiring agencies to set goals and to use performance measures for management and ultimately for budgeting 96 although the outcome of gpra has been foundation of performancebased planning for federal agencies evaluation of strategic planning continues to be weakness97 the administration has also set priority on performance measures as part of the budgetary process establishing the program assessment rating tool part as part of the performance assessment methodology used under the presidents management agenda98 some of the st directorates research portfolios have undergone part assessments with range of results99 some programs such as the biological countermeasures program were assessed as effective while others such as the chemical and explosive countermeasures program were not the part 94 testimony of gerald l epstein center for strategic and

complicates assessment of the st directorate programs existing programs transferre d in whole or in part into the st directorate may have lacked an initial homeland security focus blunting their efficacy new programs developed by the st directorate with the necessary homeland security focus lack history of operation and management challenging the smooth and efficient implementation of the programs stated goals measuring outcomes from programs with long time scales where results are not expected to be seen for several years may pose challenge to the part technique as stated by the white house office of management and budget the administration is aware that predicting and assessing the outcomes of basic research in particular is never easy100 at minimum though the part documentation for st directorate programs aims to provide clearer information about program goals and performance rd management and effective practices to the extent that this is successful this information helps to inform outside analysts of the directorates plans 101 some observers had hoped that the directorates strategic planning process would identify quantitative metrics and goals this was not the case however the program work statements in the 2007 rd plan mostly describe qualitative increase improvement and development rather than quantitative criteria another similar approach would be to use the homeland security science and technology advisory committee or an outside body such as the national academy of sciences to independently validate the directorates strategic planning documents with goals and metrics for the short medium and long terms statute has mandated comparable requirements in other st fields102 while the st directorate uses committees of the national academies for advice on an ad hoc basis it has not engaged the national academies or any other organization to perform rigorous endtoend assessment of the directorates research activities

obtain information from the st directorate is recurring criticism103 entrepreneurs with technologies potentially applicable to homeland security problems have sometimes had difficulty identifying

governmentwide website fedbizopps106 the preferred mechanism for submission of unsolicited proposals is through the office of procurement operations107 such submissions are sent to the headquarters office of procurement operations rather than directly to the st directorate the st directorate itself maintains an email address for submissions of concepts and ideas108 in may 2007 the directorate held stakeholder conference for which under secretary cohen described the message as we are open for business and we know how to do business 109 announcements of subsequent stakeholder conferences have listed goals such as describing the business opportunities for privat sector organizations and universities demonstrating business partnership opportunities in st research and explaining how to do business with the dhs st research enterprise110 in november 2007 the directorate released dhs st long range broad agency announcement this baa was partly response to concerns that entrepreneurs and researchers might be unable to bring their ideas to the directorate if there is open request for proposals or baa the longrange baa is open through december 31 2008 and provides vehicle for submission of broad range of homeland security rd ideas and proposals it states readers should note that this is an announcement to declare sts broad role in competitive funding of meritorious research across spectrum of science and engineering disciplines 111 under secretary cohen has also identified continued outreach efforts on the part of the directorate and the components of the directorate as efforts to encourage greater industry participation112 the directorate has held or partnered with other group s to hold conferences in the united states and the united kingdom to engage stakeholders and provide attendees with access and contact emphasizing the importance of maintaining good contacts with industry and others under secretary cohen testified as i have often said one knows where good

information have sometimes extended to congress as well congress has criticized the directorate along with dhs as whole for not providing it with information in timely manner for example the house committee report accompanying the department of homeland security appropriations act 2007 bill stated that the committee is very disappointed by sts poor response to congressional requests for information including failure to provide congressionally directed reports after three years there has been measurable improvement in this area which is unacceptable114 under secretary cohen responded to such congressional concerns the month after he was confirmed he stated that the st directorate will execute appropriations as intended by congress we will also be fiscally accountable to our dhs customers the congress and the american people the st directorate cfo will help put in place the systems and protocols to enable st directorate to be fully responsive and transparent in the

confirmation in august 2006 the restructuring changed both the directorates functional organization and its operat ing policies an understanding of the previous structure may be helpful when considering budgets and other documents from the period before the change then as now the directorate had matrix organization research areas known as portfolios were established in the office of programs planning and budget ppb subsequently the office of programs planning and requirements the directorates budgeting aligned with these portfolio topics actual management of rd projects however was the responsibility of three other offices depending on the nature of the work intramural rd was managed by the office of research and development ord extramural rd by the homeland security advanced research projects agency hsarpa and systems engineering and prototype transition by the office of systems engineering and development sed the heads of ppb ord hsarpa and sed each reported directly to the under secretary only the congressionally authorized hsarpa survives in the current structure and its scope is greatly reduced this matrix structure had some potential advantages the manager of each portfolio could allocate funds flexibly either within the government or outside it portfolio managers could facilitate information flow in their research topic between federal researchers and the private sector meanwhile because ord hsarpa and sed each managed parts of multiple portfolios they could identify and act upon synergies between research areas on the other hand the matrix structure created management challenges and complicated reporting and oversight the manager of any given rd pr oject reported to the head of either ord hsarpa or sed but was funded by portfolio ma nager in ppb conversely the manager of portfolio in ppb had only indirect authority over the project managers who executed the rd he or she was funding management reporting chains and lines of budget responsibility met only in the office of the under secretary in addition to its inherent difficulties this situation was unfamiliar and confusing to outside observers including many in congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34356g22g145g142g561g6g10g21g561g6g146g155g142g140g157g152g155g138g157g142g561g152g143g561g21g140g146g142g151g140 g142g561g138g151g141g561g22g142g140g145g151
