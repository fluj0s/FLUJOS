12958 decl 08072018 tags prel parm ir mu subject oman remains wary of iranian expansionism classified by ambassador gary grappo per 14 b and d summary 1 snf minister of the royal office and head of the office of the supreme commander of the armed forces lieutenant general ali bin majid almaamari reviewed omans view on iran from security perspective highlighting omani awareness of irans deceptive tactics and expansionist ideological desires in the region during an introductory meeting with navcent commander vadm william gortney accompanied by the ambassador general ali addressed the iranian nuclear file security in the strait of hormuz and iranian interference in the region ali majids suspicious view of iran stands in stark contrast to conciliatory if not obsequious public comments of omani minister responsible for foreign affairs yusuf bin alawi regarding iran and its role in the region end summary wont oppose further sanctions on iran 2 snf characterizing omans preference for frankness and clarity general ali began his comments on iran by noting the reality of iran as nearby neighbor which influenced omans relations with iran toward the end of the discussion he compared omans normal relations with iran to the relations of other gcc members with iran throughout the meeting he frequently touched on the theme of how different oman was from other gcc member states whose real intentions and positions often eluded omani comprehension 3 snf the iranian nuclear issue stood at the forefront of the generals mind he described the nuclear file as an international issue noting that resolution of this issue should be dealt with through international bodies such as the security council and the international atomic energy agency iaea oman would respect decisions of these groups and play its role in the international community oman would not oppose imposition of further measures against iran by the international bodies however oman did not want to play an active role in advocating for such measures itself iranian intentions clear stall for time 4 snf ali majid stated that oman was aware of iranian stall tactics in the talks over the nuclear issue instead of responding by the august 5 deadline the iranian side offered new initiative for talks confirming reports from the us and others that iran indeed is trying merely to buy time letting the 5 august deadline pass in responding positively to the p5 1 proposal made the iranian intention to stall very clear to oman the ambassador noted that the us has been working with allies around the world and especially within the eu to further restrict iranian economic activity in an effort to influence irans position on the nuclear file general ali agreed that sanctions to date were having an impact on the iranian economy despite irans public denials moreover he said iran believed the us would never attack iran belief that encouraged iran to persist in its stall tactics nevertheless he advocated nonmilitary solution as the best option for the us and suggested that over the long term establishment of us relations at some level with the iranian government might enable the us to better influence the iranian government and people empty threats against the strait 5 snf responding to the ambassadors question about recent iranian statements threatening the strait of hormuz ali majid dismissed the threats as empty words and perhaps feeble attempt to up its bargaining leverage vis vis the p5 1 vadm gortney echoed the ambassadors comments that such rhetoric negatively impacted the worlds view of iran and ultimately would undermine irans standing in the international community on this same issue the general expressed his pleasure with the white house press statement on august 5 responding to the irgc commanders comments regarding closure of the strait agreeing that iranian closure of the strait would be suicide ie more harmful to irans own economic interests he also commended the us for not escalating the rhetoric but instead putting irans comments into proper perspective iraq and iranian expansionism muscat 00000565 002 of 003 6 snf prior to delving into the nuclear issues ali majid acknowledged that iranian interference in iraq prevented achievement of stable security environment there he allowed that at minimum iran indirectly supported shia militia in iraq elaborating on his theme of iranian expansionist ideology he noted that the iranian national radio broadcast commenced with the prelude the voice of the islamic republic from tehran focusing on from tehran he astutely raised omani concerns that such language revealed irans true intentions greater islamic republic with tehran at its center he further speculated that iran wanted to give the impression that the islamic republic might already encompass iraq lebanon syria and even the gulf 7 snf ali majid linked the nuclear issue and the interference in iraq by speculating that resolution might entice iran into ceasing its interference in iraq he offered rhetorical question on whether iran was serious about challenging the major powers or is it posturing in the media for domestic consumption he conceded that he truly did not know the answer but that with irans continued attitude on the nuclear issue the security situation in iraq would remain unresolved citing omans preference for nonmilitary solution he nevertheless acknowledged that nucleararmed iran as opposed to war with iran posed an extremely difficult dilemma for all of us playing to their domestic audience 8 snf acknowledging irans revolutionary zeal the general attempted to put iranian public statements in perspective when he described as exaggerations those comments by iranian president mahmud ahmedi nejad or other iranian figures particularly regarding military capabilities countries that believe they have some specific military weapons advantages usually keep them secret he averred he asserted that in the end all power resided with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei 9 snf ali majid portrayed shia ideology as another factor complicating possible military conflict with iran iranian leaders would not balk at sacrificing quarter of their 60 million citizens in military conflict the shia tradition of martyrdom spanned 14 centuries the annual selfflagellation of shia over 1400 years served as an example of this martyr psychology beyond its shia ideology pride in its persian national identity compelled iran to demand international recognition and respect 10 snf returning back to comments about gcc countries general ali singled out kuwait bahrain and qatar as three gulf countries that probably would want the us to strike iran however he urged the us to determine whether such voices were speaking on the basis of logic or emotion he likened private entreaties of these countries to the us for military action on iran to the iraqi opposition in exile providing the us false information on iraq that led to the invasion of iraq at the beginning of the meeting ali majid had noted that in contrast to oman other gcc members did not always speak with candor or clarity leaving oman to question the real motivations or intentions of its gcc brethren 11 snf punctuating his comments about irans irrationality ali majid pointed to libyan leader colonel muammar alqadhafis recent comment that iran is crazy not to pay attention to the history of yugoslavia and iraq whose ignoring of us pressure resulted in their collapse interestingly he referred to qadhafis transformation from pariah to emerging member of the international community by noting that qadhafi had once been our enemy oman in strategic relationship with the us 12 s shifting from iran ali majid underscored omans strategic relationship with the us and highlighted omans cooperation with the us on counterterrorism issues he described omans zero tolerance for extremism and refusal to negotiate with terrorists as policy established at least since 1970 the year of the sultans assumed power oman has been and continues to prepare itself to confront terrorism he said as it is not exempt from the plotting of terrorists while oman is encircled by problems specifically mentioning yemen iraq iran and pakistan muscat 00000565 003 of 003 oman remains vigilant in preventing such problems from reaching the sultanate on the topic of omans partnership with the us he harkened back to when the soviets had sought warm water port during the time of their invasion of afghanistan and were rebuffed by muscat as an example of how oman has stood at the side of the us he also highlighted the irony that now the world faced not the soviets but the taliban he quickly followed this by noting that the us would be wise to support talks with moderate members of the taliban which oman encouraged as way toward achieving security in afghanistan 13 snf participants in the meeting included vadm gortney the ambassador the admirals executive officer embassy muscats omc chief and grpo notetaker sayyid munthir bin majid alsaid head of the royal office liaison and coordination service participated as notetaker and translator for general ali comment 14 snf in light of recent more conciliatory statements by minister responsible for foreign affairs yusuf bin alawi ali majids blunt assessment of iranian intentions comes as refreshing reassurance of the official omani position on iran while careful to flag omans longstanding preference for nonmilitary solution to the iran question and less directly omans inability to actively confront iranian obstinacy the sultanate nevertheless maintains cleareyed view of iran its increasingly threatening behavior and the potential repercussions for the region his comments regarding attitudes and perceptions of fellow gcc members were startling as they would appear to confirm oft stated views of gcc counterparts of oman as the sometimes odd man out in the gcc ali majids comments suggest that while not entirely comfortable with this the omanis acknowledge it ali majid as the sultans top security official and advisor is known for taking more hardline view of matters relating to regional security however given his closeness to the sultan and his status as member of the innermost circle of the sultans confidants such views to senior us officer can be assumed to accord with those of qaboos grappo
