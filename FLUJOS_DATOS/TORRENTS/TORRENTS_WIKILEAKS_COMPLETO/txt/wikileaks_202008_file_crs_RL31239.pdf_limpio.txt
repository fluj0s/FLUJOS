constitutionality of the statute prohibiting radio and television advertising of cigarettes and little cigars this case however seems of little precedential value today it was decided at time when the court deemed commercial speech to have constitutional protection see valentine v chrestensen 316 us 52 1942 in addition the ban on tobacco advertising applies to any medium of electronic communication subject to the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission which when the supreme court upheld the statute in 1972 before the prevalence of commercial cable television meant essentially broadcast radio and television and in 1972 under the spectrum scarcity rationale of red lion broadcasting co v federal communications commission 395 us 367 1969 broadcast radio and television had limited first amendment protection the force of red lion today seems questionable cf turner broadcasting system inc v federal communications commission 512 us 622 638 1994 and red lion in any event

c1prohibiting television advertising of alcoholic beverages constitutional analysis background although federal law prohibits radio and television advertising of cigarettes and little cigars 15 usc 1335 and smokeless tobacco 15 usc 4402 it does not prohibit radio and television advertising of alcoholic beverages1 however starting in 1936 for radio and 1948 for television the industry voluntarily refrained from advertising hard liquor on radio or television then in june 1996 seagram started to advertise its crown royal canadian whisky on an nbc station in corpus christi texas and on november 7 1996 the distilled spirits council of the united states said that it would lift the ban but that it had drawn up 26 guidelines for the industry to follow guidelines that will avoid younger audience but also allow this industry to compete more effectively 2 nevertheless the four major television networks announced at the time that they would not air liquor advertisements then in december 2001 nbc announced that it would accept liquor ads but imposed 19 rules to govern them including limiting them to after 9 pm est requiring that actors in them be at least 30 years old and requiring liquor advertisers also run social responsibility messages on subjects like designated drivers and drinking moderately3 in march 2002 nbc announced that it would longer accept liquor ads4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31239crs2 5commercial speech for purposes of first amendment analysis is speech that proposes commercial transaction board of trustees of the state university of new york

equate this test with the less rigorous obstacles of rational basis review florida bar v went for it inc 515 us 618 632 1995 in other words although restriction on commercial speech need not constitute the least restrictive means to satisfy the fourth prong it must be more than merely rationalfirst amendment protection of commercial speech the first amendment to the us constitution provides that congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press despite its absolute language the first amendment provides only limited protection to commercial speech which includes advertisements5 commercial speech may be banned if it advertises an illegal product or service and unlike fully protected speech may be banned if it is unfair or deceptive even when it advertises legal product and is not unfair or deceptive the government may regulate commercial speech more than it may regulate fully protected speech fully protected speech may be restricted only to promote compelling interest and only by the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest6 for commercial speech by contrast the supreme court has prescribe d the fourprong centr hudson test to determine its constitutionality this test asks initially 1 whether the commercial speech at issue is protected by the first amendment that is whether it concerns lawful activity and is not misleading and 2 whether the asserted governmental interest in restricting it is substantial if both inquiries yield positive answers then to be constitutional the restriction must 3 directly advance the governmental interest asserted and 4 be not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest7 the supreme court however subsequent to central hudson held that the fourth prong should not to be interpreted strictly to require the legislature to use the least restrictive means available to accomplish its purpose rather the court held legislation regulating commercial speech satisfies the fourth prong if there is reasonable fit between the legislatures ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31239crs3 9478 us 328 341 1986 10514 us 476 1995 11id at 488 12517 us at 505applying the central hudson test the first prong of the central hudson test asks whether the restricted speech concerns lawful activity and is not misleading the sale of alcoholic beverages is generally lawful and we assume that ban on radio and television advertising of alcoholic beverages would apply to nonmisleading advertisements the second prong of the central hudson test asks whether the asserted governmental interest in restricting the commercial speech in question is substantial the supreme court in posadas puerto rico associates v tourism company of puerto rico held that governments interest in the health safety and welfare of its citizens constitutes substantial governmental interest9 there thus seems doubt that ban on alcoholic beverage advertising would satisfy the second prong it is on the next two prongs that the case likely will turn as these prongs address whether the governments restriction on commer cial speech is reasonable way to further that interest in rubin v coors brewing co the court struck down federal statute 27 usc 205e that prohibited beer labels from displaying alcohol content unless state law requires such disclosure10 the court found sufficiently substantial to satisfy the second prong of the central hudson test the governments interest in curbing strength wars by beer brewers who might seek to compete for customers on the basis of alcohol content with respect to the third prong however it concluded that the ban cannot directly and materially advance this interest because of the overall irrationality of the governments regulatory scheme11 this irrationality was evidenced by the fact that the ban did not apply to beer advertisements and by the fact that the statute required the disclosure of alcohol content on the labels of wines and spirits in 44 liquormart inc v rhode island the court struck down statute that prohibited advertising the price of alcoholic beverages finding that rhode island had not met its burden of showing that the ban will significantly advance the states interest in promoting temperance12 cases like rubin and 44 liquormart indicate that to satisfy the third prong of the central hudson test the government must present evidence to support its claim that its restriction on commercial speech directly and materially advances substantial governmental interest in florida bar v went for it inc the court upheld rule of the florida bar that prohibited personal injury lawyers from sending targeted directmail solicitations to victims and their relatives for 30 days following an accidenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31239crs4 13515 us 618 1995 14id at 624 15id at 627 16517 us at 507 17the supreme court has acknowledged the theory that product advertising stimulates demand for products while suppressing advertising may have the opposite effect lorillard tobacco co v reilly 533 us 525 560561 2001 18idor disaster13 the bar argued that it has substantial interest in protecting the privacy and tranquilit of personal injury victims and their loved ones against intrusive unsolicited contact by lawyers14 and the court found that the anecdotal record mustered by the bar to demonstrate that its rule would advance this interest in direct and material way was noteworthy for its breadth and detail it was not mere speculation and conjecture15 by contrast in 44 liquormart the court found that any conclusion that elimination of the ban on alcoholic beverage price advertising would significantly increase alcohol consumption would require us to engage in the sort of speculation or conjecture that is an unacceptable means of demonstrating that restriction on commercial speech directly advances the states asserted interest16 thus if ban on radio and television advertising of alcoholic beverages were enacted and challenged as unconstitutional the government would have to demonstrate that such ban would directly and materially advance the governmental interest in reducing alcohol consumption arguably ban on radio and television advertising of alcoholic beverages would advance the governmental interest in reducing alcohol consumption in much more straightforward way than the laws against disclosing alcohol content or alcohol prices that the supreme court held unconstitutional and consequently would likely be found to satisfy the third prong of the central hudson test17 we turn now to the fourth prong of the central hudson test that restrictions on commercial speech constitute reasonable fit between the legislatures ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends in 44 liquormart the court found it perfectly obvious that alternative forms of regulation would be more likely to achieve the states goal of promoting temperance as the states own expert conceded higher prices can be maintained either by direct regulation or by increased taxation even educational campaigns might prove to be more effective18 with respect to ban on radio and television advertising of alcoholic beverages it does not seem perfectly obvious that alternative forms of regulation would be more likely to achieve the states goal of promoting temperance another goal of ban on radio and television advertising however might be to protect children in particular from such advertising and court might find that totalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31239crs5

23id at 503ban on radio and television advertising is not necessary to accomplish this goal federal court of appeals declared unconstitutional statute that prohibited indecent material on broadcast radio and television but subsequently upheld such statute that banned it only from 6 am to 10 pm which congress had deemed to be the hours when most children are in the audience19 indecent material however is fully protected by the first amendment and therefore may be restricted only by the least restrictive means available to further compelling governmental interest20 restriction of commercial speech by contrast need merely represent reasonable fit between means and ends under this standard it seems more likely that court would uphold total ban on radio and television advertising nevertheless 1996 court of appeals case anheuserbusch inc v schmoke might support an argument that total ban on radio and television advertising would be unconstitutional21 the fourth circuit in 1995 had upheld city ordinance that prohibited except in certain commercially and industrially zoned areas of the city billboards and other outdoor advertising of alcoholic beverages the supreme court vacated and remanded to the fourth circuit for further consideration in light of 44 liquormart the fourth circuit after further consideration in light of 44 liquormart readopted its previous decision in 44 liquormart the supreme court had increased the protection that the central hudson test guarantees to commercial speech by making clear that when state entirely prohibits the dissemination of truthful nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons unrelated to the preservation of fair bargaining process the courts should apply stricter review than when regulation is designed to protect consumers from misleading deceptive or aggressive sales practices22 the court found that the first amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good23 in its reconsideration of anheuserbusch inc v schmoke the fourth circuit wrote that in its previous decisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31239crs6 we recognized the reasonableness of baltimore citys legislative finding that there is definite correlation between alcoholic beverage advertising and underage drinking while we acknowledged that the geographical limitation on outdoor advertising may also reduce the opportunities of adults to receive the information we recognize that there were numerous other means of advertising to adults in 44 liquormart by contrast the state prohibited all advertising throughout rhode island in any manner whatsoever of the price of alcoholic beverages except for price tags or signs displayed with the beverages and not visible from the street while rhode islands blanket ban on price advertising failed central hudson scrutiny baltimores attempt to zone outdoor alcoholic beverage advertising into appropriate areas survived our close look at the legislatures means of accomplishing its objective baltimores ordinance expressly targets persons who cannot be legal users of alcoholic beverages not legal users as in rhode island more significantly baltimore does not ban outdoor advertising of alcoholic beverages outright but merely restricts the time place and manner of such advertisements and baltimores ordinance does not foreclose the plethora of newspaper magazine radio television direct mail internet and other media available to anheuserbusch and its competitors this quotation might support the constitutionality of ban on radio and television advertising of alcoholic beverages as the government could argue that such advertising is especially accessible to children and that such ban does not foreclose advertisements for alcoholic beverages in the plethora of other media at the same time however the fourth circuits finding significant the fact that baltimore does not ban outdoor advertising of alcoholic beverages outright but merely restricts the time place and manner of such advertisements might support an argument that 24houraday ban on radio and television advertising of alcoholic beverages would go beyond reasonable fit between the governments ends and means ban of fewer than 24 hours one might argue might be sufficient to protect children nevertheless because the government in regulating commercial speech unlike in regulating indecent material is not required to use the least restrictive means available to further its ends the courts might uphold total ban on radio and television advertising of alcoholic beverages the fourth circuit focused on the fact that the baltimore regulation was aimed at protecting children though the supreme court in 44 liquormart said that it would be skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good its disapproval of governmental paternalism would likely diminish where such paternalism is directed at children furthermore the court in 44 liquormart objected to states entirely prohibiting the dissemination of truthful nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons unrelated to the preservation of fair bargaining process and the baltimore prohibition was not total subsequent to the fourth circuits decision the supreme court in lorillard tobacco co v reilly struck down under the fourth prong of the central hudsonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31239crs7 24533 us 525 2001 25id at 562 26id at 564 27since 1994 the court has struck down commercial speech restrictions in ibanez v florida board of accountancy 512 us 136 1994 rubin v coors brewing co 514 us 476 1995 florida bar v went for it inc 515 us 618 1995 44 liquormart inc v rhode island 517 us 484 1996 greater new orleans broadcasting association inc v united states 527 us 173 1999 and lorillard tobacco co v reilly 533 us 525 2001 since 1994 it has upheld restrictions only in lorillard and these concerned retail product placement not advertisingtest massachusetts regulation that prohibited the outdoor advertising of cigarettes smokeless tobacco and cigars within 1000 feet of schools or playgrounds24 the court found that the regulation prohibited advertising in substantial portion of the major metropolitan areas of massachusetts25 and that such burden on speech did not constitute reasonable fit between the means and ends of the regulatory scheme similarly ban on all signs of any size seems ill suited to target the problem of highly visible billboards as opposed to smaller signs26 the lorillard decision need not be read to imply that the court today would disapprove of the fourth circuits decision as the regulations at issue in the two cases were different it is unclear for example whether the baltimore regulations inapplicabilit in certain commercially and industrially zoned areas of the city prevented it from restricting speech as the massachusetts regulation did in substantial portion of the metropolitan area but lorillard was continuation of the courts trend in recent years of striking down governmental restrictions of commercial speech27 conclusion whether the supreme court would uphold restriction on television advertising of alcoholic beverages might depend upon whether the court views it as an attempt to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good or as an attempt to protect children it might be more likely to view 24hour ban as the former and more limited ban as the latter furthermore in light of the dc circuits having upheld the 6 am 10 pm ban on indecent material on broadcast radio and television and the fact that indecent material receives greater first amendment protection than commercial speech it seems likely that comparable restriction on radio and television advertising of alcoholic beverages would be found constitutional it is more difficult to predict however whether 24houraday ban would be upheld though the dc circuit struck down such ban for indecent material such material again receives greater first amendment protection than commercial speech yet the supreme courts trend of striking down commercial speech restrictions makes it hardly certain that it would uphold 24hour ban on television advertising of alcoholic beverages
