according to the joint united nations program on hivaids unaids at the end of 2007 an timated 332 million people were living with hivaids of whom 25 million were newl infected and 21 million died in the course of that year more than 2 million of those living with hivaids at the end of 2007 were children and so 290000 of those who died of aids that year were under 15 years old on each day of 2007 some 1000 children worldwide became newly infected with hiv due in large pa rt to little access to drugs that prevent the transmission of hiv from mother to child an estimated 9 of pregnant women in low and middleincome countries were offe red services to prevent hiv transmission to their newborns unaids asserts that an effective fight against the global spread of hivaids would cost 15 billion in 2006 18 billion in 2007 and 22 billion in 2008 in fy2006 congress provided about 31 billion fo r international hivaids programs and us contributions to the global fund to fight hivaids tb and malaria 43 billion in fy2007 and 57 billion in fy2008 most recent statistics indicate that in 2005 some 83 billion was spent on hivaids globally though unaids estimated that 116 b illion was needed about 43 billion of those funds were provided by donor governments the kais er family foundation asserts that in 2005 the united states provided the largest percentage of hivaids assistance in the world

burden in subsaharan africa where 70 of the worlds 14 million coinfected people live as many as half of all hivpositive people in africa have tb and one out of three dies of tb and up to 80 of all african tb patients have hiv13 research has demonstrated that treatment of tb or hiv in co infected patients has positive effects on halting the advancement of both diseases studies have shown that hiv replication in creases during the active phase of tb and returns to baseline after successful tb th erapy conversely antiretroviral arv treatment may decrease the progression of latent tb to active tb allowing those infected with hiv to live longer14 some research has also found that mala ria contributes to the advancement of hiv replication greater sexual transmission of hiv and higher mothertochild hiv transmission mtct rates among the co infected for example one study in malawi found that adults with acute malaria had sevenfold increase in their hiv viral load15 however hiv viral loads decreased when malaria treatment was offered to some patients conversely hivpos itive pregnant women were more likely to contract malaria than hi vnegative pregnant women16 additionally malariahiv coinfection was associated with an increased risk of maternal perinatal and early infant death compared to infection of either disease alone researchers are also beginning to explore whether hivpositi ve pregnant women who are coinfected with malaria are more likely to transmit hiv to their children in uganda coinfected women had an hivtransmission rate of 40 while hivpositive women not infected with malaria had an hiv transmission rate of 15417 drug resistence complicates efforts to halt the spread of tb and malaria who estimates that about 450000 new multidrugresistant tb

plan focused on cont aining the deadly strain and advising health practitioners on xdrtb case management21 some experts believe that steady rise in malarial deaths in subsaharan africa is due in large part to an increase in treatment resistance one of the commonly used drugs chloroquine is quickly becoming ineffective in treating those infected with malaria22 chloroquine is affordable to many as it costs approximately 10 cents per course of treatment because it has been used for more than 50 years however resistant strains of malaria are rapidly veloping rendering the drug useless in growing number of cases newer treatment s that are more effective and have observable resistance are considerably more expensive the new drugs called artemisininbased combination therapie s acts cost about 2

to usaid in fy2005 it determined that the office of the global aids coordinator ogac would longer include malaria spending in its annual pepfar reports to congress and that budgetary requests for the

the risk of mtct can be reduced to under 2 by interv entions that include the provision of arv treatments elective caesarean delivery and complete avoidance of breastfeeding can also reduce the risk
