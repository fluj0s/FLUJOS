6505c18 shspec61 organization and ethics references hcopl 1may65 iii organization the design of the organization and the policy letters on staff status pp vivii in oec vol 1 staff status policy letters have been issued on the new org board we will remedy an old evil by putting after the persons name his certification and classification as an auditor his grade as pc and his staff status in the past in trying to appoint someone at distance lrh had trouble knowing who was there now copies of org boards will be exchanged between orgs and it will be easy in filling posts to see who is qualified for promotion to be staff member in tech one needs to have technical certificate that covers basics of the organization an admin terminal needs basic cert on the org then he is qualified as provisional staff status i they can be transferred without permission staff status ii is general staff member this individual has worked for and attained solid position from there on it goes up to incharge head of subsection this is the lowest exec rating an officer is in charge of section for instance the cramming officer is in charge of the cramming section then there are titles that are not associated with rank or status eg communicator post can also have deputies post assigned locally is deputy one assigned from st hill would be acting for awhile then the acting prefix is removed and the person has full status acting or deputy do not refer to rank they refer to permanency deputy is somebody who is in there temporarily small breath of air could dislodge him acting denotes st hill appointment after short time up to year the acting prefix is dropped then the person becomes the title without the prefix deputy hco exec sec is someone holding the post until confirmed it is not at all permanent acting hco exec sec is st hill appointment and therefore official to be an acting the person would have to have the appropriate staff status for the post this is not true of deputy but deputy doesnt draw the pay of an acting you put person on post to see how they do you cant wait to fill posts for someone with the proper staff status so we have the deputy rating this appointment must be confirmed by st hill to get an acting rating and full pay acting applies until person knows his hat cold and can apply it policy letters are pouring out covering everything from organizational theory to nitpicky details of minor hats ethics is there to hold the lines and to get technology in ie to make it possible for tech to go in that is its sole purpose and it is fabulously successful in fulfilling that purpose ethics is the tourniquet before the doctor arrives its purpose is to quiet the turbulence down long enough to allow the auditor to come in you carry ethics in until you get tech in it has looked like the publication of someone as an sp has the same effect as public hanging cancelling someones certs has the effect of getting him back in all straightened up within two to two and half years not cancelling the certs results in his going off into the wilds and never showing up again peter crundall for example had his certs cancelled five or six years ago when he was screaming and howling about something he had to get 500 hours of auditing at his own expense now he is being the featured lecturer at an org it took about two years for him to get his auditing started and he got it all handled so it is an unkind thing to do not to bring order into scientology area man has tremendous reaction to justice the purpose of ethics is to get in tech but mans law and mans justice is not like that man wants to squash people who get in his way his justice has end product save punishment it does not straighten out the community therefore it doesnt work police forces have bad morale because there is end product of penal action people know this and react against it and some on an aaa basis will react against ethics in scientology the same way you jar peoples banks when you present the idea of ethics be that as it may greater proportion of people in scientology today favor decent ethics system than are batting back at it this is because they see that good ethics system will give them better training processing and better grip of on scientology you cant sentence someone to technology or to getting better you can sentence him to not getting better one is forcing us to help people if someone keeps getting in the way it is pretty normal to stop wanting to assist him if you feel like blowing up organizations you should very carefully look up the justice actions of organizations and huge governments etc and compare these things if you do this you find some astonishing data the taut ship the viciously conducted regiment the harshly run empire all these survive and flourish with high esprit corps almost forever the sloppy ones succumb rapidly lrh got interested in this phenomenon while reading gibbons decline and fall of the roman empire the only long periods of progressive rule recovery from barbarian attacks and freedom from internal upsets were periods when the emperor was nut the good emperors got killed within few months this didnt jibe with lrhs experience in handling discipline on ship he realized that what works for small intimate group to keep the peace is different from what is needed for big group which gets lots of confusion in an org the points of enturbulation are the ones where the public impinges eg the line of getting the pc from the reg to the d of p this line keeps going out lrh used to wonder if there was something wrong with us to allow us to get enturbulated in this way then he looked at society in general and saw how much worse off their condition is society is deteriorating we are gradiently doing better and better as we expand we reach straight out into the tumult of society we had to have tools to extend our reach so that we could get our jobs done in time lrh found that as people moved up towards ot certain disdain occurred he saw that ethics would be necessary so that ots would take orderly bites out of people when they got annoyed by the disaster to that extent there is need for an ethics system because sufficiently powerful being annoyed at something is liable to straighten it up with such thoroughness that hardly anybody would ever recover and unless they have some orderly method of straightening things up they will straighten things up in their own way and it will make hell of mess the laws of ethics need to be known and understood they need to be predictable they cannot be capricious the question is are you for just shooting somebody down without warning or do you want ethics do you want law that just freakishly strikes down everybody in sight or do you want the kind of law that says here is the path narrow as it may seem in acting on these lines we have ethics rattling around in the orgs people are getting used to the tools you can give someone shock with heavy use of ethics it can be very effective used lightly used in this way ethics backs up tech most amazingly lrh has just discovered the pts case its cause and handling never audit pts the rollercoaster case is one that we have never been able to handle before he is connected to an sp and until ethics makes him disconnect or handle the sp he will continue to rollercoaster ethics can label the suppressive if nothing else you give the pts case the policy letter covering ptsness you dont have to issue an ethics order unless tech doesnt go in ie unless he cant or wont handle or disconnect you can insist that pts bring the sp in if necessary for auditing if things went that far you could threaten the pts person with not getting the sp audited unless the pts person gets him in before he is labeled an sp suppressives are pretty crazy the sp has got to fight he is back on the track fighting the ugbugs he is in an old ptp he is taking the actions in pt that would solve the problem with the ugbugs he is back on the track fighting an enemy that longer exists 99999999999 of his attention units are at some exact precise past period of the track and in that instant he is fighting off something and is trying to handle something by some means which are the ones he is using in pt he has problems with you and vice versa he isnt up there with you and you arent back there with him thats the whole anatomy of psychosis given associative restimulators and aaa youve got maddog type hes just defending himself in some mad insanity against things which are longer there hence the use of power processes on psychotics you can assume that the sp has problems in pt but those are not the problem that he wants to solve that problem is on the back track and it is loaded with crossassociations and identifications he misidentifies anyone who approaches or tries to help him in an effort to defend himself he is driven down to the first dynamic to such degree that one must get any better when he is driven down into the first dynamic he must destroy all around him one must get any better because they are the flying saucer people once scientology is known to be an effective way to help people watch out international city see pp 604609 above is being looked at by group connected to the we are having an effect the true antiscientologist isnt trying to be convinced he is trying to stop you you are the green alligator he is fighting 7000 years ago and if you or anyone else they are all the green alligator got any better you would be stronger and that would tear it and you would eat him up he thinks insanity is just total stuckness on the track in fight this is point that you prove instantly and utterly when you are running power class vii processes on someone power handles the sp and the insane the sp can be processed to sanity in under fifty hours but you had better have the organization and the ethics to hold things together you have to label ptss and sps to get the tech in an ethics action lasts until tech is in you use english to get tech in you stop it when youve got tech in even if stopping at that point leaves unfinished cycles of action along the way its not question of where does the ethics proceed its how long do you have to hold the area down an organization will run as long as it has channels and as long as particles on the channels dont carom off the sides of the channels and collide with the working parts of the organization if you can bring that about you can have an organization that would have total capability of pouring through it practically the whole of the human race lacking clean and definite flow channels your volume stays small because of all the barriers and stoppages that occur if the channel isnt kept open you cant handle the load scientology is probably the only outfit that ever hit this planet that meant exactly what it said and was doing exactly what it was doing and what it said it was doing and was doing exactly nothing else scientology doesnt have the time to do half the things that it has been accused of an sp saying i never said that believes that he really didnt and he is right in sense how the hell could he say anything he hasnt been there for seven trillion years im sure that many enthetaish people believe that weve gone stark staring mad with all this justice were just having little fun with justice just now and when we learn about it why well be able to control fairly well wide sphere of public in such way that they dont all get destroyed the main danger to them is not ethics its having their silly heads blown off because they make somebody mad youve got to have ethics in to handle nonscientologists if you put discipline in right at the start you can work very nicely with nonscientologists make sure that they know what ethics is how it works etc society is losing its grip we are putting in order to make an orderly show for the future
