legislative history and intent on november 26 2002 the improper payments information act ipia was signed into law as pl 107300 116 stat 2350 augmenting previous financial management reform laws the ipia is intended to increase financial accountability in the federal government and thereby reduce wasteful spending the law requires agencies each year to identify programs and activities that may be vulnerable to significant improper payments to estimate the amount of overpayments or underpayments and to report on the steps they are taking to reduce such payments as explained more fully below improper payments generally include any payments by the federal government that should not have been made or were made in an incorrect amount previously there was governmentwide requirement for agencies to estimate or report in any systematic way on improper payments although it is generally acknowledged that billions of dollars are involved the office of management and crs2 budget omb estimated that in fy2005 improper payments under 47 federal programs totaled approximately 373 billion an estimate the government accountability office gao formerly the general accounting office has suggested is too conservative1 the ipia was introduced in the 107th congress as hr 4878 on june 6 2002 by representative stephen horn with group of bipartisan cosponsors and referred to the house committee on government reform the subcommittee on government efficiency financial management and intergovernmental relations held markup on the measure on june 18 2002 and approved the bill as amended by unanimous voice vote on july 9 2002 hr 4878 was considered under suspension of the rules and passed the house as amended by voice vote on october 9 2002 the senate committee on governmental affairs ordered hr 4878 to be reported favorably with substitute amendment on october 17 2002 the bill as amended passed the senate by unanimous consent and on november 12 under suspension of the rules the house agreed to the senate amendment by voice vote the president signed hr 4868 into law on november 26 2002 pl 107300 the problem of improper payments had received attention in previous congresses httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22587 during house floor debate on hr 4878 representative horn noted that hearings held in the past clearly demonstrated the need for such legislation since the 104th congress the subcommittees i have chaired have held approximately 100 hearings on wasteful spending within the federal government time and again witnesses from the general accounting office and agency inspectors general have told the subcommittee that poor accounting systems and procedures have contributed to the governments serious and longterm problems involving improper payments2 in the written report of the senate committee on governmental affairs to accompany hr 4878 the provisions of the bill were explicitly linked to gao recommendations offered in best practices guide for agencies in managing improper payments prepared at the request of the committee chairman senator joseph lieberman the guide suggested that determining the nature and extent of risks for improper payments was crucial step hr 4878 would begin the process of improving the management of improper payments following gaos guidance by requiring that agencies annually estimate the amount of improper payments and report on the steps they are taking to reduce the amounts of those payments in the largest programs3 1 us congress senate subcommittee on federal financial management government

washington gpo 2002 p 2 crs3 major provisions the ipia directs each executive branch agency in accordance with omb guidance to review all its programs and activities each year identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments and estimate the amount of improper payments agencies are then to report annually to congress on improper payments using standardized methodology determined by omb4 with respect to any program or activity with estimated annual improper payments exceeding 10 million each agency is also required to provide report on agency actions to reduce such improper payments including 1 the causes of the improper payments and the results of the actions taken to address them 2 whether the agency has information systems and other necessary infrastructure to reduce such payments to minimal cost effective levels 3 if not budgetary resources requested to accomplish needed changes in information systems and infrastructure and 4 steps the agency has taken to ensure that managers are held accountable for reducing improper payments improper payment is defined as any payment that should not have been made or that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22587 was made in an incorrect amount this includes duplicate payments payments to ineligible recipients or for ineligible services or for services not received or that do not reflect applicable discounts the act covers payments made by federal agency federal contractor or governmental or other organization administering federal program or activity discussion the ipia codified and expanded efforts already underway in the executive branch to reduce improper payments in 2001 the bush administration designated improving financial performance as one of five governmentwide initiatives in the presidents management agenda pma the establishment of baseline on the extent of erroneous improper payments in major federal benefit programs was key component of the financial management initiative5 agencies were to include available information on erroneous payment rates for benefit and assistance programs over 2 billion as part of their fy2003 budget submissions in july 2001 revisions to omb circular a11 in section 57 implemented this objective requiring 15 federal agencies to include improper payment information with their initial fy2003 budget materials to omb enactment of the ipia extended improper payment reporting requirements to all executive branch departments and agencies lowered the threshold from 2 billion to 10 million and designated congress as well as omb to receive the annual agency reports 4 the ipia originally set deadline of march 31 for agencies to report to congress on their improper payments in the prior fiscal year the improper payments reports are now included in the performance and accountability reports or pars due to the president via omb and congress 45 days after the close of an agencys fiscal year generally november 15 see omb circular a136 form and content of the performance and accountability report par at httpwwwwhitehousegovombbulletinsb0109pdf 5 see us office of management and budget the presidents management agenda fy2002 washington omb 2001 pp 1921 for an overview of the pma see crs report rs21416 the presidents management agenda brief introduction by virginia mcmurtry crs4 in may 2003 omb distributed guide to instruct agencies on the implementation of the ipia6 the guide provided detailed definitions of improper or erroneous payments and of program and activity and then outlined four steps to be taken by the agencies first agencies were required to review systematically all their programs and activities and identify those which are susceptible to significant erroneous payments defined as annual erroneous payments in the program exceeding both 25 of the program payments and 10 million second agencies were to determine an annual estimated amount of erroneous payments made in those programs and activities found susceptible to significant errors this calculation was to be based on statistical random sample sufficiently large to yield an estimate with 90 percent confidence interval within 5 precision the third step was to determine why the particular programs were at risk and then put in place plan to reduce the erroneous payments the last step was agency reporting to the president via omb and congress on the estimates of the annual amount of erroneous payments in its programs and activities and on progress in reducing them there has been criticism of ombs guidance to the agencies for implementing the ipia particularly regarding the definition of significant emphasis added improper httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22587 payments in addition to the 10 million threshold in estimated improper spending established by the statute omb required that the payment represent at least 25 of total program payments the chairman and ranking minority member of the house subcommittee on government efficiency and financial management representative todd platts and representative marsha blackburn sent letter to omb in august 2003 questioning the 25 minimum threshold likewise according to news article senators charles grassley and max baucus the chairman and ranking minority member of the senate finance committee stated in january 9 2004 letter to omb director joshua bolten that omb should not have established the 25 threshold and should have simply required that agencies report all programs generating estimated improper payments of more than 10 million the senators reportedly observed that by adding the 25 threshold the improper payments figures that will eventually be reported to the public will look better and feel better than they really are7 gao has also argued that the 25 threshold could mask the extent of the improper payments problem in recent report gao identified many examples of agency programs with estimated improper payments over 10 million that were not included in the agencys improper payments estimate because they did not meet the 25 threshold8 for example gao said that the department of education did not report on three programs that each had estimated improper payments exceeding 10 million 155 million in total because in each case those payments represented less than 25 of program outlays p 44 if the 25 criterion were applied to large programs gao concluded billions of dollars in improper payments could go unreported p 54 omb 6 omb improper payments information act of 2002 public law 107300 memorandum for heads of executive departments and agencies from mitchell daniels may 21 2003 m03 13 ipia guidance was subsequently incorporated into appendix c of omb circular a123 7 cited by amelia gruber omb defends actions on improper payments govexeccom jan 14 2004 8 gao report gao0792 improper payments agencies fiscal year 2005 reporting under the improper payments information act remains incomplete dec 2006 pp 4145 crs5 has defended the 25 threshold stating it was established to ensure that agencies were focusing their resources on programs with the highest levels of risk for improper payments9 as noted above omb requires estimates of improper payments to be provided by agencies in their annual pars not all highrisk programs and activities however had estimates in place by the time agencies submitted their fy2005 pars agencies conducted risk assessment of all federal spending 25 trillion in fy2005 and concluded that 60 of government outlays 15 trillion were at risk for significant levels of improper payments10 agencies reported error rates for 47 programs in their fy2005 pars encompassing 13 trillion or 85 of the outlays identified as highrisk11 number of major programs including medicaid national school lunchbreakfast and the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic were among those lacking estimates omb controller linda combs in testimony before the house subcommittee on government management finance and accountability on april 5 2006 said the difficulty in developing error rates in these cases lay in the size and complexity of the programs many of which are administered by state governments12 combs also said that omb is working with states to collect the information necessary to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22587 produce valid estimates for these programs in the next two years in 2004 the bush administration designated eliminating improper payments as separate program initiative under the pma13 fifteen agencies have been graded at the end of each quarter by omb on their efforts to identify eliminate and recover improper payments the most recent scorecard showed that four agencies were green in status indicating full compliance with ombs improper payments standards eight agencies were yellow meaning they were actively putting the tools in place to achieve green and three agencies were red reflecting noncompliance in one or more areas14 in the initial ratings for improper payments at the end of 2004 agencies received green five were yellow and 10 were red15 thus in less than two years four agencies achieved green and the number of agencies receiving red declined from 10 to three 9 letter from linda combs omb controller to mccoy williams gao director of financial management and assurance oct 26 2006 10 omb improving the accuracy and

2004 crs6 data from the first two years of ipia implementation show that in both fy2004 and fy2005 the same seven programs accounted for approximately 95 of all reported erroneous payments16 the data also reflect decline in the governmentwide improper payments rate from 39 in fy2004 to 31 in fy2005 although there is disagreement as to why this occurred omb has stated that the decrease was the result of corrective actions taken by agencies while gao attributed it primarily to change in the way hhs estimated improper payments under medicare17 an upward trend in the scope of ipia coverage is evident as well in fy2004 agencies had established improper payment rates for programs that accounted for approximately 80 of risksusceptible dollars and in fy2005 as agencies developed error rates for 17 additional programs that figure increased to 85 further analysis of these trends will be possible following the release of ombs report on governmentwide improper payment activities during fy2006 meanwhile several oversight hearings on implementation of the ipia have been held the house subcommittee on government efficiency and financial management held oversight hearings on improper payments in may and july 2003 as did the house subcommittee on government management finance and accountability in july 2005 and april 200618 in the senate the subcommittee on federal financial management httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22587 government information and international security held improper payments hearings in july 2005 and in march and december 200619 congressional interest in
