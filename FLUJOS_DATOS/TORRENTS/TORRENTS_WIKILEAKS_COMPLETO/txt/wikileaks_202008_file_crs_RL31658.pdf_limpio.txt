united states conse quently washington has made considerable effort to enlist support of other nations in the campaign against terrorist financing to some extent internationa l efforts have mirrored us policy for example the united nations security council uns cr pursuant to unscr resolution 1390 january 16 2002 and related preceding resolutions maintains consolidated freeze list of some 300

orders in force only 4 countries including the united states account for about twothirds of the blocked 121 million according to us financial data how effective the campaign to limit terrorist finance has been is matter of controversy us officials regard the effort as vital adjunct to the overall fight against terrorism they claim that asset izures to date have constricted the funds of qaeda and

council monitoring group observes qaeda continues to have access to considerable financ ial and other resources as noted above reports indicate that less than 20 percent of the reported 121 million total in blocked terrorist assets have been frozen ce midjanuary 2002 which suggests that the campaign is yielding sharply diminishing returns government officials have indicated that it has proved extremely difficult to identify these additional funds and resources the report concludes10 the difficulty may be attributed to vari ous factors some observers claim that qaeda is relying increasingly on nonba nk mechanisms to move and store funds such as converting assets to untraceable commodities including gold and diamonds or moving funds via informal value transf er hawala system s that leave virtually paper trail alternatively qaeda may have acquired great er sophistication in laundering funds bin laden himself remarked to pakistani jour nalist shortly after the september 11 attacks that his financial backers are as aware of the cracks inside the western financial system as they are of the lines of their hands11 additionally the evident fragmentation of terrorist finances poses significant challenges for law enforcement many small terrorist cells are virtually self sustaining deriving income from legitimate businesses or from assorted small criminal scams12 in such cases there is not much of money trail to follow moreover terrorist operations tend to be cheap us government report notes the relatively modest funds needed to undertake them elude all but the most

internationa l cooperation in disrupting terror financing some of the wellsprings of financial support for terrorism especially sources in middle eastern countries reporte dly have been little affected by the post september 11 crackdown report by the council on foreign relations released in october 2002 states for years individuals and charities based in saudi arabia have been the most important sources of funds fo r qaeda and for years saudi officials have turned blind eye to this problem16 us officials publicly state that they are pleased with saudi cooperation but it is widely believed th at some saudi donors continue to finance terror17 july 2002 report by the royal canadian mounted police states that in saudi arabia alone individuals continue to donate 1 to 2 million month to bin laden through mos ques and other fundraising avenues that also perform legitimate charity work18 saudi performance in freezing assets seems to be improving between october and late nove mber 2002 the amount of funds blocked by the kingdom reportedly increas ed more than tenfold but whether this enforcement action has significantly curb ed the flow of funds to terrorists is uncertain washington can continue to try to pressure the saudis but for overarching strategic reasonsussaudi military ties and world dependence on saudi oilus leverage in the situation or the readiness to use it is limited another controversial topi c concerns the scope of the usled campaign us designations under executive order 13224 target international terrorism broadly and include numerous terrorist entities that have little or association with qaeda yet the international community has not ye t adopted unified definition of who is terrorist and what constitutes terrorist activity the universal adage one mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighte r has particular relevance here for instance the convention on terrorism of th organization of the islamic states says that peoples struggles aimed at liberation and selfdetermination shall not be considered terrorist crime19 hamas and hezbollah are excluded under this definition moreover the european union has not included hezbollah on its

performing an important role in this respect as the director of the muslim affairs council notes the administration policy has interfered with basic pillar or tenet of islam zakat or almsgiving in this respect the restriction on muslim charities is an issue of religious freedom23 the above discussion raises number of significant questions with respect to us counterterrorism policy and efforts

results fourth can the fight against terror finance be made more effective less disruptive and more compatible with the policies of foreign nations these questions will be addressed in the discussion that follows terror finance terrorist versus criminal finance terrorists and criminals generate and manipulate money for different ends and in somewhat different ways viewed in the simplest terms terrorists regional or global financial netw orks are designed to serve predominantly nonfinancial goalsfor example seeking political influence or legitimacy or disseminating an ideology criminals by contrast are concerned primarily with amassing vast quantities of wealth nd with concealing the fruits of their crimes the distinction should not be overdrawn because both terrori sts and criminals engage in activity that could be called politicalsuch as bankrolling political campaigns issuing communications through the media nd sponsoring social projects in poor neighborhoods criminals occasionally turn to terror tacticsth medellin cartels bombing campaign in colombian cities at the end of the 1980s is case in pointand like terrorists they have at times sought to negotiate amnesty arrangements with governments yet what criminals seek ultimately is protection in the broadest sensea favorable and secu re environment for the conduct of illicit enterprises terrorists agendas usually are broadly gauged aiming at liberation or selfdetermination of group redistribution of material power and wealth or in the case of bin laden fulfilling radical religious vision24 admittedly the motives of terrorists and criminals are sometimes intertwined some criminals may harbor exalted political ambitions and some terrorists may behave functionally as bandits in addition terrorists tend to finance th eir operations differently than criminals terrorists are known to engage in crimin activity such as robbery fraud drug running and counterfeiting especially at the individual cell level yet unlike criminals they rely on contributions for significant portion of their overall funding the most important source of q aedas money is its continuing fundraising efforts notes the abovementioned council on foreign relations report25 diversion of funds from char ities and other ngos plays an important role in this process although some donors convey funds to q aeda directly

ostensibly clean funds for violent and illicit purposes additionally some terrorist organizati ons rely on sympathetic states for infusions of money weapons and training examples in the middle east include the lebanese hezbollah and pa lestinian nationalist organizations such as hamas although such groups also maintain their own fundraising mechanisms26 iran currently appears to be the principal extern sponsor of these entities by contrast profitmotivated criminals do not ordinar ily receive government sponsorship or recognition although government s might unofficially tolerate their activities perhaps seeing reasonable alternative27 terrorist and criminal financing have f eatures in common both have employed range of bank and nonbank tr ansactions to store and tr ansfer funds yet in the postseptember 11 climate terrorists may feel especially pressured to move their organizations outside the formal financia l system certainly the freezing of 121 million in terrorist funds including more than 50 million in qaedarelated accounts represents disincentive to using ba nks it is possible that trade in high value commodities such as gold and diamonds and reliance on underground banking systems to be discussed in more detail below will play dominant role in terror finance for the foreseeable future qaedas financial network general principles qaeda financing can be divided into two basic categories one is more or less centra llydirected funding which supports system maintenance activities recruitment of adherent s training and logistics proselytizing and the like as well as coordination of significant terror activities these derive mainly from business commitme nts and contributions from arab supporters though trade in drugs and commoditie s may provide an additional funding stream second category relates to the decentralized daytoday operations of individual cells many of these are selfsupporting from petty crime or various odd jobs and minor

the united states so far has not chosen to make that case other possible sources of strategic f unding for the qaeda network can be cited one terror financial ex pert says that the qaeda network received millions of dollars per annum thr ough the production and distri bution of opium which was smuggled through neighboring central asia n states or transported to distributor networks in east africa41 however some disagreement exists on this point persuasive evidence exists that the taliban benefitted from the trade committee of experts report estimated that the taliban received between 15 million and 27 million per year from taxes on opium production in the late 1990s before banning such production in 200042 some experts believe however that qaeda itself benefitted little from the traffic which is said to be highly organized and resistant to penetr ation by outsiders43 drugs may play role in qaedas financing as they do for many terrorist organizations but their overall importance is uncertain trading in precious stones also appears to have played role in qaedas financing for instance the washington post citing western intelligence officials and other informed sources claims that bin ladens network reaped millions of dollars in the past three years from the illicit sale of diamonds moved by rebels in sierra leone44 according to the post top bin laden advisor named abdullah ahmed abdullah also one of the fbis most wanted terrorists initiated contacts with diamond dealer representing sierra leone s revolutionary united front ruf in liberia in september 1998 negotiations repor tedly resulted in an agreement to buy uncut diamonds from the ruf on re gular basis and qaeda co mmissioned professional diamond traders to transport the stones to

networks viewed in the most basic terms underground banking called by different terms such as hawala hundi or black market peso exchange is way of sending money cheaply and anonymously across borders without physical transport or electronic transfer of funds the transaction is essentially paperless it works as follows money brokers hawaladars in one country receive cash from client with questions asked for example the client might be cab driver in new york who wants to send 5000 to his brother in karachi the hawaladar alerts correspondent broker in karachi by telephone fa x or email who dispenses 5000 less fees and commissions to the brother neither the sender nor the recipient needs to identify themselves the latter only needs to provide prearranged code such as sequence of numbers and letters to complete the transaction at some other point clients in another c ountry may send an equivalent amount back to the united states in the sa fashion over time the transactions

sells cocaine in the united states for dollars and then sells the dollars to colombian black market peso brokers agent in the united states the broker then deposits the agreed on equivalent of co

through these informal systems which may explain why efforts to break the terrorist financial chain ve been decreasingly productive of late57 yet another technique for laundering money used by terrorists is tradebased fraud especially fictitious invoicing of ex ports or imports so hawaladars may balance their accounts this way in the example given above the new york broker might repay his counterpart in karach i by sending him 20000 worth of computer peripherals but only invoicing him fo r 15000 such schemes may have played role in moving funds to terrorists although this is

underpinnings of strategy the united states has pursued comprehensive strategy for combating terrorist financing in the wake of the september 11 attacks reduced to its essentials the strategy comprises two interrelated objectives the first is to locate isolate and freeze terrorist assets both in the united st ates and globally as already noted the united states and the international comm unity have frozen 121 million in terrorist related accounts since the attacks sec ond is to disrupt terrorists financial infrastructuresspecifically their formal and undergr ound methods for transferring funds across borders and between cells whether through banks businesses hawalas subverted charities an d innumerable other means59 freeze orders and other enforcement activities have effectively shut down some banks financial companies trading firms and ngos invol ved in manipulating and channeling funds for qaeda critical unde rlying component of this strategy has been to enlist international coope ration in disrupting terrorists finances treasury department report notes international alliances against terrorism are crucial because the overwhelming majority of terrorists assets cash flow and evidence lies outside our borders60 partial success has been recorded on this front although problems remain as will be discussed important organizational and regulato ry initiatives have accompanied the implementation of strategy new institutional arrangements and new powers granted by the president and congress have facilitated us enforcement actions against terrorist financing these will be summarized briefly below on the organizational front the new in teragency task force operation green quest and the terrorist financing opera tions section tfosheaded respectively by the us customs service and the federal bureau of investigationhave enforcement responsibilities vis vis terrori st finance tfos investigates the financial linkages and suppor t of

finally an overarching entity has been established within th national security council the policy coordination committee on terrorist financing to provide governmentwide coordination of financ ial aspects of the c ounterterrorism effort related priority has been to strengthen the legalregulatory basis for combating terrorist finance an important step was the presidents executive order 13224 of september 24 2001 which expanded the u s governments power to freeze terrorismrelated assets the order included in the class of targeted groups not just terrorists themselves previous executiv orders had imposed sanctions on the taliban and on terrorists who disrupt the middle east peace process63 but also on all those who provided financial or material support or who were associated with designated terrorist groups as noted 250 persons and entities have been designated under the order many of them falling into the category of financiers of terrorism other significant measures were

sectors as hedge funds commodities brokers and commercial loan and finance companies it prohibited or restricted access to the us financial system by certain categories of foreign banks including offshore banks socalled sh ell banks and banks in unregulated jurisdictions much of the legislation seemed particularly relevant to criminal money laundering several provisions though seem ed especially designed to disrupt terrorist financ ial networks for example section 326 of the usa patriot act stipulates that the secretary of the treasury shall prescribe regulations setting forth minimum standards for verifying the identity of customers including foreign nationals opening accounts at us financial ins titutions the standards would include checking the name of the applicant against lists of known or suspected terrorists provided to the financial institution by us gove rnment agency section 328 calls on the secretary in consultation with the attorney general and the secretary of state to encourage foreign governments to require that all wire transfer instructions sent to the united states include the name of the originators conceivably such provision could help authorities track terrorist donor s such as those who financed the september 11 attacks section 330 c oncerns international cooperation in investigation of money laundering fina ncial crime and fina ncing of terrorist groups essentially it empow ers relevant us agencies to conclude agreements with foreign financial supe rvisors on two points to ensure that foreign banks maintain records of terrorists accounts and transactions and to establish mechanism whereby those records can be ma available to us officials other sections of the act 359 nd 373 extend the financial re gulatory net to encompass all persons engaged in transmission of funds including informal money transfer systems under these provisions hawaladars or the equivalent would be required to register obtain licenses and file suspic ious activity reports sars finally provision of the act criminalizes bulk cash smuggling into or out of the united states such smuggling defined as an undeclared movement of more than 10000 in monetary instruments across us borde rs is described as one of the most reliable warning signs of drug traffickin g terrorism money laundering and similar crimes64 the united states also

will be burned if they contribute says one administration expert on money laundering nevertheless some experts believe that the funds seiz ed internationally since september 11 2001 represents only sma ll fraction of the funds and resources believed to be still available to qaeda and the taliban66 some reports suggest that qaeda may have converted significant portion of its assets into commodities such as gold and diamonds some months prior to the attacks also some observers point out that the financial needs of qaeda ve been reduced with the collapse of the taliban government and the destruction of most of their training camps in afghanistan leaving funds available for other activities according to the monitoring report these may include steppedup indoctrina tion and

the future direction and odds of ccess of the campaign against terrorist finance also are uncertain from pur ely financial standpoint the campaign is yielding diminishing returns with the bulk of the freezing actions having occurred in the threemonth period between september 11 2001 and midjanuary 2002 operation green quest reportedly seized 19 million to october 2002 in smuggled cash and other monetary instruments of which 11 million is middle eastern related yet green quest has not determined or is not pr epared to acknowledge that any of these funds are linked to terrorist groups68 certain limiting factors in the campaign already appear evident one relates to the regulatory burden imposed on us financial institutions the sheer volume of paperwork required of us financial institutions to comply with antimoney laundering provisions of the bank secrecy act pl 91508 as amended and the usa patriot act pl 10756 is enorm ous in fy 2001 some 12600000 currency transaction reports ctrs required for transactions above 10000 and 182000 suspicious activity reports sars were filed with the treasury department69 separating out financial activity of serious criminals including terrorists from the more than 12 million standard reports f iled annually is task of herculean proportions terrorists can enter the unite d states set up bank accounts draw on them and

of 69985 wired into his account in september 2000 from the uae ye t this report was just one of the 153500 sars filed that year and was not dis tinguishable from those related to other suspected financial crimes70 in addition most terrorists financia l transactions unlike those of major criminals tend to be smallfalling be low the 10000 threshold that requires notification of the us authorities fina lly the ability of financial institutions to fully implement enhanced security and due diligence procedures itself may be questionable such procedures are costly and timeconsuming and some institutions may lack the required resources for such r easons increased financial regulations and paperwork might not represent an effective way to stop terrorist finances and the acts that result from themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31658crs19 71 second report of monitoring group p 13 72 author interviews green qu est washington dc october 10 2002 tfos washington dc october 22 2002 73

possible to disrupt such system by subverting few links in the continuedal qaedas adaptiveness in the face of increased law enforcement pressure also is cause for concern as noted qaeda transferred portion of its exposed assets into untraceable precious commodities g old diamonds and precious stones even before the september 11 attacks possibl as early as 1998 when the united states and some european governments initiated certain freezing actions against the taliban such commodities are small and easy to store and transport moreover they retain their value over time and can be introduced in sm all quantities in the market without attrac ting attention71 one area of us nationa l money laundering strategy is to investigate the links between preci ous stones and commodity trading and the funding of terrorist groups however this is an extremely complex task offering uncertain payoffs at this stage72 also significant is evidence that nont raditional money movement systems such as hawala play an increasing role in the terror financial chain as the us monitoring report notes qaeda members will likely use the hawala system to circumvent the regular banking system and possible detec tion via suspicious transaction reports73 the usa patriot act as noted requires hawalatype businesses to register and to file sars but whether those engaged in illegal money transactions will do so is matter of speculation thats like saying the corner bookie must register with the fbi says one former us federal prosecutor74 as of mid2002 according to one report only about 10000 of an estimated 250000 money service businesses in the united states had registered under the new regulations75 also the us enforcement record against underground banking system s has been extremely modest for instance an intensive uscolombian investigation of the black market peso exchange which reportedly represents up to 5 billion dollars annually to colombia resulted in seizure of only 8 million in cash as well as some quantities of drugs and firearms76 the new legal tools under the patriot act will increase risks for illegal money remitters but some observers contend that the most likely result could be an increase in the commission they charge their customers putting them out of business or even disrupting them significantly w ould require refined targeting of ethnic communities where they operate and exte nsive undercover investigations and the results some argue might not justify the societal costs or forestall terrorist attacks77httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31658crs20 77 continued chain for example if just few merchants in the network were paid by outsiders to renege on hawala obligations it might spread highly corrosive distrust we know however that disrupting hawala would add ne w

12 2002 p a1also problematic from law enforcement perspective is qaedas relatively fragmented structure comprising numer ous supporting cells spread over many different countries qaeda may have further decentralized its operations as defensive measure since the september 11 attacks the possibility exists that the network could survive in some fashion even if central sources of funding are reduced or cut off us counterterrorism expert steve emerson stated in recent congressional testimony referring to fishing company managed by an qaeda cell in kenya in 1998 this independent business structure is particularly troubling development because it heralds the likelihood of terrori st cells operating i ndependently from any foreign financial benefactor raising the lions share of their assets from otherwise legitimate nondescript commercial entities78 the related implication is that law enforcement agencies must spread their re sources across vast number of low value targets in the hope of discovering terro rist connection this may well be happening in the united states an august 2001 washington post article reported that us authorities are investigating more than 500 mostly muslim and ar ab small businesses to determine whether they are dispatching money raised through commercial activity to terrorist groups overseas such activ ity included potpourri of petty crimes skimming the profits of drug sales stealing and reselling baby formula illegally redeeming huge quantities of grocery coupons collecting fraudulent welfare payments swiping credit card numbers and hawking unlicenced tshirts79 finally some observers question whethe r the international campaign against terrorist finance has significantly weakened qaedas main fundraising structure reportedly centered in saudi arabia and ot her persian gulf stat many details of us cooperation with gulf states in th campaign are not in the public domain for domestic political reasons gulf states have been reluctant to disclose what kinds of assistance they have provided to or accepted from the united states in this sphere nevertheless there are signs that coope ration is sometimes lting and incomplete major donors in the middle east still re portedly are funneling millions of dollars annually to qaeda according to some observers large in ternational charities based in saudi arabia with histories of

cooperation in fighting terrorist finance in august 2002 bosnian authorities lifted freeze on haramains bank accounts that had been imposed following the joint ussaudi designation in march and also renewed the foundations licen to operate in bosnia some experts believe that pressure from saudi sour ces was behind these moves82 saudi newspapers reported in september that haramain was expanding its operations in both bosnia and somalia and that it had opened 530000 islamic center in sarajevo additionally there are r ecent news reports that the foundations support for terrorism may have extende d well beyond bosnia and somalia to encompass combat operations by rebel groups in chec hnya as well as activities of indonesian militants affilia ted with qaeda83 saudi intransigence and us timidity in dealing with it are widely viewed in the united states as major obstacles to progress in the war against terror despite repeated official saudi denials as one us analyst notes the us has failed to present coherent political strategy aimed at delegitimizing the ideology of islamic terrorism and undermining terrorists s ources of support and it is becoming increasingly clear that the reason for this failure is washingtons unwillingness to risk rupture with saudi arabia yet the domestic political context constrains saudis freedom of action in suppressing the funding of islamic

states regulate or close down islamic banks incarcerate prominent saudi citizens or render them to international authorities audit islamic charities and investigate the hawala systemjust few of the steps that nation would have to takeit would be putting its current system of governance at signif icant political risk successors to the current regime could easily be drawn from the very elements in their societies that the united states is seeking to suppress84 concluding observations information presented in this report suggests that while the current campaign against terrorist finance reportedly has dimin ished qaedas abi lity to recruit and sustain allegiances significant funds still ppear to be available to the organization efforts to further regulate and introduce transparency into the global financial system are welcome steps yet they will not nece ssarily reduce terrorists striking capacity because most of the proposed measures cannot with certainty sepa rate out terrorists from other types of lawbreakers the pl ethora of reporting requirements creates sort of needleinthehaystack problem for the authorities qaedas evident abilitydocumented even before the sept ember 11 attacksto exploit nonbank mechanisms of moving and storing value as well as its structure of decentralized selfsupporting cells represent additional constraints on w enforcement finally in the view of many observers the amount of cooperation against terrorist financing that can be expected from saudi arabia nd other gulf states where support of palestinian freedom fighte rs and opposition to us and isreali policies in that region has gone on for decades is problematic investigation of terrorists finances can be useful tool for identifying linkages among terrorist cells and possibly majo r donor networks analyses of records confiscated by green quest and tfos might contribute more to the antiterror fight than the actual freezing of assets which so far has been modest these collateral benefits are difficult to assess because much of the relevant information remains in the classified realm also the treas ury department announ ced in november 2002 that it was offering reward of up to 5 million for information leading to the dismantlement of any system used to finance terrorist organization85 much larger rewards 25 million have been issued also for the capture of qaeda leaders osama bin laden and his aide ayman alzawahir i but with result in general the potential of these investigative tools remains to be developed terrorists like criminals can work through labyrinths of intermediaries create false trails and exploit internet money transfers and new pa yment technologies to disguise the source and ownership of their illicit proceedshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31658crs23 86 comments by salam marayati in terrorist financing hearing of the senate judiciary committee federal news service november 20 2002 pp 1011 for comparison

project mounting cost s of the financial war on terrorism washington dc december 20 2001 p2overall although us financial ac tions against terrorism have produced significant tangible successes whether m easured in terms of immobilization of funds or of knowledge gained about terrorist stru ctures the full impact of those actions is uncertain the bush administration s 2002 national money laundering strategy promises to apply the lessons we have l earned from the federal governments effort against money laundering to attack the scour ge of terrorism yet such efforts have made limited headway against money laundering operations such as the black market peso exchange that recycles billions of dollars in illegal proceeds mainly from the drug trade terrorists multitudinous small transactions often camouflaged as legitimate business or social activities may prove even more difficult for financial investigators to track and shut down furthermore the campaign against terro rist finance has provoked controversy on various religious public policy and humanitarian grounds the new antiterror standards have been portrayed as selectively antiislamic indeed the 12 charities designated under executive order 12334 all ppear to be associated with islamic causes some observers speculate that the us image abroad has suffered as result of the freezing of charities funds on us muslim spokesperson agrees in an ideal setting american muslim charities serve national security interest by promoting positive image of america th roughout the muslim world unfortunately the view that americas muslims are harassed or persecuted minority is gaining ground overseas partly because of the blockage of the muslim charities86 related issue concerns the bush administrations definition of the terrorist enemy which as noted clearly diverges from that of european and especially middle eastern states the broad us designation of islamic militant groups for freezing purposes is said to have deepen ed the sense of ambivalence and unease in the entire arab region according to one account countries such as saudi arabia egypt jordan and syria have urged bush to focus narrowly on blocking off bin ladens financial network rather than simultaneously targeting other terrorist groups87 in this view washingtons simultaneously broad and unilateralist approach to terrorism detracts from the international coalition against qaeda diminishing the chances that arab governments will crack down on its major supporters other possible dysfunctions of the cam paign relate to the interruption of

may move money to terrorists us efforts to shut off this fl ow have caused controversy in the view of some observers closing down entire enterprises that fill social needs in poor countries in order to keep some funds out of terrorists hands carries excessively high political and diplomatic costs simple solutions may exist to this apparent conflict however various damage cont rol measures have been proposed to increase transparency of charities operations and reduce their vulnerability to freezing actions these incl ude requiring charities to list their donors to specify exactly how their funds are used to rev eal the names of their directors and to disclose financial links to other charitable organizations another proposal is to treat charities under existing legislation t he 1970 bank secrecy act and the 2001 usa patriot act as financial institutions subject to money laundering risk charities would then be required to submit suspicious activity reports establish internal audit procedures and submit to federal examiners like say banks insurance companies and hedge funds90 more regulatory oversight might afford officials the chance to indict and prosecute individuals or branches within charities that are disbursing funds to terrorists while preserving the financial s ituation of the organization as whole the united states has proposed to other countries including saudi arabia that they set up government bodies to better monitor and control charities so the idea seems to be gaining currency saudi arabia itself has announced plans to set up such government

proceed which are the prin cipal points at issue here recently the treasury department issued voluntary best practices guidelines for charities in response to requests from am erican muslim communities who reported reductions in charitable giving and apprehensions among charitable donors as consequence of treasurys blocking actions whether these guidelines will provide sufficient protection to charities though remains to be seen93 more difficult problem is reconciling the different us and middle eastern conceptions of what constitutes terrorist activity the more encompassing us definition which reflects us policy in the israelipalestinia n conflict as well as widespread domestic abhorrence of violence directed against civilians clearly is at odds with that of much of the islamic world94 the rather egregious fundraising campaigns in persian gulf states in s upport of families of pa lestinian martyrs including suicide bombers epitomizes thes conflicting perceptions possible us strategy in this situation would be to pursue the campaign against terror finance on different levels public ly asserting opposition to terrorism in any form while privately seeking agreement with saudi arabia and ot her involved states on ways to curb flows of funds to qaeda even with limited diplomatic agenda though obtaining meaningful cooperation against terro r may prove to be an uphill battle95
