social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31501child labor in america history policy and legislative issues summary the history of child labor in america is long and in some cases unsavory it dates back to the founding of the united states traditionally most children except for the privileged few had always worked either for their parents or for an outside employer through the years however child labor practices have changed so have the benefits and risks associated with employment of children in some respects altered workplace technology has served to make work easier and less hazardous at the same time some proce sses and equipment have rendered the workplace more dangerous especially for children and youth child labor first became federal legisla tive issue at least as far back as 1906 with the introduction of the beveridge propos for regulation of the types of work in which children might be engaged lthough the 1906 legislation was not adopted it led to extended study of the conditions under which children were employed or allowed to work and to series of gislative proposals some approved others defeated or overturned by the courts culminating in the fair labor standards act flsa of 1938 the latter statute amended periodically remains the primary federal law dealing with the employment of children although providing framework for re gulation of child labor and in some cases forbidding it entirely the flsa is not comprehensive nor does it deal with all employment of children in precisely the same way generally speaking work by young persons under 18 years of age in mines and factories is not allowed the types of nonfarm work that may be suita ble or especially hazardous for persons under 18 years of age has been left mainly to the discretion of the secretary of labor some types of work for example some newspaper sales nd delivery theatrical and related employment fall beyond the scope of flsa child labor requirements finally distinction has b een made between employment in nonagricultural fields and in agriculture and in the latter case be tween work for parent or guardian in an agricultural setting and commercial employment in the

authoritative statement of the child labor requirements under the fair labor standards act consult 29 cfr part 570child labor in america history policy and legislative issues efforts to regulate or to prohibit certain forms of child labor in america largely commenced late in the 19th century mostly at the state level1 during the first decade of the 20th century child labor became federal concern congressional hearings were followed by extensive study of the issue and by several unsuccessful efforts to deal with child labor through law finally with the adoption of the fair labor standards act flsa of 1938 the modern federal role in child labor regulation took shape but debate concerning the issue has continued in congress2 through the years regulation of child labor has been contentious sparking sharp differences of opinion some have urged modification of existing federal child labor restraints to afford greater opportunities for young persons to learn the value of work or to gain entry into skilled occupation but the opportunity to learn craft and industrial discipline can also provi an occasion for youth to be exploited and possibly endangered some have questioned whet her young children ought to be employed at all especi ally while attending school discussion of child labor would seem to suggest tradeoffs resting upon fundamental socioeconomic philosophy and the value one places upon time for example when is child labor healthy nd useful introduction to the worldofwork and when might it divert young persons from academic work or place them at physical or psychological risk do children however defined need time for their own purposes and if so how much time how might one distinguish between freedom to play think or ssociate informally with peer s and idleness that may be conducive to activities that ma be less wholesome than some types of work is some work suitable for young children and teenagers persons less than 18 years of age and if so how might suitable work be distinguished from work that is not suitable or that is particularly hazardous for persons of that age the history of child labor in american workplaces can be divided roughly into four periods first from the late 19th century to 1941 reformers sought to remove children from the workplace whether fact ory field or tene ment house and to encourage more extended school attendance second with world war ii the focus shifted to alleged labor s hortages for war production some urged modification of work restrictions for older children t oo young for the draft but old enough to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31501crs2 useful employees third by the late 1940s another shift took place too many older youths were believed to be out of school out of work and unable to find employment for which it was argued they were often unprepared both in terms of training and discipline thus various schooltowo rk transition progra ms were developed together with incentives for employers to hire youth workers fourth since roughly the late 1980s child labor in its va rious aspects has larg ely disappeared from the policy scene the issue is often viewed as remnant of an earlier and darker period in american history this report is intended as an introduction to the issue of child labor it briefly describes the early history of child labor regulation re views recent federal initiatives in that area and discusses concerns voiced through the 110th congress early child labor in america prior to the 20th century employment of children largely reflected socioeconomic class stratification wher children were of workingclass families it was largely assumed that they would wo rk even when they were very young some were employed in the street trades delivering newspapers and telegrams shining boots and shoes running errands in various often unwholesome sections of the city and at whatever hours the task demanded others were engaged in industrial homework in ta sks often reserved for the very young who could work usually alongside parent or another adult in tenement flat in segments of garment production or in other types of work th at could be performed sometimes on piece rate basis in ones place of residence still others worked in mines or factories most notoriously perhaps the breaker boys who separated coal from slate and rock in the coal mines the child workers in the textile mills and the helpers in the glass factories agricultural labor by children seems always to have been in category by itself usually until the early 20th century such work seems to have been on the family farm whatever its size or in an agricultu ral operation in the general vicinity of youths place of residence though he or sh might reside and work beyond the view and reach of parent such work wa s less hazardous and less arduous than that of the streets or tenement or industrial labor ind eed in some respects agricultural work may have been more dangerous regulation of child labor has been motivated by diverse concerns economic humane and more broadly social in the 19th and early 20th centuries child workers were often viewed as an alternative source of lowwage labor who vied with their parents and other adults for employment ev at the cost of their own health and education products of child labor competed with goods produced by adults exerting downward pressure on wages and living st andards aside from health and safety hazards inadequate rest it was argued left children illsuited for educational activities and in turn as dults illprepared

of labor in the 1880s and gompers only slightly exaggerated the fact s when he declared in 1906 there is not child labor law on the statute books of the united states but has been put there by the efforts of the tradeunion movement but he added it is unlikely that the campaign against child labor would have made such ra pid headway after 1900 had it not been for the pressure brought to bear on

labor regulation generally commenced at the state level early laws were experimental loosely drawn and where they exerted restraining influence subject to court challenge each type of work by children for example in the mines factories fields or street trades presented its own special challenges for reformers but industrial homework by child ren was especially difficult to restrain although often not formally employed children worked in tenement sweatshops making clothing processing food and gaging in whatever other work might profitably be conducted at home any tenement might become little factory where conditions were adverse ften effectively unregulated and hours of work were unrestrained except by exhaustion thus child labor and industrial homework from regulatoryreform perspective became intermeshed reformers tended to agree that child labor could not be c ontrolled while industrial homework continued that regulation of the latter per would never be successful total ban on the system they said was needed8 reformers however did not always agree on timing or overall strategy most seem to have concurred that ultimately reform would need to be federal faced with state regulation of child labor or industr ial homework employers could simply move to another state further those who utilized child labor could play one jurisdiction against another in terms of wagebased ec onomic development for labor standards it was race to the bottom at the same time the strength of reform organization varied from one state to another some believed that state action was more nearly feasible than securing broader national change at least at that time the early federal role in child labor regulation in 1906 senator albert beveridge ri n and representa tive herbert parsons

congress the right to limit regulate and prohibit th labor of persons under 18 years of age the child labor amendment 1924 involved far more than the mere pa ssing of legislation since the case for approval had to be made to each state legislature while the proponents of child labor reform began optimistica lly support began to erode on number of fronts for reasons not necessarily associat ed with child labor per the proposed amendment remained unratif ied in 1937 when congress turned back to direct legislation with consideration of the fair labor standards act15 early new deal enactments 19331937 from the period of the beveridge bill 1906 to the new deal era childrens advocates remained divided over the means for ending exploitive child labor the reform community initially split with respect to federal action the n it had largely coalesced behind the owen keating 1916 and pomerene 1918 bills debating long and hard over the wisdom of constitutional amendment 1924 by late 1932 leaders of the childrens bureau in the department of labor dol and the nclc with others decided to shift their focus away from ratification of the constitutional amendment which was then perceived to be in doubt and back toward action by individual states in retrospect this shift of emphasis may have been misreading of the times by 1933 notes walter trattner in his reformoriented study crusade for the children the spreading contagion of child labor had found every weakness and loophole in state labor legislation he observes sweatshops and flybynight plants were exploiting children for little or pay moving at will across state lines to take advantage of laws of nearby states the individual states were unable to halt these abuses which had farreaching effect s including the complete breakdown of wage scales thus in competitive terms some argued it was not feasible for individual states to lead in laborrelated re form even were they predisposed to do sohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31501crs7 16

wages and long hours22 after exhaustive debate the fair labor standards act flsa with its child labor provisions became law during the summer of 193823 the flsa was not complete victory fo r advocates of child labor regulation historian jeremy felt argues that the act may have served as deterrent and as an educational force but adds that in those areas where children are useful they continue to be employed24 further the act did not deal with competition from goods produced abroad by child workers under conditions the flsa proscribed in america during the early 1940s as enforcement of the flsa commenced dol found like reformers early in the century that illegal exploitation of children as laborers was extremely difficult to er adicate where industrial hom ework persisted attempts to regulate the latter were largely unproductive by the mid1940s dol had imposed an outright ban on industrial homew ork in certain garmentrelated fields thereafter abusive child labor seems to ve faded as public policy issue gradually being replaced by concern with youth unemp loyment training and schooltowork transition25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31501crs9 26 section 203l defines oppressive child bor section 212 defines the relationship of goods produced by child labor with movement in interstate commerce section 213c sets forth the specialized treatment of child work ers under the act and the

flsa standard where there is overla pping coverage the higher standard most protective of the youth worker will normally pr evail when exploring coverage in any particular case both the state and federal statutes need to be taken into account 27 see title 29 cfr part 570 for more complete explanation of child labor regulation in general in addition dol may have issued opinion letters that apply provision of the flsa to specific workplaceschild labor under the fair labor standards act the flsa as amended protects children by setting conditions under which they may be employed and in certain type s of work prohibiting their employment altogether26 although the basic structure of the act has changed little since 1938 congress has altered specific provisions of the statute nd dol has variously refined its administration through the rulemaking process the basic pattern of coverage under the flsa employers may not use oppressive child labor in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce oppressive is par tially defined in the act and partly left to the discretion of the secretary persons under 18 years of age may not be employed in mining or manuf acturing or in any occupation which the secretary of labor shall declare to be particularly hazardous for the employment of children or detrimental to their health or wellbeing otherwise 16 years of age is the usual minimum age for employment the secretary may permit employment of persons 14 to 16 years of ag in work not deemed oppressive that does not interfere with the youths schooling and that is not detrimental to hisher health and wellbeing the secretary has established hours during which children of various ages may work that is the num ber of hours they may be employed taking into account the demands of academic attendance exemptions the fair labor standards act is broad um brella statute that sets forth general policies and at the same time may specify in precise deta il either in the statute per or through implementing regulations how coverage is to be applied namely who is covered and who is exempt because of the technical nature of wagehour and child labor law it may be unwise to accept any segment of the statute or regulations in isolation and at face value most provisions of the act have either been the subject of litigation or have long administrative legislative histories what may seem obvious on the surface may in f act be inordinately complex27 the flsa rooted in the commerce cl ause of the constitution excludes from coverage children who are not involved in activities affecting interstate commerce though such persons may be protected by state statutes also excluded arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31501crs10 28 the department of labor estimates that during the late 1990s bout 7 of all farmworkers were between 14 and 17 years of age that is about 126000 children in that age group were employed on american farm s however an unknown number of youth younger than 14 years of age are also employ ed in agriculture see us department of labor report on the youth labor force pp 5253 29 as the 1977 flsa amendments were written grower could employ children age

person standing in place of parent employing his own child or child in his custody child for instance assisting parent helping around momandpop corner gr ocery or doing chores around the home would not be covered under federal child labor law nor do the child labor provisions of the act apply to children employed as actors or in related activities traditionally the street trades such as ne

administratively to allow youths of 14 and 15 years of age to work in certain sportsattending services at professional sporting events childyouth employment in agriculture is treated somewhat differently from nonagricultural employment28 for example child working for parent on family farm is not covered under the flsa th law and regulations include differences with respect to age and the types of work that children and teenagers may perform see table 1 for general summary of these requirements under the 1977 amendments to the act specialized exemption carefully circumscribed was wr itten into the statute for the employment of children of 10 and 11 years of age as hand harvest workers in agriculture29 enforcement even where child labor is banned enforcement can be difficult flsa compliance staff is relatively small and enforcement is often complaint driven child workers themselves may not be likely to complain if children are employed with parental knowledge or consent

this serious but little known nationa l problem the summary report of the conference observed that again and again in the past decade juvenile delinquency and the outbreaks of youthful street gangs have made headlin the fact that large numbers of our youth 16 to 21 years of age are out of school and unemployed significant as it may be in terms of delinquency has far greater significance in terms of what changes are taking place in our society the summary report pointed to an unemployment rate of 171 for this age group with somewhat higher rate for minority youth there have always been young people who dropped out before finishing high school or grade school but until recently except during the depression there were ample unskilled jobs for workers of limited education that the report

of review and that by midmay they had reached the desk of the administrator of the wage and hour division43 administrative changes in the wake of the 1988 election may have caused further delay in

before during and after sporting event ar ound the playing field club house or locker room to provide sportsattending serv ices at professional sporting events certain conditions were specified inte

15 years of age to work late hours on school night did it really matter what sort of work they were doi ng how did sportsattending services differ in that context from work in the f ood services industry or in real estate or law office entering data into computer might more routine business environment be preferable to that of professional sports for the education and welfare of 14 and

operation of such equipment dol had determined was esp ecially hazardous for younger workers even loading them was viewed by the department as serious risk karen keesling acting administrator of dols wage and hour di vision explained that it was not just the loading but that individuals involved in th at process would likely reach into baler or compactor to keep the materials from falling out or

in youth peddling the bill which went on to define what is included within the concept of peddling was referred to the committee on education and the workforce and in midoctober 2003 to the subcommittee on workforce protections some questions of public policy periodically through recent years concerns have been raised about the welf are of young persons the age varies who are engaged in certain types of outside sa work on occasion the focus has been upon the street trades selling newspapers candy or other items at subway stops or locally from doortodoor in such cases manager or supervisor may recruit young persons move them to various local sites and at days end collect them and bring them back to their homes but there is also another arrangement the traveling sales crews in which sales team goes on the road and remains away from its home base possibly for extended periods some argue that each of these types of sales peddling can encompa ss risks especially for young persons such sales work by young persons suggests numerous questions of public policy for example how young is too young for children to be engaged in street sales potentially in rough neighborhoods with which they may not be familiar and if they do engage in such work through what hours should they be employed how early in the morning and how late at night the situation becomes more complicat ed when groups of recruits are transported from their homes to distant city to engage in sales work are the vehicles in which they are transported safe and insured how and where are these workers housed does the manager or s upervisor have aut hority and responsibility with respect to the offhours behavior of these young workers what happens if one of these young persons becomes ill and needs medical attention beyond the personal there are strictly workplace questions what is the employment relationship between these work ers and the manager or supervisor are the youth workers employees independent c ontractors or something else entirely to the extent that they are employees by whom are they employed the manager or supervisor may also be an employee of some more distant entity where does responsibility ultimately reside how ar wages and benefits handled what employment records are maintained and by whom from policy perspective some may as k should young persons be excluded by law

school at age 14 or 15 amish boys typically receive training in farming or carpentry from their fathers69 in recent years the opportunity for the amish to farm has diminished in part because of increased land values and property taxes therefore the amish have sought other activities for their children what are we supposed to do with them if they dont work here lamented one member of the amish community have them stay on the street all day70 the amish have sought to have their sons work in sawmills and woodworking plants where there is amish supervision r where they are supervised by

setting aside issues of legality other questions could be raised given that amish children are per mitted to leave school after the 8th grade73 first would elimination of federal restrictions upon child labor to the extent proposed in the legislation provide an opportunity and perhaps an incentive for amish children to leave school and to enter th world of work or would it merely recognize that amish childre n are already out of school and thus permit them to be productively occupied second assuming that these children do leave school to work are sawmills and wood processing establishments appropriate places of employment for any youngster s under the age of 18 might other areas of skills training be more suitable for children than mill work with its attendant hazards what types of work are suitable for 14 yearold amish children and who should decide74 in order to strengthen the ties of amish children to the amish community youngsters are systematically parated from the nonamish world75 the work experience of amish children with the skills they acquire on the family farm may not be readily transferable to the nonamish marketplace thus with only an eighth grade education and lacking experience in the nonamish world their subsequent choices may be accordingly restricted rendering their outmigration from the community within which they were raised extremely difficult76 some
