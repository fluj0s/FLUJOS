the us role in the multilateral affairs of asia the centrality of the united states is now being challenged by renewed regionalism in asia and by chinas rising influence while the united states traditionally has played central role in setting the agenda and shaping the goals for multilatera l cooperation in the region including the asia pacific economic cooperation apec group there is the potential that the east asia summit eas to which the united states was not invited could lead to new regional forum led by china that would ex clude the united states and increasingly displace apec and other mo re inclusive fora as the leading multilateral grouping of asia although there are number of obstacl to the realization of an east asian bloc that would limit american influence in the region some observers are of the opinion that the united states should take fu rther steps to reinforce its own regional role and revitalize ties with allies friendly countries and others to deter that possibility while china sought leading role in the eas asean appears to have retained central role in the eas process chinas tensions with japan also appear to be key limiting factor to asian unity under the eas the east asia summit background and context kishore mahbubani formerly senior fficial in singapores ministry of foreign affairs and trade stated that history will view the eas as the real beginning of the pacific century3 the eas is viewed as important not only because of its implications for regional trade but more importantly for its potential importance as an indicator of chinas rising geopolitical importance it is also of importance because the positions of regional states re lative to china and the united states were brought into perspective as the dipl omacy surrounding the summit unfolded the eas is viewed as potentially of strategic importance because many believe that it could form the basis of future east asian community which might make collective agreements on trade or even security affa irs without us input as such regional states have sought to be included in the summit so that they will not be excluded from any future east asian community the united states has not played role in the eas process nor was it invited to attend what is of concern to some analysts is that this appears to be potential challenge to american involvement in the region some fear that by shifting emphasis from apec an organization in which the united states has played leading role and which encompasses the broa der pacific rim to an annual east asia summit in

the united states as well as india india is chinas traditional rival in asia and is in the process of developing closer ties with the united states this issue came to light as china reportedly favored

influence may have contributed to enthusiasm among others to include india australia and new zealand in the group some view recent developments in americas bilateral relationship with india as in part

number of evolving geopolitical dynamics in the region it has been observed that key outcomes of the summit are that asean successfully projected its political centrality in wider region fast becoming function of the economic weig ht of china and india and those within asean plus three who advocated more inclusive membership were able to bring india australia and new zealand into the group33 it has been reported that japan singapore and indonesia worked to broaden membership to include india australia and new zealand34 such additions are thought to partially offset the influence of china within the group it was also observed that while the united states did not participate its influence remains directly and via regional allies while media reports did focus on the eas as new asia n bloc they also pointed to conflicts within the region particularly the sino japanese conflict that may limit future regional cooperation35 some analysts have observed th at rather than bringing asia together under chinese leadership the ea s may have more cl early defined asian rivalry and regional ge ostrategic divisions36 russia which had observer status at the eas also is reportedly seeking to become full member at the next eas meeting37 the group plans to hold its second summit in the philippines in 200638 implications for us policy some have asked why the united states should be concerned with an eas that has yet to demonstrate that it will be threat to american influence in asia others argue that it will lead to reduction in influence that would limit americas ability to promote its values or look after its inte rests whether they be economic or strategic to some americas preoccupation with iraq has been distraction that has led it to underestimate the importance of evolving

perceived to have lost momentum there is an incr easing perception that apec which has 21 members and was established in 1989 is di sintegrating into regional and bilateral blocs and that it does not have the leadership necessary to meet future challenges some feel that return to apec core issues of trade liberalization and the reduction of trade barriers is the best way for apec to regain its momentum40 australia which played key role in the development of apec will be the 2007 chair of apec question is whether the united states shoul d take additional measures to strengthen apec some suggest this would also keep taiwan from becoming increasingly isolated to some the key question concerning the eas is whether chinas leadership will be benign or will it be aimed or be perceived by the us as being aimed at limiting or replacing washingtons nd tokyos influence in the region41 chinas actions through the shanghai cooperation organization sco which includes china russia kazakhstan tajikis tan and uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan are viewed by some as challenging americas regional presence42 the sco asked in july 2005 for timetable for the withdrawal of us coalition forces in central

elsewhere in asia developing constructive re lationship with china is generally viewed as the most significant foreign policy challenge for the united states in asia and possibly the world in the years ahead how the unite d states reacts to chinas bid to position itself more centrally in asia as demonstrat ed by the eas is an important component of this challenge policy approach that seeks to continue to foster the peaceful rise of china appeals to many44 some feel that it is important that american policy on the east asia summit or potential future east asian community not be interpreted by china as an effort to contain china but rather as policy initiative to demonstrate that america seeks to remain an active and constructive actor in asian multilateral affairs and that it supports the constructive integration of china into regional and world affairs
