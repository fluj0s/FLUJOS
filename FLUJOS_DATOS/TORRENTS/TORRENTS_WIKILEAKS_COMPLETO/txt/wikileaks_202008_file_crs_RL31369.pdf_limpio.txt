intelligence issues for congress summary intelligence derived from satellites has become an essential element of military operations and foreign policymaking in particular precise imagery from spacebased collection systems makes possible the effective use of precisionguided munitions that is becoming the basis of us defense planning imagery intelligence also provides the factual bases for addressing many foreign policy issues imagery is collected by satellites acquired and operated by the national reconnaissance office nro an organization with record of enormous technological achievements since its creation in 1961 imagery collected by the nro is processed analyzed exploited and disseminated by another organization the national imagery and mapping agency nima nima was established in 1996 incorporating the defense mapping agency and various intelligence offices congress has been concerned with satellite imagery because of its critical importance and its high costs independent commissions established by congress to assess the state of the imagery intelligence effort have concluded that significant changes need to be made in the way the nations imagery effort is conducted there is consensus that greater emphasis should be placed on better collection targeting and improving processing exploitation and dissemination the processes collectively termed tped that greater attention should be given to acquiring commercial imagery and that the management of the imagery effort may need to be changed even before the events of september 11 2001 there appeared to be fairly widespread view within congressional committees that at least some additional funding should be directed towards imagery collection and tped subsequent military campaigns have underscored the use of imagery in military operations and other counterterrorist efforts tped encompasses the establishment of multiint database ie an electronic file containing information from all intelligence sources that will require the balancing of different needs of intelligence agencies and government consumers congress has encouraged nimas role in establishing this database but obstacles include costs inherent technical difficulties and the administrative and security complications of placing one agency in charge of maintaining and editing data for multitude of users some observers advocate more fundamental changes these include significantly greater reliance on commercial imagery and reduction in coverage by government satellites in this approach the nro and nima would concentrate on developing cutting edge technologies and on meeting special requirements beyond the capabilities of the private sector some would reconsider the next generation of imagery collecting satellites satellite imagery is among the most important technological achievements of the intelligence community maintaining capability to support military operations that avoid inflicting vast civilian damages

brilliant success and harbinger of military operations in the twentyfirst century among other things it demonstrated the increasing importance of precise imagery intelligence that permitted nato to attack and destroy crucial serbian targets with minimal friendly losses or collateral damage over 9300 strike sorties were flown with nato losing aircrews and only two aircraft without the need for costly ground campaign serbian forces pulled out of kosovo and albanian refugees were able to return to their homes in the midst of this successful air campaign however occurred significant blunder that was to have major repercussions on the other side of the globe and demonstrated significant weaknesses in the imagery analysis and dissemin ation process on may 7 1999 us b2 bomber fired 2000 lb guided bomb and precisely destroyed building believed to be the headquarters of the yugoslav federal directorate for supply and procurement fdsp legitimate military target the building was first designated by intelligence officers at the central intelligence agency cia unfortunately the building was not the fdsp headquarters but the embassy of china as result of the attack three chinese officials were killed and the united states had to apologize formally and pay restitution despite the apology and restitution the mistaken bombing was deeply resented in beijing and may have contributed to general deterioration of sinoamerican relations the misidentification of this belgrade office building reflects both the crucial importance that intelligence has come to have in military operations and the serious consequences of what director of central intelligence dci george tenet acknowledged as an intelligence failure as tenet later testified when cities were struck in past wars none doubted that civilians embassies hospitals and schools would be in harms way today our ability to strike precisely has created the impression that sensitive sites can be safe in the middle of war zone our desire to protect innocents in the line of fire has added an enormous burden on all of us that we accept the incident demonstrated the crucial importance of integrating satellite imagery of major installations with other forms of intelligence that would identify what was going on inside them tenet also suggested the origins of the mistakea failure to maintain

11 2001 campaign against the afghan taliban and qaeda terrorists imagery intelligence has continued to be of great value aircraft based in the us are able to attack ground and underground targets with precision weapons using imagery obtained by reconnaissance satellites imagery intelligence is also an important component of the global war against terrorism in which it is tied to information from other intelligence sources and from unclassified open sources to locate terrorist facilities and activities the additional funding becoming available for intelligence in the wake of september 11 is expected to alleviate some of the problems encountered in the kosovo campaign but the overarching challenges of aligning the agencies involved and maximizing the usability of their products by both policymakers and the operating forces remain to be resolved the intelligence community has emphasized the development and operation of satellites of great technical complexity but exploitation and dissemination of the data collected have fared less well furthermore the changing nature of warfare has required that information be transmitted to theater commanders immediately in real time not just forwarded to washington agencies these two requirementsthe need for better analysis and the requirement to move the data rapidly to field commandersunderlie the challenges facing two agencies charged respectively with collecting and producing imagery intelligence from satellites the national reconnaissance office nro and the national imagery and mapping agency nima2 background on the two agencies is provided in the appendices imagery from satellites is used in conjunction with imagery from airborne systemsmanned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs these much less expensive systems have been used extensively in recent combat operations but can be vulnerable to enemy attack and lack the technical capabilities possessed by satellites in many cases aircraft and uavs do not collect imagery for use by national intelligence agencies to build permanent databases3 it is possible that reviews of intelligence organization underway since early in the current bush administration may result in recommendations to make major changes in the organization of the imagery effort by placing the nro and nima directly under the dci earlier one influential study group proposed the abolition

while observers believe that such proposals would be likely to face substantial resistance the technical administrative and budgetary challenges that have been identified by the nro and nima commissions will be central considerations for the future of the imagery effort under any circumstances the nature of these challenges involves billions of dollars which are required for satellite imagery collection and processing costs of intelligence programs are not made public being authorized in the classified annexes to defense and intelligence authorization bills but it widely understood that satellite programs cost several billion dollars annually and absorb large proportion of the budget of the national foreign intelligence program concerned with the future of imagery programs in 1999 congress created two commissions to assess spacebased intelligence issues one addressing the nro and the other nima5 both have issued reports with number of recommendations that are currently under consideration in the executive branch and congress congress also mandated the establishment of commission to assess national security space management and organization6 the latter commissions concerns extended far beyond intelligence collection platforms but it addressed organizational issues involving both the defense department and the intelligence community the establishment of these commissions reflected congressional concerns in particular about several aspects of the nations imagery intelligence effort httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31369crs4 7see repo rt of the commission to assess united states national security space management and organization january 11 2001 pp 1922 hereafter cited as space commission report even greater concern expressed by some observers is the possibility that foreign entity could find way to blind disrupt or falsify comprehensive intelligence database that had become an integral part of us military operations ibidperceived imbalances between funds allocated to launching and operating satellites on one hand and that spent on tasking processing exploitation and dissemination on the other the decision to choose new generation of satellites that was designed to meet established criteria rather than extend the envelope of technical capabilities the possibility of making greater use of commercial imagery ongoing but disjointed efforts by nima to create and maintain worldwide geospatial grid dealing with imagery issues is undertaken against an unstable geopolitical environment in which access to highquality intelligence and communications equipment is becoming available to many other countries and even terrorist organizations some observers fear that hostile countries could leapfrog the technological capabilities that the united states has acquired after many years and end up with virtually comparable intelligence at fraction of the investment made by this country7 given the growing importance of spacebased intelligence and the sums of money involved some analysts believe that evaluati ng and possibly redefining the responsibilities of the nro and nima will be among the most important challenges facing the intelligence community and congressional armed services and intelligence committees in the next decade imagery intelligence lies at the heart of efforts to transform the postcold war defense establishment but it is costly balancing the opportunities with the costs is crucial responsibility of both congress and the executive branch background the need for spacebased intelligence became evident in the earliest years of the cold war long before the united states developed the capacity to launch and operate satellites in the late 1940s and the 1950s ignorance of the military capabilities of the soviet union was source of profound concern given the pervasive fear of soviet aggression overflights near and over soviet territory were undertaken to collect aerial photography but there were great risks involved as demonstrated when u2 aircraft operated by the central intelligence agency cia was shot down over soviet territory in may 1960 and the pilot francis gary powers put on public trial in moscow the u2 shootdown provided strong impetus for satellite program already planned that could provide intelligence from space without risking eitherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31369crs5 8the legality of spacebased reconnaissance is recognized in international legal instruments including the 1967 treaty on principles governing the activities of states in the exploration and use of outer space including the moon

the satellite reconnaissance program grew in importance throughout the remainder of the cold war providing the necessary intelligence foundation for us defense programs national security policies and especially for arms control negotiations additional satellites provided different forms of intelligencefrom electronic and communications transmissions radar and telemetry by the end of the cold war satellite programs provided an major portion of the intelligence needed to formulate national security policy and consumed sizable percentage of the intelligence budget9 throughout the cold war satellite reconnaissance data was primarily used by nationallevel policymakers and planners focused on the threat of strategic nuclear conflicts involving the west and major communist countries many of the collection targets were fixed installationsmissile bases shipyards defense industry factories etc the data acquired was the basis for targeting aircraft and missiles and for arms control discussions but it was not for the most part integrated directly into ongoing military operations the persian gulf war in 1990 against iraq however saw extensive use of satellitederived data in contemporaneous combat operationsa practice that was to have profound influence on military planning for the postcold war environment the much greater tactical use of satellite reconnaissance resulted in part from the fact that the flat desert terrain was ideally suited to overhead imaging as compared for instance to the triplecanopy jungles of southeast asia in part it was made possible by the end of the soviet threat that allowed the diversion of satellite coverage to nonwarsaw pact targets the potential value of satellite imagery was quickly grasped by military commanders but there were many complaints that the ability to disseminate the product was woefully inadequatein some cases imagery had to be handcarried to various desert storm commands the use of satellite data in desert storm was key part of major technological breakthrough in large measure unanticipated yet what in the end largely predetermined the allied victory had never been tested before least of all in the synergistic combination that roved so overwhelm ing against iraq the power of few stealthy f117s to operate with impunity and to substitute for mass by way of precision the confident knowledge of the battlefield

smoothed out dissemination problem to ensure that satellitederived intelligence could be transmitted without delay to consumers this required new communications links equipment changes and the development of new analytical and dissemination procedures including the lifting of restrictions on disseminating information that had previously been strictly accessible only to users with certain special clearances much had been accomplished by the time of the natoled attack on serbian forces in the spring of 1999 operation allied force as result in part of faster dissemination of satellite data the kosovo air campaign achieved most of its objectives it did so with almost loss of allied life and minimal loss of civilian lives on the grounddespite the lamentable attack on the chinese embassy in belgrade11 in the postcold war environment requirements for satellite data are closely tied to the growing use of precisionguided munitions pgms that allow very specific targets to be destroyed while minimizing loss of civilian life and damage to civilian facilities targeting pgms depends on very precise locating data that are acquired from satellite data supplemented by airborne reconnaissance current defense planning documents such as joint vision 2020 describe precision engagement as including more than the employment of pgms encompassing vision of information superiority

intelligence college occasional paper number 9 april 2001nima it can budget for innovative but expensive research it can realign agency roles and responsibilities at the same time congress cannot direct presidents to devote more of their personal time to satellite issues nor can congress mandate effective cooperation among agency heads within the executive branch commissions and many observers have argued against the need for new legislative initiatives many believe the number of congressional committees involved and the separate legislative vehicles by which funds are authorized and appropriated for space collection analysis and dissemination complicate efforts to address space based intelligence issues observers note in particular the potential for different priorities among armed services and intelligence committees as well as the budgetary pressures on spacerelated programs that have existed in recent years another view however is that the evolutio n of spacebased intelligence may have to be guided by new statutory authorities existing or potential overlap among the current authorities of dod and the intelligence communit as well as funding changes and tradeoffs that may be required among highcost programs may according to this view lead to necessarily larger congressional role given the central role of spacebased intelligence in future military planning and in intelligence effort most observers expect continued high level of congressional interest tasking processing exploitation and dissemination tped tped is the collective term used to

48only technological improvements but the continued evolution of organizations and doctrine and the development of relevant training to sustain comparative advantage in the information environment14 further discussion of the geospatial grid may be found in appendix b but put simply the goal is to provide database built around geographic display essentially map displayed on computer screen the user clicks computer mouse on specific point on the display to obtain information about geographic features such as rivers or hills the location of manmade structures such as buildings bridges or weapon emplacements information about activities likely occurring within buildings the presence or absence of personnel etc this information is intended to permit the recipients to take appropriate action with confidence that targets can be hit refugees rescued etc much of the discussion of the geospatial grid is focused on the needs of military commanders but this type of information could be of great utility to government officials outside dod for instance during the kosovo conflict nima made daily presentation to the state department that provided geospatial reference including shaded terrain relief overlaid with towns and roads over this was layered census data showing the distribution percentage of ethnic albanians over which was satellite and aircraft imagery of burning houses added to which was imagery or graphics of the movements of serbian paramilitary forces and the resulting flow of displaced albanians15 nimas role as the functional manager of the whole enterprise is matter of significant concern managing the grid includes making many technical decisions regarding information reliability communications systems message formats access controls etc all of which will be difficult to establish on governmentwide basis since in practice there may be different needs by different consumerssome with great cloutfor specific types of data within different time constraints observers express concern that nima as new agency will find it difficult to make final judgments resolving differences beyond bureaucratic concerns observers consider that nima has far to go in being able to exploit the vast quantities of data collected nevertheless most observers have reached the conclusion that nima should retain control of the geospatial grid the nima commission concluded to whom should we entrust the responsibility to fuse imagery and sigint against all odds the commission feels the answer may well be nima according to the commission the geospatial construct is the obvious foundation upon which fusion should take place16 however the commission expressed concern not just about nimas ability to manage the tped process but also about the agencys ability to manage

about nimas lack of plans to integrate imagery from airborne collectorsaircraft such as the u2 and uavsinto tped based on the fia according to the commission current plans do not address either the integration of airborne imagery or multiint integration similarly the defense science board task force concluded that nima as the government agency responsible as the functional manager for imagery and geospatial intelligence will be at the center of the information revolution as it affects individuals and organizations that contribute to national security18 according to the task force nima should have the clout to bring other communities to accept the architecture and the standards necessary to build an integrated tped system19 more specifically the task force argued that nima should act as the single functional manager for imagery and geospatial information define future tped architecture products and services task and make tradeoffs between commercial and government collectors and review budgets of agencies responsible for imagery and geospatial efforts20 the senate intelligence committee has expressed concern that nima does not exercise comprehensive functional management authority over us imagery and geospatial programs the committee noted in particular the nimas absence of authority to set standards and review investment and rdte programs of tactical efforts of the military services21 the conference report accompanying the fy2001 defense authorization act also took note of the need for an integrated multiint tped architecture nima was directed to undertake review regarding means to achieve the development of such an architecture with the direct and personal involvement by the deputy secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence the

agencys primary focus right now according to zitz we dont feel that we are ready to take on the challenge of doing imagery and signals intelligence both in one architecture23 nima officials undoubtedly recognize that such fusion would not only be technically challenging but it could involve conflicts with other older and larger agencies that could complicate nimas overall missions peter marino the chairman of the nima commission in april 3 2001 testimony indicated continuing concern that nima lacks adequate resources for such task and i think what youre creating is recipe for disaster for the day when fia starts dropping down volumes of data that is considerably greater than the volumes of data that were seeing today and expects an organization like nima to start processing and exploiting that data that doesnt close at all right now with the budget that nima has to do tped24 beyond questions of resources some observers express concern that the heavy responsibility of managing multiint geospatial grid would be assigned to relatively new organization that is dod combat support agency according to this view developing and acquiring the necessary systems that manage the flow of imagery will be daunting task that nima will probably be able to accomplish only with additional funding and by drawing upon outside assistance they suggest that establishment of collection requirementsdetermining which targets should get the highest prioritiesmore appropriately should become the responsibility of the dci who has in any event been assigned the responsibility by statute25 nor do they believe would nima be logical candidate to address the tasking of the sigint collection efforts of the national security agency nsa for which longstanding interagency procedures exist organizing process by which analysts in various agencies can annotate data on an imagery base would be logical nima responsibility but attempting to become final authority for validating such annotation would at least in some cases appear to be an overstretch that could cause prolonged interagency disagreements in addition to nimas apparent ambivalence it should be noted that the nro commission recommended that imagery and signals intelligence requirements committees should be returned to the dci instead of being left with nima and

pp 45in order to ensure the balance and priority of requirements between military and national consumers is maintained26 it is possible that the dcis staff has been reluctant to become overly involved in the operational activities of dod combat support agency but many observers believe that to the extent that nima becomes responsible for managing the geospatial grid for wide variety of government consumers inside and outside dod there will have to be significant role for the dci if for other purpose than ensuring that nima decisions are acceptable to the entire intelligence community it cannot not of course be proven that different organizational arrangements for identifying geospatial data would have prevented the mistaken bombing of chinas embassy in belgrade but almost all observers agree that there needs to be better arrangements for bringing all forms of dataincluding human reportingt bear on target selection and other functions establishing systematic collection and review procedures and fixing responsibilities would arguably serve to minimize blunders in the future funding tped the question of nimas ability to manage the geospatial grid is closely related to the adequacy of funding for tped reacting to the longstanding tendency to favor collection systems over analysis congress has expressed concern that planned investment in fia has not been matched with willingness to make the necessary investment in tped creating potential for excessive collection of data that cannot be effectively used in 1998 congress authorized fia but inserted provisions in the fy1999 intelligence authorization act requiring that fia funds be embargoed pending the identification of tped requirements27 in 1999 the senate intelligence committee noted that the fia program focuses on collection and pays relatively less attention to the tasking processing exploitation and dissemination functions necessary to coherent and comprehensive endtoend architecture as result the committee urged maintainin g cap on the fia budget until all requirements including tped were identified28 in floor debate prior to passage of the fy2000 intelligence authorization act pl 106120 representative jerry lewis who also served as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on defense noted that while the fia will be the most expensive program in the history of the intelligence

utilization of the data collected furthermore there may be sound reasons to maintain an extensive imagery database that can be exploited in the event of unanticipated military operations39 commercial imagery second major issue is commercial imagery which some believe can reduce the need for massive investment in government satellite reconnaissance systems commercial imagery is increasingly available to customers government and private throughout the world40 it is expected that the quality of resolution available the extent of coverage and timeliness of delivery of the finished product will be enhanced by more commercial satellites that are anticipated to be orbited in the coming decade at some point observers predict continuous global coverage will become available on the open market although there are obvious security concerns about highquality imagery becoming available to other governments and terrorist groups the large inventory of commercial images that can be purchased will be of significant potential interest to intelligence agencies nima is currently purchasing commercial imagery annually but many observers argue that much larger amounts of commercial imagery could be purchased although cost data on government imagery is not public given amount of imagery purchased from commercial firms could in some circumstances cost considerably less than comparable government imagery thus heavier reliance on acquiring commercial imagery could represent important cost savings given the potential cost of fia the space commission argued that with the currently available halfmeter imagery approximately half of nimas requirements for information on the locations of objects on the earth could be met41 in particular commercial imagery

also took note of the increasing availability of commercial satellite imagery and the absence of systematic plan to take advantage of its availabili ty at less cost than acquiring the imagery with new nro systems the commission argued that there is need for an outside assessment independent of the nro of the utility of commercial technologies to supplement traditional nro missions defense science board task force on nima concluded that commercial and international systems could meet many government needs in terms of image quality if not quantity and noted that measured in availability and in resolution commercial capacity will increase by factor of 5 to 10 times over just the next five years43 the nima commission argues that the design of the fia fails to take into consideration the potential integration of commercial imagery and imagery from aircraft into the larger imagerygeospatial information system and is accordingly suboptimal44 it is uncertain whether the increasing availability of commercial imagery will have any effect on the multiyear process of fia acquisition that has been underway since the passage of the fy1998 intelligence authorization act pl 10510745 even with fia satellites coming on line however observers believe that commercial imagery will usefully supplement data acquired by government satellites many observers believe however that nima is purchasing far less of the available commercial imagery than could be productively used the dsb task force argued that the budget for commercial imagery in early 2000 about 400 million for the next several years was at too low level46 the nima commission was especially critical of budgeting for commercial imagery the congress showed keen insight in designating nima the dod and intelligence community sole focal point for commercial imagery not to be outdone by itself however the congress one year denied nima the funds necessary for purchasing that imagery the administration topped that in successive years by failing to request sufficient funds move that the congress then trumped by authorizing and appropriating funds that were not requested most recently the nro

billion dollar buy the commission observes this hot potato approach with wry amusement if it werent serious it would be funny47 the nro commission noted that despite the provisions of pdd49 in september 1996 relating to commercial space guidelines that encourage government agencies to purchase commercial imagery to the fullest extent feasible there have been relatively insignificant purchases of commercial imagery by nima such purchases would allow government imagery collecto rs to be used for specialized collection and would also help create stable and predictable government market for commerci imagery firms as was recommended by pdd4948 the nro commission cited managerial problems that have emerged in nimas commercial imagery program there is continuity in the program and the program manager has been changed frequently49 nima the dsb task force argued should execute balanced strategic plan to exploit fully commercial capabilities most importantly nima should restrict government collection by tasking national systems to collect only on that which cannot be procured competitively from us commercial sources50 the commercial satellite industry remains in its infancy there have been several launch failures and commercial markets are not well developed one concern about increasing use of commercial imagery is the possibility that the private firms producing it might not remain in business and that if they fail restarting government satellite programs would be difficult and lengthy especially if large numbers of skilled technicians were longer employed by government agencies51 both the nima and nro commissions suggested that an account be established by dod that agencies could use only for the procurement of commercial imagery along the lines of an existing account used to determine whether to use commercial or military airlift capabilities at present government agencies including the military services receive government imagery as free good and may thus be disinclined to expend their own funds for purchasing imagery from commercial firms under the proposed approach agencies would have access to an account managed by the office of the secretary of defense whose funds could be used only for purchasing commercial imagery thus there would be administrative machinery in place to encourage use of imagery from commercial sources that does not exist at present advocates argue that key advantage of establishing such fund would be to provide predictable market for commercial firms that would serve to strengthen the us satellite reconnaissance industry according to the nro commission through an approach to imagery analogous to dods militarycivilian airlift practice government systems would be focused on targets where their

indicate that nima did not request substantial increases in funding for the purchase of commercial imagery in its fy2002 budget submission there may be conviction that higher priority should be given to modernizing its own infrastructure than to the larger purchases of commercial imagery nor was there request for budget augmentation to support such purchases53 two staff members of the house intelligence committee have expressed their perception that little support currently exists for purchasing additional amounts of commercial imagery at the expense of sacrificing government program funds54 in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 attacks nima has publicly described more extensive purchases of commercial imagery nimas director retired general clapper argued that unclassified commercial imagery can be readily shared with coalition partners whereas imagery acquired by us satellites would have to be put through lengthy declassification process in addition commercial images of large geographic areas can be used in conjunction with more specialized intelligence products especially important according to clapper are multispectralcolorimages of which commercial systems are the primary source55 government procurement of commercial imagery undoubtedly has important implications for the viability of the industry and nimas reported aversion to purchasing larger amounts will be disappointing to industry officials anticipating larger government purchases however some observers argue that the imagery companies remain in weak position as result of their own inherent problems as two congressional staffers noted after more than six years this commercial industry has few actual commercial customers56 management and personnel issues third major issue for the intelligence community is the management of the satellite intelligence effort specific management issues affecting the nro and nima are discussed in the appendixes but there are overarching concerns regarding the entire imagery intelligence effort key question is whether the emphasis should be on continuing to push the technological envelope in order to acquire even more sophisticated imagery capabilities or to design systems based on essentially existing technologies to meet current needs in the past much basic research on satellitehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31369crs18 57nro commission report p 78technology did not necessarily have immediate practical applications but it contributed enormously to the overall capabilities of the us satellite programs this research was expensive but most observers believe that the payoff easily justified the investment as satellite programs moved out of their earlier highly secret environment they became more susceptible to the pressure s and constraints of ordinary budgeting processes some argue that there is danger that the us will lose its technological edge with the potential to allow other countries to make technological leaps and to reduce the technological spinoff into the civilian space industry both the nro and nima commissions addressed the question of managing innovation in satellite reconnaissance program s as discussed in further detail in appendix the nro commission in particular noted that in earlier decades the nro operating in almost total secrecy was able to accomplish important technological triumphs in designing and fielding the worlds first and most successful satellite reconnaissance program in large measure these accomplishments have been attributed to the fact relatively small group of scientists and engineers were permitted to work in secrecy without micromanagement and excessive oversight from the defense departments layers of acquisitions offices in more recent years however the nro has had higher public visibility and has adhered more closely to routine acquisitions regulations in earlier years nro engineers reportedly were given greater latitude in designing systems to take advantage of newly available technologies and other intelligence agencies were able to take advantage of the nros innovations once they were in place more recently nro satellites have been designed to fulfill the specified requirements of other agencies and there has been tendency to downplay innovation for innovations sake some observers suggest that the shift away from attempting to take full advantage of cuttingedge technologies has begun to jeopardize the nros roles and missions electing less technically sophisticated approaches they argue will require an approach different from that currently followed specifically the nro commission recommended that with the nro separate miniorganization be established to develop and acquire cutting edge technologies the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence should establish new office of space reconnaissance under the direction of the director of the nro the office should have special acquisition authorities be staffed by experienced military and cia personnel have budget separate from other agencies and activities within the national foreign intelligence program be protected by special security compartment and operate under the personal direction of the president secretary of defense and director of central intelligence 57 as discussed in appendix b major problem for nima has been inadequate numbers of personnel with highly sophisticated skills to deal with the technical challenges involved in creating the geospatial grid the nima commission recommended the creation of an extraordinary program office

being bound by civil service pay scales and procure equipment unfettered by the usual government acquisitions regulations secretary of defense rumsfeld indicated in his may 8 2001 press conference that he had requested study of how an office of space reconnaissance might be established within the nro but details of his immediate intentions have been made public there are pros and cons to attempts to provide such exceptional authorities in government agencies there is question that seeking out the most creative personnel can be facilitated by avoiding rules and regulations that apply across the length and breadth of the federal government and were not designed for the purpose of engaging relatively small technological elite of systems engineers and systems acquisitions people at time of high demand within the civilian sector nor were the promotion regulations and merit system protections designed with the culture of computer engineering in mind arguments can be made that the nro and nima both need to be able to attract the most innovative thinkers at least for period to move both agencies into an intelligence world unlike that which has ever existed before again these moves cannot necessarily be made by strict application of the procurement regulations as they currently exist there is arguably much greater need to accept risks inherent in innovation in the area of spacebased intelligence in order not to jeopardize the possibility of revolutionary gains on the other hand there are significant and substantial risks involved in setting up specially compartmented research and development efforts with unique personnel and procurement authorities most obviously there is risk of failure there is also potential for excessive costs when usual regulations for competitive bids and standardized salaries are not in place there is danger that interest in pushing the technological envelope will result in equipment and software that while conceptually brilliant is not optimized for operational use extraordinary entities do not necessarily coordinate well with other government organizations instead of authorizing exceptional authorities for small offices some observers suggest that congress could provide more comprehensive authorities for the entire organizations based on consensus surrounding the nature of the tasks required

area in support of us forces stationed there see crs report 98672f us intelligence and indias nuclear tests lessons learned august 11 1998 by richard best jranother challeng is the different perspectives of the director of central intelligence and the defense department the dci has broad statutory authority over all national intelligence activities but dod has control over much of the resource base of both the nro and nima there is possibility that either the various agencies will go their own ways with minimal coordination or that there will constant struggles over resources and responsibilities in the case of spacebased imagery and sigint collection there have been periods of interagency conflict in the past but in more recent years some observers have noted tendency for dod concerns to dominate process that was supposed to serve national as well as defense needs there are also concerns that effective interagency coordination has not been achieved among the nro nima and nsa both the nro commission and the space commission urged greater direct personal involvement of highlevel officials especially the president the secretary of defense and the dci in coordinating the space programs including those of the nro this recommendation undoubtedly reflects the difficulties involved in coordinating the information requiremen ts of military commanders and those of nationallevel policymakers competition between military and national consumers for intelligence resources has existed for decades and can be expected to continue59 the solution would be effective coordinative mechanisms to establish priorities and involvement and acceptance of responsibility by senior officials observers note however that it may be unrealistic to expect the degree of presidential involvement in such issues that existed during cold war administrations in discussing dods initiatives on space operations secretary of defense rumsfeld indicated on may 8 2001 that he and the dci meet regularly and have established an executive committee that they both cochair to review intelligence issues of joint concern proposals to place the nro and nima along with nsa under the direct control of the dci would according to proponents enable tighter control of their activities and avoid counterproductive rivalries skeptics argue however that such shift would impede the close links that must exist between these combat support agencies and dods operating forces the space commission also recommended the establishment within the defense department of an under secretary of defense for space intelligence and information this position would serve as the principal advocate for space within dod and would incorporate the responsibilities of the current assistant secretary of defense for command control communications and intelligence c3i the commissions apparent goal would be to provide greater visibility to spacerelated issues including both policy and satellite acquisition issues within the pentagon this recomm endation was not accepted by defense secretary rumsfeld in announcing dods responses to the recommendations rather he indicated that the

have authority to reprogram in year money within components an authority that would enhance its direction of intelligence community affairs rumsfeld did not comment on this recommendation that has faced opposition not only in dod but also within congressional armed services committees the space committee also took note and made recommendations relating to congressional oversight arguing that congressional oversight of the authorization and appropriation of national security space funding routinely involves fewer than six committees generally each committee mirrors the priorities of the executive branch interests it oversees the intelligence committees focus on issues concerning sources and methods and on the ability of the intelligence community to provide intelligence to the national command authorities the armed services committees contend with competing space requirements of the three services the military intelligence agencies and the cincs and tend to see national intelligence primarily as support for combat forces the appropriations committees subcommittees on defense oversee all defense and intellige nce space programs and are one place where national security space programs are viewed together however they focus primarily on budgets executive branch officials must expend considerable time and energy interacting with large number of committees and subcommittees that on some matters have overlapping jurisdiction to the extent that this process can be streamlined it would likely benefit the nation congress and the executive branch it would also help if there were an environment in which national security space matters could be addressed as an integrated programon that includes consideration for commercial and civil capabilities that are often overlooked today60 related to managerial difficulties is the challenge of taking advantage of the dynamic changes in computer and communications technologies observers note the difficulties involved in employing persons possessing acquisitions and systems engineering technical skills it has been argued that strong competition from private industry and limits on government pay and allowances affect the ability of intelligence agencies to employ persons with the sophisticated skills required for the next generation of satellites and associated tped there are various approaches currently under consideration to make use of expertise in the private sector through contracts and consultancies but it has been indicated that the problem will require highlevel administration attention61httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31369crs22 conclusion congress is expected to consider imagery intelligence programs in the context of efforts to transform the entire defense structure the parameters of the transformation effort remain as yet unknown but almost all observers believe that the effort to obtain dominant battlefield awareness and growing reliance on precision guided munitions will characterize the transformation effort regardless of the other initiatives and defense budget levels success in any transformation effort will depend on the availability of detailed imagery within required times ensuring that imagery products incorporate accurate data from all intelligence disciplines and that budgets for the nro and nima can be adequately funded imagery intelligence has been around for several decades but its importance has been growing significantly in recent years the challenge is to design organizations to obtain analyze and disseminate the result of new technologies to support an evolving defense and national security structure while remaining within budgetary constraints the mixture of cuttingedge technologies complex organizational structures and budgetary limitations complicate decisionmaking nevertheless the accomplishments of the intelligence community in imagery intelligence represent one of its greatest successes

act62 the defense department is responsible for developing acquiring and operating satellites and processing raw data that are provided to other intelligence agencies for analysis and dissemination to government consumers the nro was established in 1961 but its existence has been acknowledged publicly only since 1992 it was created within dod but has always had reporting responsibility to the director of central intelligence dci the contours of doddci responsibilities for nro operations have varied over time but currently both the dci and dod retain important roles the nro remains part of dod but the concurrence of the dci is required in the appointment of the head of the nro63 the dci develops and approves the annual national foreign intelligence program nfip budget that includes funding for the nro although the dci also has statutory authority to approve reprogramming of nfip funds he does not have authority to be involved in the execution of the nro budget after funds are appropriated the nro developed highly innovative technology and displayed willingness to take risks and endure multiple failures before successful launches were accomplished initially satellite photography was parachuted back to earth in canisters that had to be netted in midair processing and analysis could take days or weeks in the 1970s in major technological breakthrough the nro developed electrooptical capabilities that allowed realtime electronic transmission of imagery to ground stations from whence it could be relayed to authorized consumers in more recent years capabilities have been created to permit satellite data to be transmitted directly to shootersships attack aircraft and other military units the significant progress that the nro achieved resulted from number of factors the effort was conducted in tight secrecy by relatively small group of highly qualified scientists and engineers it had strong backing from the white house and adequate funding by congress with limited oversight the emphasis was on innovative technological approaches rather than meeting carefully specified and coordinated requirements funds were available for cuttingedge technologies without immediate practical applications overriding all else was pervasive and unquestioned determination to identify threats especially from the soviet union that could destroy the united states or its allies in the mid1990s the nro began work on the future imagery architecture which will be based on larger number of smaller satellites that can provide more frequent coverage than is currently possible unlike their larger predecessors however these satellites are not designed to push the envelope of satellite technologies but rather to meet stated needs of potential

concerns that its cost could draw funds from other intelligence programs and that the costs of analyzing and disseminating the acquired data had not been included in dods budget submissions66 the nro is not an analytical organization but it has to undertake certain amount of data processing prior to delivering its products to other agencies according to the nro commission it has also rendered extremely valuable non spacerelated services over the years by providing terrestrial communications systems visualization tools imagery exploitation systems and technical problemsolving skills to us combatant commands and military departments when other entity was willing capable or agile enough to do so67 the nro commission implies that there may be an element of duplication of effort with other agencies the national security agency nima and the office responsible for measurement and signatures analysis masint and urges that there needs to be careful delineation of the responsibilities of different agencies for tasking processing exploitation and dissemination68 the nro commission praised the overall record of the nro but took note of number of managerial problems that it felt need to be addressed it argued that the management of the nro requires greater personal attention by the president the secretary of defense and the dci but did not recommend legislative solution the commission noted matter what form the secretary of defensedci relationship regarding the nro should take it is not selfexecuting and requires that active participation of both in order to best effect the basic mission of the nro this basic point was made again and again to the commission by past and present senior officials69 the commission also noted thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31369crs25 70ibid

nondod customers all of whom expect to be satisfied by nro systems with its systems overtaxed and unable to answer all demands yet attempting to be all things to all agencies the nro often bears the brunt of criticism from all sides70 the commission recommended that attention be given to achieving the proper balance between strategic and tactical requirements for nro systems present and future it noted also that funding limitations of recent years in conjunction with expanded support for military operations have limited nros ability to satisfy strategic longerterm intelligence needs71 congress in the report accompanying the fy2001 defense authorization act took note of the fact that recent years have witnessed the increase of nro support to military commanders at the same time as dod has been less involved in budgeting of the nro through the defense space reconnaissance program dsrp the conference committee directed an assessment by the secretary of defense to analyze whether funds and responsibilities for nros support of military operations and exercises should be consolidated and whether the dsrp should be revitalized72 the nro commission went further recommending that the dsrp be reestablished the nro commission noted that current innovation programs are designed to meet existing requirements within established cost controls the commission however suggested that this approach will not necessarily provide the type of technological breakthroughs that the nro achieved in the past and accordingly recommended the establishment of small office that would focus narrowly on high technology solutions to the most difficult intelligence problem s based on the requirement to gain frequent assured global access to denied areas73 the commission envisions the office operating separately from the rest of the nro with small highly skilled staff and with considerable budgetary independence and high level direction by the president secretary of defense and the dci the nro commission noted the importance of coordination of spacebased collection with that obtained by airborne platforms manned aircraft and unmanned airborne vehicles uavs satellites of course do not put pilots at risk and in general are much less at risk to hostile attack than airborne platforms especially from third world states or terrorist groups airborne platforms can nevertheless supply immediate longterm multiint coverage of limited area of interest the commission and other observers consider that there has been inadequate coordination of space and airborne programs especially since the space programs are national and much of the airborne effort is servicespecific the nro commission argued that the nro should supply system engineering capabilities to the airborne programs and promote common technologieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31369crs26 74nro commission report p 64 75ibid p 66 76ibid p 16at the same time the commission indicated its concern about the nros mission to support national policymakers and recommended that the dci should have greater latitude in transferring funds to respond most effectively to the specific types of issues that arise in nro programs giving the dci authority over the execution of the budgets of dod agencies has long been controversial and this recommendation has not been endorsed by secretary of defense rumsfeld the nro commission noted that the nro is currently developing new satellites that will be launched by new launch vehicles and that significant technical and administrative risks are involved today the fragility of the satellite and launch architectures offers margins for error74 the commission noted that the in the 1980s the challenger disaster and the suspension of space shuttle flights required the reconfiguration of nro satellites for other launch vehicles this cost billions of dollars and placed us national security at risk during the period when replacement satellites could not have been launched if circumstances had so required75 the commission also addressed nros personnel policies taking exception to what is viewed as overly rapid turnover among military personnel assigned to the space reconnaissance effort the commission believes there is compelling need for separate nro career path and assignment policy that provides an opportunity for selected highly trained engineers acquisition professionals and operations specialists to be assigned to the nro on longterm basis and progress through broad range of nro positions the technical complexity of nro systems is unique and it requires the continuity of dedicated cadre76 most observers would concur with the conclusion that the management of the nro and its relationships with other intelligence agencies could be usefully improved by greater attention from the president the secretary of defense and the dci and that better coordination needs to be established between the nro and other intelligence agencies and better balance achieved between the strategic and tactical requirements levied on the nro whereas improvements in coordination could readily be implemented by the executive branch the commission also considered but did not recommend the enactment of legislation to provide additional statutory authorities to the nro although some observers believe that legislation could enhance the nros legal charter more effectively than an informal working relationship among one set of incumbents that might not outlast the initiating administration the commissions recommendations reflect the continuing important role of the nro in the intelligence community and the extensive budgetary resources that such role entails in stressing issues of coordination the commission acknowledged that the nation s

of the impetus for the creation of nima was unsatisfactory experience during the persian gulf war when maps charts and geospatial data proved hard to acquire and difficult to disseminate to military commanders with pressing needs for precise locating data in congressional testimony one marine general recalled his experience in desert storm in locating imagery needed for breaching iraqi defenses dod had forwarded 1 ½ million imagery products to the theater but there was index as result our solution as surprising as it might seem was to take one officer from each of the divisions in their desert camouflage utilities put them on commercial aircraft fly them back here to washington dc have them go to dia cia and six other agencies try to find photos wrap them up get back on commercial aircraft and fly back to saudi arabia and distribute them our ground commanders got those photos 2 nights before the ground war began78 the difficulty illustrates the crucial importance of dissemination precise imagery is useless if it does not reach the decisionmaker when it is needed nima was established in the fy1997 defense authorization act pl 104201 despite reservations among some members that the designation as combat support agency would limit its ability to support nondod policymakers79 the conference report that accompanied that act stated that nima must be under the clear authority direction and control of the secretary of defense but the charter also provides for clear and prominent role for the dci to task imagery systems and exploit imagery products in support of the national mission80 current law provides that the dci shall establish requirements and priorities governing the collection of national intelligence by nima 81 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31369crs29

defined as information that identifies the geographic location and characteristics of natural and constructed features and boundaries on the earth including statistical data information derived from among other things remote sensing mapping and surveying technologies and mapping charting and geodetic data including geodetic products thus geospatial information is information about any objectnatural or manmadethat can be referenced to specific location on the earth lt gen james c king director nima address to the american society for photogrammetry and remote sensing httpwwwasprsorg

crucial for info superiority defense information and electronics report november 2 2001much of the attention of nimas leadership in the five years of its existence has been expended on the need to create single new agency out of the offices formerly associated with other agencies the unique and disparate cultures of imagery analysts and cartographers have been difficult to combine the fact that the defense mapping agency was never part of the intelligence community presented other administrative and cultural challenges observers credit nima with significant progress maps and other forms of geospatial data are made available in wide variety of formats to consumers throughout the government the nima commission concluded that while nimas transformation is still incomplete and progress against some of the goals mixed the commission observes progress in virtually every area82 nima has acquired global terrain elevation set that provided foundation display of the earths terrain heights within some 30 meters although greater accuracy is required for targeting precision guided munitions pgms this database reportedly will ensure much more accurate geographic dataset than previously available83 much of nimas current efforts are directed at making maps available to the rest of the defense department and other agencies according to one report nima produced 29 million maps for thousands of users in 1999 alone84 but major emphasis is the creation of the geospatial grid as currently envisioned the grid would include vast database of information collected from all parts of the intelligence community and from open sources the data would be organized around geographic datapoints and would provide common operating picture to the user hopefully reconciling information from variety of sources and reducing the possibility of mistaken attacks on embassies and other unintended targets thus consumer would be able to view particular geographic location on computerized map note terrain characteristics and manmade features and then have access to database with current intelligence regarding further information such as activities within factory or office ethnic compositions of specific areas etc85 even if administrative and technological barriers can be successfully overcome by nima there will still be limitations to the information available through geospatialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31369crs30 86see frank tiboni nima takes monumental step toward digital maps defense news may 21 2001 p 18 87nima commission report p 103reference points first there will always be classification limitations if for instance there is one human source who can identify factory producing weapons of mass destruction within an especially brutal dictatorship placing that information in database accessible to many people could be overly risky and there would need to be some way either to compartment that piece of information so only some users can access it with special codeword or handle it in separate channels secondly some observers believe that geospatial basis may be more useful for intelligence of concern to military commanders than to civilian policymakers there may be advantages and even significant disadvantages to tying certain types of information to geospatial grid political social or religious movements that may be of great concern to policymakers may not be tied to single geographic point for example russian decisionmaking may be of enormous interest but tying it to an office building in the kremlin would not be especially informative most observers believe that there will be continuing need for paper maps even as nima works on computerbased grid media reports indicate that nima plans envision eventuall phasing out the production of paper maps some observers however maintain that paper maps will continue to be required in many situations including special operations they believe that nima will have to ensure that paper maps remain available even if they are produced commercially86 for the nima commission the goal is to provide tped through an integrated data architecture not collection of systems products or processes seeking the mother of all databases the commission conceiv ed of all information with some form of georeference and widely and easily shared among users to include mapping and imagery in seamless packaged whole third parties would be able to add additional information in process that would be termed annotation the database should be structured to be independent of client or application fully distributed and capable of accepting successive valueadditions and user annotations87 the commission sees nima as the appropriate agency to achieve multiint integration and thus break down the intelligence stovepipe collection systems once in place can produce mountains of data at regular intervals and much undoubtedly goes unanalyzed there may be quantities of data left on the cutting room floor in actuality the data would be stored in retrievable form and arguably failure to provide decisionmakers with all information that has already been collected on the other hand government officials are not always equally interested in every corner of the world and in some cases data collected can be stored for future reference should interests change while it may not be expedient constantly to analyze certain targets it is important to retain coverage in files the nima commission also made number of specific recommendations that would in some cases require congressional authorization httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31369crs31 88on august 8 2001 dci tenet and secretary of defense rumsfeld announced the appointment of retired lt general james r clapper jr as nimas next director clapper had previously served as director of the defense intelligence agency from 1991 to 1995 89catherine macrae imagery and mapping agency reports steady progress at reforms defense information and electronics report july 27 2001 pp 1314 the establishment of an extraordinary program office epo to acquire stateoftheart tped and related communications the commission concluded that nima lacks the necessary expertise that it is not readily available in other agencies and that it is needed to accomplish the necessary goals within the next five years the proposal would provide for non government experts to be hired without the constraints of federal hiring restrictions or salary levels the epo would possess the special acquisition authorities of the dci the emphasis would be on maximal use of commercial off the shelf products while avoiding proprietary systems that face more rapid obsolescence the nominal tour length of the director of nima should be five years one of the ongoing challenges facing nima is the establishment of common culture for employees with backgrounds in several different agencies and greater longevity for senior leadership is needed88 nima should be authoriz ed additional senior executive service ses and senior intelligence service sis positions in order to promote and retain the caliber of personnel required to undertake the necessary transformation nima is severely under resourced given the expanding mission and the need to modernize augmentation of nimas research and development budget nima should develop new strategy to integrate commercial imagery with information from intelligence sources on an urgent basis osd should establish commercial imagery fund through which defense elements can charge purchases of commercial imagery larger question is whether the fia satellite program is justified given the availability of commercial imagery according to media accounts nima has taken number of reforms to deal with concerns identified by the commission efforts have been made to seek advice from industry experts to get clearer view of foreseeable technologies and to improve acquisition and delivery efforts89 it is impossible to make conclusive judgments on this issue without reference to classified materials but congressional committees are reviewing the program nimas mission is to provide global database to provide current basic geographic products to its customers many observers question whether nima is capable of taking charge of maintaining multiint database at this point building new single agency out of several components must overcome differences based on previous organizational ties and separate bureaucratic cultures as this is being accomplished nima must also establish reputation for accuracy completeness andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31369crs32 responsiveness that extends throughout the national security community achieving such reputation will require not only effective leadership but also the development and acquisition of an innovative and highly complex technical infrastructure
