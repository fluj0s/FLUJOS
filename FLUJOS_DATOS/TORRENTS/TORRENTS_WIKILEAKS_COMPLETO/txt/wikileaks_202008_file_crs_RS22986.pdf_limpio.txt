cynthia brougher american law division november 18 2008 abstract concerns over ﬂuctuating oil prices and declining petroleum production worldwide have revived interest in oil shale as potential resource the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 identiﬁed oil shale as strategically important domestic resource and directed the department of the interior to promote commercial development oil shale development would require signiﬁcant amounts of water however and water supply in the colorado river basin where several oil shale reserves are located is limited according to news reports oil companies holding water rights in the region have not exercised those rights in decades which has allowed other water rights holders to use the water for agricultural and municipal needs because of the nature of the water rights systems in the relevant states these users might face signiﬁcant limitations in their future use of water from the basin if the oil companies exercise their rights this report will provide brief overview of water rights in colorado utah and wyoming including changes that may be made to currently held water rights and the possibility for abandonment of unused water

unused water rights concerns over the price of oil and supply of petroleum have revived interest in alternative energy supplies including the deve lopment of oil shale to help address energy needs in the united states1 the process used to develop oil shale resources requires plentiful water supply according to news reports oil companies currently hold senior water rights in the states where oil shale reserves are located2 as explained below appropriation of water in these states is based on priority sy stem under which waterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22986crs2 3 id 4 depending on the individual states resources and historical development it may use one of three doctrines of water rights riparian prior appropriation or hybrid of the two under the riparian doctrine person who owns land that borders watercourse has the right to make reasonable use of the water on that land rather than having appropriated quantities of water per user users must share the water resources nd reduce their usage proportionally in times of shortage see generally dan tarlock law of water ri ghts and resources ch 3 common law of riparian rights 5 see generally id at ch 5 prior ppropriation doctrinerights holders have seniority over other wate r rights holders who acquired rights later these senior rights reportedly have not been exercised for decades allowing junior water rights holders to use the water3 because of the nature of the water rights systems in the relevant states junior water rights holde rs might face significant limitations on their future use of water from the basin if the oil companies exercise their rights this report will provide brief overview of water rights in colorado utah and wyoming changes that may be made to curren tly held water rights and the possibility for abandonment of unused water rights water rights in the colorado river basin generally the law of water rights is traditionally an area regulated by the states rather than the federal government indivi dual states may choose the sy stem under which water rights are allocated to water users4 western states including colorado utah and wyoming generally follow the prior appropriation doctrine of water rights often referred to as first in time first in right these states typically are drier and experience regular water shortages the prior appropriation system llows water users to acquire welldefined rights to certain quantities of water by designating senior and junior rights to avoid uncertainty during times of water scarcity under the prior appropria tion doctrine person who diverts water from watercourse and makes r easonable and beneficial use of th water acquires right to use of the water5 the users location relative to the watercourse whether upstream downstream adjacent or remote does not affect the ability to obtain water right typically under prior appropr iation system of water righ ts users apply for permit from state administrative agency which manages the acquisition and transfers of such rights the prior appropriation system limits users to the quantifie d amount of water the user secured under the permit process with pr iority based on the date the water right was conferred by the state the users right that was appropriated first t he senior water right is considered superior to late r appropriators rights to the wa ter the junior water right appropriators fill their needs according to the or der in which they secured the right to the water and not based on the available quantity therefore in times of shortage junior rights holders could be w ithout the water they need colorado basin states laws affecting water rights the issues regarding water rights in the colorado river basin arise from the fact that limited supply of water is sought after by ma ny different users junior rights holdershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22986crs3 6 colo const art xvi 56 utah code ann 7311 2007 wyo stat ann 413101 2007 7 colo rev stat 3792301 2007 8 conditional rights holders must demonstrate reasonable diligence in completing the diversion every six years in order to maintain the c onditional water right upon completion of the diversion the user

use waters from the basin to meet agricultural and municipal interests potentially are limited by what oil companies as senior rights holders use these junior rights holders have been able to use water to fill their need s for decades while senior rights holders have not used the water the dispute over po ssible water shortage when both groups wish to use water likely will raise questions about th nature and administra tion of water rights whether existing water rights may be amende d to account for the ch anged circumstances and the options available for users who seek to claim unused water rights from other users water rights typically are established thr ough an administrative permit system of the state in which the water is being appropriated water rights seekers must file an application with the proper state administra tive organization which dates the seniority of the water right state law provides that the water is the property of the state but water right is considered an individuals property right in the priority of the use of the states water6 the specific nature of water rights may vary depending on the state for example in colorado water rights can be either absolute or conditional7 absolute rights are assigned to users who have diverted water and put the water to beneficial use whereas conditional water rights allow the user to maintain the priority of the right he intends to acquire until the diversion is complete8 in other words user with an absolute right has fulfilled all the requirements necessary to acquire right to the water user with conditional right has asserted an intention to acquire right but has not yet fulfilled all of the requirements necessary to do so and that right is conditioned on the completion of all requirements utah law provi des that water rights become real property only when the application has been perfected under the require d legal process meaning that title of the right is properly filed with the state9 wyoming issues permits to applicants for water rights which allow the user time to construct and complete project to put water to beneficial use10 the water right is not considered permanent until the process is complete and may be disputed or removed until that time in the context of oil shale in the colorado river basin oil companies hold both absolu and conditional rights for water in colorado the nature of the rights held coul d influence the future use of the water and may provide basis for junior rights holders to challenge the continuing validity of the senior rights holders rights both junior and senior rights holders may seek to alter certain water rights if circumstances of water use change for example in co lorado senior rights holders may seek to convert their conditional rights to ab solute rights as discussed other state lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22986crs4 11 colo rev stat 3792302 utah code ann 7333 wyo stat ann 413104 413 114 12 see eg colo rev stat

altered as ci rcumstances change junior or senior rights holders may seek to change the geographic or purpose parameters set at the time they acquired their rights water rights generally are allocated based on specific point of diversion location of use and purpose of use in order to change the point from which water is diverted from its source or to change the place or purpose of use water right holder must apply to the appropr iate state office for approval11 the state office considering the change may consider factor s such as whether the change would exceed historical levels and whether other users ve sted water rights would be impaired by the change12 junior rights holders may seek to secure wa ter by acquiring the rights of senior rights holders under the water rights transfer pro cess in each state in colorado water right may be bought sold or leased to other entities if the transfer is f iled with the appropriate state office and the transfer would not inju re the vested rights of another user13 similarly utah water law provides that water right may be bought or sold if the transfer is approved by the state14 under wyoming law water right attaches to the lands or the place of use in the permit rather than to an individual15 water rights may be transferred only if included in the sale of land or by petition for change in place of use to the appropriate state office senior rights holders may lose their rights if those rights are not used conditional rights in colorado require rights holders to demonstrate continuous efforts in developing the water right on regular basis16 other water rights also may be lost under certain circumstances according to state law if senior rights holders lose their rights the water supply available for junior righ ts holders to fill their needs would increase in colorado water right may be considered abandoned if it is not used for 10year period and there is an intent to abandon17 in utah water rights ma be abandoned or forfeited18 for water right to be abandoned ther must be intent to abandon by the user and there is time requirement for water right to be forfeited the water right must not be used for fiveyear period in wyoming abandonment may take three forms19 first the user may voluntarily abandon the water right second one user may allege that another users right has been abandoned because the other user s not used the right for fiveyear period and that reactivation of that right would injure the users right third the state may allegehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22986crs5 20 at least 47 states and

beneficial use for fiveyear period and reallocation would serve the public intere st water rights that are lost under these processes revert to the state and may be appropriate d in the future the law of the river and interstate water allocation state water laws govern the allocation of water within the state but water resources rarely are confined to state boundaries ra ther like the colorado river basin water basins spread across several states as re sult states often compete for resources from shared basins and the competition often leads to water disputes between states in regions with shared water resources20 interstate water disputes may be resolved in various manners two of the most common methods are equitable apportionment in the us supreme court21 and interstate compact negotiate d by the parties and approved by congress22 the colorado river basin is excep tion to the likelihood of disputes and is subject to number of j udicial decisions and intersta compacts commonly referred to as the law of the river the law of the river governs the waters of the colorado river basin in addition to regulation by the individual states in which water rights are allocated the law of the river is collection of laws and agreements that govern the distribution of the water throughout the basin as whole23 because the colorado river basin includes seven states which have varying needs and all draw upon the same resources series of court decisions statutes interstate compacts and international treaties address the use and management of co lorado river water24 the laws and agreements that form the law of the river attempt to allocate the waters of the colorado river basin among the states providing broad parameters fo r the distribution of the basins waters thus the law of the river would not govern individual wate r rights directly but it would place limits on the water available for allocation by each state
