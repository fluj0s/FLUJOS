reprinted in uscode cong ad news 1425 1432schools1 the amendment was withdrawn from hr 2646 but senator gorton indicated that the present gregggorton amendment or something very similar to it will be presented at an early opportunity on some other bill that relate s directly or indirectly to education it will not go away but i hope the next time that it is pr esented it is presented on bill that is almost certain to be signed by the president of the united states rather than vetoed by the president of the united states2 the supporters of this type of ame ndment argue that it would eliminate double standard with respect to the discipline of children with and wit hout disabilities and give decisionmaking authority to the state and local authorities so they could tailor their policies to their particular situations3 the opponents of such an amendment argue that it would eliminate the rights of children w ith disabilities by giving school officials authority to remove these children if their be havior violated unifo rm policy even if such behavior was manifestation of disability4 current law under current law child with disability is not immune from disciplinary procedures but neither are those procedur identical to those for children without disabilities idea contains detailed due process protections for children with disabilities including the stayput provision requiring th at unless the state or local educational agency and the parents otherwise agree the child shall remain in the then current educational placement of the child during any dispute over the childs education5 if parent feels that child with disability is not receiving free appropriate public education parent may invoke due process and ask for hearing on the issue these provisions were included in idea due to congressional findings that children with disabilities were of ten not receiving an education or were receiving an inappropriate education the house and sena reports for pl 94142 bot h noted statistics indicating that there were more than eight million children with disabilities and that only 39 million such children are receiving an ppropriate educati on 17 million handicapped children are receiving educational servi ces at all and 25 milli on handicapped children are receiving an ina ppropriate education6 in addition at the time of enactment of pl 94142 there were number of judicial deci sions finding constitu tional infirmities with the lack of education for children with disabilities when the states were providinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98385crs3 7parc v state of pennsylvania 343 fsupp 279 ed pa 1972 mills v board of education of the dist rict of columbia 348 fsupp 866 ddc 1972 the house report for pl 94142 indicated that followi ng these decisions there were 46 cases which are completed or still pending in 28 states hrepno 332 94th cong 1st sess 3 1975education for childre n without disabilities7 in fact one of these decisions mills v board of education involved seven school age children w ho had been excluded from the public schools and had been labeled as behavior problems ment ally retarded emotionally disturbed or hyperactive and received education the di strict court found that this denial of an education was denial of constitutional due process the protections against school unilatera lly ceasing services to child with disability do not mean that school officials have options regarding disciplining such children school personnel may suspend child with disability for up to ten days place child with disability in an inte rim alternative edu cational setting for up to forty five days for situati ons involving weapons and drugs ask hearing officer to order child to be placed in an interim alternative educational setting for up to fortyfive days if it is demonstrated that the child is substantially likely to injure himself or others in his current placement conduct manifestation determination review to determine whether there is link between the childs disability and the misbehavior if the childs behavior is not manifestation of disability long term disciplinary action such as long term suspension or expulsion may occur except that educational services may not cease legal implications of the amendment if an amendment like the one proposed to hr 2646 were to be enacted states and localities would be free to establish and implement their own disciplinary policies as long as these were uniformly applied to all children this would essentially return the authority to the schools regarding discipline and the cessation of edu cational services that existed prior to enactment of pl 94142 the states and localities would be free to establish disciplinary policies that are the same as current law or more or less stringent than current law it could be argued that the requirement for uniformity would be distinction from the pre pl 94142 law and would provide some protections for children with disabilities since they could not be specifically singled out for exclusion however it could also be argued that the requirement for uniformity might work to the detriment of children with disabilities for example if school distri ct had policy for expulsion for all children who injured other children situation could arise where child with seizure disorder could accidently hit and injure another child if treated uniformly with the situation involving child who beat up another chil d both situations could result in expulsion similarly if schools policy was suspen sion or expulsion for the use of profanehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98385crs4 language child with tourettes syndrome wh ich is often characterized by uncontrollable verbal expressions could be treated simila rly to child without disability and be subjected to the same disciplinary pr ocedures under the proposed amendment an amendment like that proposed to hr 2646 would only change ideas due process protections with regard to discipline nd order parents due process rights with regard to placement and other non disciplinar matters would be unchanged however the proposed amendment could be signif icant limitation on the due process protections available to children with disabilities since parents would not have federally guaranteed right to challenge the change in placement of child with disability resulting from disciplinary action the exact limitations if any would depend on the specific policies that the states and localities adopted another issue raised by the amendmen t proposed to hr 2646 is whether parents could pursue other legal avenues when disputes arise concerning discipline the supreme court has not dealt with the constitutional issues presented by parc and mills but it has discussed these cases in the context of ideas statutory provisions in board of hendrick hudson school district v rowley 458 us 176 1982 the court examined the legislative history of pl 94142 nd noted the importance attached to parc and mills finding that the principles they established were the principles that guided the drafters of the legislation similarly in honig v doe 484 us 305 1988 the court found that the decisions in parc and mills demonstrated that many di sabled children were excluded pursuant to state statutes or local rules nd policies typically w ithout any consultation with or even notice to their parents id at 309310 it could be argued that if language like that in the amendment proposed to hr 2646 were enacted constitutional arguments may be advanced challenging the policies of state and local educational agencies it might so be possible for parents to sue under the americans with disabilitie s act ada 42 usc 12101 et seq or section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 29 usc 794 th likelihood of success of cases brought under the constitution and these statutes is not clear since the supreme court has not spoken on the issues and lower courts have infrequently addressed them due to the existence of the statutor protections of idea
