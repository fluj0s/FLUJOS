research service the library of congress how medicaid works program basics summary medicaid is meanstested entitlement program that has been in existence for more than 40 years it provides primary and acute care as well as longterm care to more than 50 million americans at cost to federal and state governments of approximately 2963 billion in fy2004 of all federally supported social programs only medicare comes close to this level of spending and only social security costs more medicaid is jointly financed by the federal and state governments but each state designs and administers its own version of the program under broad federal guidelines the complexity of medicaid presents an enormous challenge for anyone attempting to generalize about the program state variability in eligibility covered services and how those services are reimbursed and delivered is the rule rather than the exception furthermore medicaid is targeted at individuals with low income but not all of the poor are eligible and not all those covered are poor this report summarizes the basic elements of medicaid and includes the most recent data available ranging from 2000 to 2006 depending on the data source

works program basics overview medicaid was enacted in 1965 in the same legislation that created the medicare program the social security amendments of 1965 pl 8997 it grew out of and replaced two earlier programs of federal grants to states that provided medical care to welfare recipients and the aged medicaid is meanstested entitlement program it is jointly financed by federal and state funds federal contributions to each state are based on states willingness to finance covered medical services and matching formula each state designs and administers its own program under broad federal rules the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms within the us department of health and human services hhs is responsible for federal oversight of the program in fy2004 total federal and state spending on medicaid reached 2963 billion see table 1 slightly exceeding net outlays for medicare other meanstested cash or noncash program comes close to approaching this spending level in fact of all federally supported social programs only social security costs more table 1 federal share and total medicaid spending 19982004 in billions percentage change year total medicaid spending federal share in federal share 1998 1773 1001 66 1999 1899 1074 73 2000 2061 1169 88 2001 2280 1298 111 2002 2582 1466 129 2003 2761 1610 98 2004 2963 1750 87 sources crs tabulations of form cms64 data from the centers for medicare and medicaid services to many medicaid is an enigma the programs complexity surrounding who is eligible what services are paid for and how those services are reimbursed and delivered is one source of this confusion variability across state medicaid programs is the rule not the exception and adds to the confusion income eligibility levels vary services covered vary and the method for and amount of reimbursement for services differ from state to state in addition more and more states in recent years crs2 have implemented variety of major program changes using special waiver authority furthermore medicaid is program that is targeted at lowincome individuals but not all of the poor are eligible and not all those covered are poor for populations like children and families primary and acute care are often delivered through managed care while the elderly and disabled typically obtain such care on feefor service basis nationwide medicaid finances the majority of longterm care services such services include for example nursing home care and communitybased services designed to support the elderly and disabled in their homes recently some states have begun to integrate medicare and medicaid financing andor coverage of acute and longterm care services for these populations the complexity of medicaid presents an enormous challenge for anyone attempting to make generalizations about the program this report describes federal medicaid rules that govern 1 who is eligible 2 what services are covered and how they are delivered 3 how the program is financed and administered 4 key provider reimbursement issues and 5 the significant role of waivers in expanding eligibility and modifying services it concludes with brief legislative history of major laws affecting medicaid enacted since 1996 eligibility federal medicaid statute defines over 50 distinct population groups as being potentially eligible for states programs some groups are mandatory meaning that all states that participate in the medicaid program must cover them others are optional prior to the 1980s medicaid eligibility was limited to very lowincome families with dependent children poor elderly and disabled individuals and the medically needy beginning in the 1980s additional eligibility pathways were added to the medicaid statute to allow for the coverage of higher income children and pregnant women as well as other elderly and disabled individuals most recently states were given the option to provide medicaid to other groups with specific characteristics including certain women with breast or cervical cancer to uninsured individuals with tuberculosis and to additional working individuals with disabilities not all groups of medicaid beneficiaries receive the same set of benefits to understand the different benefits offered to each group see benefits medicaid is meanstested program to qualify applicants income and resources must be within certain limits the specific income and resource limitations that apply to each eligibility group are set through combination of federal parameters and state definitions consequently those standards vary considerably among states and different standards apply to different population groups within state for many of those groups moreover states have permission under special provision section 1902r2 to use more liberal standards for computing income and resources than are specified within each of the groups definitions most states use section 1902r2 to ignore or disregard certain types or amounts of income or assets thereby extending medicaid to individuals with earnings or assets too high to otherwise qualify under the specified rules for that eligibility pathway crs3 families pregnant women and children the two primary pathways to medicaid for lowincome family members pregnant women and children are through 1 section 1931 of medicaid statute for those families who would have been eligible for cash welfare payments under former aid to families with dependent children afdc program rules and 2 series of targeted medicaid expansions for poor pregnant women and children begun in the 1980s other important pathways for lowincome family members including transitional medical assistance other afdcrelated groups and children qualifying for the state childrens health insurance program schip who are receiving their health coverage under the medicaid program are explained below section 1931 persons qualifying under the former afdc program rules families who are eligible for temporary assistance for needy families tanf the welfare program enacted in 1996 to replace afdc are not automatically eligible for medicaid medicaids section 1931 however preserves medicaid entitlement for individuals who meet the requirements of the former afdc programs in effect in their states on july 16 1996 this categorical group was created when tanf replaced afdc to ensure that lowincome families do not lose medicaid as result of welfare reform states have significant flexibility in defining the income and resource standards for those families qualifying for medicaid under section 1931 1 income standards may be reduced below those in effect in 1996 but they cannot be lower than those used on may 1 1988 2 income and resource standards may be increased for any period after 1996 but by more than the percentage increase in the consumer price index cpi for the same period and 3 states may use less restrictive methods for counting income and resources than those in effect on july 16 1996 certain individuals qualifying under the section 1931 pathway may be denied medicaid coverage if they refuse to cooperate with states tanf work requirements states are permitted to deny medicaid benefits to nonpregnant adults and heads of households who lose tanf benefits because of refusal to work but must continue to provide medicaid coverage to their children in 2002 39 states had taken advantage of the flexibility of section 1931 to expand eligibility for working families by disregarding some earned income thereby allowing families with higher total income to qualify for the program additional states eliminated various income and assets rules again for lowincome working families thus expanding their access to medicaid1 povertyrelated pregnant women and children between 1986 and 1991 congress gradually extended medicaid to new groups of pregnant women and children under these provisions states are required to cover pregnant women and children under age 6 with family incomes below 133 of the federal poverty income 1 ka maloy ka kenney j darnell and s cyprien can medicaid work for low income working families kaiser commission on the future of medicaid and the uninsured apr 2002 crs4 guidelines2 coverage for pregnant women qualifying through this pathway is limited to services related to the pregnancy or complications of the pregnancy and extends to 60 days after termination of the pregnancy children receive full medicaid coverage states are required to cover all children over the age of five and under 19 who are in families with income below 100 of the federal poverty level fpl this requirement has been phasedin since july 1 1991 and was fully implemented in 2002 states have the option to go beyond the above mandatory groups to include pregnant women and infants under one year of age whose family income is over 133 and up to 185 of the fpl in 2002 36 states and the district of columbia extended coverage to some or all pregnant women and infants in this category transitional medical assistance states are required to offer transitional medical assistance tma to certain individuals receiving medicaid under section 1931 of the social security act the law permanently requires four months of tma for families losing medicaid eligibility due to increased child or spousal support collections it also permanently requires four months of tma for families losing medicaid eligibility due to an increase in earned income or hours of employment tma was established in part to address the concern that individuals receiving afdc payments would not seek work or would turn down work opportunities for fear of losing medicaid in 1988 congress expanded tma so that states must continue providing medicaid for six months to families that were receiving medicaid under section 1931 in at least three of the last six months the extended tma coverage is available to individuals and families who would otherwise have lost such assistance due to increased work hours increased earnings or the loss of timelimited earned income disregard in addition states are required to extend medicaid coverage for second six months to families that were covered during the entire first sixmonth tma period and whose earnings are below 185 of poverty the provision authorizing tma receipt for up to 12 months section 1925 of the social security act was originally authorized to replace the permanent fourmonth tma requirement through fy1998 but its sunset has been repeatedly extended over the years if the 12month tma provision is allowed to expire states will still be required to provide four months of tma to families that lose medicaid eligibility due to an increase in earned income hours of employment or child or spousal support but not to those who lose eligibility due to the loss of timelimited earnings disregard which allows families to qualify for medicaid at higher income levels for set period of time3 2 one hundred percent of the federal poverty level fpl is equal to 15670 and 133 of fpl is equal to 20841 for family of three in 2004 in the 48 contiguous states 3 as of 2001 the most recent published data available 15 states had timelimited income disregard policies for families receiving medicaid under section 1931 see ka maloy ka kenney j darnell and s cyprien can medicaid work for lowincome working families kaiser commission on the future of medicaid and the uninsured apr 2002 crs5 other afdcrelated groups while the afdc program longer exists number of medicaid eligibility groups tied to states former afdc rules remain states must provide medicaid to recipients of adoption assistance and foster care who are under age 18 under title iv of the social security act in 1999 states were given the option to extend medicaid to former foster care recipients who are aged 18 19 or 20 ribicoff children pathway named for the former senator who sponsored legislation authorizing this group are those under age 21 who meet income and resource requirements for the former afdc program but who do not meet other categorical requirements for afdc states have the option to cover ribicoff children and have great deal of flexibility in defining the specific group of children to be covered under this category often states use this authority to cover children in state sponsored foster care children who are institutionalized or who are inpatients in psychiatric facilities although many of the children who have traditionally been covered under ribicoff are now eligible under other povertyrelated groups ribicoff remains an important pathway to eligibility for some small groups of older adolescents in foster care and children in twoparent families targeted lowincome children section 4911 of the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 established an additional coverage group for low income children this provision establishes medicaid coverage group that is parallel to the group of children eligible for health coverage under another provision of bba 97 the state childrens health insurance program schip section 4901 the two provisions allowed states to choose after the passage of bba 97 to extend medicaid for targeted lowincome children create new schip program for those children or coordinate both programs to cover the target population targeted lowincome children are those who are not otherwise eligible for medicaid are not covered under group health plan or other insurance and are living in families with income that is either 1 above the states medicaid financial eligibility standard in effect in june 1997 but less than 200 of the fpl or 2 in states with medicaid income levels for children already at or above 200 of the poverty level as of june 1997 within 50 percentage points over this income standard states can either establish specific coverage group for targeted lowincome children or they can build upon other existing medicaid coverage groups for children as of august 2004 33 states cover targeted lowincome children under medicaid the aged and persons with disabilities persons who qualify for supplemental security income ssi with one important exception states are required to provide medicaid coverage to recipients of ssi ssi authorized under title xvi of the social security act is meanstested cash assistance program for aged blind and disabled individuals whose income falls below the federal maximum monthly ssi benefit and whose resources are limited to qualify for ssi person must satisfy the program criteria for age or disability and meet certain citizenship or united states residency requirements eligibility for ssi is restricted to otherwise qualified individuals whose resources do not exceed 2000 for an individual and 3000 for couple certain resources such as persons home are exempt income cannot exceed the maximum federal ssi crs6 benefit of 579 per month in 2005 for an individual living independently and 869 for couple living independently the ssi benefit level of 579 per month for an individual is 74 of the fpl the major exception to medicaid coverage of ssi recipients is in states that exercise the socalled 209b option described in section 209b of the social security amendments of 1972 pl 92603 such states may use income resource and disability standards that are more restrictive than those in place on january 1 1972 as of 2003 there were 11 section 209b states connecticut hawaii illinois indiana minnesota missouri new hampshire north dakota ohio oklahoma and virginia4 each of these has at least one eligibility standard that is more restrictive than current ssi standards and some have certain standards that are more liberal states that use more restrictive eligibility rules under section 209b must also allow applicants to deduct medical expenses from their income when determining financial eligibility for medicaid this process is sometimes referred to as spenddown5 recipients of state supplemental payment ssp benefits many states provide ssp benefits with stateonly dollars on monthly basis these payments are intended to cover such items as food shelter clothing utilities and other daily necessities the amount of the benefit is determined by the individual states states may provide supplemental payments to all persons who receive ssi andor to individuals who meet all ssi criteria other than income states may also choose to provide ssp benefits only to particular groups such as elderly persons living independently in the community without special needs or elderly individuals who require inhome personal care assistance or homedelivered meals in all of these cases states decide whether to extend medicaid coverage to all ssp recipients to only some of these recipients or to none at all when state provides medicaid eligibility to persons receiving only ssp and not ssi then the maximum income eligibility standard for medicaid is an amount equivalent to the combined federal ssi payment and the ssp benefit for 209b states however the effective maximum financial eligibility standard for these individuals is the 209b categorical eligibility standard plus the ssp payment povertyrelated group for the aged and disabled the enactment of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1986 obra 86 offered states an option for covering persons whose income exceeds ssi or 209b levels this option allows states to cover aged and disabled individuals with incomes up to 100 of fpl in 2003 20 states and the district of columbia used this option6 4 2003 eligibility survey conducted by the american public human services association in collaboration with congressional research service 5 an example of spenddown is as follows if an applicant has monthly income of 700 not including any ssi or state supplemental payments ssp and the states maximum allowable income standard for spenddown eligibility is 600 the applicant would qualify for medicaid after incurring 100 in medical expenses in that month 6 2003 eligibility survey conducted by the american public human services association in collaboration with congressional research service the district of columbia allowed people to qualify up to 100 of fpl the states included arkansas up to 80 california continued crs7 coverage for institutionalized individuals and related groups under the special income rule states may extend medicaid to certain individuals with incomes too high to qualify for ssi and who are eligible for nursing facility or other institutional care under the special income rule also referred to as the 300 rule such persons must 1 require care provided by nursing home or other medical institution for fewer than 30 consecutive days 2 meet the resource standard determined by the state and 3 have income that does not exceed specified level greater than 300 of the maximum ssi payment applicable to person living at home for 2005 this limit is 1737 per month 3 times the monthly ssi payment of 579 states may use level that is lower than the maximum of 300 of ssi if they wish since 1993 obra 93 states that use only the special income rule for institutional eligibility and do not use the medically needy option described below must allow applicants to place income in excess of the special income level in special trust often called miller trust and receive medicaid coverage for their care7 following the individuals death the state becomes the beneficiary of amounts in the trust working individuals with disabilities concern that many workers with disabilities would lose eligibility for medicaid as result of increased earnings and yet not have access to affordable or adequate health insurance through their jobs prompted congress to establish variety of special rules that would protect working individuals with disabilities from losing their medicaid benefits one rule does so by changing ssi program rules for working persons with disabilities in order for disabled persons to qualify for ssi and thus become eligible for medicaid applicants must establish disability status under the criteria determined by the secretary of health and human services hhs these criteria are linked to an individuals ability to work or earn income from work commonly referred to as an individuals ability to engage in substantial gainful activity sga current regulations provide that an individual is able to engage in sga if his or her earnings exceed 830 per month for 2005 for persons who are blind sga is 1380 per month for 2005 sga is defined in federal regulations as paid work involving significant and productive physical or mental duties8 section 1619a of ssi law permits those states that extend medicaid to ssi recipients to allow certain persons with disability who had been eligible for an ssi payment for at least one month and who meet all 6 continued 100 florida 88 georgia 100 hawaii 100 illinois 100 maine 100 massachusetts 100 michigan 100

from the united states district court for the district of colorado that first coined the term miller trust see miller v ybarra 746 fsupp 79 ed colo 1990 8 the inability to engage in sga must be result of medically determined physical or mental impairment expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last for continuous period of at least 12 months child under age 18 may qualify as disabled if he or she has an impairment that results in marked and severe functional limitations crs8 other eligibility rules to continue receiving medicaid even when they are working at the sga level the amount of their ssi special cash benefits is gradually reduced as their earnings increase under an income disregard formula9 until their countable earnings reach the ssi benefit standard or what is known as the breakeven point 579 per month in 2005 in addition individuals who are blind or have disability can continue to be eligible for medicaid even if their earnings exceed the ssi income disregard breakeven point under special group referred to as qualified severely impaired individuals special eligibility status granted by section 1619b1 and 1905q under which the individual is considered an ssi recipient for purposes of medicaid eligibility although he or she is not actually receiving ssi cash benefit applies as long as the individual 1 continues to be blind or have disabling impairment 2 continues to meet all the other requirements except for earnings for ssi eligibility 3 would be seriously inhibited from continuing to work by the termination of eligibility for medicaid services and 4 has earnings that are not sufficient to provide reasonable equivalent to the benefits that would have been available if he or she did not have ssi state supplementary payments medicaid and publicly funded personal care other provisions give states even more flexibility to cover working persons with disabilities the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 allows states to provide medicaid coverage to working individuals with disabilities whose familys net income does not exceed 250 of the fpl two other provisions were added under the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 twwiia pl 106170 the first allows states to further expand medicaid coverage to working individuals with disabilities between the ages of 16 and 64 with incomes and resources as defined by the state and allows states to impose premiums and other costsharing on individuals who qualify the second allows states under certain circumstances to provide coverage to persons whose medical conditions have improved and who have therefore become ineligible for ssi on the basis of disability qualified medicare beneficiaries and related groups certain low income individuals who are aged or have disabilities as defined under ssi and who are eligible for medicare are also eligible to have some of their medicare costsharing expenses paid for by medicaid there are four categories of such persons10 qualified medicare beneficiaries qmb qualified medicare beneficiaries are aged or disabled medicare beneficiaries with 9 not all income is counted for ssi purposes different exemptions or disregards apply for the different types of income earned income that is exempt from being counted includes the first 65 per month in wages onehalf of all wages over 65 impairmentrelated expenses necessary for blind and disabled workers and income used for plan for achieving self support pass unearned income exclusions include the first 20 per month of non needs tested benefits and all of the following food stamps housing and energy assistance state and local needsbased assistance inkind support and maintenance payments from non profit organizations and student grants and scholarships 10 the program known as qualifying individuals2 qi2 terminated on sept 30 2002 crs9 incomes greater than 100 of the federal poverty level and assets greater than 4000 for an individual and 6000 for couple states are required to cover under their medicaid programs the costs of medicare premiums deductibles and coinsurance for medicare covered benefits for such persons other medicaid covered services such as nursing facility care prescription drugs and primary and acute care services are not covered for these individuals unless they qualify for medicaid through other eligibility pathways eg via ssi medically needy or the special income rule specified lowincome medicare beneficiaries slmb specified lowincome medicare beneficiaries meet qmb criteria except that their income is greater than 100 of fpl but does not exceed 120 fpl under this medicaid pathway states are required to cover only the monthly medicare part b premium other medicaid covered services are not covered for these individuals unless they qualify for medicaid through other eligibility pathways qualifying individuals qi1 the qi1 eligibility pathway applies to aged and disabled medicare beneficiaries whose income is between 120 and 135 fpl for these individuals states are required to pay the monthly medicare part b premium only until the federal allotment for this purpose is depleted11 these individuals are not otherwise eligible for medicaid qualified disabled and working individuals qdwis states are required to pay the medicare part premiums for persons who were previously entitled to medicare on the basis of disability who lost their entitlement based on earnings from work but who continue to have disabling condition such persons may only qualify if their incomes are below 200 of fpl their resources are below 200 of the ssi limit 4000 and they are not otherwise eligible for medicaid in december 2003 the president signed the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma 2003 pl 108173 this act provides that beginning in 2006 medicaid eligibles who are also eligible for medicare will receive outpatient prescription drug coverage through the new medicare prescription drug benefit instead of through medicaid while this act does not change medicaid eligibility rules it does affect the benefits that the medicaid program will be allowed to cover12 under mma 2003 state medicaid programs will 11 in general medicaid payments are shared between the federal government and the states according to matching formula see the section on financing however expenditures under the qi1 program are paid 100 by the federal government from the part b trust fund up to the states allocation level state is only required to cover the number of persons which would bring its spending on these population groups in year up to its allocation level this temporary program originally slated to end sept 30 2002 has been extended through sept 30 2005 by pl 108448 12 medicaid eligibility for individuals who now qualify as medically needy by spending down their income on medical expenses see next section may be affected those continued crs10 longer be able to cover any drugs that are to be provided through the medicare benefit or pay the cost sharing amounts for those drugs medically needy states may extend medicaid coverage to persons who are members of one of the broad categories of medicaid covered groups ie are aged have disability or are in families with children but do not meet the applicable income requirements and in some instances resources requirements for other eligibility pathways under this option states may set their medically needy monthly income limits for family of given size at any level up to 133 of the maximum payment for similar family under the states afdc program in place on july 16 1996 for families of one the statute gives certain states some flexibility to set these limits to amounts that are reasonably related to the afdc payment amounts for two or more persons while 133a of the former afdc program standard is generally higher than the nominal income standard for other medicaid pathways for families it is generally lower than the income standard for elderly or disabled ssi recipients for all groups states are required to allow individuals to spend down to the medically needy income standard by incurring medical expenses in the same way that ssi recipients in section 209b states may spend down to medicaid eligibility for elderly and disabled recipients living in the community who must spend down to qualify for medicaid the medically needy income standard leaves individuals with less money for their living expenses than simply qualifying for medicaid through ssi under the statute states may limit the categories of individuals who can qualify as medically needy if state provides any medically needy program however it must include all children under 18 who would qualify under one of the welfare related groups and all pregnant women who would qualify under either mandatory or optional group if their income or resources were lower in 2003 cms reported that 35 states and the district of columbia had medically needy programs13 and 33 of these programs were extended to persons age 65 and older and persons with disabilities14 12 continued individuals may experience delayed medicaid eligibility or longer qualify at all because medicare part d will pay some portion of the drug expenses that were formally counted toward their spenddown amounts 13 these include

human services association in collaboration with congressional research service states not extending their medically needy programs to the aged and persons with disabilities include oklahoma oregon and texas crs11 others in recent years new groups have been added to medicaid that move the program further away from its traditional links to cash assistance programs demonstration waivers have given states the flexibility to target enrollment and benefits to various groups and two new pathways were added to medicaid for individuals with specific medical diagnoses with specific restrictions medicaid is also available to certain immigrants individuals qualifying under demonstration waivers demonstration waivers available under the authority of section 1115 of the social security act enable states to experiment with new approaches for providing health care coverage that promote the objectives of the medicaid program section 1115 allows the secretary of hhs to waive number of medicaid rules including many of the federal rules relating to medicaid eligibility15 the health insurance flexibility and accountability hifa initiative is an explicit effort of hhs to encourage states to seek section 1115 waivers to extend medicaid and schip to the uninsured with particular emphasis on statewide approaches that maximize private health insurance coverage options and target populations with incomes below 200 fpl number of states have used such waivers to enact broadbased and sometimes statewide health reforms although demonstrations under section 1115 need not be statewide number of the demonstrations extend comprehensive health insurance coverage to lowincome children and families who would not otherwise be eligible for medicaid women with breast and cervical cancer woman who are eligible for medicaid under this optional coverage group are those who have been screened for and found to have breast or cervical cancer including precancerous conditions through the national breast and cervical cancer early detection program nbccedp women who qualify must be under age 65 uninsured and otherwise not eligible for medicaid benefits are limited to the period in which the beneficiary requires breast or cervical cancer treatment in 2003 47 states16 and the district of columbia chose to cover women who meet these requirements persons with tuberculosis states may choose to offer medicaid to people with tuberculosis tb who are uninsured individuals qualifying under this pathway are entitled only to those services related to the treatment of tuberculosis in 2003 13 states17 and the district of columbia covered such persons with tb 15 see also the discussion of section 1115 waivers below 16 these include alabama alaska arizona arkansas california colorado

eligibles include all persons enrolled in medicaid during the year whether or not any payments for services were made on their behalf totals do not sum because this table excludes individuals whose basis of eligibility was unknown medicaid and the poor in calendar year 2002 medicaid covered 15 of the total us population excluding institutionalized persons and 53 of those with incomes below the federal poverty level fpl according to estimates from the medical expenditure panel survey meps because categorical eligibility requirements for children are less restrictive than those for adults poor children are much more likely to receive coverage table 4 shows medicaid coverage by age and income status in calendar year 2002 the estimates of those with medicaid coverage include those covered by the state childrens health insurance program through both expansions of medicaid and separate state programs note that persons shown as receiving medicaid may have had other health coverage as well nearly all the elderly for example had medicare of persons with family incomes below poverty 85 of children under age six were covered by medicaid compared to 375 of those 19 and older many individuals even below the poverty level are not eligible for medicaid due to categorical restrictions nondisabled childless nonaged adults are never eligible for medicaid regardless of their income unless their state obtains special waiver to cover such individuals in addition even those who are eligible may not enroll for example all children under six years old in families with income below 133 of fpl are mandatory coverage group however 691000 children in poverty below 100 of fpl were estimated to have gone without medicaid this is not to say these children were uninsured in fact based on meps only 30 of these children 204000 were uninsured for the entire year half had employersponsored coverage and the remainder had some other type of public coverage crs18 table 5 shows an analysis of all children regardless of income using meps it provides estimates of the number of children who were uninsured in the first part of 2002 and the number who were also eligible for medicaid ten million children were estimated to have been uninsured with 62 million of them eligible for public coverage but not enrolled it is necessary to note that the meps results shown in table 4 and table 5 reflect what is widely referred to as the medicaid undercount meps along with other nationally representative surveys on sources of health insurance have been shown to undercount the number of people enrolled in medicaid one analysis of 2000 data estimated that meps undercounts medicaid enrollment of children by 3 to 7 million for all ages the undercount was as much as 105 million21 the impact of the medicaid undercount on estimates of the uninsured is debatable some research suggests that the medicaid undercount is the result of survey respondents selecting some other source of health insurance besides medicaid although this results in medicaid undercount it would not cause an overestimate of the uninsured since these respondents are still claiming source of coverage however if medicaid enrollees fail to respond as having any source of coverage they would inappropriately be considered uninsured additional research is needed on this topic to determine the impact of the medicaid undercount on uninsured estimates another source often used to estimate the uninsured is the current population survey cps however analyses show that the magnitude of the medicaid undercount in the cps is significantly more than in any of the other surveys including meps as result the cps was not used in this report table 4 medicaid coverage by age and family income calendar year 2002 in

states choose to include them in their medicaid plans states define the specific features of each mandatory and optional service to be provided under that plan within broad federal guidelines those four basic guidelines include amount duration and scope each covered service must be sufficient in amount duration and scope to reasonably achieve its purpose the state may not arbitrarily deny or reduce the amount duration or scope of services solely because of the type of illness or condition the state may place appropriate limits on service based on such criteria as medical necessity crs20 comparability with certain exceptions defined in regulations services available to any categorically needy22 beneficiary in state must be equal in amount duration and scope to those available to any

receiving cash payments these groups are generally referred to as the categorically needy states also have the option to provide medicaid coverage to other categorically needy groups for whom the eligibility criteria are somewhat more liberal crs21 items in defining the scope of selected optional benefits and in developing programs that meet the needs of their medicaid populations other

are also eligible for medicare will receive outpatient prescription drug coverage through the new medicare prescription drug benefit instead of through medicaid state medicaid programs will be prohibited from covering any drugs that are to be provided through the medicare benefit and from paying the cost sharing amounts for those drugs the precise impact of this bill on the medicaid drug coverage for dual eligibles is difficult to predict at this time because the scope of the new medicare benefit is not defined in statute the statute includes general guidelines that private insurers and plan sponsors who will offer and administer the medicare benefit must follow under these general guidelines specific plan benefits may vary nonetheless prescription drug crs24 coverage offered by state medicaid plans to dually eligible beneficiaries will be considerably reduced23 services for persons with sickle cell disease under pl 108357 beginning in 2004 an optional benefit was added to the medicaid statute defining services to identify prevent and treat sickle cell disease and its complications this benefit includes primary and secondary medical strategies and treatments for persons with sickle cell disease who otherwise meet medicaid financial eligibility standards services include chronic blood transfusion to prevent stroke among those at high risk genetic counseling and testing for persons with the disease or sickle cell trait to facilitate treatment and prevention of symptoms and other care to prevent those who have experienced stroke from having additional strokes rule of construction in the law notes that addition of this new benefit does not imply that states could not have covered these services previously related administrative services including for example identification of eligibles and education about the disease and its complications are also covered in addition states are able to waive many of the basic benefits rules to provide special home and communitybased services for persons who are in need of long term care and to conduct demonstration projects that test alternative methods of meeting the overall purpose of the medicaid statute these waivers include home and communitybased services hcbs under the hcbs waiver authority states can provide special benefits tailored to meet the longterm care needs of targeted populations among the benefits offered under these programs are case management homemaker home health aide personal care adult day health habilitation respite care day treatment or other partial hospitalization services and psychosocial rehabilitation and clinic services for individuals with chronic mental illness states can also cover wide range of other medical nonmedical social and supportive services that allow persons who need longterm care to remain in the community for more information on hcbs waivers see the medicaid waiver programs subsection below section 1115 research and demonstration waivers states have great deal of flexibility to define benefits under section 1115 waivers many of the rules outlined above regarding benefits may be waived under comprehensive 1115 demonstrations states generally provide broad range of services statewide the bush administration has encouraged states to pursue targeted policies under three waiver initiatives all using section 1115 authority

individuals with disabilities24 under family planning waivers states are encouraged to provide only family planning services to certain individuals of childbearing age under specialty services and populations demonstrations states provide pharmacy benefits to those with hivaids and conduct cash and counseling projects that provide cash to enrollees who may then arrange and purchase certain services on their own for more information on research and demonstration waivers see the medicaid waiver programs subsection below tables 7 and 8 show recipients and expenditures25 by type of service for fy2002 the single benefit used by the largest number of medicaid recipients was prescription drugs used by 244 million recipients followed by physician services used by 221 million recipients26 nursing facility services accounted for the largest share of medicaid spending 184 followed by inpatient hospital services 136 prescription drugs and physician services while accounting for the largest number of users accounted for 133 and 39 of all spending on services respectively 24 the interaction between the drug coverage that will be available to individuals eligible for medicare and medicaid under the mma of 2003 and the drug coverage that is available to these individuals under pharmacy plus waivers has yet to be defined the mma of 2003 only requires the secretary to apply coordination requirements to certain prescription drug plans including those operating under waiver under section 1115 the aug 3 2004 proposed regulations clarify that drug coverage under pharmacy plus waiver programs will not be allowed to fill the gap in coverage in the part d prescription drug benefit however since the mma allows states to use state pharmaceutical assistance program spap funds to assist beneficiaries with outofpocket expenditures the proposed regulations suggest that pharmacy plus waivers will become obsolete in 2006 the proposed regulations assert that states would be better off using their current pharmacy plus spending toward spaps as they are allowed to wrap around the federal part d benefit 25 expenditures shown in table 8 are those reported by states through the medicaid statistical information system msis for fy2002 these data do not match fy2002 expenditures reported above in table 1 based on cms64 reports data reported on form cms64 have always varied from the msis reported totals because the cms64 reports are filed for financial accounting purposes they are generally considered to be more accurate accounting of total outlays and are preferred when examining state andor federal totals those data however do not allow for analysis of spending patterns and use of services for individuals or among groups of individuals for example by basis of eligibility for such analyses data from the msis are used figure 3 also uses msis data for this reason 26 capitated payment systems accounted for larger number of recipients than prescription

government helps states pay for medicaid services by means of variable matching formula called the federal medical assistance percentage fmap which is adjusted annually27 with specific exceptions described below the federal matching rate which is inversely related to states per capita income can range from 50 to 83 beginning in fy1998 the federal matching rate for the district of columbia increased to 70 and alaskas matching percentage for fy2001 through fy2005 was calculated using the threeyear average per capita income for the state divided by 105 federal matching for five territories is 50 with maximum dollar limit placed on the amount each territory can receive to provide fiscal relief to states federal matching rates for benefits were changed temporarily by the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act jgtrra pl 10827 which altered the rates for qualifying states28 for the last two quarters of fy2003 and the first three quarters of fy2004 for these quarters the federal matching percentage for each state is held harmless for declines from the prior fiscal year and then is increased by 295 percentage points the federal matching percentages for all states and jurisdictions for fy2003 through fy2006 are shown in table 9 mma 2003 includes provisions intended to continue after 2005 some state financing of outpatient prescription drugs for individuals dually eligible for medicare and medicaid even though medicare will be their primary source of drug coverage beginning in 2006 each state will be required to make monthly payment to the secretary of hhs equal to the product of the states share of 2003 medicaid per capita spending for drugs for all fullbenefit dual eligibles29 trended forward to the current year multiplied by the total number of such dual eligibles for such state for the month and multiplied again by the factor for the month the factor is 90 in 2006 and will phase down to 75 over 10 years the formula ensures that states continue to fund significant share of the cost of the new medicare drug benefit for those individuals who would have otherwise been eligible for medicaid prescription drugs states failure to make the required payments will result in interest charges and in an offset to amounts otherwise payable under medicaid 27 fmap is measure of the average per capita income in each state squared compared to

part states establish their own rates to pay medicaid providers for services by regulation these rates must be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that covered services will be available to medicaid beneficiaries at least to the extent they are available to the general population in geographic area the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 required that beginning october 1 1997 states must provide public notice of the proposed rates for hospitals nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded and the methods used to establish those rates all providers are required to accept payments under the program as payment in full for covered services except where states require nominal costsharing by beneficiaries states may generally impose such charges with certain exceptions they are precluded from imposing cost sharing on services for children under 18 services related to pregnancy family planning or emergency services and services provided to nursing facility residents who are required to spend all of their income for medical care except for personal needs allowance effective august 5 1997 states are permitted to pay medicaid rates instead of medicare rates to providers for services to dual eligibles those medicare beneficiaries who are also eligible for full medicaid benefits and qualified medicare beneficiaries qmbs see eligibility subsection effective in 2006 medicaid programs are prohibited from paying the cost sharing charges for medicare covered drugs under the mma 2003 prescription drug benefit certain types of providers are subject to special rules three such circumstances are discussed in detail below crs33 reimbursement for prescription drugs the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra 90 pl 101508 established rules for medicaid reimbursement of prescription drugs medicaid payments for drugs are subject to upper payment limits for drugs with generic versions available from three or more manufacturers the upper payment limit is 150 of the average wholesale price for other drugs the upper payment limit is either the estimated price paid by the provider for the drug plus dispensing fee or the providers usual charge for the drug to the general public in addition drug manufacturers participating in the medicaid program must provide rebates to states rebates intended to ensure that states pay the best price for medicaid pharmaceuticals vary depending upon whether the drug is available from multiple sources generic version of the drug is available or available from single source generic version of the drug is not available the rebate for drugs ranges from 11 to 151 of the average manufacturer price disproportionate share hospital payments states must provide for additional payments to hospitals serving disproportionate share of lowincome patients medicaid disproportionate share hospital dsh payments must follow formula that considers hospitals charity patients as well as its medicaid caseload beginning in fy1992 state dsh payments were limited as part of an effort to rein in fast growth dsh payments were limited to 12 of total medicaid spending the 12 figure was phased in through the use of statespecific dsh allotments caps on federal matching payments for each federal fiscal year bba 97 lowered the dsh allotments by imposing freeze and making graduated proportional reductions for 19982002 mma 2003 included special rule for calculating dsh allotments for certain years under the new law dsh allotments to states for fy2004 and for certain subsequent fiscal years are increased by 16 over the amounts authorized under prior law thereafter annual dsh allotments for state equal the allotment for the preceding fiscal year increased by the percentage change in the medical care component of the consumer price index for all urban consumers other ceilings as well as floor are imposed on dsh allotments they include cap on dsh payments to institutions for mental disease and other mental health facilities and cap on dsh payments to specific hospitals equal to percentage of each hospitals uncompensated care costs this hospital specific cap for all public hospitals in the nation for twoyear period beginning in state fy2003 is equal to 175 of uncompensated care costs for private hospitals the ceiling is at 100 of uncompensated care costs finally certain low dsh states are guaranteed floor on their dsh allotments under mma 2003 states in which total dsh payments for fy2000 are less than 3 of the states total medicaid spending on benefits allotments for fy2004 through fy2008 will be equal to 16 above the prior year amounts for fy2009 forward as for all other states the allotment for low dsh states for each year equals the prior year amount increased by inflation crs34 upper payment limits for certain institutional providers in 1987 the secretary of hhs issued regulations establishing separate upper payment limits for inpatient and outpatient services provided by different types of facilities an aggregate upper payment limit was established for each type of institutional provider of medicaid services by ownership state versus other that would not exceed what would have been paid for those services under medicare payment principles in 2000 the secretary determined that some states made arrangements with city or county facilities to pay these facilities at inflated rates the city or county facilities then transferred some or all of the enhanced payments back to the state bipa 2000 addressed these funding methods by requiring regulations to provide separate upper payment limits for private and nonstate public facilities up to 100 of the medicare rate for such services later through regulation the clinton administration allowed payments to city and county public hospitals up to 150 of the medicare rate for their services in january 2002 the bush administration changed the special rule for city and county hospitals to 100 of the medicare rate administration medicaid is stateadministered program at the federal level the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms of the us department of health and human services hhs is responsible for overseeing state operations federal law requires that single state agency be charged with administration of the medicaid program generally that agency is either the state welfare agency the state health agency or an umbrella human resources agency the single state agency may contract with other state entities to conduct some program functions further states may process claims for reimbursement themselves or contract with fiscal agents or health insuring agencies to process these claims the federal share of administrative costs is 50 for all states except for certain items for which the authorized rate is higher delivery systems there are two systems for delivering services under medicaid feeforservice and managed care these systems differ in how the state pays for the services it covers and how the individual accesses service providers most states use combination of both of these systems to deliver medicaid services the primary elements of these systems and initiatives to deliver longterm care services are discussed below feeforservice the feeforservice system has been the primary method of paying for and delivering medicaid services since the programs enactment in 1965 under feefor service medicaid beneficiary determines in consultation with physician the type crs35 of services needed and can receive those services from any medicaid participating provider states may limit the amount of services or require prior approval of services but the individual retains significant flexibility the provider receives payment from the state medicaid agency for that particular service based on rates established by the state states have significant flexibility in developing how payment rates are calculated and there is significant variation by state and by service for example the rate may be related to the actual cost of the service for an individual provider or could be fixed predetermined amount for particular procedure although enrollment in managed care has increased over the last decade the feeforservice system continues to be widespread and important service delivery mechanism the feeforservice system is used for individuals whose medicaid eligibility group or geographic location is not served through managed care or for persons who opt out when managed care is voluntary the feeforservice system is also used for those medicaid services not covered by managed care contract for individuals who live in rural areas and individuals who are elderly or have disability feeforservice continues to be the dominant delivery system states have tended to exclude these groups from managed care programs individuals in rural areas often have limited choice of managed care plans and service providers individuals who are elderly or who have disability often have complex medical conditions which can be costly and require specialty care and their health status can be unpredictable though individuals who are elderly or who have disability tend to be excluded states have started to develop managed care approaches for these groups to contain cost and test alternative delivery systems as discussed below under primarily feeforservice system state medicaid expenditures and the number of enrollees has increased significantly over the 10year period between 1985 and 1995 state medicaid expenditures increased from 182 billion to 673 billion an average growth rate of 14 annually this increase primarily reflected increases in medical costs and increases in the number of medicaid enrollees among other causes between 1985 and 1995 the number of medicaid enrollees increased 66 from 218 million to 362 million during that period states also lacked coordinated system for delivering services one was designated to assist the individual in sorting through his or her health care options or ensuring timely access to appropriate services in an effort to slow the growth of expenditures and improve service delivery many states turned to managed care for many of their enrollees managed care the number of medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plan of any type increased from 95 of the medicaid population in 1991 to 591 in 2003 as of june 30 2003 253 million individuals receiving medicaid were enrolled in some form of managed care alaska mississippi and wyoming were the only states that did not use managed care to deliver services to medicaid beneficiaries under managed care the state contracts with plans to provide an agreed upon set of benefits the contract could include comprehensive set of services or include only one service for example case management for each managed care contract the state establishes fixed prospective monthly perperson payment rates referred crs36 to as capitation payment for the covered services the capitation rate is based on the average cost of services for defined group after determining the average cost states may use variety of actuarial methods to adjust the average cost for specific individuals by age geographic location andor diagnosis for example state may establish different rates for men and women and different rates for specific age brackets the plan would receive the rate associated with the individual enrolled based on that persons gender and age the capitation payment does not vary on monthly basis if the volume of services actually used by the individual differs from that assumed in the capitation payment the plan also negotiates payment rates with participating providers in contrast under feeforservice the state establishes the provider payment rates as described earlier the goal of managed care is to reduce unnecessary service use improve access to quality health care by having central point of contact and increase care coordination thereby reducing expenditures types of managed care managed care plans vary in the financial responsibility or risk the plan assumes and the services they provide in risk based managed care contract the plan is fiscally responsible for the provision of all services agreed upon in the contract regardless of actual use by beneficiaries under nonrisk based contract states either implement processes to share the financial burden with the plan or the state assumes full financial responsibility for the services provided for example in nonrisk based contract at the end of the fiscal period state may modify the payments to managed care plan if actual service use differs from projected use upon which the original capitation payment was based there is also significant variation in the amount and types of services that each state includes in its medicaid managed care contracts some states contract with plan for limited benefit package such as case management dental or mental health services other states have included comprehensive30 set of services the primary types of medicaid managed care arrangements are described below managed care organization mco under managed care organization such as health maintenance organization or hmo the entity has comprehensive riskbased contract with the state the state pays the organization fixed prospective per person per month rate for providing medical care for all plan enrollees prepaid health plan php prepaid health plans refer to risk based contracts that include less than comprehensive set of services such as only behavioral health services or nonrisk based contracts for any package of services essentially such plans do not have riskbased contract with the state for comprehensive set of services 30 the law considers service package to be comprehensive if it includes inpatient hospital services and any of the following services or any three or more of the following services 1 outpatient hospital services 2 rural health clinic services 3 federally qualified health center fqhc services 4 other laboratory and xray services 5 nursing facility service 6 early and periodic screening diagnostic and treatment epsdt services 7 family planning services 8 physician services or 9 home health services crs37 primary care case management pccm under pccm model providers receive per person monthly fee for coordinating each enrollees care the provider is not fiscally responsible for the services used by the individual all services are provided through the feeforservice delivery system the pccm must be physician or licensed health care professional this provider acts as care coordinator andor gatekeeper to the services specified under the pccm contract there are also several hybrids of the mco php and pccm models most states have implemented multiple models for example state may have an mco for children and families enrolled in medicaid and php for mental health services for individuals with relevant disability as of june 30 2003 47 states and the district of columbia were using some form of medicaid managed care 44 states had riskbased plans31 and 29 states had nonrisk pccm plans32 as discussed earlier managed care has primarily included lowincome adults and children as shown in table 10 based on the most recent data available of the 213 million medicaid recipients enrolled in managed care organization or prepaid health plan in fy2000 78 were lowincome adults and children 18 were individuals with disabilities and the elderly and 5 had an unknown basis

httpwwwcmshhsgovmedicaidmanagedcaremctype02pdf show that arkansas and georgia had capitated mco or php programs during fy2002 trends in managed care in the early and mid1990s states significantly expanded enrollment in medicaid managed care programs but this growth is slowing in fy2002 and fy2003 the number of individuals enrolled in managed care plan as percentage of all medicaid eligible individuals increased 13 and 26 respectively this is significant decrease over the 611 and 384 annual growth rates of fy1994 and fy1995 respectively the expansion of medicaid managed care in the early and mid1990s should be viewed in the context of general trend toward managed care across many sectors of the us health care system despite the significant growth of managed care both in medicaid and the overall health care system the extent to which it has accomplished the goal of controlling health care expenditures and increasing quality has been inconclusive crs42 finally in both medicaid and the us health care system in general managed care continues to evolve some of these changes include plans entering and exiting certain geographic locations and company consolidations and bankruptcies in general medicaid beneficiaries in managed care have been increasingly enrolled in plans that are only serving medicaid beneficiaries from june 30 1998 through june 30 2003 the number of commercial managed care plans providing services to medicaid beneficiaries declined an average of 10 per year35 as comparison the number of managed care plans serving only medicaid beneficiaries declined 2 per year over the same time period36 this evolution of the managed care market is not necessarily negative if it strengthens the overall delivery system but it may result in decreased continuity of services and additional administrative costs if beneficiaries must switch providers or reenroll in different plan longterm care delivery system longterm care refers to wide range of supportive and health services for persons who have lost the capacity for selfcare due to illness frailty or disabling condition it differs from acute care in that the goal of longterm care is not to cure an illness that is generally of short duration but to allow an individual to attain and maintain an optimal level of functioning over the longterm since the establishment of the medicaid program in 1965 longterm care services ie nursing home and home care have been delivered largely through the feeforservice delivery system 1981 amendment to the medicaid statute established section 1915c waivers giving states the option of providing home and communitybased services to individuals who would otherwise be eligible for institutional care many states arrange for these services to be delivered on feefor service basis often using case managers to determine service needs and authorize delivery concerns about uncoordinated longterm and acute care inefficiencies in disease management for persons with multiple chronic conditions and growing costs however have encouraged federal and some state governments to develop alternative systems to pay for and deliver longterm care services in recent years many of the alternative delivery systems that states and the federal government have developed coordinate longterm care services for dual eligibles persons who are eligible for both medicaid and medicare through managed care programs one example is the program for allinclusive care for the elderly pace originally modeled after the on lok senior health services pilot project in san francisco pace makes available all services covered under both programs without amount duration or scope limitations and without application of any deductibles copayments or other cost sharing under the program certain low income individuals age 55 and older who would otherwise require nursing home care receive all health medical and social services they need an interdisciplinary team of physicians nurses physical therapists social workers and other 35 commercial managed care plan may provide services to individuals who have private health insurance medicare beneficiaries andor medicaid beneficiaries 36 cms medicaid managed care enrollment statistics 1998 through 2003 see httpwwwcmshhsgovmedicaidmanagedcareenrolstatsasp for additional information crs43 professionals develop and monitor care plans for enrollees monthly capitated payments are made to providers from both the medicare and medicaid programs as specified in medicare and medicaid statutes the amount of these payments from both programs must be less than what would have otherwise been paid for comparable frail population not enrolled in the pace program payments are also adjusted to account for the comparative frailty of pace enrollees pace providers assume the risk for expenditures that exceed the revenue from the capitation payments the balanced budget act of 1997 made pace permanent benefit category under medicare and state plan optional benefit under medicaid as of february 2005 there were 32 pace sites across 18 states other examples of state initiatives to provide coordinated longterm care services include the minnesota senior health options msho the wisconsin partnership program and the continuing care network ccn demonstration of monroe county new york the msho program combines medicare and medicaid financing to integrate acute and longterm care services for dually eligible seniors residing in seven counties in minnesota the program consolidates all medicare and medicaid managed care requirements into single contract overseen by the state allowing msho to reduce duplication and resolve important differences across medicare and medicaid delivery systems like pace the wisconsin partnership program pays capitated payments to providers to coordinate acute and longterm care services for persons who would otherwise qualify for nursing home care it also places strong emphasis on services provided in home and community settings this program however was designed specifically to serve rural areas new yorks ccn project enrolls at least 10000 elderly beneficiaries including 1500 who had been certified for care in nursing facility to participate enrollees must be age 65 or over eligible for medicare andor medicaid and reside in the programs service area capitation payments made to ccn are intended to cover all of medicares acute care services for this population and most of medicaids longterm care services medicaid prescription drug coverage for example is paid separately on feefor service basis states have also experimented with other initiatives that capitate payments for acute and longterm care services under the medicaid program only examples of these demonstrations include the nations only statewide mandatory medicaid managed care program the arizona longterm care system altcs and small voluntary programs such as floridas communitybased diversion pilot project floridas diversion program serves selected metropolitan areas and counties case managers employed through both of these programs arrange medicaid long term care services and coordinate with medicare providers to deliver acute care services all of these programs were designed with the expectation that they would control costs and reduce administrative complexity they also intend to delay institutionalization and thus incur savings for medicaid through the provision of expanded home and communitybased care options and in some cases greater beneficiary control over services those programs that also capitate medicare are intended to reduce hospitalization and skilled nursing facility expenditures as well as other acute care costs associated with institutional care while these initiatives crs44 exist in number of states they account for relatively small share of total medicaid spending for longterm care medicaid waiver programs under current law states have the flexibility to waive certain medicaid program requirements to provide services to individuals not traditionally eligible for medicaid limit benefit packages for certain groups and provide home and communitybased services to people with longterm care needs among other purposes states must submit proposals outlining terms and conditions for proposed waivers to cms for approval before implementing these programs the two primary provisions of the social security act used today that authorize states to implement waiver programs are section 1115 and section 1915c in recent years there has been increased interest among states in demonstration programs as means to restructure medicaid coverage control costs and increase flexibility whether large or small reforms the waiver programs have resulted in significant changes for medicaid beneficiaries nationwide section 1115 waiver demonstration programs section 1115 of the social security act provides the secretary of health and human services hhs with broad authority to waive certain statutory requirements in the medicaid program allowing states to conduct research and demonstration programs to further the goals of title xix37 under section 1115 the secretary may waive medicaid requirements contained in section 1902 known as freedom of choice of provider comparability and statewideness see benefits subsection for discussion of these requirements states often use section 1115 waivers to offer different service packages or combination of services in different parts of the state test new reimbursement methods change eligibility criteria in order to offer coverage to new or expanded groups cover nonmedicaid services eg cash and counseling demonstrations38 or contract with greater variety of managed care plans demonstration programs 37 section 1115 also authorizes the secretary to conduct research and demonstration projects under several other programs authorized in the social security act including tanf ssi and schip 38 cash and counseling demonstrations are designed to test consumerdirected approach to the financing and delivery of personal attendant services eg assistance with activities of daily living such as eating bathing toileting transport from bed to chair etc for elderly and disabled individuals these demonstrations provide cash payments to enrollees so that they may directly arrange and purchase services that best meet their needs states must submit section 1115 waiver for cash and counseling demonstration if cash is provided directly to an individual cash is used to pay legally responsible relative eg spouses or parents the state intends to change medicaid eligibility requirements andor the state intends to waive the requirement to pay only those agencies that have provider agreements with the state crs45 are generally approved for fiveyear period however cms has granted program extensions for many of the comprehensive waiver programs ie programs that generally offer statewide comprehensive service package to populations traditionally eligible for medicaid as well as expansion populations some of these extensions have allowed section 1115 waiver programs to remain in operation for 10 or more years for example arizonas entire medicaid program operates under the section 1115 waiver authority and this program is in its 22th year while section 1115 is explicit about provisions in medicaid law that may be waived in conducting research and demonstration projects number of other provisions in medicaid law and regulations specify limitations or restrictions on how state may operate waiver program for example one provision restricts states from establishing waivers that fail to provide all mandatory services to the mandatory povertyrelated groups of pregnant women and children another provision specifies restrictions on costsharing imposed under demonstration waivers financing approved section 1115 waivers are deemed to be part of medicaid state plan and are financed through federal and state matching funds at the regular fmap rate however unlike regular medicaid costs associated with waiver programs must be budget neutral to the federal government over the life of the waiver program to meet the budget neutrality test estimated spending under the waiver cannot exceed the estimated cost of the states existing medicaid program under current law program requirements39 for example costs associated with an expanded population eg those not already covered under the states medicaid program must be offset by reductions elsewhere within the medicaid program several methods used by states to generate cost savings for the waiver component include 1 moving part of the medicaid population into managed care 2 limiting benefit packages for certain eligibility groups 3 providing targeted services to certain individuals so as to divert them from full medicaid coverage and 4 using enrollment caps and costsharing to reduce the amounts states must pay program types cms classifies section 1115 waiver programs into five distinct categories they are comprehensive demonstrations these demonstrations provide broad range of services that are generally offered statewide as of january 2003 there were 19 operational ie approved and implemented medicaid comprehensive state reform waivers40 fy2003 statereported enrollment estimates for the comprehensive 39 current law program requirements may include hypothetical program expansions allowable under current law eg groups of eligibles services or payments which could have been but were not previously covered or provided as well as program terminations eg the elimination of the states medically needy program 40 states with comprehensive demonstration waivers include arizona arkansas california angeles county delaware district of columbia hawaii kentucky maryland massachusetts minnesota missouri new york oklahoma oregon rhode island tennessee utah vermont and wisconsin crs46 demonstration waivers totaled approximately 70 million41 and federal expenditures for these programs were approximately 195 billion42 family planning demonstrations these demonstrations provide family planning services for certain individuals of childbearing age in 17 states43 for the family planning demonstrations fy2003 enrollment counts totaled 21 million and federal expenditures were approximately 426 million44 specialty services and population demonstrations these demonstrations generally include programs that provide cash to enrollees so that they may directly arrange and purchase services that best meet their needs in addition they also include waivers to provide pharmacy benefits to persons with specific conditions such as hivaids in fy2003 there were 11 such operational programs in eight states45 these demonstrations covered just under 8000 individuals at federal cost of approximately 99 million46 the health insurance flexibility and accountability initiative hifa these demonstrations are designed to encourage states to extend medicaid and schip to the uninsured with particular emphasis on statewide approaches that maximize private health insurance coverage options and target populations with incomes below 200 fpl as of january 2003 there were seven medicaid 41 californias section 1115 waiver program ie angeles county uses demonstration authority to provide financial support to continue county delivery system restructuring efforts because of the nature of the demonstration project california does not submit enrollment estimates to cms in states where multiple demonstration

expenditure data show that these demonstrations covered just over 180000 individuals at federal cost of approximately 988 million48 pharmacy plus demonstrations these demonstrations provide comprehensive pharmacy benefits for lowincome seniors and individuals with disabilities with income at or below 200 fpl the demonstrations may provide pharmaceutical products assist individuals who have private pharmacy coverage with high premiums and cost sharing or provide wraparound pharmaceutical coverage to bring private sources of pharmacy coverage up to the level of desired demonstration benefit coverage enrollees will not be eligible for the comprehensive medicaid benefits available under the states medicaid plan in fy2003 there were six approved pharmacy plus waivers49 enrollment counts totaled approximately 309000 at federal cost of approximately 11 billion50 section 1915c home and communitybased waiver programs in 1981 congress added section 1915c to the medicaid statute section 1915c authorizes the secretary of hhs to waive certain requirements51 of medicaid law to allow states to cover range of home and communitybased services for persons who would otherwise be eligible for medicaidfunded institutional care the 1915c waivers often referred to as home and communitybased services hcbs waivers were designed to reduce the institutional bias in the medicaid program that made it easier for persons to qualify for medicaid coverage of institutional care than for care in the home or in the community 47 states with approved medicaid or medicaidschip combined

waive statewideness and comparability and may apply certain institutional eligibility rules to persons in home and communitybased waivers crs48 the waivers allow states to cover broad range of medical and nonmedical social services to enable people with chronic longterm care needs to remain in the community unlike the budget neutrality test required for section 1115 waivers where estimated spending under the waiver cannot exceed the estimated costs of the states existing medicaid program the costeffectiveness test under 1915c prohibits expenditures from exceeding the cost of institutional care that would have been provided to waiver recipients absent the waiver52 to assist states in containing costs section 1915c allows states to place caps on the total number of individuals that may be covered under each waiver andor set expenditure restrictions on per capita basis eg not to exceed 20000 per year per waiver recipient or on an aggregate basis eg cost cap applied to all persons under waiver in the state medicaid regulations require that waiver participants fall into one of the following target groups the aged persons with physical disabilities persons with mental retardation or developmental disabilities mrdd and persons with mental illness generally states must apply for separate waivers to serve these different groups section 1915c also gives states the flexibility to define the categories of individuals within these broader target groups who may be eligible for certain waivers and the services they will receive states may also limit eligibility for services to individuals who have certain conditions such as hivaids further eligibility is limited to individuals who would otherwise be eligible for institutional care provided in hospital nursing facility or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded icfmr there are federal requirements that describe the level and or severity of functional limitations that individuals must have to be admitted to an institutional setting and thus be eligible for 1915c waiver although states generally determine eligibility for longterm care services based on test of applicants functional limitations for most waiver programs the design of these tests varies across states but often includes tests to determine an applicants limitations in ability to carry out activities of daily living adls and instrumental activities of daily living iadls53 although these programs are optional all states provide some hcbs waiver services to certain medicaid enrollees with longterm care needs as of june 2003 cms reported that 275 programs were in operation across the country in fy2002 the most recent year for which data are available 1915c waivers served 874520 individuals the most recent expenditure data from fy2003 showed that total medicaid spending on 1915c waivers reached 186 billion versus 112 billion in fy1999 52 section 1915c waivers are prohibited from covering expenses for room and board while such costs would be covered by medicaid in an institutional setting 53 adls refer to activities necessary to carry out basic human functions and include the following bathing dressing eating mobility inside the home toileting and transferring from bed to chair iadls refer to tasks necessary for independent community living and include the following shopping light housework telephoning money management and meal preparation crs49 the cost of providing waiver services to recipients varies across target populations see figure 4 spending on waivers for persons with mrdd for example totaled 14 billion in

new cash welfare block grant to states temporary assistance for needy families tanf is established the automatic link between afdc and medicaid is severed families who meet afdc eligibility criteria as of july 16 1996 are eligible for medicaid even if they do not qualify for tanf states must use the same income and resource standards and other rules previously used to determine eligibility including the prereform afdc family composition requirement state may lower its income standard but not below the standard it applied on may 1 1988 state may increase its income and resource standards up to the percentage increase in the consumer price index cpi subsequent to july 16 1996 states may use less restrictive methods for counting income and resources than were required by law as in effect on july 16 1996 states are permitted to deny medicaid benefits to adults and heads of households who lose tanf benefits because of refusal to work states may not apply this requirement to povertyrelated pregnant women and children disabled children the definition of disability used to establish the eligibility of children for ssi is narrowed children who lose ssi eligibility may still be eligible for medicaid if they meet other medicaid eligibility criteria states are required to perform redetermination of medicaid eligibility in any case in which an individual loses ssi and that determination affects his or her medicaid eligibility aliens legal resident aliens and other qualified aliens who entered the united states on or after august 22 1996 are barred from medicaid for five

august 22 1996 and coverage after the fiveyear ban are state options administration state may use the same application form for medicaid as they use for tanf state may choose to administer the medicaid program through the same agency that administers tanf or through separate medicaid agency special fund of 500 million is provided for enhanced federal matching for states expenditures attributable to the administrative costs of medicaid eligibility determinations due to the law balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 eligibility the balanced budget act restores medicaid eligibility and ssi coverage for legal immigrants who entered the country prior to august 22 1996 and later become disabled guarantees continued medicaid eligibility for children with disabilities who are expected to lose their ssi eligibility as the result of restrictions enacted in 1996 and extends the period that states must provide coverage to refugees asylees and individuals whose deportation has been withheld from five to seven years states are permitted to provide continuous medicaid coverage for 12 months to all children regardless of whether they continue to meet income eligibility tests states are permitted to create new medicaid eligibility category for working persons with disabilities with income up to 250 of poverty and who would but for income be eligible for ssi such individuals can buy into medicaid by paying sliding scale premium based on the individuals income as determined by the state payment methodology the law repeals the boren amendment which directed that payment rates to institutional providers be reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of efficiently and economically operated facilities and repeals the law requiring states to assure adequate payment levels for services provided by obstetricians and pediatricians the requirement to pay federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics 100 of reasonable costs is phased out over
