referred to as the gephardt rule named after its author former representative richard gephardt the rule which was established by pl 9678 and first applied in calendar year 1980 provides for the automatic engrossment and transmittal to the senate of joint resolution changing the public debt limit upon the adoption by congress of the budget resolution thereby avoiding separate vote in the house on the public debtlimit legislation the senate has comparable procedure if it chooses to consider housepassed joint resolution it does so under the regular legislative process the house also may

publicdebt limit changes enacted into law during the period 1980 to the present 28 were enacted without resorting to the gephardt rule in 11 of the 29 years since the gephardt rule was established the rule did not apply due to its suspension or repeal by the house calendar years 1988 19901991 19941997 and 19992002 in most cases the house suspended the rule because legislation changing the statutory limit was not necessary at the time the existing public debt limit was expected to be sufficient during the remaining 18 years when the rule was in effect the house originated 19 joint resolutions under this procedure 14 were signed into law the first seven of these 18 joint resolutions were generated under the gephardt rule in its original form the rule was modified in 1983 the current rule is substantively the same as the 1983 form of the rule the subsequent 12 joint resolutions were generated under this modified language in three years calendar years 1998 2004 and 2006 the house and senate did not agree to conference report on the budget resolution and therefore the automatic engrossment process under the gephardt rule was not utilized the senate passed 15 of the 19 joint resolutions automatically engrossed pursuant to the gephardt rule passing 10 without amendment and five with amendments only one of these 15 joint resolutions was not signed into law of the remaining

congress of the budget resolution thereby avoiding separate vote in the house on the public debt limit legislation the senate has comparable procedure if it chooses to consider housepassed joint

crs2 legislative history of the gephardt rule the gephardt rule initially codified as rule xlix of the standing rules of the house of representatives was established by pl 9678 93 stat 589591 an act to provide for temporary increase in the public debt limit the house adopted the legislation hr 5369 by vote of 219198 on september 26 19793 during consideration of the measure representative gephardt explained that the purpose of the new house rule was to place the consideration of the public debt limit within the context of the overall budget policies contained in the annual budget resolution in addition it was intended to reduce the amount of time spent and the number of votes in the house and in committees on the issue of raising the public debt limit one of the aggregate figures required to be included in the annual budget resolution is the appropriate level of the public debt as the budget resolution has evolved over time from singleyear time frame to multiyear time frame the budget resolution has gone from including debtlimit level for only one fiscal year to including debtlimit levels for each fiscal year over multiyear period because budget resolution does not become law it is necessary to enact legislation in order to implement budget resolution policies regarding debtlimit adjustments the gephardt rule enables the house to combine the finalization of the budget resolution and the initiation of debtlimit legislation into single step representative gephardt stated that the new automatic engrossment process puts the consideration of the appropriate level for the debt ceiling where it legitimately and logically belongs that is in the context of when we vote for the spending that creates the need to change the debt ceiling4 in its original form the rule required the engrossment of joint resolution changing the temporary public debt limit in 1983 the existing separate temporary and permanent statutory limits on the public debt were combined into one permanent statutory limit pl 9834 subsequently the house amended the gephardt rule to reflect this change by agreeing to hres 241 98th congress by voice vote on june 23 19835 under the modified rule the automatically engrossed joint resolution would contain change to the permanent statutory limit in addition to this modification the rules change also provided that where budget resolution contains more than one public debt limit figure for the current and the next fiscal year only 3 for the consideration in the house see congressional record vol 125 september 26 1979 pp 2633726350 the senate passed hr 5369 by vote of 4929 on september 28 1979 for the consideration in the senate see congressional record vol 125 september 28 1979 pp 2666926691 the president signed the legislation into law

limit figure for the current fiscal year with time limitation and the debt limit figure for the following fiscal year as the permanent limit6 during consideration of hres 241 representative butler c derrick explained the limitation of single joint resolution by stating that the committee on rules believes that it is unnecessary and confusing to have single concurrent resolution on the budget trigger the engrossment and passage of two separate joint resolutions to increase or decrease the public debt limit7 at the beginning of the 106th congress the house recodified the rule as house rule xxiii certain language was deleted and modified from the existing rule but the revisions were intended to continue the automatic engrossment process without substantive change8 the house repealed the rule at the beginning of the 107th congress9 on the opening day of the 108th congress the house reinstated this automatic engrossing process as new rule rule xxvii10 the current rule contains the exact language as rule xxiii of the 106th congress current features of the gephardt rule house rule xxvii requires that the house clerk automatically engross and transmit to the senate upon the adoption of the budget resolution joint resolution changing the public debt limit to the level specified in the budget resolution the rule stipulates that the joint resolution is deemed to have passed the house by the same vote as the conference report on the budget resolution under clause 2 of the current rule if an adopted concurrent resolution under clause 1 sets forth different appropriate levels of the public debt for separate periods only one engrossed joint resolution 6 us congress constitution jeffersons manual and rules of the house of representatives of the united states one

requires the house budget committee and the conference committee on the budget resolution to issue clear statement regarding the impact of the automatically engrossed joint resolution on the public

to accompany such concurrent resolution each shall contain clear statement of the effect the eventual enactment of joint resolution engrossed under this rule would have on the statutory limit on the public debt the full text of the gephardt rule in its current form is provided in the appendix implementation of the gephardt rule table 1 provides information on the joint resolutions changing the public debt limit that were engrossed and deemed passed by the house pursuant to the gephardt rule during calendar years 19802008 in 11 of the 29 years since the gephardt rule was first established the rule did not apply due to its suspension or repeal by the house calendar years 1988 1990 1991 19941997 and 1999200212 in most cases the house suspended the rule because legislation changing the statutory limit was not necessary at the time the existing public debt limit was expected to be sufficient in three cases the house passed or was expected to pass separate legislation to increase the statutory limit as noted above the rule was repealed at the beginning of the 107th congress and therefore did not apply in 2001 and 2002 during the remaining 18 years when the rule was in effect the house originated 19 joint resolutions under this procedure the first seven of these 18 joint resolutions were generated under the gephardt rule in its original form as mentioned above the rule was modified in 1983 the current rule is substantively the same as this 1983 form of the rule the subsequent 12 joint resolutions were generated under this modified language in three years calendar years 1998 2004 and 2006 while the rule was in effect the house and senate did not agree to conference report on the budget resolution and therefore the automatic engrossment process under the gephardt rule was not utilized 11 for recent example of such statement see us congress committee of conference concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008 conference report to accompany sconres 21 110th cong 1st sess hrept 110153 washington gpo 2007 p 133 12 for each of these cases brief explanation regarding the rules suspension is provided in the notes at the end of table 1 crs5 as table 1 shows although budget resolutions adopted during this period contained debt limit amounts for between three and 11 different fiscal years as the time frame of each budget resolution dictated the joint resolutions automatically engrossed under the gephardt rule contained debt limit amounts for only one or two fiscal years depending on the requirements of the rule at the time as noted above the 1983 modification provided that the automatically engrossed joint resolution could include multiple debtlimit increases one temporary and another permanent the first three of the 11 joint resolutions automatically engrossed pursuant to this modified version of the rule contained two different public debt limits and the other eight contained single public debt limit the senate passed 15 of the 19 joint resolutions automatically engrossed pursuant to the gephardt rule passing 10 without amendment and five with amendments only one of these 15 joint resolutions was not signed into law13 of the remaining four joint resolutions the senate began consideration on one but came to resolution on it took action on two and has not taken action on the most recent one hjres 92 110th congress of the 19 joint resolutions originated by the house under the gephardt rule 14 were enacted into law14 13 specifically during the second session of the 99th congress the senate passed as amended the joint
