trade and dev elopment information and communications technology management ae200534001 executive summary during the second quarter of 2005 oios conducted n audit of unctads information and communications technology management function the audit did not reveal major weaknesses however number of measures need to be taken to strengthen the governance structure over unctads verall ict operations and to bring these in line with the policies of the united nations secret ariat unctad has accepted all of the recommendations and has initiated their implementat ion information technology support its within the div ision of management mainly handles operational matters and some aspects of security unctads four substantive divisions operate specific systems that are critical to their program mes of work these systems are maintained and run independently of unctads its an it board has only met twice during the past two years and has largely been ineffective furthermore the re is suitably qualified senior official to oversee ict policy matters and see that these are i mplemented unctad should set up an ict committee in compliance with stsgb200317 and should assign the functions of chief information officer to sen ior official the committee would oversee all major decisions related to software applications d efine system and data ownership and monitor it related matters the official assigned cio functio ns would report to the committee and be responsible for all of unctads ict strategic plann ing coordination and policy implementation oios is pleased to note that unctad is taking immed iate steps to strengthen its ict governance through the implementation of these recommendations oios would like to draw managements attention to t he fact that systems development and other ict activities undertaken by entities which form pa rt of the secretariat will need to comply with standards and procedures set out by the ict bo ard irrespective of the source of funding another critical action required of management is t he implementation of formal ict strategy covering all aspects of ict within unctad and suppo rting the entitys mandates the strategy should also reflect the global ict policies of the secretariat unctad has taken the first steps towards the implementation of this recommenda tion and is in the process of discussing an ict strategy document drafted by the chief its t he timing and details of implementation of number of recommendations made in this report will be linked to the ict strategy document changes to existing its staff resources will depend on whether the ict strategy will indicate the need to set up systems development function oio s is of the opinion that unctad should first make every attempt to use applications and services that are already available through entities such as the information technology service division its d at headquarters and unogs information and communication technology service nd to rationalize certain services as it is planning to do with the help desk function oios s ees the introduction of individual work plans and time records as useful tool for analyzing the adequacy of resources to carry out the tasks set out in the ict strategy unctad does not have complete inventory of its ic t equipment application software and databases such list is necessary for planning purposes and to safeguard the entitys assets oios came across system that was purchased from minor supplier and over which there are guarantees of continued support such systems shoul d be covered by an escrow agreement guaranteeing unctad access to the source code if th supplier terminates system support management has taken steps to address the shortcomi ng and will avoid recurrence the nature and scope of services that its is respon sible to provide to users are not defined these services should be set out in service level agreeme nts oios is also recommending the setting out of policies and criteria for the replacement of ict equipment formal process to evaluate requests for modifications to systems and the introduction of an online system for users to log their requests for computer equipment the introduction of these measures should improve the level of ict services to the user community and generate mor accountability and transparency unctad does not have formal policy covering all spects of it security including the granting and administering of access rights and oios is recomme nding the implementation of such policy the network administrator is not always informed of ter minated employees and consultants in order to close their email account and these accounts may still be accessed remotely via the internet oios is recommending that human resources management sectio n is assigned responsibility to inform its of all terminating employees and consultants unctad is also being asked to evaluate the option of mail encryption and the introduction of measures th at would provide tighter security over remote access management is proposing to request the united natio ns international computing centre to carry out security policy assessment followed by the setting up of it security policies oios is recommending that its coordinate with itsd to implement as soon as possible the global it physical security policies management should lso assess the risk of the computer rooms current location which is directly above the palet bar and the absence of fireproof safe and take appropriate action there are detailed pla ns to ensure that in the event of major disaster unctads critical operational functions are properl recovered and become operational within acceptable timescales oios is recommending that u nctad request the assistance of itsd to perform an ict security risk assessment and seek to benefit from the work already undertaken by itsd in relation to business continuity planning management is in the process of evaluating the risks and the best options for the implementation f the recommended actions oios believes that the implementation of the recomm endations set out in its report would bring the management of ict more in line with best practi ce and would demonstrate managements commitment to ensuring proper control september 2005 table of contents chapter paragraphs i ii iii introduction audit objectives audit scope and methodology

introduction 1 during the second quarter of 2005 oios conducted an audit of information and communications technology management within the uni ted nations conference on trade and development the audit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 the unctad secretariat has around 400 staff memb ers and is divided into five divisions of which four are focused on the substan tive research and technical assistance work of the secretariat while the fifth the division of m anagement includes the resources management service the technical cooperation service and the intergovernmental affairs and outreach service in addition special programme is dedic ated to dealing with issues affecting the least developed countries the chief information technol ogy support reports to the chief resource management service within the division of managemen t 3 the findings and recommendations contained in th is report have been discussed during the exit conference held on 8 july 2005 with the director executive direction and management the programme management officer execu tive direction and management and the chief its draft of this report was communi cated to the director executive direction and management on 8 august 2005 comments received on 2 september 2005 are reflected in the report in italics ii audit objectives 4 the main objectives of the audit were to assess unctads governance and organisational s tructure with respect to ict b determine what is required for the development of unctads strategic plan for ict c assess unctads practices and plans for ict aga inst the global ict strategy of the secretariat and d identify areas of ict that require the attentio n of unctads management to bring them in line with best practice iii audit scope and methodology 5 the four substantive divisions within unctad hav significant ict responsibilities independently of its and develop implement and ma intain their own application systems in addition several databases applications and web s ites are designed and maintained by substantive divisions and such applications are cur rently not controlled by its 6 the review focused on the relevant areas of information technology contro ls that fall under unctad it did not examine the it controls ver individual application systems or the functionality aspects of such systems 7 oios sought to obtain an understanding of the co mputer environment at unctad organization systems and key performance indicato rs through the completion of questionnaire set of tailored audit programmes covering all the audit objectives was developed on the basis of the above and discussions with key personnel interviews were also held with selected managers staff from the substant ive divisions during the audit oios 2 analysed applicable data and reviewed the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations establishing governance structure for the unct ad ict function 1 setting up an effective governance body 8 in recent years the governance role for ict wit hin unctad has been assigned to the it board this board is composed of representatives f rom unctads division of management and the four substantive divisions it is schedule d to meet twice year but the last two meetings were held in autumn 2003 and autumn 2004 9 the lack of activity and participation within th it board was confirmed during our discussions with representatives from the substanti ve divisions as result the board failed to serve as an effective mechanism for bringing all of unctads divisions under common it policy 10 unctad forms part of the secretariat of the uni ted nations stsgb19975 and is therefore governed by the secretarygenerals bulle tin information and communications technology board stsgb200317 this bulletin calls for all departments and offices away from headquarters to establish information and comm unications technology committees stsgb200317 44 as first step towards establishing an effective g overnance structure covering all aspects of ict within the or ganization unctad should set up an ict committee with adequate representation from the use r community this committee would oversee all major decisions regarding new software applications define system and data ownership and monitor itrelated matters to see tha t they are in line with unctads ict strategy 11 having strong functioning ict committee and welldefined governance structure for the whole of the organizations ict would give unct ad stronger voice when dealing with the secretariats ict board recommendation head2right unctad should set up its ict committee in line with the requirements of section 44 of stsgb200317 the terms of reference of the committee should be approved by th secretary general of unctad rec 01 management response while revised tor for unctads it committee have be drafted and will be discussed at the next it board meeting the incoming secretarygeneral of unctad whose appointment commenced on 1 september will n eed to be seized of the matter consequently while these tor are in line with sts gb200317 and include functions as per stai200510 concerning ict initiatives they may r equire some amendment once the sg has reviewed them naturally on the understanding that any changes to them would be in line with these administrative provisions thus by way of xample the chair of the ict committee would 3 in all likelihood be the director division of mana gement see our comments on recommendation 2 below implementation september october 2005 oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending receipt of the ict committees terms of reference approved by unctads sg and minutes of the committees first meeting 2 chief information officer functions 12 an effective ict committee will be useful for c arrying out the governance function but such body usually meets few times year corp orations that have structure similar to that of unctad ie central administrative role and number of divisions providing specialized products or services to specific client base have adopted the cio function to achieve more effective governance structure 13 within the organization general assembly re solution 57304 4 requested the secretarygeneral inter alia to make proposals on how to reflect the functions of chief information and communication technology officer of the united nations in the organizational structure of the organization as suggested by the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions in response the secretariat stated that the project review committee of the ict board provides the head of the information technology services division as chair of this committee with strong central authority over in formation and communication technology initiatives in the global organization a587 anne x ix 14 in its report on the management of information systems in united nations organizations the joint inspection unit recommended that the exec utive heads appoint or designate senior official to serve as cio a5882 recommendation 2 depending on the size of the organization the cio or the official including th chief of an appropriate unit who has cio functions would report directly to the executive he ad or to the deputy executive head in charge of programmes the report also recommended that depending upon organizationspecific circumstances the cio functions could be performed by an appropriate unit or in the case of small organizations that cannot afford cio by senior official with organizationwide coordinating responsibilities as well as some it kn owledge 15 the designation or appointment of senior offi cial as cio was also recommended by the jiu to the united nations high commissioner for ref ugees a59394add1 19 recommendation 7d in 2004 unhcr recruited and appointed cio at the d2 level to perform the abovementioned functions 16 in the case of unctad its is not responsible f or the entire scope of it services provided by the organization to large extent it s has been carrying out support function and approving the purchases of computer hardware it h as control over systems that are developed implemented and maintained within the fr amework of technical cooperation projects and project managers have obligation to consult with or involve its consequently its is not in position for example to monitor the deve lopment of applications in the substantive divisions to see that this complies with the secret ariats global ict policies over systems 4 development and security standards this could res ult in lack of uniformity and compatibility between systems and potentially weak access securi ty from our discussions there also appears to be lack of coordination with regard to securit backup policies and recovery procedures with some divisions relying on its others having t heir own or combination of the two 17 application systems such as trains dmfas and sycuda on which the service provided by the respective substantive division is based are standalone systems in the sense that there is interfacing between theses systems or with core application systems such as imis and galaxy oios agrees that unctads divisio ns need to retain degree of autonomy in view of the specialized nature of their operatio ns and their need to address quickly requests from their clients however there would be sign ificant improvement in governance if certain functions that apply across unctad as whole are m anaged by one unit such as its which in turn would report directly to someone assigned the functions of cio this setup would have its advantages when it comes to planning and coordi nation would make it easier to ensure systems compatibility and standardization and make s compliance with secretariatwide policies more manageable 18 while it may not be feasible at this stage fo r unctad to establish fulltime post for cio the functions of this role should be defined nd assigned to suitablyqualified senior official in broad terms this official would coord inate the policy and direction for all ict matters and discuss these at the senior management level n amely the secretarygeneral deputy secretarygeneral and the directors of the divisio ns the other major benefit is that cio will be in position to identify areas where efficienci can be achieved this person would report to the ict committee list of specific responsibili ties that may be assigned to the cio function is attached at annex recommendation head2right unctad should assign the functions of chief information offic er cio to suitablyqualified senior official with responsibil ity for all its ict planning coordination and policy implementatio n and b define the ictrelated functions that fall unde r the responsibility of the cio and administered by infor mation technology support rec 02 management response the draft vacancy announcement for the position of director division of management which has been cleared by the incoming sg of unctad reflects this recommendation implementation january 2006 oios will keep this recommendation open pending the receipt of copy of the vacancy announcement and the new director for the division of managements terms of reference 5 b implementing an ict strategy for unctad 1 ict strategy 19 unctad does not have strategy for information technology systems that is approved at the highest level such plan is necessary to ens ure that the entity has the right systems to support its mandate and is able to provide the best service to its clients 20 the absence of comprehensive ict strategy tha t is linked to management strategy and is subject to periodic review and updating to take into account technological developments has resulted in instances where its was not able to mee t demands of technical nature from the substantive divisions and the latter had to resort to external sources for example in areas of wireless solutions remote email access and video conferencing 21 its prepares budget proposal for the forthcom ing biennium on the basis of medium term work plan and the requirements submitted by th divisions the latter are basically for hardware requirements oios is of the opinion that budgets and funding resources would be applied to best effect if budgeting were directly b ased on the ict strategy for the whole entity 22 oios is pleased to note that an ict business s trategy for unctad has now been drafted by the chief its and encourages fast tim eline for its review by management to ensure it adequately covers the services to be provided wi thin unctad as well as those to external clients and include details of deliverables timin g and resource requirements recommendation head2right unctad should request its to submit for the ict committees review and approval rolling strategic plan for it services and applications covering the next two bie nnia once approved by the committee the plan should be endor sed by the secretarygeneral of unctad and implemented and sho uld serve as basis to determine unctads ict budget requirements for the 20082009 biennium rec 03 management response its has already requested the organization of an i t board meeting to discuss the proposed ict strategy in the meantime copy of the draft ict business strategy document has been provided to oios implementation autumn 2005 oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending the receipt of copy of the ict strategy endorsed by u nctads sg 6 2 compliance with the secretariats global ict pol icies 23 the absence of strategy for ict that takes in to consideration the services available through other entities such as unog and the secr etariat may result in duplication in fact many nonstandard and duplicative systems funded f rom extrabudgetary resources have entered the secretariats ict resource portfolio 24 to ensure the coherent and coordinated global m anagement of ict initiatives across departments and duty stations sgb200415 on the u of information and communication technology resources and data and new stai titl ed ict initiatives that will soon come into effect promulgate very broad and inclusive definit ions of what constitutes an ict resource and an ict initiative irrespective of how this is fund ed stsgb200415 defines ict resource as any tangible or intangible asset capable of genera ting transmitting receiving processing or representing data in electronic form where the ass et is owned licensed operated managed or made available by or otherwise used by the united nations section 1 b an ict initiative will consist of any project or activity irrespect ive of its sources of funding or its cost that will result in new or modified ict resource 25 in addition to all networking computing ict c onsulting and internal expenditures of staff resources related to an ict initiative telep hone systems audio equipment electronic interpretation support cell phones building autom ation security and access control and cctv would also fall under the definition of ict resourc and as such any initiative related to them will need to be managed in accordance with these in structions 26 the report of the secretarygeneral on the ict strategy for the secretariat worldwide states that in line with the broad objectives of t he strategy all ict investments need to generate tangible returns a57620 paragraph 31 it als calls for the use of mandatory costbenefit analyses as prerequisite for the development of ll new systems and for the initiation of ict related projects to ensure consistent approach an d returns on investment a57620 paragraph 77 27 stsgb200317 established the project review c ommittee to apply uniformly the standards decided upon by the information and commu nications technology board to information and communications technology initiativ within the organization and to recommend whether such initiatives should proceed stsgb200317 paragraph 52 the prc is fully operational and meets as needed to rev iew high level business cases for projects costing more than 200k 28 its did not undertake any major software develo pment projects during the past four years however it has not been consulted or invol ved in ict initiatives within the substantive divisions and is not in position to say whether these conform to t hose promulgated by the ict board the chief programme on debt management and financial analysis dmfas for example affirmed that although they do apply syste ms development standards and methodologies they work independently of the ict b oard and the prc 29 unctad should have mechanism that will provid senior management with assurance that methodologies in conformity with those promulg ated by the ict board are being applied for 7 project management system design and testing in addition to conforming to secretariat regulations this would reduce the risk of systems being delivered late and over budget and of inadequate security features recommendations head2right unctad should see that the future strategic plan fo r its overall it services and applications is aligned with the gl obal ict strategy of the united nations secretariat and blish mechanism to ensure it remains in compliance with t he global ict policies of the secretariat rec 04 head2right once established unctads ict committee should mon itor all systems development within unctad irrespective of the source of funding and ensure this follows the meth odologies standards and procedures set out by the ict board nd project review committee rec 05 management response both recommendations are addressed in the ict busi ness strategy document in particular the unctad ict board will be responsible for approving local high level business cases hlbc and also proposes the establishment of project management working group to oversee software development in ctad implementation autumn 2005 with the approval of ic t strategy oios takes note of managements response it will keep these recommendations open pending receipt of the ict committees terms of reference approved by unctads sg and minutes of the committees first meeting recommendation 1 and copy of the ict strategy endorsed by unctads sg recommendation 3 3 ict staff resources 30 its currently has 175 posts eight of these ar at the professional level but one is on loan to another division over the past three years it s has employed the services of consultants in the area of software development and maintenance of applications at an average of 50 to 80 man days per year there are about 600 pcs installed 31 its has been providing service that is essent ially aimed at ensuring users can access their systems without interruption and that the in tegrity of data held on these systems is safeguarded 32 the most critical factor affecting ict resource requirements will be whether unctad needs to have its own software development and main tenance function in addition to those employed by the technical cooperation projects or w hether it will continue to provide general support and assistance to users such function wo uld be very costly to set up and maintain and its viability will need to be backed by return on investment analysis management will also need to make sure there is duplication with serv ices and systems that are already being provided or are available from entities such as the secretariats itsd unog and the united 8 nations international computing centre icc it s hould also seek to rationalize certain services as it is currently planning on doing by consolidati ng the help desk function with that of unog 33 obtaining new posts under the regular budget wi ll be very difficult under current budgetary policies outsourcing to icc may be an ption especially if the purpose is the development of new systems however the work to b outsourced will need to be defined and linked to the ict strategy another option is the recovery of funds from the extrabudget programmes related to specific projects to finance the maintenance of systems once these have been implemented 34 this could be an opportunity to introduce mecha nisms for measuring productivity and efficiency oios is of the opinion that the intro duction of individual work plans and time records within its will help management to make an informed case for requesting additional posts the services of consultants or funds for the outsourcing of services recommendation head2right unctad its should introduce individual work plans and time records and use them for analyzing the adequacy of resources to carry out the tasks set out in the ict strategy re c 06 management response the epas partially covers the issue of individua l work plans at the same time it is recognized that this requires strengthe ning including through enhanced time management and recording implementation once ict strategy is approved oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending further details on the actions management will be t aking to enhance time management and to determine the it staff resources required to meet t he ict strategy objectives 4 support for packaged systems 35 unctad currently operates web content manage ment system this was purchased from minor supplier and its does not have copy of the source code or an agreement that in the eventuality that the supplier will longer pport the system the source code would be made available to unctad oios recommended that unc tad should ensure that systems purchased from minor suppliers are covered by an crow agreement guaranteeing it access to the source code if system support is terminated management responded that actions have already been taken to address the iss ue of the mentioned source code its has it in future its will ensu re that source code of outsourced development is fully part of the deliverables and this would be in cluded in the relevant contract oios takes note of managements response and considers this recomme ndation as implemented 9 c ict services provided to users 1 service level agreements 36 the scope of ict services to be provided by its to users is not clearly defined and agreed upon there is users computing working group t hat brings together its management and the it focal points from unctads various divisions this working group is scheduled to meet three times year oios was provided with the nutes of the last meeting held on 3 february 2005 37 oios welcomes the existence of forum that cou ld help it services become more client oriented however the services expected of its sh ould be clearly defined and formalized in service level agreements between its and the manage ment of the particular usergroup including the four substantive divisions these wou ld take into consideration the fact that the divisions need to be oriented towards the needs of their clients which are of distinct and specific nature while its needs to be more client oriented towards all the components of unctad this is more important given its limited resources and should help avoid situations where users expect and demand certain rvices that its is not equipped to deliver recommendation head2right unctad its should identify all the ict services it is requested to provide to each of the substantive div isions and the rest of the user community and have these services and respective responsibilities defined in service vel agreement signed by its and the respective user group rec 0 7 management response while currently its has service catalogue which describes the portfolio of services delivered sla is yet been adopted tablishing slas is two way street process requiring agreement between the user group concerne d and its and will require several phases of discussion implementation 2006 oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending the receipt of copy of all the slas 2 inventory of hardware and systems 38 unctad has formal policy for the replacement of desktop computers but there is similar policy that sets out the criteria for repla cing other items of it equipment such as laptops printers and scanners in the case of technical co operation projects the mandate of its is only to provide technical evaluation whereas the require ment to seek compliance with central policies is not clearly documented 39 to ensure standardization and compatibility of all items of it equipment the replacement of all items of such equipment should follow set policy and be subject to review against established criteria 10 recommendation head2right once set up unctads ict committee should establis h policies and criteria for the replacement of all it ems of computer hardware and it equipment within unctad rec 08 management response replacement policies exist for desktop computers s well as for assignment of personal printers clearly such policies can b extended to other items it is proposed to take up the matter in the next meeting of the desktop compu ting working group one observation here is to match policies with flexibility so that undue rigi dity is avoided implementation first half of 2006 oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending the receipt of documentation setting out the policies nd criteria for the replacement of all items of computer hardware and it equipment within unctad 40 unctad does not have complete list of its it hardware and equipment this is partly due to difficulties in tracking it equipment that h as been allocated to consultants when their contract expires and terminating staff who are not 100 series 41 an accurate list of it hardware and equipment i s the basis for control over the entitys ict assets it is also required by management to ma ke informed decisions when ordering new equipment management should therefore take steps to compile and maintain complete and up todate inventory of all types it equipment within unctad showing technical details location and user and the installationdue replacement date s 42 for the same reasons oios is also recommending the introduction of similar procedures with regard to application software and databases s that management has readily available list of all applications and databases in use within unc tad recommendation head2right unctad should request its to compile an inventory of computer hardware and equipment and set database of application sof tware and databases and b assign human resources management section with the responsibility of informing its of all employees an d consultants whose contracts are expiring rec 09 management response i with the implementation of microsofts system ma nagement system sms in 200506 hardware inventory will be easier to manage and mai ntain however it will still require the implementation of improved processes in order for i ts to be aware of staff movements in timely manner in this light its proposes implementing n identity management system data base which would inter alia define unique process to creat and maintain identities and accelerate the access 11 to organizational resources to staff members eg creationclosure of mailbox for its but also for other purposes such as human resources or general s ervices matters implementation to be defined ii as far as the inventory of software is concerne d the issue is also addressed by the ict strategy paper this envisages giving the mandate to maintain the it applications portfolio and address issues like assigning priorities in softwar development to the project management working group mentioned therein implementation depends on strategy approval and dorsement oios takes note of managements response and encour ages unctad to set timelines for the full implementation of these initiatives in the m eantime oios recommends the immediate implementation of recommendation 09b at least as an interim measure it will keep these recommendations open pending confirmation that syst ems for the effective management and control of computer hardware and software and for maintaining an accurate list of user profiles are in place 3 user support 43 senior staff in the substantive divisions ackno wledged the improvement in it services achieved over the last few years they also saw ro om for improvement especially when it comes to dealing with requests for hardware and providing d irectly or indirectly services based on stateof theart technology the aforementioned service ivery agreements should go some way to address this issue 44 one remark with which oios concurs is the nee d for system by means of which users can log their request for items of equipment and monito r the status of their request the implementation of such log should not be difficult and would als ensure more accountability and transparency in dealing with such requests 45 the process of evaluating and implementing requ ests for modifications to application systems is not formalized changes to application systems need to be properly specified to ensure they do not adversely impact on other system s or the integrity of data these modifications have cost element even when perform ed inhouse and there should be proper evaluation to ensure that the changes are necessary and do not arise from failure on the users part to make proper use of the application this valuation procedure should also result in the prioritised of modifications according to their imp ortance recommendation head2right unctad should set up committee with it and user representat ives to evaluate user requests for modifications and enhancements to systems and to prioritize such requests and b request its to implement an online system for users to log their requests for hardware and computer equipment and monitor the status of their request rec 10 12 management response the issue is partially addressed by the ict strate gy however the design and implementation of an online system will depend on software development priorities and resources implementation to be defined oios takes note of managements response it sugge sts that unctad sets timelines for the full implementation of the recommended actions oios wi ll keep this recommendation open pending confirmation that the recommended committee has been setup and is functioning and that an online system for users requests is operat ing d access security 1 general policies 46 its deals with aspects of an operational nature and is therefore responsible for ensuring data security within unctad for example the divis ion on international trade in goods and services and commodities ditc uses one of the it s servers to relay information from the trains system to the database that is located on world bank server in washington and relies on its to ensure adequate security over access to t he geneva server 47 the its network administrator and his assistant are responsible for the administration of access rights to the network and email systems but there is documented computer security policy for unctad that covers logical and physical access control procedures over its ict systems data and equipment 48 written security policy covering all aspects of it security within unctad should be drawn up the policy would inter alia identify the persons who are assigned the most po werful access rights both within and outside of unctad nd can view or delete the documents and other data of others these people should be ident ifiable and their rights and responsibilities should be clearly set out and approved by managemen t 49 its should take the lead in developing such s ecurity policy and in setting standards that are in line with best practice recommendation head2right unctad its should develop security policy covering all aspects of it security within unctad the policy should define the roles and responsibilities of staff associated with computer security including nonunctad staff it should be supported by written procedures over the granting and modification of ac cess rights and the removal of profiles in the case of terminated u sers b submit the security policy to the ict committee for review and approval c review and where necessary amend current access rights to 13 bring them in line with the security policy and d perform periodic eg semiannual review of access rights to ensure they comply with the policy rec 11 management response it is proposed to request unicc to carry out curity policy assessment to be followed by the setting up of such policies icc has already performed such work in the past eg itu implementation as soon as possible oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending confirmation that the recommended actions have been implemented 2 email system 50 the united nations international computing cent re is providing unctads email service person in the centre and the deputy chi ef its have administrator access rights 51 oios did not perform detailed assessment ho wever brief review and discussions with management highlighted serious concerns on em ail access security and the confidentiality of emails one reason is that in the case of shor tterm staff members and consultants its is not always aware of people who have terminated their co ntract and left unctad there may be instances where the email account of former staf f member or consultant is still active and can be accessed remotely via the internet when its is informed access is normally removed one month after termination 52 oios is recommending that management draws up formal risk assessment arising from the current state of affairs and evaluate the cost of tightening control in this area against the risk s involved certain measures such as the alerting of its of leavers by human resources management section and the immediate disabling of t he send function for terminated employees and consultants can be implemented at cost to th organization recommendations head2right once set up unctads ict committee should establish policy over the granting and admini stering access rights to the email system including remot access and the closure of email accounts this policy would form part of the overall security policy b the send function should be disabled immediatel upon termination and the readonly function retained for longer than 30 days and c evaluate the option of email encryption and ghter security over remote access eg use of handheld devices t generate random access codes rec 12 management response we believe that this issue should be included in t he analysis we propose under recommendation 11 above email accounts c losure recommendations can be implemented 14 once the information flow about staff movements is working smoothly see recommendation 09 oios takes note of managements response and agrees that the implementation of the recommended actions should be coordinated with that for recommendations 09 and 11 oios appreciates that developing and implementing polici is likely to take time but in view of the risks involved with the systems as currently set up it urges management to assign priority to this area it will keep this recommendation open pendin g confirmation that the recommended actions have been implemented contingency and business continuity planning 1 contingency planning 53 the main computer equipment is housed in room that is located directly above the palette bar there is fireproof safe for the st orage of backup media anywhere within the unctad premises 54 management should assess the risks arising from these circumstances and see whether relocation of computer room andor the installati on of fireproof safe for the storage of complete set of backups is called for oios also believes that unctad should contact itsd and obtain the latest global it physical security p olicies these policies should be tailored and implemented for the entity recommendation head2right unctad its should assess the risk of the computer rooms current location and the lack of fireproof safe and take appropriate action and b coordinate with the information technology serv ice division to implement as soon as possible the globa l it physical security policies rec 13 management response unogicts is currently evaluating the design and d esignation of new computer room which would be security proof and our proposal is to house unctads equipment in this facility once it is available in the short t erm we propose that an evaluation of the current r isks associated with the location of our computer room b made part of the security analysis mentioned above and decisions taken to minimize the risks ba sed on this evaluation implementation move to new computer room to be coordinated with unogicts risk assessment asap oios takes note of managements response in the w ider context oios would like to reiterate the recommendation to implement as soon as possible the secretariats global it physical security policies this recommendation is kept open pending confirmation that the recommended actions have been implemented 15 2 business continuity planning 55 there are currently formal plans which set ut the procedures to be followed to ensure that in the event of disaster affecting its compu ter facilities unctad would be able to mobilize alternate arrangements for processing data and continue to provide its core services efficiently while the facilities are being properly restored while effective backup procedures and power supply protection provide measure of in surance against system failures in the event of major disaster such as fire it is likely th at the damage will not be restricted to the compute r equipment but will also affect other areas 56 business continuity planning is wide in scope nd requires input from all user departments it requires coordination with externa l parties such as the suppliers of hardware software and communications service and equipment 57 the plan needs to be preceded by risk assessm ent that will define the critical business functions and the systems supporting them the diff erent types of disasters ranging from major malfunctions of equipment to largescale disasters that would affect all the site activities it would detail the key tasks and the individuals resp onsible for undertaking them and the alternative arrangements to be made while the criti cal functions are being recovered 58 the conduct of such an exercise is demanding on resources and oios suggests that unctad takes advantage of the work that has already been undertaken by itsd in the conduct of ict security risk assessments and business continui ty planning recommendation head2right unctad its should request the information technology services div ision at headquarters to assist in carrying out an ict curity risk assessment and seek to benefit from the work alread undertaken by itsd in relation to business continui ty planning and b draw up project plan for the implementation f business continuity plan that details the stages to be follo wed to ensure that in the event of major disaster unctads cri tical operational functions are properly recovered and be come operational within acceptable timescales rec14 management response this issue is also addressed by the ict strategy p aper and similar recommendation is made therein implementation depends on ict strategy endors ement oios takes note of managements response it will keep this recommendation open pending confirmation
