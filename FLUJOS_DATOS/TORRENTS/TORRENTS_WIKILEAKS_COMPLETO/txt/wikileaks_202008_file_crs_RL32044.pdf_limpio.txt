divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32044immigration policy considerations related to guest worker programs summary at present the united states has two main programs for temporarily importing lowskilled workers sometimes referred to as guest workers agricultural guest workers enter through the h2a visa progra m and other guest workers enter through the h2b visa program employers in terested in importing workers under either program must first apply to the us department of labor for certification that us workers capable of performing the work are not available and that the employment of alien workers will not adversely aff ect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed us workers other requirements of the programs differ variety of bills have been introduced in recent congresses to make changes to the h2a and h2b programs and the h visa category generally and to establish new temporary worker visas the 109th congress revised the h2b program in the fy2005 emergency supplemental appropria tions act pl 10913 among the changes temporary provision was added to the immigration and nationality act ina to exempt certain returning h2b workers from the h2b annual numerical cap of 66000 the fy2007 department of defense authorization bill pl 109364 extended this exemption through fy2007 the exemption expired on september 30 2007 number of bills before the 110th congress s 988 s 2839 hr 1843 hr 5233 hr 5495 hr 5849 would reenact an h2b returning worker exemption other guest worker bills introduced in the 110th congress include proposals to reform the h2a program s 237s 340hr 371 s 1639 hr 1645 hr 1792 and the h2b program s 1639 s 2094 nd to establish new temporary worker visas s 330 s 1639 hr 1645 hr 2413 some of these bills also would establish mechanisms for certain foreign workers to become legal permanent residents lprs the sena debated but failed to invoke cloture on s 1639 in june 2007 president george w bush proposed new expanded temporary worker program in january 2004 when he announced his principles for immigration reform and has since reiterated his support for such program in august 2007 following the unsuccessful cloture vote in the nate on s 1639 the bush administration announced that it would seek to streamlin the existing h2a and h2b programs within current law in february 2008 the us department of labor dol and the us department of homeland secur ity dhs published proposed rules to significantly amend their respective h2a regulations the current discussion of guest worker programs takes place against backdrop of historically high levels of unauthor ized migration to the united states and one question that often arises about proposals fo r new guest worker programs is whether they would enable participants to obtai n lpr status other issues raised in connection with guest worker proposals include how new program requirements would compare with those of the h2a and h2b programs and how the eligible population would be defined this report w ill be updated as legi slative developments occurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32044contents introduction 1 background 1 c u r r n t p r g r m s 2 h 2 p r

united states and mexico began cabinetleve l talks on migration although the details of these discussions were not made public two issues legalization and temporar worker program dominated media coverage the talks lost momentum after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 as the bush administration focused its attention on securityrelated matters temporary worker program not limited to mexico however remains of interest to some members of congress and administration officials various bills to reform existing programs for foreign temporary workers and to create ne w temporary worker programs have been introduced in recent congresses comp rehensive immigration reform bills that would have established new guest worker programs were considered in the senate in the 109th and 110th congresses but none of these proposals were enacted into law president bush outlined proposal for new temporary worker program in january 2004 and has since reiterated hi s support for such program the temporary worker programs under discussion presumably woul d cover largely lowskilled workers in the absence of legislation authorizing new temporary worker program the bush administration announced in august 2007 that it would seek to streamline existing guest worker programs within current w in february 2008 the us department of labor dol and the us department of homeland security dhs published proposed rules to significantly ame nd their respective h2a regulations background the term guest worker has typically been applied to foreign temporary low skilled laborers often in agriculture or other seasonal employment in the past guest worker programs have been established in the united states to address worker shortages during times of war during worl d war i for example tens of thousands of mexican workers performed mainly agricultural labor as part of temporary worker program the bracero program which began during world war ii and lasted until 1964 brought several million mexican agricultural workers into the united states at its peak in the late 1950s the bracero program employed more than 400000 mexican workers annually1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32044crs2 2

and training administration eta of dol and us citizenship and immigration services uscis of dhs6 h2a program the h2a program allows for the tem porary admission of foreign workers to the united states to perform agricultural work of seasonal or temporary nature provided that us workers are not available an approved h2a visa petition is generally valid for an initial period of up to one year an employer can apply to extend an h2a workers stay in increments of up to one year but an aliens total period of stay as an h2a worker may not exceed three consecutive years an alien who has spent three

the h2a program in its current form growers complain that the h2a program is overly cu mbersome and does not meet their labor needs labor advocates argue that the program provides too few protections for us workers for discussion of proposed rules published by dol and dhs in february 2008 to amend their h2a regulations see bush administration proposal s section below h2a visas issued the h2a program which is not subject to numerical limits has grown significantly since 1992 one way to measure the programs growth is to consider changes in the num ber of h2a visas issued annually by the

the jobs the program which would grant participants legal temporary status would initially be open to both foreign workers abroad and unauthorized aliens within th united states at some future date however it would be restricted to alie ns outside the country the temporary workers authorized period of stay would be three years and would be renewable for an unspecified period of time temporary workers would be able to travel back and forth between their home countries and th united states and as stated in the background briefing for reporters would joy the same protections that american workers have with respect to wages and employment rights the proposal also called for increased workplace forcement of immigration laws the proposed temporary worker pr ogram would not include special mechanism for participants to obtain lpr status according to the white house fact sheet the program should not permit undocum ented workers to gain an advantage over those who have followed the rules temporary workers would be expected to return to their home countries at the end of their authorized period of stay and the administration favored providing them with economic incentives to do so as

streamlining the process so that willing workers can efficiently be matche d with employers when there are willing us workers although she did not describe this strea mlined process she did state that

temporary worker program that would create legal path for foreign workers to enter our country in an orderly way for limited period of time this program would match willing foreign workers with willing american employers for jobs americans are not doing every worker who applies for the program would be required to pass criminal b ackground checks and temporary workers must return to their home country at the conclusion of their stay37 during the first half of 2007 dhs s ecretary michael chertoff and commerce secretary carlos gutierrez participated in senate negotiations over comprehensive immigration reform bill in may and june of 2007 during senate debate on comprehensive immigration reform pr oposals38 the white house and president bush consistently expressed suppor t for immigration reform and th senate legislation in remarks to the associated builders and contractors organization in june 2007 the president specifically addressed the need for new temporary worker program the reality is in america that the c onstruction industry and other sectors depend on foreign workers to fill jobs americans are not doing so once our border security and work site enforcement measur is in place this bill will create new temporary worker program the program will establish lawful and orderly process for foreign workers to come to america on temporary basis this will help reduce the number of people trying to sneak across our border if youre truly interested in border security it makes sense to give people legal way to come to do work americans aren t doing on

dol proposed rule woul d reengineer the process through which an agricultural employer can apply for temporary labor certification to employ h2a workers under the dol proposal the current certification process would be replaced by an attestationbased process in which employers would attest in their applications under th reat of penalties that they have complied with program requirements prospective h2a employers would have to begin recruiting us workers to fill the job openings before filing labor certifi cation application as specified and would have to submit preliminary recruitment report as part of that application dol also would establish new auditing process to determine whether employers are complying with program requirements the dol rule further proposes to change the methodology for termining the adverse effect wage rate discussed above with the goal of more accurately measuring marketbased wages by occupation skill level nd geographic location it suggests using new data source the bureau of labor statistic s occupational employment survey to determine the aewr in addition to th proposed changes to the h2a labor certification process the dol proposed ru includes amendments to other dol h 2a related regulations for example dol proposes to increase existing civil money penalties and to establish new penalties for certain violations related to h2a work contracts dhss proposed rule would likewise ma ke number of changes to its h2a regulations among these amendments th proposed rule would modify existing limitations on an h2a workers period of stay as mentioned above an h2a worker who has spent three years in the united states must remain outside the country for six months before he or she can again be granted h2a status the dhs proposed rule would reduce this waiting peri od from six months to three months in addition under current regulations an h2a worker may remain in the united states for up to 10 days after the h2a petition expires in order to prepare to depart or to seek an extension of stay based on subs equent job offer the dhs proposed rule would extend this postpetition period of stay to 30 days another proposed amendment would enable an h2a worker who is awaiting an extension of stay based on petition filed by new employ er and accompanied by an approved labor certification to begin the new job before the extension of stay is granted under current regulations the alie n cannot begin the new job until the petition is approved and the extension of stay is granted this ability to begin working for the new h2a employer before the extension of stay is granted however would apply only if the new employer is registered user in g ood standing of everify largely

the 110th congress coordinated by andorra brunoelectronic employment eligibility verification system administered by uscis43 according to the proposed rule uscis believes that this proposed empl oyment authorization provision will create an incentive for agricultural employ ers to enroll in the everify program thereby reducing opportunities for aliens without employment authorization to work in the agricultural sector and helping protect the integrity of the h2a program policy considerations issues raised in connection with tem porary worker programs such as us economic development mexican economic development law enforcement and worker protections coupled with the us experience with the h2a and h2b programs suggest policy issues likely to arise in the evaluation of guest worker proposals comparison of program requirements new guest worker program could include agricultural workers or nonagricultural workers or both it could replace or supplement one or both of the existing h2a and h2b programs the assessment of any proposed program would likely include comparison of the requi rements of the proposed and existing programs especially in the case of ne w program covering both agricultural and nonagricultural workers because current h2a and h2b requirements vary considerably the area of wages provides an example under the h2b program employers must pay their workers at least the prevailing wage rate employers importing agricultural workers through the h2a program are subject to potentially higher wage requirements as explained above they mu st pay their workers the highest of the minimum wage the prevailing wage rate or the aewr therefore new guest worker program that covered both agri cultural and nonagricultural workers and included unified wage requirement would represent change in existing wage requirements for employers eligible population guest worker program could be limited to aliens within the country many of whom presumably would be unauthorized alie ns or to aliens outside the country or could include both groups the possible par ticipation of illegal aliens in guest worker program is controversial some parties would likely see their inclusion as rewarding lawbreakers and encouraging future unauthorized immigration especiallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32044crs21 44 comment of t alexander aleinikoff migration policy institute quoted in eric schmitt the nation separate and unequal you can come in you stay out new york times july 29 2001 section 4 p 5 45 president bush was asked in july 2001 whether an immigration proposal under consideration at the time to legalize the stat us of some unauthorized mexicans would be expanded to cover immigrants from other countries the president responded well consider all folks here but did not provide further details see edwin chen and jonathan peterson bush hints at broader amnesty angeles times july 27 2001 part part 1 p 1 46 for example in an august 2001 letter to pr esident bush and

proposal can be complete w ithout an earned adjustment program 47 pl 99603 november 6 1986 the general legalization program is at ina 245a and the saw program is at ina 210if the program enabled some participan ts to obtain lpr status the option of excluding unauthorized aliens has raised another set of concer ns some observers maintain that large guest worker program limited to new workers could leave unauthorized aliens in the united states particularly vulnerabl to exploitation by unscrupulous employers more generally many who view guest worker program as means of addressing the unauthoriz ed alien problem see the inclusion of unauthorized aliens as integral to any proposal another eligibility question is whether the program would be limited to nationals of certain countries the bush administration began discussion of guest worker program with mexico in 2001 as pa rt of binational migra tion talks and some immigration experts maintain th at there are very good r easons for crafting special immigration relationship with mexico given its propinquity its historical ties and nafta44 some immigrant advocacy groups how ever have argued that it would be unfair to single out mexicans for special treatment especially if legalization were part of the agreement45 legalization of program participants the issue of whether to include legalization or earned adjustment program as part of guest worker pr oposal is controversial earned adjustment is term used to describe legalization programs that require prospective beneficiaries to earn lpr status through work andor other contribu tions some see permanent legalization as an essential element of guest worker proposal46 while others oppose the inclusion of any type of lpr adjustment program in the current debate reference is often made to two legalization programs established by the immigration reform and control act irca of 1986 1 general program for unauthoriz ed aliens who had been continually resident in the united states since before january 1 1982 and 2 special agricultural worker saw progra m for aliens who had worked at least 90 days in seasonal agriculture durin g designated yearlong period47 approximately 27 million individuals have adjusted to lpr status under these programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32044crs22 recent h2a reform bills suggest w illingness on the part of some policy makers to establish an earned adjustment program at least for agricultural workers key set of questions about any legalization mechanism proposed as part of guest worker program would concern the propos ed legalization process and associated requirements major h2a refo rm proposals introduced in the 107th congress s 1313hr 2736 and s 1161 discussed in the appendix for example would have established similarly structured earned adjustment programs for agricultural workers under these proposals workers who had perfo rmed requisite am ount of agricultural work could have applied for temporary resi dent status after satisfying additional work requirements in subsequent years they could have applied for lpr status the applicable requirements in the proposals however differed significantly for temporary resident status s 1313hr 2736 would have require d the alien to have performed at least 540 hours or 90 work days of agricultural work during 12 month period s 1161 would have required at least 900 hours or 150 work days of agricultural work during similar period to qualify for adjustment to lpr status s 1313hr 2736 would have required at least 540 hours or 90 work days of agricultural work in each of three year s during fouryear period s 1161 would have required at l east 900 hour s or 150 work days of agricultural work in each of four years during specified sixyear period various issues and concerns raised in connection with such earned adjustment proposals for agricultural workers may be re levant in assessing other guest worker legalization programs among these issues is the feasibility of program participants meeting the applicable requirements to obtai n legal status s 1161 for example was criticized for incorporating work requirements for legalization that some observers said many agricultural workers could not satisfy it also has been argued that multiyear work requirements could lead to exploitation if workers were loathe to complain about workrelated ma tters for fear of being fired before they had worked the requisite number of years possi ble countervailing set of considerations involves the continued availability of wo rkers for lowskilled industries such as agriculture meat packing nd services industries some parties have expressed general concern that quick legalization pr ocess with light work requirements could soon deprive employers of needed workers if some newly legaliz ed workers were to leave certain industries to pursu more desirable job opportunities treatment of family members the treatment of family mbers under guest worker proposal is likely to be an issue currently the ina allows for the admission of the spouses and minor children of alien workers on h2a h2b and other h visas who are accompanying the worker or following to join the worker in the united states in considering any new program one question would be wh ether guest workers coming from abroad could be accompanied by their spouses and children if the guest worker program in question were open to unauthoriz ed aliens in the united states the issue of family members would become much more complicated relevant questions would include the following would the unauthorized spouse andor minor children of the prospective gues t worker be granted some type of legal temporary resident status under the progra m if not would they be expected to leave or be removed from the country if the program had legalizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32044crs23 48 see crs report rl32235 49 pl 101649 november 29 1990 50 questions about the

for lpr status as derivatives of the guest worker the treatment of family members became significant issue in the 1986 legalization programs descri bed above as enacted i rca required all aliens to qualify for legalization on their own be half it made provision for granting derivative lpr status to spouses and childre n legalized aliens thus needed to file immigrant visa petitions on behalf of their family members these filings were primarily in the family preference categor covering spouses and children of lprs category 2a and had the effect of lengthening waiting times in this category48 to partially address the increased demand for visa numbers the immigration act of 199049 made limited number of dditional visa numbers available for spouses and children of ircalegalized aliens for fy1992 through fy1994 it also provided for temporary stays of deporta tion and work authorization for certain spouses and children of ircalegalized aliens in the united states as suggested by the experience of the irca programs the treatment of family members in any guest worker program w ith legalization component could have broad implications for the us immigration system even in the absence of legalization component however the treatment of family members in guest worker program could have im portant ramifications with respect to the program itself for example it could affect the willingness of aliens to apply to participate labor market test key question about any guest worker program is the type of labor market conditions that would have to exist if any in order for an employer to import alien workers50 under both the h2a and h2b prog rams employers interested in hiring foreign workers must first go through the process of labor certif ication intended to protect job opportunities for us workers labor certification enta ils determination of whether qualified us workers are ava ilable to perform the needed work and whether the hiring of foreign workers will adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed us work ers as described above recruitment is the primary method used to determine u s worker availability while there is widespread agreement on the goals of labor certification the process itself has been criticized for being cumbersome slow and ineffective in protecting us workers proposed guest worker program could re tain some form of labor certification or could establish different process fo r determining if employers could bring in foreign workers for example some past legislative proposals to reform the h2a program sought to overhaul current labor certification requireme nts by establishinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32044crs24 51 see discussion of legislation in the 105th107th congresses in the appendix 52 see crs report rl30498 immigration legislati ve issues on nonimmigrant professional specialty h1b workers by ruth ellen wasema system of worker registries51 another option suggested by some in h2a reform debates is to adopt the more streamlined labor market st used in the temporary worker program for professi onal specialty workers h1b program that test known as labor attestation requires employers to atte st to various conditions52 some argue that labor attestation is inadequa for unskilled jobs without educational requirements assuming that protecting us workers remained policy priority the labor market test incorporated in any guest worker program would need to be evaluated to determine whether it would likely serve this purpose numerical limits related to the issues of labor market tests and us worker protections is the question of numerical limitations on guest worker program numerical cap provides means separate from the labor market test of limiting the number of foreign workers currently as explained above the h2a progra m is not numerically limited while the h2b program is ca pped at 66000 annually like the h2b program other capped temporary worker programs have fixed statutory numerical limits by contrast guest worker program that was outlined by former senator phil gramm during the 107th congress but never introduced as legislation included different type of numerical cap one th at would have vari ed annually based on regional unemployment rates according to the program prospectus released by senator gramm except for seasonal work the number of guest workers permitted to enroll would be adjusted annually in response to changes in us economic conditions specifically unemployment rates on regionbyregion basis some more recent guest worker proposals such as the y2 visa proposed in s 1639 in the 110th congress include numerical caps th at would vary based on demand for the visa numerical limitations also are relevant in the context of unauthorized immigration some view temporary worker program as way to begin reducing the size of the current unauthorized alien popula tion andor future inflows in light of the estimated current size nd annual growth rate of the unauthorized population it could be argued that guest worker progra m would need to be sizeable to have any significant impact on the other hand critic s contend that guest worker program especially large one would be counterproductive means of controlling unauthorized immigration in their view temporary worker programs serve to increase not reduce the size of the unauthorized population enforcement another important consideration is how the terms of guest worker program would be enforced relevant questions include what types of mechanisms would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32044crs25 53 ina 218g2used to ensure that employers complied with program requirements with respect to the h2a program for example the ina authorizes the labor secretary to take such actions including imposing appropriate penalties and seeking appropriate injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual obligations as may be necessary to assure employ er compliance with terms and conditions of employment53 related question is whether the enforcement system would be complaintdriven or whether the appropriate entity could take action in the absence of specific complaint another enforcementrelated question is wh at type of mechanism if any would be used to ensure that guest workers parted the country at the end of their authorized period of stay historically the removal of aliens who have overstayed their visas and thereby lapsed into unauthorized status but have not committed crimes has not been priority of the us immigration system some have suggested that largescale guest worker program could help address the problem of visa overstaying and unauthorized immigration generally by severely limiting job opportunities for unauthorized aliens others doubt however that large numbers of unauthorized residents would voluntarily l eave the country as explained above they argue instead that new guest worker program would likely increase the size of the unauthorized alien population as many gues t workers opted to overstay their visas other ideas have been put forth to facilitate the departure of temporary workers at the end of their authorized period of stay one suggestion is to involve the workers home countries in th guest worker program another option is to create an incentive for foreign workers to leave the united states by for example withholding or otherwise setting aside m of money for each worker that would become available only once the worker re turned home in evaluating any such financially based incentive system it may be useful to consider among other questions how much money would be availa ble to typical worker and whether such an amount would likely provide an adequate incentive to return home homeland security final consideration relates to bor der and homeland security matters of heightened concern since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 supporters of new temporary worker programs argue that such programs would make the united states more secure they cite security related benefits of knowing the identities of currently unknown i ndividuals in the country and of legalizing the inflow of alien workers and thereby freeing border pers onnel to concentrate on potential criminal and terrorist threats opponents reject th idea that guest worker programs improve homeland security and generally focus on the dangers of rewarding immigration law violators with temporary or permanent legal status security concerns may affect various aspects of temporary worker pr ogram possible securityrelated provisions that may be considered as part of new guest worker program include specialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32044crs26 screening of participants monitoring while in the united states and issuance of fraudresistant documents conclusion the question of new guest worker progra m is controversial key reason for this is the interrelationship between the recent discussion of guest worker programs and the issue of unauthorized immigration the size of the current resident unauthorized alien population in the ited states along with continued unauthorized immigration and related deaths at the usmexico border are major factors cited in support of new temporary worker progra m at the same time the importance of enforcing immigration law and not rewarding illegal aliens with any type of legalized status are primary r easons cited in opposition to such program it would seem that some bridging of th is gap on the unauthorized alien question perhaps in some of the areas analyzed above would be prerequisite to gaining broad support for guest worker proposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32044crs27 54 during the 107th congress former senator phil gramm released preliminary proposal for new usmexico guest worker program th at would have covered both agricultural and nonagricultural workers but he did not introduce legislation 55 although s 1814 and hr 4056 are not identical they are treated as companion bills for the purposes of this discussion because they are highly similarappendix guest worker legislation in the 105th109th congresses legislation in the 105th107th congresses major guest worker legislation introduced in the 105th 106th and 107th congresses was limited to the h2a progra m major nonagricultural guest worker bills were offered54 in the 105th congress for example senateapproved amendment to s 2260 an fy1999 department s of commerce justice and state appropriations bill would ve replaced the existing labor certification process with new set of procedures for importing h2a workers it would have established system of agricultural worker registries containing the names of eligible us agricultural workers employers interest ed in importing h2a workers would first have applied to dol for the referral of us workers through registry search if sufficient number of workers were not found the employer would have been allowed to import h2a workers to cover the shortf all the senate measure also would have changed wage and other requirement s the provision was not enacted provisions to establish system of worker registries and to change existing h 2arelated requirements were likewise included in two h2a reform proposals introduced in the 106th congress s 1814hr 405655 and hr 4548 in addition s 1814hr 4056 would have established twostage legalization program under which farm workers satisfying specified work requirements c ould have obtained temporary resident status nd then legal permanent resident lpr status although formal congressional consideration was limited to senate immigration subcommittee hearing s 1814hr 4056 became the basis of bipartisan compromise on foreign agricultural workers that agreement however fell apart at the end of the 106th congress hr 4548 the other reform bill before the 106th congress differed from s 1814hr 4056 in that it sought to establish pilot h2calien agricultural worker program to supplement rather than repl ace the h2a program hr 4548 also did not include legalization program hr 4548 was reported by the house judiciary committ ee in october 2000 but saw further action like s 1814hr 4056 in the 106 th congress key bills before the 107th congress coupled significant h2a refo rm with legalization s 1161 and s 1313hr 2736 would have streamlined th process of importing h2a workers particularly for jobs covered by collective bargaining agreements with respect to legalization both proposals would have llowed foreign agricultural workers who met specified work requirements to adjust to lpr status through twostage process like that in s 1814hr 4056 the requirements for adjustment of status in s 1313hr 2736 differed from those in s 1161 with the latter being more stringent among the other major differences between the proposals s 1161 would have easedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32044crs28 existing wage requirements while s 1313hr 2736 would have mandated study of the wage issue action beyond committee referral occurred on either proposal legislation in the 108th congress bills to reform the h2a program the h2b program and the h visa category generally as well as bills to establish new guest worker programs were introduced in the 108th congress some of these bills would have enabled certain workers to obtain lpr status action beyond committ ee referral occurred on any of the bills congressional committees held related hearings during the 108th congress the house agriculture committee held hearin g on the potential impact of recent guest worker proposals on the agricultural sector and the house judiciary committees subcommittee on immigration border security and claims held hearing on the impact of guest workers on us workers in the senate

conditions among these proposed changes the adverse effect wage rate discu ssed above would have remained at the january 2003 level for thr ee years after the date of enactment and employers would
