government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474suspension of the rules in the house of representatives summary suspension of the rules is procedure the house of representatives uses frequently to debate and pa ss measures on the floor after representative moves to suspend the rules and pass particular measure there can be 40 minutes of debate on the motion and the measure floor amendments to the measure are in order however the member who offers the suspension motion may include amendments to the measure as part of the motion in this case the member moves to suspend the rules and pass the bill or resolution as amended at the end of the debate the house casts single vote on suspending the rules and passing the measure there is separate vote on the measure or on any of the amendments to it that are included in the suspension motion each suspension moti on requires vote of twothirds of the members present and voting quorum being present the speaker determines which suspension motions the house will consider members offering suspension motions are recognized at the discretion of the speaker house rules provide that such motions are in order on mondays tuesdays and wednesdays and on the last six days of session of congress and at other times by unanimous consent or pursuant to standi ng order or special rule the house has adopted the speaker also may postpone electronic votes on suspension motions until later on the same day or until the following day and then cluster these votes to occur one right after the other the suspension procedure is wellsuite d for expeditious action on relatively noncontroversial measures approximately onehalf of th bills and resolutions the house has passed in recent cong resses have been considered in this way the house also sometimes agrees to suspension motions for other purposes such as to agree to senate amendments to bill the house already has passed or to agree to conference report in early congresses motions to suspend the rules were used primarily to give individual bills priority for floor action when considered thes bills were debated and amended under the houses regular legislative procedur gradually during the 19th century the suspension motion was tran sformed into procedure for taking up and acting on bill by one vote also originally members claimed the right to be recognized for the purpose of offering wh atever suspension motions they wished late in the last century the speaker asserted the authority to decide which members would be recognized to make suspension motions and the purposes for which these motions would be offered this control by the speaker transformed suspension of the rules into useful and wellregulated device for the majority party leadership to schedule floor action on measures that are supported by more than simple majority of the house this report will be updated to reflect any procedural changeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474contents introduction 1

government and finance division now retired from crssuspension of the rules in the house of representatives introduction the legislative procedures of the hous of representatives strike balance between two requirements that the house act with reasonable dispatch but that it act only after adequate delib eration with an opportunity for differing positions to be considered the most appr opriate balance between thes requirements varies from one measure to the next many bills and re solutions are relatively routine they evoke little controversy and disagreement and the house passes them quickly others provoke more interest and bate among members so th house usually considers them at greater length the rules and practices of the house take these differences into account providing necessary flexibility in the procedures by which individual measures are considered on the house floor measures to which there is virtually opposition may be called up and passed by unanimous consent generally with little discussion and floor amendments by contrast the most important measures are considered in committee of the whole and are debated and amended under the term s of resolutions or special rules reported by the committee on rules and adopted by the house in specifying the number of hours for general debate and perhaps imposing restrictions on the amendments that members may offer in committee of the whole each of these resolutions is adapted to the nature of and circumstances rrounding the measure it proposes to make in order consideration of measures in the house under the one hour rule or in the house as in committee of the whole as opposed to consideration in committee of the whole and then in the house imposes different conditions and restrictions on floor action an alternative to these procedures fo r considering measures on the house floor is special set of procedures known as suspension of the rules this mode of consideration limits opportunitie s for debate and amendmen t and consequently is generally reserved for measures that are relatively noncontrovers ial this report summarizes the current rules and practi ces governing house floor action under suspension of the rules and then discu sses the evolution of these procedures1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs2 2 until the house recodified its rules by adopting hres 5 on the first day of the

of the speaker the speaker is authorized to entertain such motions at these times but he is not required to do so6 if member is to make suspension motion it must have the suppor t or at least the acquiescence of the speaker representatives consult with the speaker before they are recognized for this purpose member has the right to be recognized to make such motion independently

speaker intends to entertain suspension motion the majority party leadership normally gives advance noti ce to all members through published whip notices also during the last floor session of each week majority and minority party leaders usually engage in discussion on the floor about the anticipated floor schedule for the following week including whatever measures are likely to be considered under suspension at this nd other times member s sometimes refer to the suspension calendar by this they m ean the unofficial list of measures that the leadership intends to have considered unde r suspension there is official list of these measures as there is for measures that have b een placed on the union house or corrections calendar committee role the speaker may recognize any member to offer suspension motion most often however this motion is made by the chairman of the committee or subcommittee with legislative jurisdicti on over the measure in question or designee representative recognized fo r this purpose usually says mr speaker i move to suspend the rules and pass the b ill hr number and then states the bills official title the suspension procedure also may be used for other purposes for example to concur in senate amendment or to agree to conference report reporting the house may consider measure under suspension of the rules even though it has not been reported from committee7 or even if it has not already been introduced and referred to committee8 more often than not bills and resolutions are considered under this procedure only after they ve been reported favorably from committee however if committee expects the house to consider one of its bills under suspension there is need for the committ ee to satisfy the requirements of house rules for reporting it ie securing the presence of majority quorum to vote on approving the measure and preparing written committee report to accompany it in recent years there has been an upward tr end in the number of house bills and joint resolutions that have been considered unde r suspension of the rules without first having been reported from committee see table 1 belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs4 table 1

51 243 guidelines majority and minority party rules contain guidelines for consideration of bills under suspension of the rules in the 108th congress rule 28 of the house republican conference directed the speaker not to schedule bill for consideration under suspension if it would authorize or appropriate funds or provide direct or indirect loan commitments or guarantees in an amount greater than 100 million in any fiscal year except with the approval of majority of the partys elected leadership this conference rule was modified in the 109th congress dropping the 100 million proviso requiring instead waiv er for consideration of any bill or resolution that creates new program ex tends an authorization whose originating statute contained sunset provision or authorizes more than 10 increase in authorization appropriati ons or direct spending in any given year because suspension motions require two thirds votes for passage they usually are not offered unless the measures they propose to pass enjoy significant bipartisan support especially on the committees with legislative jurisdiction over the measures in question in fact republican conference rules also direct the majority leader not to schedule measure for considera tion under suspension unless that bill or resolution has been cleared by the minority and was not opposed by more than one third of the committee members reporting the billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs5 9 as discussed in later sections members once could decline to consider some or all suspension motions by voting against orderi ng seconds on them this opportunity was restricted in 1979 and eliminated in 1991 10 in recent congresses in departure from earlier practices some measures brought up under suspension procedures have been

opponent of this legislation congressional record daily edition vol 148 july 23 2002 p h5118 14 on occasion time for debate has been extended beyond the 40 minutes specified in house rules such extensions have been granted by unanimous consent for example during consideration of hr 10809 the national aeronautics and space administration authorizations for fy1960 debate on the susp ension motion was increased to one hour and 20 minutes debate under suspension procedures also has been extended pursuant to the provisions of special rule reported by the rules committee hres 417 101st congress provided for five hours of debate on pr oposed constitutional amendment prohibiting flag desecration hjres 350control of time the house cannot vote against considering suspension motion9 once the motion is made the speaker typically nnounces that the 40 minutes for debating it will be equally divided between the chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee with jurisdiction over the m easure in question or their designees10 clause 1c of rule xv however provide s that the 40 minutes are to be divided between those in favor of and thos in opposition to the motion not merely between members of the majority and minority parties11 consequently another member may inquire if the ranking minor ity member opposes the motion if he or she does not which usually is the case the speaker assigns contro l of half the debate time to member who is opposed12 such challenges are infrequent because opponents usually can obtain sufficient time to present their case from the ranking minority member whatever his or her personal position may be13 the house then debates the suspension motion for maximum of 40 minutes14 with the allocation of time being at the discretion of the two members controlling it each of them usually makes an opening statement on the measure in question and then yields to other members who wish to participate in the debate after the 40 minutes have elapsed or after all requests for debate time have been satisfied thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs6 15 house practice ch 53 8 16 deschler 6 21155 17 deschler 6 2198house votes on the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill there is one vote on both parts of the motion it is not divisible amendments measure considered under suspension of the rules is not subject to amendment from the floor not even pro forma amendments offered fo r purposes of extending the debate15 amendments to the measure can be included however in the motion to suspend the rules more often than not these amendments are committee amendments in such case the majority floor manager moves to suspend the rules and pass the bill as amended if an am endment is not included in the motion the measure may be amended by withdrawing the initial motion and offering it novo in amended form alternatively the manager of the motion may subsequently modify it by unanimous consent separate votes on the amendments are permitted after debate the house casts one vote on the motion and on the measure as amended16 points of order moving to suspend the rules and pass measure has the effect of waiving all rules of the house including provisions of the budget act under which members might otherwise make points of order agai nst the measure any of its provisions or the amendments included in the motion17 points of order ma be made against the motion itself for example if it is offered on day not permitted by rule xv but the 100 million ceiling imposed by re publican conference rules cannot be enforced on the floor because it is not rule of the house clause 1b of rule xv states that pending motion that the house suspend the rules the speaker may entertain one motion that the house adjourn after the result of such motion is announced the sp eaker may not entertain any other motion until the vote is taken on the suspension consequently it is not in order to move to postpone recommit refer or tabl either the motion or the measure voting passage of measure under suspension of the rules requires support by two thirds of the members present and voting quorum being present the vote may be taken by voice by division or by electronic device or roll call clause 8 of rule xx permits the speaker to postpone and cluste r record votes on suspension motions until later time on the same day or within two legislative days this procedure is for the convenience of the members who might othe rwise have to cast series of record votes at intervals of more than 40 minuteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs7 if number of motions to suspend the rules are scheduled for consideration on the same day and especially if record votes are expected on several or all of them the speaker usually announces before the fi rst suspension motion is offered that he will postpone further proceedings toda on each motion to suspend the rules on which recorded vote or the yeas and na ys are ordered or on which the vote is objected to because of the absence of quorum he also announces when the postponed votes will take place either later on the same day or at some other time within two legislative days for example the house sometimes debates suspension motions on monday but the speaker defe rs any electronic votes on them until tuesday if member then obtains record vote on suspension motion or if he or she objects to voice or division vote on the ground that quorum is not present and makes point of order to this effect the speaker announces th at further proceedings on the motion will be postponed after th speakers announcement the point of order of quorum is considered as withdr awn since if quorum call did occur the purpose of postponing further action on the suspension motion would be lost the house then proceeds to consider additiona l motions to suspend the rules either taking final action on each by nonrecord vote or postponing final action if record vote is required when the time arrives for voting on the postponed motions the votes occur one after the other and in the order in which the motions were offere d before the first of these votes takes place the speaker ma announce that the time available for the first vote will be 15 minutes but that only five minutes will be allowed for the second and each succeeding vote the prac tice of postponing and clustering votes reduces the number of times that members have to come to the floor to vote on suspension motions especially on mondays when many representatives have other commitments also limiting the time for conducting most clustered votes to five minutes each reduces the total time devoted to voting when most members already are on the floor reconsideration if measure is passed under suspension member may move to reconsider the vote by which the house agreed to the mo tion such reconsideration motions usually are laid on the table and thereby killed in practice the speaker often announces that without objection motion to reconsid er is laid on the table motion to reconsider is in order if suspension motion fails subsequent action bill that is considered but not pa ssed under suspension of the rules is not necessarily dead when the house rej ects suspension motion it decides only that it is not prepared to pass the bill in ques tion under the constraints of the suspension procedure the bill may be brought before the house again for further consideration usually in committee of the whole under the rms of special rule at later datehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs8 18 deschler 6 21158 19 on at least one occasion measure that failed passage under suspension of the rules was later considered and passed again under spension procedures on july 15 2002 hr 3479 bill to expand aviation capacity failed under suspension of the rules by vote of 247143 on july 23 also under suspension the bill passed 34387 20 data on the 89th 92nd congresses are presented in the archived crs report bills considered under suspension of the rule s in the house of representatives 89th92nd congresses by mildred amerduring the same congress18 theoretically measure that has failed under suspension procedures could be considered again under the same procedures but this tactic is rarely attempted19 evolution of suspension procedures the procedures for suspending house ru originally were useful device to supersede the regular order of business so that the house could take up the bills it considered most timely and important during the 19th century however these procedures also became an attractive way for individual members to bring matters of their choice to the floor leading to criticisms that such motions often were disruptive and timeconsuming distractions from the orderly consideration of legislation as result the house gradually imposed restrictions on suspension motions limiting the days on which they could be offered requiring majority votes to consider them and finally giving the speaker c ontrol over them through his discretionary power of recognition in addition the house devised an alternativ way to set aside the order of business through resolutions that the rules committee reports and that the house adopts by simple majority vote increased use during the 20th century suspension motions came to be an increasingly established and accepted means for taking up and passing relativ ely noncontroversial bills that enjoy bipartisan support alt hough the available data are incomplete and not always comparable from congress to c ongress they do indicate that the use of suspensions has increased during recent congresses an average of fewer than 200 measures were considered under susp ension procedures during each twoyear congress from the 89th to the 92nd20 in the 108th congress the number of measures considered under suspension burgeoned to 924 in part these data reflect th at at the beginning of the 93rd congress the number of suspension days was increased from the first and third mondays of each month to the first and third mondays and the tuesda ys following and then at the beginning of the 95th congress to every monday and tues day in addition to the last six days of each session as mentioned earlier 109th congress rules change added wednesday to the days on which suspension motions could be entertained changes in the numbers of suspension motions howev er undoubtedly are attributable as wellhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs9 to changes in congressional workload and to the success of committees in resolving legislative issues before they reach the floor the frequency with which the house has agreed to the suspension motions offered by members suggests that in most cases measures considered in this way would have passed if they had been considered under ss restrictive procedures however there undoubtedly have been in stances in which measures have been brought to the floor under suspension mo tions in order to minimize debate and especially to preclude amendments some representatives also have argu ed that considering measures under suspension and then clustering votes on series of such motions discourages members from informing themselves in deta il about the measures and their probable effects the very fact that bill or re solution is considered under suspension may be taken by some as evidence that it does not require as much careful and skeptical scrutiny as other measures therefore critics have argued the increasing use of suspension motions to achieve efficiency and save time may detract from the care and deliberation with which the house should act in its legislative procedures the hous needs to strike difficult balance between deliberation and dispatch the hi story of the suspension procedure to be discussed in the remainder of this report offers clear evidence that the house has adjusted and undoubtedly will continue to adjust its rules and practices as they affect this balance in response to the changing pressures and circumstances the house confrontshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474 crs10 table 2 house action on all measures considered under suspension of the rules 101st

postponed or changed except by vote of at least twothirds of the members present thus by the 20th congress it had become established that an extraordinary majority of the house could set aside its

or by suspension of the rules thirtytwo years later it was by suspension of the rules that the house considered and agreed to reso lution establishing procedures for debating the impeachment of president andrew johnson28 during this period motions were made to suspend the rules for variety of purposes such as dispensing with the reading of amendments29 however suspension motions had their greatest impac t on house procedures as means for setting aside the regular order of business in favor of particular measures in the case of the 1868 motion regarding the johnson impeachment after representative elihu b was hburne of illinois moved to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution speaker schuyler colfax of indiana overruled point of order that the house had right to vote separately on suspending the rules and then on agreeing to the resolution30 but the usual practice at the time was for member to move to suspend the rules to make consideration of measure in order the measure itself then would be considered under the regular pr ocedures of the house the use of the suspension motion for this purpose had the dvantage of altering the normal order of business but it also had the disadvantage of requiring twothirds vote for this reason an alternative proce dure was developed for bringi ng measures before the house for consideration31 special orders have been in use in th house from the early days but the method of making them has not always been the same often they were made by unanimous consent and sometimes this method is used at the present time if there was objection they were made by suspension of the rules which was in order more frequently in the earlier years than at present this method was cumbersome since on any question which involved party differences the attempt was very likely to fail in 1882 in the first session of the fortyseventh congress it was the usage and apparently the only method in case where there was opposition to offer under motion to susp end the rules resolution providing for consideration of bill at given time this required twothirds vote and minority would sometimes refuse consent to the order until they had exacted terms as to kinds of amendments that should be permitted etc it was in the second session of the fortyseventh congress in 1883 that the method of adopting special order by majority vote after report from the committee on rules was first used this method was not in great favor in the next three congresses but in the fifty first congress it was used frequently and since 1890 has been in favor as an efficient means of bringing up for consideration bills difficult to reach in the regular order and especially as ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs15 32 constitution jeffersons manual and

special orders are made yet by unanimous consent or under suspension of the rules but only as to matters to which the opposition is not extensive once it became accepted that the house could temporarily put aside its order of business by adopting by majority vot resolution reported by the rules committee the use of motions to suspend the rules for this purpose fell into decline32 however this usage did not immedi ately disappear altogether in 1906 representative john dalzell of pennsylvania moved to susp end the rules to make specific bill in order for consider ation at any time in response33 mr david armond of missouri made the point of order that this proposition ought to go to the committee on rules because it provided for precisely the same condition of things that existed when measure was reported from the committee on rules suspension day was to dispose of things not to provide for their disposal at some other time and this was really in effect special rule without having been referred to the committee on rules the speaker overruled the point of order saying the chair will state to the gentleman from ssouri that his point of order in the opinion of the chair is not well taken th is is one of the mondays in the month when it is in order to move to suspend the rules and do anything where member is recognized providing twothirds of the members vote for the motion this ruling by speaker joseph g cannon of illinois indicates that motions to suspend the rules continued to be made for purposes other than to take up and dispose of measures for example in 1908 representativ dalzell of pennsylvania offered resolution on which the house or dered the previous question another member then demanded division of the stion into several parts at which point representative dalzell moved to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution point of order was made against the motion but was overruled by speaker cannon34 three years later point of order was raised against conference report when it was called up for consideration before the speaker ruled representative albert s burleson of texas moved to suspend the rules and agree to the report the

practice developed of adopting special rules reported by the committee on rules change occurred in the primary use of suspension motions they came to be used principally to enable the house to take up and dispose of measures that did not evoke substantial opposition especially opposition th at divided the house along partisan lines more recently however some members contended that the suspension procedure was being used excessively and inappropriately and especially to the disadvantage of the minority party in march 1975 for example the house republican task force on reform issued series of proposals for changing house organization and procedure its statemen t on suspension of the rules included the following37 it is clear from the legislative record of the 93d congress that the more the suspension procedure is used the more it is abused to the detriment of sound legislative practice and results the fact that numerous bills were defeated under suspension and that some were even cynically brought up under suspension for the very purpose of defeating them is sufficient evidence that this procedure must be modified and restricted while we do not favor the outright repeal of the suspension procedure and recognize its utility if limited to minor noncontroversial legislation we must strongly protest its increasing utilization for cynical purposes or on major controversial bills while our committees ordinarily do thorough and responsible job on the legislation they report their work should not be allowed to go unchallenged or unaltered on the house floor or to pass in substitute for the will of the house the full and free working of the legislative process should not be sacrificed for the sake of expediency representative james c cleveland of new hampshire made much the same argument at 1978 hearing of the rules committee38 at the same time the legislation considered under suspension has more and more frequently included the highly significant already dozens of nonroutine measures have been identified on the suspension calendar sic during the present congress they were judged to be nonroutine on the basis of such criteria as amount of spending aut horized

members of the house democratic st udy group responded to survey on possible changes in the hous by supporting the general proposition that the house should establish st rict standards to restrict bills on suspension to those which are truly routine and which do not contain authorizations in excess of 1 million39 the democratic caucus re sponded to these concerns as well as to concerns about the sheer number of bills considered under suspension when it held its organizational meetings afte r the 1978 congressional election40 faced with the difficulty of establishing guidelines fo r measures that should be taken up under suspension of the rules the caucus accep ted cost criterion but instead of proposing an additional amendment to h ouse rules the caucus amended its own rules the new caucus rule generally directed the speaker not to schedule bill or resolution for consideration under suspension if legislative or executive branch cost estimate indicated that the measure would make or authorize appropriations of more than 100 million in fiscal year the same rule also provided that the democratic steering and policy committee could authorize exceptions to the rule at that time the democratic caucus could impose such directive on the speaker because as the majority party it nominated him for the ection that occurs on the first day of each new congress the 100 million ceiling could not be enforced on the house floor however because it was not rule of the house itself the republican majority adopted conference rule 28 that imposed the same 100 million ceiling in the 109th congress the rule was modified the 100 million dollar proviso was dropped under the new requirements the majority leader may not schedule any bill for considerati on under suspension which

move to suspend the rules these ch anges first decreased and then increased opportunities for suspension motions origina lly such motions were in order daily and were made by leaders of the house in order to arrange the order of business but also by other representatives for their own purposes it appears that individual members made suspension motions so often that they eventually disrupted the orderly and timely considera tion of legislation conse quently by 1847 the rules of the house had been amended to permit th motions only on mondays and during the last 10 days of session except when made for specific purposes42 except during the last ten days of the session the speaker shall not entertain motion to suspend the rules of the house at any time except on monday of every week provided

after week and month after month the whole morning hour and perhaps two or th ree hours each day consumed in making motions to suspend the rules motion which had become so common as to be considered almost test vote43 it seems likely that the opportunity to move to suspend the rules at the end of session was used frequently by members on behalf of measures of limited importance or parochial interest as mary parker follett wrote in her study of the speaker of the house44 during the last 10 days of congress when the rules may be suspended at any time the power of the speaker is at its

significant respects first the committee on rules recommended and the house agreed to an amendment providing that motions to suspend the rules should be seconded by ma jority vote taken by tellers if second was demanded second the house also agreed to the committees recommendation that motions to suspend the rules wh seconded should be debatable for 30 minutes these amendments are discussed under later headings of this report third the new rule regarding committee of the whole longer included provision for the rules to be suspended at any time for the purpose of going into committee of the whole or discharging the committee from further consideration of measure referred to it this provision had been part of the 1847 rule governing suspension of the rules quoted above but in 1860 was placed instead with other rules affecting committee of the whole the elimination of this provision seems to indicate that motions to suspend the ru were longer being used as primary means for structuring the order of business on the house floor this conclusion also is supported by comments made in debate on another amendment to the proposed new rule xxv iii on suspension of the rules formerly rule 145 in this fourth major change in procedure the house agreed to proposal made by representative william p frye of maine on behalf of the rules committee that motions to suspend the rules be allowed only on the first and third mondays of each month instead of every monday with preference to be given to individual members on the first monday and to committees on the third monday theme of the 1880 debate was that members were not using the opportunity to move to suspend the rules for serious legislative purposes in support of limiting suspension motions to two days per month representative frye argued45 it will at once be seen what this amendment will effect if adopted it will leave all the mondays but two in each month for useful business and legislation under the present rule motions for suspen sion of the rules can be made on every monday now few gentlemen in this house have failed to see what the effect of such rule as that has been nd since i have been in the congress the result has been that twothirds of th time on each monday has been utterly and entirely wasted in the first place it is understood that any gentleman under the present rule may bring before the house any resolution he may see fit and compel us to vote upon it political resolutions are in order nd to prevent their being offered to the house every now and then we adjourn i

of measures that had been reported favorably by committee and distributed to the members in printed form requirements th at also would protect against precipitate passage of legislation at th end of congressional sessions speaking against these proposals repres entative edward h gillette of iowa contended that the motion to suspend the rules is the only door open if it is open to an individual who is in the minority in this house and wishes to bring some measures before this body for action47 the majority however evidently concluded that suspension motions had become nuisance and embarrassment that should be curtailed although limitati ons were placed on what suspension motions might be offered the house did re duce from four days to one day per month the opportunity for individual members to make such motions the third monday of each month was reserved for members acting on behalf of committees to offer suspension motions for consideration of m easures that had been reported favorably when the newly revised house rule s were published in june 1880 rule xxviii on change or suspension of rules read as follows48 1 standing rule or order of the h ouse shall be

third monday of each month in 1890 speaker thomas b reed of maine ruled that motion to suspend the rules and pass measure could be made on behalf of committee only if the measure had been referred to that committee49 in the same year he also ruled that member offering suspension motion on behalf of committee had to be formally and specifically authorized to do so by the committee50 eleven years later speaker david b henderson of iowa ruled that on thir d mondays measures considered under suspension could only carry amendments authorized by the committee of jurisdiction51 by 1921 however the distinction in the rule between first and third mondays was longer bein g observed consistently52 although the distinction remained until 1973 it came to have little significan ce as the expectation became firmly established that most measures considered under suspension would first have been reported from committee in 1890 the time for debating suspen sion motion was extended from 30 to 40 minutes and the reference to the call of states and territories was stricken because of change in the order of business four years later the first provision of the rule regarding rescissions or changes of house rules was eliminated as well having been rendered obsolete by the development of the rules committees jurisdiction over proposed rules changes and during the 54th congress the number of votes necessary to adopt suspension motion was changed from twothirds of the members present to twothirds of the members voting quorum being present53 but with these few exceptions rule xxviii as dopted in 1880 was identical to rule xxvii adopted by the 92nd congress in january 1971 during the 19th century the trend in the house was to limit the opportunities for moving to suspend the rules by contrast during the late 20th century the trend has been in the opposite direction this change in sentiment most likely reflected changes in the purposes for which such motions have been made which in turn resulted partly from changes in the speakers power of recognition on the floor in brief as the speakers power of recognition increased suspending the rules became more limited and disciplined

the congressional record an article by hinds on the order of business in the house part of which read54 there does exist an arbitrary recogniti on on the motion to suspend the rules formerly the speaker was compelled to recognize any member who first got his attention on the motion to suspend the rule s the result was that the motion was greatly abused men would prepare resolutions on subjects of practical standing in the house sometimes so ar tfully worded as to be political traps condemning many members to political dang er in their districts whether they voted for or against them members therefore did not naturally like to run the risk of such pitfalls or to be put on record upon questions not of practical moment to the united states or which might involve local prejudices in their homes and thus destroy their usefulne ss without any compensating good so it happened that frequently the house on suspension days adjourned in order to escape this snare and in 1880 the number of suspension days were reduced to two week sic so as to make the dangers of the day as little as possible about that time mr speaker randall wit hout complaint of the house began to exercise the right to determine when he would recognize for the motion thus still further placing it under control if the mo tion to suspend the rules were essential to the business of the house this us urpation by mr speaker randall would have had bad consequences but in 1883 and in 1890 the rules were improved by enlarging the functions of the committee on rules and by improving the rule for the order of business so that bills in an unfavorable position might be gotten out by majority vote without recourse to the older and clumsier method of suspending the rules and today the moti on to suspend the rules is used two days in the month to supplement the proceeding by unanimous consent there are many bills which cannot get through by unanimous consent because two or three members may be opposed in such cases the motion to suspend the rules affords convenient and easy method of dealing with them between 1880 and 1909 the house elected fo rceful speakers such as samuel j randall

rules that eventually transformed the suspension motion into wellregulated device for considering relatively nonc ontroversial measures once this transformation had taken place ad hoc adjustments and

to offer suspension motions could become intense during the closing days of session it was under such circumstances that speaker nicholas longworth of ohio made the following comments70 the chair agrees that suspension of the rules is not normal legislative procedure in sense it is trifle unfair in that it limits debate and does not permit the right of amendment if anybody thinks that the chair covets the right to recognize or not to recognize motions to suspend the rules in the last six days of session he is far from being correct it is one of the most burdensome unpleasant duties that can fall to the lot of member of congress it is always unpleasant for the present occupant of the chair to say four out of five times as he is compelled to do but there are times when suspension of th rules is vitally necessary to dispatch public business it is going to be vitally necessary in the next few hours because very few hours remain before adjournment and the chair must use his discretion when he believes it is in the interest of large majority of the house to use the right of suspension i think the chair is safe in saying that not more than three or four times since his incumbency of this office for the past six years has the motion to suspend the rules out of hundreds of cases received less than the necessary twothirds in other words the chair was in fact aiding the house to carry out its will longworths concluding observation indi cates the extent to which suspension of the rules had become procedure used almost exclusively for one purpose for expeditious floor consideration of measur enjoying the support of more than majority of house members by unanimous consent or by resolution the restrictions of the rules have been and continue to be set aside mporarily when floor action on such measures could not be accommodated on the regular suspension days the expansion of suspension days during the 108th congress to include most wednesdays is the most recent acknowledgment of the belief that the number of suspension dayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs26 71 congressional record vol 119 jan 3 1973 p 18 72 ibid p 21specified in house rules may be insufficient to meet current requirements for expediting legislative scheduling prior to the 108th congress expansion the house voted on two occasions during the 1970s to change what was then rule xxvii so as to make suspension motions in order more often on january 3 1973 the house adopted its rules for the 93rd congress including two changes in its suspension procedures first motions to suspend the rules were made in order on the first and third mondays of each month and the tuesdays following as well as during the final si x days of session second the rule longer gave preference to motions by individual members on some days and to motions made at the direction of committees on others four years later when the house adopted hres 5 making rules changes for the 95th congress suspension procedures were again changed to allow the rules to be suspended on every monday and tuesday during the 1973 debate members of th minority party opposed increasing the number of suspension days on the ground that it would permit too many bills including bills of considerable cost and significance to be considered with only limited debate and without opportunity for floor ame ndments illustrative of these concerns was the following statement by re presentative gerald r ford of michigan the minority leader71 as i understand the historical justifica tion for suspension it was for the purpose of considering relatively unimportant legi slation or legislation where there was little or controversy and the net result was the rules of the house said that on every first and third monday we should have suspension and in addition during the last 6 days after the date of an adj ournment has been set i think that is good rule but now mr speaker to double to increase by hundred percent the days on which we can have suspensions in my judgment is going too far because suspensions as all of us who have been here know mean that you can take bill involving billions of dollars involving literally hundreds of thousands of words and put it on suspension and you could not amend dollar and you could not amend word and i do not believe that is the way to legislate in response the majority leader representative thomas p oneill of massachusetts argued that increasing th number of suspension days would permit more even distribution of workload on the floor and that measures were only brought up under suspension with the prio r knowledge and consent of the minority72 mr oneill they have complained because on one day we had 46 suspension bills which made for long night session is this way to legislate why should we not have quit at 8 oclock that night and brought up the remaining suspensions the next dayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs27 73 congressional record vol 123 jan 4 1977 p 58 74 ibidthat is what we have in mind that is what we would like to do we do not want to go until 2 or 3 oclock in the morning how does bill get on the suspension calendar the gentleman from new hampshire mr cleveland wants to know i am sure the minority leader knows although the chairman of the committee goes to the speaker he always clears the legislation with the minority member of the committee mr gerald r ford if the chairman of the committee gets permission from the speaker to be recognized it does not make any difference whether the ranking minority member or the minority leader is consulted at all mr oneill i appreciate that but i will say to the gentleman i think we have always been extremely fair along the line when the majority whip organization calendar is made up the speaker inevitably says to the chairman is this bill going to be controversial matter af ter all as the gentleman from michigan knows it takes twothirds vote of this congress to pass bill on the suspension calendar why if the minority member of the committee is opposed to it rare is the occasion when suspension goes on the calendar during debate on the rules for the 95th congress opposition focused principally on the fact that the resolution to adopt th rules was not open to amendment the minority leader representative john j rhodes of arizona inserted in the record summary of amendments that would have been offered if the parliamentary circumstances permitted including the following73 suspension of the rules clause 1 of rule xxvii is amended to prohibit bringing up any matter under suspension of the rules unless authorized by rollcall vote of the committee having jurisdiction or by joint request of the chairman and ranking minority member under the present procedure the chairman may unilaterally request bringing matter up under suspension the minority leaders insertion also include d this critique and proposal by the house republican task force on reform74 at the beginning of the 93rd congress the use of the suspension motion was increased from 2 to 4 days per month majority of the republican members opposed such an expansion of the suspen sion procedure as detrimental to sound legislative practice although assurances were given by the democrat leadership that the suspension rule would be us ed sparingly and be limited to minor noncontroversial legislation what has occurred is an abuse of suspensions with bill after bill being considered under an essentially closed rule procedure limited debate with amendments the end result debasement of the legislative process the task force on reform has recommended strongly thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs28 75 congressional record vol 137 jan 3 1991 p 46 see also hres 127

to any bill which is to be brought up under suspension 4 prior to scheduling bill under suspension the majority party leadership would consult with the minority leader even with these safeguards expanded use of suspensions is simply an invitation to further abuse notwithstanding these objections the rules for the 95th congress were adopted by rollcall vote of 256 to 142 with opportunity for floor amendments the republican minority continued to seek changes in the suspension procedure that would have required formal notice to all members of the suspension motions the speaker intended to entertain as part of their package of rules changes proposed in 1991 on the opening day of the 102nd congress there were several proposed changes in suspension procedures including the following75 it shall not be in order to entertain motion to suspend the rules and pass or agree to any measure or matter unless written notice is placed in the congressional record of its scheduled consideration at least one calendar day prior to its consideration and such notification shall include the numerical designation of the measure or matter its short title and the text of any amendments to be offered thereto and the date on which the measure or matter is scheduled to be considered the democratic majority resisted such proposals as unwelcome intrusions on the majority party leaderships control over arranging the floor schedule and the republican majority thus far has not instituted any pertinent rules changes of its own the result is that members of both parties remain dependent on ffective but informal and discretionary notification practices to alert them to the propositions on which they will be asked to vote through suspension motions who decides what suspension motions the house sha ll consider until the closing decades of the 19th century speakers did not exercise as much discretion as they do now in recognizing members to offer motions to suspend the rules consequently such motions coul d be used especially by minority party members to raise issues for parochial or partisan advantage during the 20th centuryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs29 76 writing in 1928 changwei chiu asserted that some measures such as appropriations public buildings and rivers and harbors are br ought up under the suspension of the rules with the distinct purpose of shutting off amendments or unnecessary riders chiu the speaker of the house of representatives since 1896 p 217 on november 15 1983 representative peter rodino of new jersey ch airman of the judiciary committee moved to suspend the rules and pass joint resolu tion proposing an equal rights amendment to the constitution the motion was rejected by vote of 278 47 also see deschler 6 21921 77 congressional record vol 115

the rules to expedite action on relatively noncontroversial legisl ation nonetheless there were occasional charges during recen t decades that specific measures were brought up under the suspension procedure in order to avoid the possibility of floor amendments76 although the rules are now suspended frequently to pass house or senate measure reported from committee this is not always the case at the beginning of the 91st congress for instance bill was brought up under suspension even before the standing committee of jurisdiction was organized to consider it77 the house also has suspended the rules to take from the speakers table housepassed bill with senate amendments and agree to the amendments or agree to them with house amendments to cite just one exam ple from the 1970s representative harley staggers of west virginia then chairman of the committee on interstate and foreign commerce now the energy and commerce committee moved to suspend the rules and agree to resolution to concur in senate amendment to house amendment with further house amendment in the nature of substitute after this motion failed to receive twothirds vote stagge rs offered second suspension motion that if adopted would have changed the proposed new house amendment in one significant respect this motion also fa iled as did third successive suspension motion which proposed simply that the house agree to the senate amendment78 thus the house may suspend the rules to consider measures at various stages of the legislative process for example house or senate bills coming to the house floor for the first time or bills returned to the house with senate amendments79 the question remains who decides whether measure at whatever stage of the process will be considered under suspension of the rule s to put it differently to what extent is the consideration of suspension motions controlled by the house or its majority party leadership the suspension procedure was am ended in 1880 to provide that all motions to suspend the rules shall before being submitted to the house be seconded by majority by tellers if demanded according to hinds this requirement w as intended to prevent the offering of

positions on resolutions on subjects of practical standing in the house sometimes so artfully worded as to be political traps condemn ing many members to political danger in their districts whether they voted for or against them81 similar provision had been adopted in 1874 but abandoned two years later whereas the house agreed to the 1880 rules change without controversy an extended and informative debate took place when the house first voted to require that suspension motions be subject to demand for second this requirement was first debated on the floor in december 18 73 the committee on rules had recomme nded unanimously that rule 145 be amended to read as follows82 standing rule or order of the house shall be rescinded or changed without one days notice being given of the motion therefor nor shall any rule be suspended except by vote of at least twothirds of the members present nor without the motion therefor being seconded by majority as in the case of the previous question this language had the same effect as requiring teller vote on ordering second because at that time rollcall vote coul d not be demanded on vote to second the demand for the previous question83 proponents of this change in the rule s argued that it would expedite floor activity by enabling house members to decide by majority vote whether they wished to consider suspension motion althoug h motions to suspend the rules were not then debatable they were subject to demands for rollcall votes members of the rules committee believed that such motions had often been offered and rollcall votes demanded merely for purposes of lay in other cases they asserted members had offered suspension motions pecially to adopt resolutions without any expectation that the motions would be approved instead these motions were drafted and proposed only to create politi cal embarrassment the demand for second if rejected by an unrecorded major ity vote would enable members to avoid having

single item of the legislation of the country84 on behalf of the rules committee representative horace ma ynard of tennessee contended85 now then if any gentleman has measure which he regards as of such consequence that the rules of the h ouse should be suspended and immediate action had upon it let him appeal to the house in the first place and see whether he can get majority vote because if he cannot it is utterly idle to suppose that he could ever get twothirds to vote with him this is proposition that will save time and will protect the rights of minorities it will prevent our monday mornings and the last ten days of the session from being consumed upon impracticable measures when there are measures of real importance upon which if the house could get at them it would act favorably it seemed to the committee and they were unanimous on this question that this was wise provision calculated to facilitate the public business and protect the rights of everybody while interfering with the just privileges of none on the other hand opponents of the proposal contende d that suspension motions offered individual members and especially members of the minority party their only opportunity to raise issues of their choice on the floor and to force votes on them this opportunity would be eliminated if the house could vote to refuse to consider these motions and do so by unrecorded teller votes the two positions were summarized aptly in the following exchange between representative maynard and representative william j obrien of maryland86 mr obrien i desire to illustrate the effect of this proposed rule under the existing rule i may have resolution for instance resolution of inquiry upon which i desire the action of the h ouse and moving suspension of the rules to adopt the resolution i can demand the yeas and nays upon the motion and even though i know the resolution will be defeated yet if onefifth of the members present should consent to order the yeas and nays i can obtain record in that form but if the rules be amended as proposed by the gentleman from tennessee then in such case as i have stated unless i can get majority of the house to second the demand for the previous question sic so that my resolution can be entertained i can get information as to who are and are not willing to order the inquiry proposed by the resolution i ask the gentleman from tennessee whether that is or is not pr actical illustration of the operation of this proposition mr maynard mr speaker it is not presumed that gentlemen come here for the purpose of wasting public time upon questions and propositions which they know have nothing in them which can be interposed only for the sake of delay propositions which have practical vitality but which merely seek to ventilate or air the opinion of those submitting the propositions gentleman i suppose will for moment maintain that such is the object for which his constituents have sent him

was recommitted without objection to the rule s committee for further study month later in january 1874 the proposal again wa s reported in slightly different form and the debate resumed representative benjamin f butler of massachusetts described how the legislative business of the house had b een delayed and disrupted by members offering suspension motions on one subject while the house was in the midst of considering more pressing legislation on another by contrast representative william s holman of indiana characterized such ploys as necessary means for obstructing the plundering schemes which have from time to time been sought to be rushed through this house in the closing hours of the session87 representative holman also argued that the proposal for unrecorded teller votes violated the constitutional rights of onefifth of the members present to demand the years and nays on any question represen tative clarkson n potter of new york among others supported this pos ition even t hough he disapproved of many of the measures considered under suspension88 in some casesthey attach preambles to their resolutions preambles which are absolutely true while the resolutions appended are entirely objectionable the practice is i concede an abuse and an evil but it does not after all mislead the country or do very much harm we have to be sure during this very session seen the house upon monday putting itself by the doption of conflicting resolutions in two or three different positions on the same day each one inconsistent with the others but such votes only have the effect of showing the country how little the buncombe action of the house on mondays amounts to the constitutional argument was rejected by butler and others who sought to distinguish between question and motion for question89 the difference is this when any question is put for the action of the house in legislation or otherwise the members have the right to record their votes on the demand of onefifth of those present but when the motion comes up will we have this subject up today or shall we take the other up tomorrow then they have right to invoke this constitutional provision in their behalf because it is on the order of business butler also recalled that under the existing rules the house sometimes had adjourned rather than vote on m easures brought up under suspension90 how did it operate yesterday we voted on two or three things which were mere matters of theoretical politics and to pr event those things being sprung in the house the only protection that the majority of the house had was to adjourn sohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs33 91 ibid p 790 92 ibid p 791 93 floyd m riddick the organization and procedure of the united states congress

is the only protection that the majority of the house have by changing the rules he argued mbers would be protected against being compelled to vote on whatever measures were offered under suspension without the benefit of debate or time for thought the case for changing the rules was well summarized by representative james garfield of ohio91 the plain purport of this rule is that it shall not be the right of one member or onefifth not of the political minority only but of the majority to push aside the business of this house and by the help of onefifth compel every other man in this house to vote on any subject he pleases without word of debate and without chance of amendment any one man with onefifth of the house at his back can put the house through its paces on any question on earth that he pleases this rule only provides that before any one member shall be empowered to do this he shall show that majority of the members are willing that the question shall be brought before them and disposed of without amendment or debate in the precise words he pleases to use the resolution to change the rules was finally adopted by vote of 123 to 101 before the vote took place garfield noted that we so metimes need suspension of the rules in order to fix day for considering some measure92 but the 18731874 debate and vote and the vote in 1880 to reinstate the provision for demanding second illustrates to what extent the us of suspension motions had changed from an effective means for organizing the busin ess of the house to an equally effective means for accommodating individual members and interfering with the planned schedule of legislative activity according to floyd m riddick nate parliamentarian 19641974 if question of second is raise d the bill will not be debate d but the vote will be taken immediately93 however it became routine practi ce in the house for second to be demanded by the ranking minority member of the subcommittee or committee with jurisdiction over the measure and for the s econd to be considered as ordered without objection contrary to this general practice howev er the house refused to order second on two suspension motions during the 95th congress on november 1 1977 representative stephen j so larz of new york moved to suspend the rules and pass hr 9282 deferring the effective date of future congressional salary adjustments and making

the middle income student assistance act although debate is permitted before second is ordered or refused representative thomas b evans jr of delaware explained the reason for his opposition immediately before th suspension motion was offered95 assistance for middleincome taxpayers to meet increasing educational expenses is one of the most important issues facing the congress to bring such an important measure up under suspension of the rules is simple attempt by the administration to ramrod this approa ch through the congress without adequate opportunity for full and open debate american families need relief from mounting educational costs but in not providing the opportunity for full discussion we are further corrupting the deliberative legislative process these instances were excep tional the house usually agreed without objection that is by unanimous consent to orde r seconds on suspension motions however the right of any member to force the h ouse to vote on ordering second preserved the opportunity for the house to decide not to consider such motion on the other hand the same right also created an oppor tunity for members to demand rollcall votes and thereby delay the work of the house as way of expressing their displeasure at some unrelated legislative development there were votes at all on ordering seconds from 1973 to 1976 then between march and july of 1978 there were 13 such votes96 on june 28 1978 alone five votes on ordering seconds took pl ace all evidently unrelated to the merits of the bills at issue in each case memb er objected to the result of the teller vote on the ground that quorum was not present triggering an automatic roll call vote but more than five members voted against seconding any one of the five suspension motions such events pointed to concern among some members that their time and the time of the house was being consumed needlessly by an increasing number of rollcall votes that were not seriously contested and that occurred on procedural questions which fe w if any members opposed on their own merits on august 14 1978 the subcommittee on ru and organization of the house of the rules committee

its removal from the house rules has arrived it has long ceased to serve its original purpose of protecting the memb ers from considering matter that they dont desire and is now filibustering tac tic used to thwart the leadership in its responsibility for programming the houses business but more important it wastes the time of all of us without regard to how we stand on the merits of particular measures being considered from time to time on suspension this is exactly what our predecessors aimed at preventing in 1880 in reply representative james c clev eland of new hampsh ire contended that98 without this protection members would face an increasing threat of being forced to record simple aye or nay on legislation which may be highly significant extremely costly far more controversial than expected and often hastily considered in committee all w ithout the possibility of obtaining needed information through adequate debate or of considering possible options through the amendment process thus the resolution before you would strip us all of our flak jackets at the very time the risk of political land mines is growing and the threat to the public interest is even more acute when the 96th congress convened on january 15 1979 the resolution adopting the rules of the house incorporated num ber of amendments proposed by the house democratic caucus several of these amendments were designed according to representative james c wright jr of texas to save the time of the house to save the taxpayers waste of that valuable time and to save members the harassment that has sometimes come with procedural demands that they present themselves and vote on meaningless votes99 among the amendments was one that waived the requirement for second where printed c opies of the measure or matter as proposed to be passed or agreed to by the motion ve been available for one legislative day before the motion is considered100 on january 3 1991 at the beginning of the 102nd

march 1 1881 pp 2296 2297explained what this rules change would do but felt need to justify or defend it nor did republicans specifically oppose it101 by eliminating the possibility of votes on seconding suspension motions these rules changes removed an opportunity for d ilatory tactics on the floor at the same time however they also removed the ability of the house to vote against considering suspension motions this second effect concerned the member s who believed that the suspension procedure was being used with increasing frequency to pass bills that were too important and contr oversial to be debated for more than 40 minutes and with opportunity for amendment on the floor not coincidentally therefore the same 19781979 series of democr atic caucus meetings th at led to severely limiting votes on seconds also resulted in the caucus rule imposing the 100 million ceiling on the cost of bills the speaker should pe rmit to be considered under suspension the same ceiling that the republican majo rity now has included in its conference rules thus the democratic caucus limited the power of the speaker to entertain suspension motions at roughly the same time that the house limited its own power to vote against considering them nonetheless this restriction on the speakers discretion is less significant than the control that he retains over suspension motions each motion to suspend the rules still must have the speakers acquiescence or approval and this requireme nt has had significant ffect on the development and use of the procedure for reasons alread discussed rule xv specifies when the speaker may entertain motions to suspend th rules but he is not required to do so at any time through his power of recogniti on therefore the speaker controls which matters are considered under suspension and when they are raised for consideration in his article quoted earlier hinds stat that in the early 1880s mr speaker samuel j randall without co mplaint of the house began to exercise the right to determine when he would recognize for the motion102 in the published precedents the first cited instance of the speakers discretionary power occurred in 1880 when the following exchange took place103 mr robeson the motion that i make is the regular order it is in accordance with the rules it is moti on to suspend the rules allowed by the rules and

prevailed the motion to suspend the rules has been one depending on recognition that is it can not be made unless the member is recognized to make it the chair in speaking of this motion as one of the highest privilege did not mean to convey the idea that necessarily when the day comes for motions to suspend the rules the chair must recognize gentleman to make such motion speaker david b henderson

declined to recognize him stating108 the chair will not recognize any gentleman unless the chair knows about the matter the chair will not recognize the gentleman unless he consults the chair in

the speaker for recognition to move to suspend the rules those requests are now coming in rapidly it is impossible for the chair to keep in mind all of the requests and the merits of the bills at the close of the last session the chair requested all members desiring to move to suspend the rules to put their requests in writing and to accompany their requests with the bill and report the chair will again make that request for the rema inder of the session it worked very well last year and the chair hopes that it will this year thus by the 1920s if not before speaker s had come to exert effective control over what measures might be considered unde r suspension of the rules but if the following statement by speaker champ clar k of missouri is indicative this power was not exercised arbitrarily110 if there is pronounced sentiment in the house amounting to majority or anywhere approximating twothirds in favo r of the consideration of particular bill whether it be big or little bill i believe it is the business of the speaker to recognize some gentlemen under the susp ension of the rules to call that bill up speaker frederick h gillett evidently dopted similar policy on august 28 1922 he was asked what suspension motions were likely to be brought up in reply he stated that he will recognize motions for suspension without the consent of the gentleman from tennessee minor ity leader finis j garrett111 it appears however that during the 1920s the minority leader was not always consulted in this way and that there had not yet been developed regular means for informing all members about the suspensi on motions that the speaker intended to entertain in 1926 minority leader garrett found it necessary to ask the speaker on the floor will there be any suspension today112 under current practice by contrast suspension motions are routinel listed on the whip notices of expected floor activity each week in the houses recent practice moreover when additional suspension motions are considered advan ce notice usually has been given for example on march 5 1974 after representa tive harold r gross of iowa sought recognition to offer suspension

was offered without regard to the socalled gross rule which is tradition in which the house is required to have 24 hours advance notice114 to ensure that all members are adequately forewarned the house republican task force on reform later proposed that at least thr ee calendar days advance notice be given to any bill which is to be brought up under suspension this issue also was addressed in mocratic caucus ru 39 on guidelines on suspensions of house rules which stated in part that115 in scheduling any bill or resolution for consideration under the suspension of the rules of the house the speaker of the house shall provide notice to all members of the house of representatives by at least three calendar days excluding saturdays sundays and legal holidays but including the day on which such bill or resolution is considered under the susp ension of the rules of the house that said bill or resolution has been schedul ed for consideration under the suspension of the rules of the house the speaker of the house of representatives shall provide sufficient time for members of the house to receive copies of the whip advisory regarding any bill or resolution for consideration under the suspension of the rules of the house or comparable analysis of such bill or resolution in case shall such time be less than two calendar days excluding saturdays sundays and legal holidays but including the day on which such bill or resolution is considered under suspension again however these provisions were not rules of the house and so were not enforceable on the floor although republi can conference rules do not contain such provision the need for it is largely obviat ed by the conferences insistence that each suspension motion have the concurrence of the ranking minority member of the appropriate committee in sum motions to suspend the rules were once offered by individual members at their own discretion and for various purposes gradually though the suspension procedure evolved into regu lar and relatively routine procedure that usually is used for acting on measures reported by committee and favored by the speaker until recently rule xxvii now rule xv permitted the house to refuse to consider suspension motion by voting not to order second this opportunity rarely was exercised and has now been eliminated ltogether yet it remains unusual for the house to consider bill under suspension that does not enjoy at least majority support of the more than 4000 measures considered under suspension of the rules from the 101st through the 107th congresses fewer than 100 failed to attract the necessary twothirds support moreover of those that failed approximately onethirdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs40 116 donald r wolfensberger suspended partis anship in the house how most laws are really made paper presented at the annual meeting of the american political science association boston ma aug 29 sept 1 2002 p 30 117 on rare occasions members have been reco gnized to offer suspension motions that have not only failed to garner the requisite tw othirds but also have been defeated overwhelmingly see for example hres 467 106th congress failed on vote of 1420 and hr 3085 106th congress failed on vote of 0419 such voting anomalies usually occur when the sponsor of the motion has expectation that the measure will pass but rather employs the suspension procedure simp ly as convenient vehicle for eliciting symbolic vote 118 hinds and cannon v 6822 119 hinds and cannon v 5405 6820were later considered under ot her procedures and approved116 through consultation with minority party and committee leaders the speaker usually is in position to entertain only those suspension motions th at are likely to be supported by the necessary twothirds majority117 under what procedures are suspension motions considered as previously discussed each suspension motion is debatable for maximum of 40 minutes and the measure or propositi on it brings up for consideration is not subject to floor amendments during this time while the house is acting on suspension motion the only other motion that is in order is one motion to adjourn measures considered under suspension are protected against points of order that might otherwise be made against them at the end of the debate members cast single vote on both suspending the rules and passing the bill or taking whatever other action is proposed to pass the motion mu st be supported by twothirds of the members present and voting quorum being present each motion to suspend the rules may be debated for maximum of 40 minutes even if the question to be decided unde r the motion would not be debatable under other parliamentary circumstances for example in 1893 deba was permitted on motion to suspend the rules and table motion to reconsider although motion to table ordinarily is not debatable speaker charles f crisp ruled according to hinds that the provision allowing debate on suspension motions applied to all propositions sought to be passed under susp ension of the rules whether the main question was debatable or not under the ordinary rules of the house118 before 1880 motions to suspend the ru were not debatable house precedents cite rulings to this effect in 1842 and 1846119 at that time however suspension motions related primarily to th order of business on the house floor in the 1842 case for example representative millard fillmore of new york moved that the house suspend the rules and proceed to consider resolution affecting house action on another measure speaker john wh ite of kentucky

procedure 211578was not debatable but that if the motion was agreed to the resolution thereby made in order then would be subject to debate120 as the practice developed of acting by single vote on motions to suspend the rules and dispose of measures the prohi bition against debate precluded discussion of the issues considered in this manner hinds cites three significant examples121 on november 5 1877 the house on motion of mr richard d bla nd of missouri passed under suspension of the rules without any debate being possible bill providing for the free coinage of silver on january 28 1878 the house in the same way and against the pr otest of mr james garfield of ohio passed concurrent resolution from the senate declaring the coin bonds of the united states payable in silver dollar of 412Â½ grains and on february 24 1879 the sundry civil appropriation bill carrying on appropriation of nineteen millions of dollars it certainly seems likely that bills of such importance were passed under suspension of the rules not simply in order to exped ite business but in or der to preclude debate and amendment debate on suspension mo tions continued to be prohibited even though the character and use of th suspension procedure had changed consequently during the rules revi sion of 1880 the house agreed without discussion or opposition to an amendmen t permitting 30 minutes of debate on each suspension motion the time to be equally divided and controlled in 1890 the period for debate was extended to 40 minutes the time was reduced to 30 minutes during the next two congresses but ag ain extended to 40 minutes during the 54th congress and thereafter122 additional time for debate has been permitted by unanimous consent or by resolution123 the time for debate is divided between and controlled by the majority party member offering the motion and the ranking minority member of the committee or subcommittee of jurisdiction however if this minority party member is not opposed to the measure another member of his or her party who does oppose it may claim control of the time instead once the time is allocated the representatives controlling it yield portions of it to other members wishing to participate in the debate the minority party member controlling half the time gene rally yields at least some of this time to opponents of the measure even though he or she may support it the speaker does not however assume respons ibility for ensuring that time is equally divided or divided at all between proponents and opponents124 in 1882 for instance representative goldsmith w hewitt of alabama demanded second but then indicated that he didhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32474crs42 125 hinds and cannon v 6824 congressional record vol 12 may 1 1882 pp

chair125 more recently in 1969 representative lester l wolff of new york made point of order that time had been yielded to opponents of bill speaker john w mccormack of massachusetts re sponded that that is not within the province of the chair126 when measures are considered in committee of the whole committee amendments are acted upon after general bate on the measure itself under the suspension procedure on the other hand th motion submitted to the house already includes any committee amendments or any other amendments that the mover incorporates in his or her suspension mo tion other amendments are in order in the 1840s speakers ruled that amendmen ts were not in order to motions to suspend the rules that were offered to per mit the introduction of bills or to set aside the onehour limit on debate but when suspension motion only made measure in order for consideration the measure its elf then might be subject to amendment under the regular procedures of the house127 the prohibition against amendments continued even after the practice develope d of disposing of measures as part of suspension motions amendments may not be offered even by unanimous consent128 nor may members offer pro forma amendments to secure time for debate129 when measure is considered by the house under suspension of the rules it is protected against points of order that might otherwise be made against its consideration or provisions or against any amendments to it that are proposed as part of the motion130 the suspension procedure sets aside the rules on which any such points of order would be based for the same reason consideration of measure under suspension precludes members from offe ring most of the procedural motions that otherwise would be in order clau 1b of rule xv first
