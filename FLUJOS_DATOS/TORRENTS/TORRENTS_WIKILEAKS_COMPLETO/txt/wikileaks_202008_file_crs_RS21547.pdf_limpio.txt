promulgation of the regulations specifica lly noted that although date of birth and taxpayer identification number ie social security numberfor us individuals are required before any account is opened for cred it card accounts it is not necessary for the customer to provide them directly in that situation they may be obtained from trusted third parties such as consumer reporting agencies6 in all circumstances however the institutions program must set forth procedur for verifying the identification either through examination of such documents as passports or drivers licenses or certified articles of incorporation or by nondocumentary means7 nondocumentary means could include contacting customer comparing in formation with information obtained from consumer reporting agency or checking refere nces cips must also include procedures to deal with situations in which the cu stomer cannot produce the required documentary evidence and must specify when the bank should not open an account or terms under which customer may have an acc ount pending verification of identity in opening an account for an entity such as corporation associ ation or partnership financial institution is not required to obtain identifying information for every person having signature authority or control over such an account but it must have procedures for assessing the risks involved and obtaining the needed information in view of the associated risks under the program the institutions are not required to keep copies of the documents accepted for verifying identity they must retain record of the information obtained and description of the documents and methods used to identify the customer and retain them for five ears beyond the closing of the account crosschecking names of new account holders with terrorist lists the regulation also specifies that the customer identification program must include procedures for determining whether the cust omer appears on lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations issued by any federal agency within reasonable time in issuing the rules the agencies noted that although such lists have yet been circulated banks and other regulated financial institutions have long been obliged to comply with sanctions against designated fo reign countries foreign nationals and foreign terrorists under various laws nd regulations administered by treasurys of office foreign assets control 31 cfr part 5008 that prohibit certain financial transactions and include lists that must be crosschecked banks must have procedures in place to identify and block transactions with ofacs peri odically updated list of specially designated nationalists and blocked persons9 under regulations specifying special information sharing procedures to deter money launde ring and terrorism 31 cfr part 100 issued on september 25 200210 and under section 314a of the usa patriot act 31 usc 5311 note moreover banking institu tions are required to

files fincen is to be informed of the fact and provided with the name of contact person at the bank cost of compliance in analyzing the cost of instituting cips under section 326 the federal agencies determined that the effect of this regulatory regime would not add significant burden to the cove red institutions including the small banks in reaching this conclusion the agencies considered the fact that other requirements of the antimoney laundering laws and regulations have along with prudent risk avoidance practices already motivated the institutions to install programs to identify customers the financial services industry may have nother view of the accumulated cost of complying with the cip requirement and ot her requirements of the array of federal regulati ons promulgated under the antimoney laundering laws and the usa patriot act on june 9 2003 for example the american bankers association issued the results of its survey of banking companies with respect to cost and attitude toward complying with various federal regulations the survey is titled the nationwide bank compliance officer survey top costs in the compliance area are assigned to complying with bank secrecy act anti money laundering and ofac regulations treasurys request for comments on retaining photocopies of documents verifying identi ty of foreign nationals on september 17 200311 the treasury department announced that institutions must have customer identification programs in place as originally scheduled in the final regulations changes were required by the results of its july 1 2003 request for comments on 1 whether the institutions should retain photocopies of the documents used to verify identity and 2 whether there are circumstan ces under which the regulations should preclude reliance on certain forms of foreign governmentissued identification documents essentially this request for comments revived issues that were presumed settled when the final rules were issued on may 9 2003 as originally propose d the regulations would have required institutions to keep copies of documents used to verify identity this requirement was eliminated because of the number of co mments calling it ove rly burdensome 68 fed reg 25090 25101 the july 1 2003 notice sought information on whether photocopying documents is necessary in all cases or so and whether there should be regulations regarding risk factors indicating the necessity of retaining photocopies it also specifically sought input from law enforcement as well as the financial services industry this may indicate heightened awareness of the potential importance of copies of identifying photographs of new customers to law enforcement investigators 68 fed reg 39039 the issue of what documentation is to be required of nonu s persons was also considered earlier in its report to congre ss on customer identification requirements for foreign nationals httpwww treasgovpressreleasesre portssec326breportfinalpdf as required under section 326b of the usa patriot act 115 stat 272 315 treasury recommended that because of the lack of single reliable system for verifying the identity of foreign nationals opening accounts financial in stitutions be given flexibility in choosing reasonable means of verifying identity this would mean that they be required to make reasonable efforts to verify identity but be permitted to rely on existing information and documents including the matricula consular the matricula consularhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21547crs6 12 richard crowden banking groups object to treasury inquiry into

conducting an investigation of the use of documents such as the matricula consular and asked that implementation of the regu lations be delayed for six months the 911 commission report although 911 commission report made direct reference to the cip program so of its findings and recommendations may eventually require reassessing the cip regulations the commission noted that hijackers used us
