choquehuanca charge pablo solon 4 c summary under secretary otero reaffirmed secretary clintons commitment to improve relations with bolivia noting her own interest in finding ways to be helpful to the bilateral dialogue process foreign minister choquehuanca and charge solon expressed frustration with slow progress and the decisions on andean trade preference program atpa and the narcotics certification us otero and as shannon expressed disappointment at bolivias decision to terminate usaids democracy programs both sides committed to setting date for second round of talks in washington in the first half of october end summary bilateral dialogue slow and difficult 5 c under secretary otero opened the meeting by reaffirming secretary clintons commitment to improve relations with bolivia and noting her own interest in finding ways to be helpful to the bilateral dialogue process given her bolivian background 6 c foreign minister choquehuanca stressed the importance of building mutual trust and said bolivia would always be open to dialogue he appreciated our first round of talks held in may in paz as first step in overcoming differences and establishing relationship of mutual respect he did complain there had been progress since then and that the decisions to remove bolivia from the andean trade preference program atpa and to flunk bolivia in the narcotics certification were not constructive he noted bolivias new alliances with brazil argentina and paraguay to combat drug trafficking and affirmed that despite difficulties they are ready for second round of talks choquehuanca said the bolivian government cancelled usaid democracy programs marco dialogo8 and that they look forward to discussing pending assistance issues and finalizing bilateral framework agreement 7 c us otero welcomed their commitment to advancing the dialogue as good news8 but expressed disappointment in bolivias decision to terminate usaid democracy programs 8 c charge solon said they feared new golpe8 to the dialogue process in december when atpa legislation is renewed he warned the consequences for the bilateral relashionship would be grave if bolivia is not included solon said the clock is ticking and if we do not move fast the dialogue will become increasingly difficult and the us congress will eventually put bolivia in category where it doesnt belong he said what they need from us is concrete proposal on what steps we will take to advance the dialogue process 9 c solon recalled the advances of the first round of talks especially how close we were in reaching agreement on principles to guide our development cooperation yet from the four elements of their framework agreement proposal political relations development cooperation counternarcotics and trade our counterproposal was weakest in the area of development cooperation step backward moving forward state 00100988 002 of 002 10 c as shannon noted that although we understand there may be another golpe8 to the dialogue process in december we are working with congress to look at trade preferences more broadly noting that we face obstacles on both sides as shannon pointed out that our congress sees the bolivian governments decision to expel parts of our mission and to terminate usaid democracy programs as punitive actions and justifying engagement becomes an obstacle for us to that end it would be useful for us to know if we should expect further measures before december 11 c choquehuanca said what we need is to set date and focus on it choquehuanca said the first half of october is preferable because bolivia is hosting the alba summit october 1617 as shannon said we would present them with set of potential dates by next week wto health services commitments 12 c finally charge solon raised the wto health services commitments issue pending in geneva he said one opposes bolivias withdrawal from the commitments except the united states he asked for our assistance in resolving this issue in satisfactory manner and avoiding arbitration clinton
