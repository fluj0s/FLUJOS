has preclearsound versions of these tapes please check the others and post differences statement of purpose our purpose is to promote religious freedom and the scientology religion by spreading the scientology tech across the internet the cof abusively suppresses the practice and use of scientology tech by freezone scientologists it misuses the copyright laws as part of its suppression of religious freedom they think that all freezoners are squirrels who should be stamped out as heretics by their standards all christians moslems mormons and even nonhassidic jews would be considered to be squirrels of the jewish religion the writings of lrh form our old testament just as the writings of judaism form the old testament of christianity we might not be good and obedient scientologists according to the definitions of the cof whom we are in protest against but even though the christians are not good and obedient jews the rules of religious freedom allow them to have their old testament regardless of any jewish opinion we ask for the same rights namely to practice our religion as we see fit and to have access to our holy scriptures without fear of the cof copyright terrorists we ask for others to help in our fight even if you do not believe in scientology or the scientology tech we hope that you do believe in religious freedom and will choose to aid us for that reason thank you the fz bible association shsbc1 renum 1 7 may 61 emeter talk and demo emeter talk and demo lecture given on 7 may 1961 based on clearsound only okay this is talk on an emeter 7 may 1961 to hasi london technical staff now this instrument is probably the simplest instrument on earth and is the least known theres tremendous mysteries connected with this instrument and nearly everybody using it has developed whole bunch of technology of his own on it and lot of that technology is actually in total avoidance of the purpose of the meter theres tremendous numbers of things that you could say are this that or the other way about this meter and none of them are right it is very simple machine thats the first thing ive got to tell you now any time you put simple machine simple piece of data in peoples hands what happens you enter simple datum you blow off the confusion right well after all these years were still blowing confusion off of emeters now the whole fact of clearing today depends on this meter if you can read this meter well you can clear people and if you cant read this meter well you certainly cant thats just the long and the short of it ive seen veteran auditor do bad read on meter audit somebody for couple of hundred hours factually audit somebody for couple of hundred hours and wonder why they werent getting clear its just the meter in sop goals bad assessment the it looks so good but its just not quite right extends auditing time to ten thousand hours i mean simple you just wont make it thats all its an aristotelian proposition its black or white and the funny part about sop goals is it can be run on anybody theres very little preparation actually necessary for it if you get the right goal by assessment by elimination once more theres judgment here involved you just shake this meter down for every goal the person has and when they longer have any goals which theyre withholding secret goals childhood goals antisocial goals goals what would you have to have happen to know scientology worked you see all those goals shaken down until they longer produce fall on this meter when you got that complete list whether its 70 or 250 this meter goes numb it goes completely null it longer registers when youve got the list all right now having that list you go down until you washed out all goals but one just by going over the list and over the list and over the list and over the list and over the list youll find out oddly enough and this is almost an accident and it just plays into our hands just madly theres only one goal left that will register on the meter i dont care if it takes you twenty five hours to get the assessment right if the assessment is right you have saved all the hours of auditing the fellow will now invest without result you see it isnt that it isnt that you waste time by taking long time to do an assessment its you waste time by getting bad assessment you get wrong assessment youve had it i mean the fellow just isnt going to go anyplace now you get list of meter completely null on terminal list for the goal youve now got youve the goal now you run the thing completely null you go right down the line terminal another terminal what other terminal would represent that goal ah good what other terminal would represent that goal what other terminal would represent that goal whats another one now finally the needle goes null it longer registers you in other words you get the list of terminals so long as the idea of terminal for that goal is producing reaction on the meter meter goes null you got the terminal list thats it now you go over this list and over this list and over this list and over this list and mysteriously and wonderfully if you go over it enough times only one terminal and boy can you be fooled on this ive seen an expert fooled on this enough times only one terminal produces drop there isnt any single other reaction on the meter except one terminal oh for while hell look juicy theres one thats going to fall and oh boy you say thats it and then all of sudden that doesnt do it anymore but another terminal falls like mad and then thats gone and then ah what the hell you just go over them enough and all of sudden one terminal starts to fall and it falls and it falls and it doesnt matter how many times you say so and it doesnt matter whether you kick the pc or drug him or dope him it still falls you get the idea thats the terminal hhsssss i dont care how many hours you take to do that thats wellinvested time because the number of hours it takes to do good assessment is compared to the infinity of hours in auditing youre going to spend if the assessment is wrong you got the idea because the fellow is never going to go clear so youve consigned him to an infinity of auditing hours because hell never go clear on wrong assessment he wont even get better how do you like that now we have lots of processes we can make him better on which have assessment like put your finger in your ear thank you and the fellow has finally got his earache over with and that sort of thing we can do things with other processes but not sop goals its infinity or finite an infinity of hours in auditing is the result of wrong assessment and finite number of hours is result of right assessment its just that bingbang you see its just black and white its either that or it isnt youre just about to get new prehav scale by the way and it is very took quite while to figure out how i could deliver the thing properly and exactly what it was well weve got this in the works actually its in the typists hands but this is the point what do you know it does assessment by elimination if you went over the key points of the scale enough times only one point falls doesnt matter how many other points fall only one point falls so you do it assessment by elimination every time on the prehav scale every time you do this assessment by elimination as long as youve got three levels falling you are wrong to stop if youve got three levels ticking youre wrong to stop you go over that until youve got one level falling and that is the level the rest will blow off theyll notis well heck it may take you couple of hours then to get the right assessment for the next level to run every time you flatten level why it might take you anoth i dont care if it does you see because every moment that you run without the right assessment is totally lost in auditing so how do you waste auditing time you waste auditing time well various ways one of the first ways is you run rudiments on somebody who is incapable of running rudiment thats good way to waste auditing time tbd lets spend fifteen hours on rudiments on somebody who cannot produce any reaction on the body by thinking the reason he cant is he alterises every command so you say what part of that somatic could you be responsible for or some command thatd be bad process what part of leg could you be responsible for youre going to cure up his pt problem hes got pain in his leg or something like that and you could go on and on and on and on and on and on why because the fellow is running what leg has responsibility look auditing doesnt work if they dont do the auditing command so that alterisness has to be knocked out obsessive alterisness has to be knocked out and all of this is preparatory to sop goals its just preparatory now what processes do you run to prepare him actually the best known process is attention but attention or change or an assessed change scale or actually the new prehav scale which you havent got in your hands yet simply run without terminal in other words you can start assessing on the prehav scale with terminal and run anything you can get your hands on and then you loosen up the tone arm and then you can come back and do an sop goals assessment on the person if youve got him set up that way we have had some remarkable recoveries on just running on the prehav scale by the way terminal assessment nothing quite interesting but it sets person up to run the new prehav scale will because its got all varieties of change and alteration in it so itd take out all the obsessive change off of the case all the alteris of the auditing command but thats beside the point this is actually not lecture on how to set case up because that will be too easy i could say the best way i know of to do it is to take the new prehav scale and do an assessment directly without terminal on the pc and you only do that when his tone arm wont move hes got stuck tone arm and you run the levels that do make it fall in spite of the fact that its stuck because those are the automaticity levels get the automaticities off the surface of the case and you immediately have somebody who can be assessed and who will follow an auditing command and sop goals grips them so with interest with the right goal that they dont alteris auditing commands they are too interested theyre sitting right in the middle of it you got it so weve got this thing made and its essentially very simple regimen it fortunately perhaps for us is one which requires technical perfection thats fortunately for us because it means screwball outfit but imagine some outfit like the grand temple of ishtar or the brothers of the snake or something suddenly being able to pick up our technology if it were terribly terribly simple and use it to plow everybody in on earth this was one of the points that maybe you werent looking at but i was if it came out at the other end too simple all you had to do was say bligablog and the guy was had terrific mental effect you see or if you said subbabubbabubbahubbabooboo or something and some terrific mental effect occurred in the individual it was susceptible to being used as black dianetics if it was too simple but weve come out the other end of the horn and we get an actual look at what it really is and its simply this perfect adherence to the auditors code oh yeah but your black operations cant follow the auditors code look freudian psychoanalysis is exactly reverse to the auditors code the whole way everything we say in the auditors code plus psychoanalysis says minus if you dont believe it look it over some time they do exact reverse to everything thats in the auditors code well therefore the auditors code is not something theyd have any sympathy with so therefore theyd never follow it would they so all right that puts barrier across their track perfect trs it takes person in pretty good shape to do perfect tr why perfect tr well the funny part of it is if it isnt perfect tr your pc as he comes up through sop goals gets new pt problems and new arc breaks with the greatest of ease and if youre not administering it with perfect trs the individual is thrown off line and youre wasting auditing time like mad and if your trs were bad enough he never would get clear thats another barrier across the track isnt it total understanding of this meter and perfect use of model session now black operation would only use this meter to blackmail thats the total use theyd put the meter to once more itd be boobytrapped theyd never really learn how to run the meter and model session they couldnt learn model session because they cant duplicate those are the things that it actually takes to clear somebody plus perfect assessment and we have new book emeter essentials which is quite comprehensive however what im giving you today are well most of it is covered in emeter essentials but im going to give you right now breakdown of the material on an emeter which is probably even little more simple than the takeoff point of emeter essentials ive thought of new point of takeoff its very funny thing i get better at explaining things and ive got better explanation today on emeters than i had when i wrote the book just two or three weeks ago now heres this explanation the reason ive given you by the way all of this rundown here on the subject of what it takes to clear somebody is just to try to tell you look guys thats all it is you know i mean there isnt anything else but those factors there are other factors there are sneak factors out someplace than those i have exactly mentioned so if you say well theres something more that ron hasnt told us or something like this look around to find out what fact ron has told you that youre dispersing on will you because im actually now giving you all the dope its taken eleven years to condense it to find out all about it to develop it to get it into every case line to require vast mental gymnastics for each particular different case ill tell you how wide and varied dianetics was on several occasions i dreamed up complete regimen that fitted case and the case started to run on it and then went out and invented whole new dianetics that applied only to that regimen which was invented for that particular case fellow by the name of altman in new york city remember that what did they eventually call that gestalt therapy or something it was something real weird but it was something that was invented for altmans case and it only applied to altman and he went out and he started whole school of dianetics he might he might better have called it altmans case to get something that embraced all cases and which you could use and which wouldnt betray you in your hands and which you didnt have to suddenly develop an enormous bleuh for this particular case because this case was all different has been quite trick and its taken eleven years and thats probably very long time but as dick said the other day in view of the fact nobody had done anything for the fifty thousand years preceding that eleven years doesnt look very much so dont feel betrayed that i didnt tell you all this yesterday as favor huh its taken quite little while to find out the words to fit the music things like this now im going to tell you about an emeter things like this this is just communication expression and the moment i tell you this im sure youre going to say well what do you know this is tension machine thats all thats all it measures if you want to be idiotic and leave the electronics alone it is tension machine not an attention machine tension machine the more tense is the individual the more offbeat is the read from the meter standpoint the only thing youre trying to do is take the tension measurements out of this machine thats the goal of clearing as viewed from an emeter now theres oddly enough the lowest zone of tension which is there is so much tension in the world that there is sense in doing anything about anything anyplace and youve got an ambulant catatonic schiz you got dead thetan who is totally incapable he thinks of himself as dead you see and hes totally incapable of influencing the machine thats your first stage but the machine even on that first stage although it reads the way clear should read its the lower harmonic mockery of the clear still detects perfectly because hes clear here male 30 on the tone arm dial andor she still detects here female 20 on the tone arm dial the needle is tense youve got your sensitivity up to read him so the machine still detects this case and as crossdetection the machine does not react favorably at all and the individual cannot answer positively to his own satisfaction or yours any questions about help that one he cant embrace if you just ask him well how could you help although hes sitting here at 30 and you say well hes sitting here at 30 when i ask him things theres action on the needle so therefore he must be natural clear you see well look at this needle and youre going to find out something about mr needle the needle is going to be in some kind of state of dishabille and it will be almost as stiff as you see that needle floating there with the cans unplugged the needle isnt going to move off of that now severe test of it would be to kick him in the shins the needle is still not going to move off of that this does not look like clear it doesnt even vaguely look like clear the difference is the needle and the sensitivity knob your sensitivity knob will have to be up to get thirdofadial drop sometimes way up otherwise the individual is at clear mockery do you follow thats mockery and thats the thetan who thinks of himself as dead dead dead and actually there isnt any use to have any tension anyhow because its all so tense that if i just stay here nicely dead and although hes walking and talking on the subject of machinery you know hes all machine motivated youll find in his normal course of endeavor if you ask him any questions that he has all kinds of bad luck that he doesnt quite groove in but basically this he doesnt believe anything can be done i had the perfect ease of this tell one day he was actually working here on press and he told well you cant possibly produce story about tomatoes feel pain every six weeks he knew lot about press that was what he knew you cant possibly see theres doingness so theres help theres doingness theres possibility these are immediately detectable in the individual theyre not deep searching detection you have to take you just say well lets get busy and sort out these papers and youll get the answer you cant do there isnt any sense in sorting out the papers because you got the idea he says cant do well now doingness is the common denominator of the prehavingness scale and an individual who cant do isnt even on the scale see everything is cant do now dont be fooled by this case because the meter detects it at once sensitivity knob down here look at your sensitivity knob there is your best case detector not your tone arm not your needle but the sensitivity knob right down here in the lower lefthand corner of the meter now that right there is your case detector and dont forget it thats honey and if you dont know anything else about the tone arm or the needle as case detection know the sensitivity knob on these modern meters if the sensitivity knob has to come up to 2 to get read the case is in bad condition its just as simple as that much less 3 4 8 16 if you have to wind up this sensitivity knob at all your case is in bad condition you got that thats diagnosis if you want to call it that put the fellow on the machine if you dont pay any attention whatsoever to the tone arm if you dont pay any attention over here to the needle at all you can tell on this sensitivity knob if you have to crank the sensitivity knob up to get the case to get onethirdofadial drop on the needle for test case in bad shape otherwise it should sit down here way down way down now your first test of course then is when you hook up the meter you balance the thing you say well now its sitting here at two snap in your cable fellow has got the cans and you say squeeze the cans squeeze the cans and he gets sixteenthofadial drop bring the sensitivity knob up and you say squeeze the cans and you get an eighthofadial drop and you bring the sensitivity up and you say squeeze the cans and you finally get exactly one thirdofadial drop and his sensitivity is at 4 dont pay any attention to your tone arm thats it the case is in lousy condition thats all you have to know you dont even have to go psychiatric and say hes catatonic ambiguousa hes just in lousy shape meaning this that well have to do some preparatory work before we can do an assessment and thats everything that means to you weve got to do preparatory work before we do an assessment lets find out little bit more about this case now you actually dont have to bring this sensitivity knob down here to its zero you dont have to bring it down there for thirdofadial drop to do an assessment you can still assess these people long before they have recovered on their sensitivity thats interesting isnt it but the probability is youre going to have to do something with this case now if this is in real bad shape youre probably have to going to have to do something adventurous just to get him to sit in the chair all right now lets look this over your diagnosis we have said in the past is tone arm and needle and sensitivity knob your first and foremost diagnosis and most everything you want to know about the case is told to you by the sensitivity knob now we can progress with our diagnosis now this individual to get thirdofadial drop when he squeezes the cans which is the cans held in his hands relaxedly with his fingers not off of them but just touching them normally as he would in auditing you say squeeze the cans now sometimes they go like this you know its very jerky and so forth and they keep squeezing squeezing squeezing to thats diagnosis the guy cant follow simple order you say give the cans squeeze i dont know what hes doing with them but you have to then educate him in how to squeeze the cans thats not very diagnostic but he squeezes the cans properly just one squash and then back to relaxation and you get onethirdofadial drop with the thing low all right that would be all right but you get thirdofadial drop with the sensitivity needle at 4 ahahahahahahahahah ohohohohoh individual is not going to have lie reaction hes going to be very hard to security check he all of these other things follow out why because the guy is very very very surrounded by tensions of all kinds sorts and descriptions im using this word tension as just sort of an embracive thing of hes got all kinds of things going on and hes got all kinds of tightnesses and tautnesses now this coordinates this way if you were to reach over and squeeze this cord which comes out of his neck fellow who is up here at about 2 or 3 on the sensitivity knob will sometimes scream like hog with his throat cut thats painful but if it is just exactly like cable you know its as though he had galvanized iron cable not an upper muscle here on the upper part of his shoulder from his neck over to his shoulder pit and doesnt feel any pain at all you can expect this thing to have to ride at 16 for thirdofadial drop you got it hes very tense and doesnt even know it now how tense is tense well actually the fellow that can be nervous about being tense or the fellow that can be jittery about being tense or the fellow that can jiggle his foot or scratch his head or fumble his chin is not in very bad shape you go down scale and this fellow is getting into the rigidity of rigor mortis now thats in bad shape cant move anything at all ever thats your sensitivity knob telling you the story of your case and you do security check get your thirdofadial drop and if this thing is up high you know what you could really do you could say to the fellow well why dont you get some auditing then well security check you later because frankly any security check that you get on this individual is going to be very suspect he will however fall on things where he has crimes but to clear them oh my god well we just had one we just did seven hours or so on case to run joburg security check case isnt as bad off as cases go by an awful long ways so that forecasts that somebody reading at about sixteen to clear every level you could get tick on what does that mean that means twentyfivehour intensive for one joburg security check well oddly enough it would do him lot of good hed get off lot of withholds and youd see that the needle was loosening up and this tone arm falling and youd more importantly for diagnosis youd see that the sensitivity knob didnt have to be so high okay now always run meter with thirdofadial drop these meters are set i check them over and they do respond to that mechanical action another type of meter or another model or something like that they might not respond that way but this type of meter that ive checked out does respond that way but you will get proper fall if you have thirdofadial drop on squeeze of the cans on the needle dont run one jacked way up with its sensitivity very high and with the needle flying around because you dont get any significant read thirdofadial drop at any given time during session will give you significant read and itll leave out all the heartbeats and so forth now in emeter essentials it gives you drill lets go little bit further now in emeter essentials it gives you drill and the drill is bodymovement detection drill and every auditor should do that drill just have somebody sit back and breathe and wheeze and cough and tell him to do these various things and watch the reactions on this needle and this will teach you after youve done it with your meter set up properly after youve done it this will teach you that they are erratic they are very fast and that they dont in the least look like reads and you will learn rapidly to differentiate between read from the bank and body reaction the fellow who shifts his thumb on the can sporadically keeps shifting his thumb or something like this it doesnt even vaguely look like read youll see that very soon youll see that after while you dont even have to look up to see if hes doing something odd now you get into rock slam as one of the needle characteristics and youll find that you usually have to check the pc what are you doing all of sudden youve got whamwham of the needle well kind of check the pc what are you doing thats the only one that looks like body movement but then that keeps up and he couldnt possibly be doing this rhythmic body movement this well so even that is detectable now its the body movement that makes the erratic moves and which the phrenologist that is taught in most universities today or is it chaldeosis or they read stars horoscopy or something like that these birds are so unaccustomed to galvanometer that they never learned how to read one and they think the falls are mostly attributable to body motions they have been defeated by the body motion so they say you never can tell on lie detector or this and that because its body motion and this is the first invalidative factor they give the meter remember that the basis of this meter is one hundred years old this is not new meter century this thing has been around and for nobody to have learned how to use it in whole century was something weird now of course we had to set it up so that it would read for our purposes we had to redesign circuits we brought it into very compact package the shelf life of this british of the batteries in this british meter and the consumption rate are the same now thats quite remarkable isnt it did you know that you could take one of these modern mark iv british meters and dont do this but you could leave it on in the case for weeks without running it down could just leave it on for weeks and weeks because its consumption rate is the same as shelf life for the battery pretty interesting huh well weve refined the living daylights out of the meter and weve made it read and weve found out what these various components that can vary the meter mean and were not teaching you new electronic instrument all were doing is teaching you refined electronic instrument that nobody ever learned how to read so dont feel that youre dense or stupid particularly because you dont instantly and immediately pick up how to read an emeter because remember its been around for century without anybody in the halls of learning even finding out anything about it you know that this thing is part and parcel of every lie detector in the united states men are actually sent to the electric chair on the evidence of one of these things and the guys operating them dont know how to read them they dont know anything about the mind they dont know anything about the track they tell you it reads only sweat if the individual sweats suddenly you get drop and then when he unsweats it gets silly doesnt it actually the fellow with soaking wet palms and the fellow with perfectly dry palms can read more or less the same as far as thats concerned it has bearing on it but thats what they tell you and its very amusing all right state of case sensitivity knob dont be fooled by it if its high knob its just openandshut if its high reading on the sensitivity knob look out because youre dealing with somebody whos going to alteris commands thats all theres the possibility of his alterising commands well youre probably have to going to do something with this straight on the prehav scale to get the alteris of the commands before you get anything run you got it simple lets put it this way lets make another remark on this he is not release now the best person to run sop goals on is release and if you were being terribly careful the whole way you would make release before you started sop goals the odd part of it is if youre very good on sop goals you can do an assessment on person who isnt release and you will make faster auditing progress if you do it normally if you have high sensitivity knob reading it will assess only to present time problem your whole sop goals will assess to present time problem that goal which is the present time problem for the case will be the goal you will usually get something to expect huh something to sort of know about the thing but if youve released the person first or got him up in that general direction one way or the other well after all look at the technology weve had over the last many many years i mean you can do all kinds of things with cases you can soften up this meter you can make this meter read differently with auditing practically everything weve ever found out is now valuable to us one way or the other im not saying you have this enormous span of things but if you know something thats made cases well for you you know it just this if you know something that has made cases well for you something like 8c or something like this youve made cases well with this sort of thing you know youve changed meter reads on them and so forth why thats better reality make them release with it and youll find the sensitivity is reading lower if youve done something that makes the case better youve produced release now go ahead with sop goals now that fits into your reality doesnt it im not giving you whole new package and saying all of scientology is discarded but im telling you where it stops it stops at sop goals sop goals is itself and it is very precise how you produce this release thats matter that is pretty well up to you i can give you numerous ways that will be highly functional on numerous cases but by doing four or five of them you will always have case in shape to be run on sop goals all right lets look at the next factor on this this has to do with the tone arm this tone arm this thing over here on the upper upperleft side of the meter all right now this thing reads at 5000 ohms female 12500 ohms male for the body and its read is monitored for the body it reads the body when person is clear youre not reading him the emeter ceases to read its hit its zenith when hes total stable ms clear it has hit its zenith the meter is good from there on up it will always have to be used lower than that however so what do you what have you got left here youve got his body and apparently female body is 5000 ohms and male body is 12500 ohms and thats represented by f with circle around it and 20 for female and the m with circle around it and the 30 for male now that tells you at once why the lowerharmonic case the dead thetan why he reads at 20 and 30 see that tells you why he reads at 20 and 30 because hes dead body you go down to the morgue and put the meter on corpse down there and youll get these same reads its very fascinating isnt it so youve either got the thetan not mauling the body around and changing its density every three seconds or dead thetan which couldnt and you have these two extremes and the worstoff case that you will run into is of course the lower mockery harmonic of the clear only hes really dead in his head hes so dead in his head he thinks hes elsewhere while hes there you ask this person where he is you just ask this person where he is hes always someplace else in between that band you have innumerable variations of this tone arm innumerable variations of the tone arm but most important and this is the most recent discovery did you know there were you know these are divisions and when you hear divisions of the tone arm dial its 10 to 20 look on your dial there look on your dial and just move it now from 10 to 20 10 to 20 that is called one division of the tone arm dial one tone arm division 10 to 20 similarly 20 to 30 move it from 20 to 30 from 20 to 30 that is one division of the tone arm dial now back it down from 30 to 20 all right back it down now from 30 to 20 that again is the movement of one division of the tone arm dial doesnt matter which way it moves that is movement of one division now move it from 30 to 35 and then back to 30 do that again move it from 30 to 35 and back to 30 that is not one division of movement not one division of movement that is half division of movement even though it moved up half and back half the way were running this thing now our movements are so explicit that when we say it has to have one division of movement for the tone arm dial or an eighth of the division of movement of the tone arm dial we mean in one direction up or one direction down not four times with quarter now lets look at four times with quarter move it from 30 to 325 to 30 to 325 to 30 to 325 to 30 that is not one motion one division of the tone arm dial have you got that thats not one division of the tone arm dial one division motion of the tone arm dial the way were this is refined look at the situation is from 30 to 40 or 40 to 30 now this may contradict some of your earlier data but weve had to codify this thing so were expressing exactly what were expressing quarter of division of movement could be this in five minutes now move it from 30 to 325 to 30 to 325 to 30 to 325 to 30 to 325 got that that all took place in five minutes of auditing thats quarter of division of motion of the tone arm dial didnt matter how many times it happened thats quarter of division of the tone arm dial got that subtle difference thats just so we dont make any mistakes about this all right now this tone arm is what we audit with and you are being technically incorrect if you make report like this the tone arm dial was pretty motionless while i was running the process but the needle was moving any mention of needle during the running of process is faux pas it has nothing to do with the running of the process now curiosa that it occasionally rock slams on you is just curiosa its not factual it doesnt immediately lead you into making any new decision or solution its interesting that there is something flying around but let give you caution because this needle flies around it is moving isnt it and your attention its moving rapidly let us say your attention is liable to be drawn to the needle and youre liable to start trying to interpret the needle as you audit process and it has nothing to do with the auditing of process we couldnt care less what the needle is doing while were running the process we might as well take the needle and snap it off and throw it away the only thing were going to pay any attention to at all is this tone arm dial if that is moving the process is biting and if that isnt moving the process is not biting and here we get blackandwhite aristotelian fact motion on the tone arm dial action in the bank im not going to bother to go into the details here today of why this bank action occurs and so forth but the bank is moving and the movement of the bank is registered over here on broad wide basis on the tone arm dial now were running processes today which do move the tone arm dial and which are sufficiently good that they cannot help but move the tone arm dial if youre running the right process the tone arm dial is moving if youre running the wrang process it is not if the process is flat regardless of what this needle is doing over here if the process is flat the tone arm dial is not moving if the case is progressing the tone arm dial is moving if the case is not progressing the tone arm dial is not moving simple very straightforward in other words process on the tone arm now we take look at this needle what is the needle for then that is for assessment that is what you use that needle for it is for assessment there are several things the needle can do and only one of those things has any real significance to you what you are looking for is falls they are called falls drops dips there are numerous words used but fall is actually the proper word only because it says fall on the needle on the needle dial it says fall and that means the fall is in the direction from set to where it is marked fall in other words fall inevitably drops to the right and recovers but it can go this way it can fall recover slightly fall recover slightly fall recover its still fall all right well take fall here and it fell and then it recovered slightly and fell and recovered slightly and fell and recovered slightly and fell and recovered slightly and fell by the way i dont pay any attention to this tone arm numbers here these numbers dont mean anything over here on the needle dial they mean something on the tone arm dial but they dont mean anything here i just noticed the other day somebody has marked this thing up for two divisions as one number that will be changed division is simply the distance between two black marks on this thing all right with that repetitive and continual fall the actual fall was one two three four five six seven eight in what space of time well i would say in the matter of two or three seconds you know it kind of pumps itself down well that is the number of divisions of fall now this thing is marked off with little black marks and you have these and you call them divisions dont pay any attention to the numbers on the thing and that is divisions of fall now diagnostically the fall is the primary needle manifestation now lets talk in these needle manifestations fall thats primary stronger manifestation than fall is the rock slam thats just all over the i dont know whether i yeah yeah i can i can make one of these things rock slam there there theres rock slam just agitate go ahead do it agitate your tone arm here and watch that needle just move that back and forth rapidly thats rock slam see that crazy thats crazy thing that means youre right on the rock chain to the first time the ever guy the guy ever decided to be another valence thats right straight on the line you get that thing take it thats your strongest read theta bop is diagnostic read but when youre really on the button your theta bop turns into fall but if youre reading bunch of questions and you get theta bop and you keep getting theta bop every third question theta bop theres one of those questions someplace in the assessment list that is theta bop question and it has to do with leaving and death and its really kind of the yoyo the thetan is backing out of his head and coming back in slightly whether hes doing it inside his head or on the next planet it doesnt matter but hes going in and out and he actually is moving in and out hes moving tcktcktcktcktcktck ticktickticktickticktick hes going call it like yoyo the old childs toy that bounced down and came back up and bounced down and came back up and thats represented by little tickticktick that is almost exactly the same path thats too fast one now if you just move this thing about an eighth of division move your tone arm back and forth smoothly about an eighth of division move it back and forth smoothly an eighth of division youll notice that needle rocking back and forth there over the same pattern that is theta bop it does not matter continental how wide the theta bop is it can be whole dial wide now basically ive always referred to theta bop as something that did it repetitively and most theta bops which are going to be anything at all do it repetitively now if you refined this down to the ne plus ultra youd find out that one dip and one recovery at the exact same speed over the exact same area would be onemotion theta bop youre now sort of nagging at the facts its true thats perfectly true but its not very useful thats perfectly true but its not very useful you get what im talking about now now theta bop has the equal halt at both ends you see you might as well call it fall as far as diagnostics are concerned if it fell once and recovered you might as well call it fall but technically speaking you could say well that was one onejump theta bop but of course its diagnostic the way fall is see you could differentiate between these two things it would mean that the speed of recovery was the same exactly as the speed of drop but its still diagnostic and it means the same thing ordinarily that fall would get if you saw that manifestation sooner or later youre going to turn on what caused it and then its going to go rockrockrockrockrockrock itll do the same thing many times now itd mean that you just ticked the edge of theta bop so fall rock slam theta bop all right all of them are useful diagnostically all of them the fall is ordinarily what you use you ordinarily use the fall thats the usual action the theta bop can be used as an indicator but never put it down as the needle reacted put it down as theta bop make the greek letter theta and write bop after it that simply means the guy wants to get out of there he wants to die he is stuck in past death and oddly enough he wants to leave the assessment or hes got leavingness on his mind it doesnt matter which of these things is true you would merely know that some of them are true if hes consistently theta bopping theta bop and death are synonymous theta bop and leaving are synonymous because death is leaving guy blows out of his head when he dies so when he gets the idea of leaving he also theta bops its very simple returning will also give you theta bop now what do you use for assessment then actually its broadly covered by change of needle pattern the needle is sitting there quietly you read question question question question and nothing is happening at all and then you read question and it goes jigglejaggle well we dont care what it did read the question again it goes jigglejaggle we really dont care what it did you understand it did something the needle responded because we read the question and that is the fundamental whatever the significance of the response are that is the fundamental and theres only one exception to this it rose i can hear far too much about needles rising i can hear too much about this i can easily be bored with the subject of rising needles in fact you hardly have to do anything to bore with it because it means just one thing it means the pc isnt confronting and of course thats why hes being audited so ill show you what rising needle looks like now take this thing and set it at 25 set your meter at 25 and now move it slowly and evenly to 20 you got that if your meter is turned on here its turned on and balanced and is in the vicinity of 20 you ought to have read on the needle the needle ought to be up in the middle of the dial all right take it from again take it from 225 now very slowly over this period of time inch it inch it inch it smoothly smoothly sometimes even with little jerks inch it smoothly up to 20 and you will get it that is rising needle now naturally needles have to rise for tone arms to recover dont they just the mechanics of the meter tell you that they have to rise its absolutely vital otherwise you would never get another read anywhere on the tone arm would you and if you become too fascinated with rising needle youre becoming too fascinated with something which doesnt mean anything it just doesnt thats all beyond this just one thing the pc has struck something he isnt confronting now we used to use this rising needle this way anything that will stop needle from rising is something the pc can confront or is usually why the needle is rising you can find out why the needle is rising by finding out what stops it from rising whatever stops needle from rising is why its rising i studied asw under british instructor i was running british corvettes during the war and i was studying asw and they have to do with meters too you know they have chemical recorders and pings and bops and dials and lord knows what and i sat down in the classroom and he gave lecture on the speed of sound which went down to the particle motion of particles influenced by sound we were about hundred fathoms under any information we had to have to run chemical recorder you understand i was struck by the tremendous thoroughness of this and after this particular instructor got through after long course of this and that on these things i was very indebted to him for having given all this stuff i really knew about it you understand but ill be of monkey if it if it had much application to hunting submarines you know the physics of speed of sound and that sort of thing and i got the idea of the thoroughness of this thing and the thoroughness of this thing was fabulous well im only mentioning this particular incident for this reason yeah itd be good thing to teach you all about this emeter on the standpoint of making you learn the circuit you know the resistors and capacitors and everything in the circuit and exactly how the balance wheels go on in back of this thing and so forth that would be good idea and probably you couldnt be called total expert on emeters unless you could build one out of some old baling wire you understand but there is point there is point where that information ceases to be of any value to you because you are not building emeters now there was some sense in his teaching all about the speed of sound and so forth because i could do calculation but how sound existed as sound i didnt need to know this you understand i remember that course because on the one hand i resented the living daylights out of it i had already been using these things in action and on the other hand i appreciated it because it seemed so thorough im only bringing this up to tell you dont think that there arent things about this meter you could study you could study its circuit you could study its manufacture you could under study its costing you could study methods of improvement of it well needle manifestations become an esoteric subject like the construction of the meter am i making my point now now you can really start getting esoteric ill give you an example theres stage four needle and that stage four needle cant be duplicated over here by this tone arm but if youll take it up to 225 now swing it fairly rapidly in rise by bringing the tone arm to 20 and then pretend the needle stuck and then drop it back rapidly to 225 and then bring it up to 20 and then to 225 and then bring it up to 20 and pretend it stuck and then bring it back to 225 got that you see that motion well you cant get the exact motion by moving the tone arm because its distinct stick at the top up it goes up up up and sticks and then it falls and then it goes up up up and it sticks and then it falls there is stage four case you could hit the guy with belaying pin you could put him in boiling oil and i think youd still get stage four needle it is just total noeffect sort of needle now stage four can be very tiny ive seen them half division wide its not theta bop because theta bop is back and forth equal speed actually theres kind of little flip on the end of it if your needle was very sensitive youd see your flip on both ends of the theta bop it goes over and flips and goes back and flips and goes back and by flip i mean it kind of goes tzit tzit tzit back and forth tickticktickticktickticktick on these meters it simply looks like little swing but stage four now thats up tsk stick fall now its very relaxed at the bottom of it up stick fall it simply means lousy case youre going to have it already adjudicated down here with the sensitivity knob you see nothing is having any effect on the case at all nothing as long as youve got stage four needle to that degree its useful to know you wont see them often so when you do see them nothing is having any effect on the case but its almost impossible for modern auditing not to have any effect on case so it would be very brief that you would see one we can blow up stage four needles now very nicely i remember two famous cases that had stage four needles though that lasted through all of the early processes of dianetics and scientology still with stage four needles its noeffect sort of manifestation all right the prehav scale will blow up that needle in time at all so why should we go into the particulars of it all right theres another one theres jigglejiggle vibration the needle simply vibrates like mad well youve got somebody with an alternating current ridge very important so hes got an alternating current ridge theres other stuff about meters 45 means crowd if the guy is stuck at 45 on the tone arm hes afraid of people or hes stuck in people you ever see travel pictures of the famous monastery in greece where they haul people up in basket thats their elevator and it survived down through the centuries because invader can even get near it he cant climb it have you ever heard of this one well i actually did an emeter assessment on its the head of that monastery few months ago and where was he he was at 45 naturally in living in protected area up in the sky you almost might say that nobody could get near or something he had done such tremendous avoidance of people that he finally got himself stuck there incidentally the only goal you could get out of this old man is he wanted to go to heaven he believed his own propaganda he said he wanted to have something happen with his eyes he was going blind thats what he said but that meter didnt say so he just wanted to die he wanted to go to heaven i tried to find terminal to heaven and im afraid there were too many people around for to do very good job of the assessment because i could only spend about half an hour on it or something like this i got him straightened out enough so something could be done about his eyes and after that i turned it over to local auditor and it would do something for his eyes trying to find terminal for somebody who wants to go to heaven who answers you nothing but in total doctrine you see total doctrine i mean all your answers are doctrine answers have nothing to do with anything he had he had not he didnt even have goal to be priest i gave presession 38 to run the engram of his heartbreak when he was young man at the age of eighteen in the united states when he decided to become priest that was the point where his whole life had broken down and he decided to become priest and actually hed been trying to go to heaven since he was eighteen in other words but going to heaven what is this its just manifestation of fellow trying to die so of course he was going blind he was making nothing out of his own mockup so fast that what could you do well what could you do well you could find the incident where he decided to become priest thats what you could do and run it the old man wasnt in bad shape by the way and i mentioned people enough to him in the assessment that i kicked him off his 45 read on the tone arm an obsessively stuck at 25 means machine robot doll that sort of thing now these are just samples of bricabrac oh yes as time goes on these things are very nice to know and theyre they mark you as the expert now after id taken course on asdic from british instructor i was after that certified as total total expert dont you see i could probably build the machines now i cant even buy one out of war surplus ive been trying to get one for yacht and they wont even sell one probably an expert like that hes at least entitled to his machinery isnt he now these you might assign to esoterics so get your levels of importance up here levels of importance terribly important that read on the needle produces most ordinarily and usually and significantly and which you always make record of fall next to that theta bop more rarely rock slam most positive read is rock slam somebody starts rock slamming and then you get him so he does nothing but rock slam on that question that is the question that is producing the rock slam and man youd better run it because that is right on the rock chain that is hotter than pistol every time you come by boy scout he used to have an ambition to be boy scout ambition to be boy scout rock slam and then later on he wanted to be minister rock slam and then later on why he wanted to become choir boy rock slam action at all and so on you go over this list of assessment again you get it up to boy scout rock slam and all of sudden rock slam on boy scout that has dropped out but later on in the questions he wanted to be frontiersman that rock slams see in other words boy scout was borrowing its rock slam from frontiersman and we keep on asking him about frontiersman and the more we ask him about frontiersman the more rock slam we get thats only valid if this other phenomenon takes place other goal on the list produces any fall any theta bop or any action on the needle but frontiersman produces rock slam well then youre saying the same thing as frontiersman produces fall arent you so rock slam you can classify for diagnosis as very positive fall thats all fall is what you look for and dont go talking to about rises and dont start worrying about how this pc consistently read at 3 78 and what did that mean i dont know what it means whos kidding who got it so what thats interesting and those of us that are fumbling around with meters will eventually get this thing read down to point of where you could put any man or beast on the face of earth on an emeter and we can probably tell what his name rank and serial number is for each life back you know well thats way beyond what is needed to make sop goals work or make auditing work you produce reaction on this needle that is different than the reaction you had on this needle and youve got reaction but thats not true of fall because you might have leered at the moment you asked the question and he couldnt confront leer so now hes rising rise means nothing now theres another read ill have to tell you about on this meter and that is 70 on the tone arm dial the limitations of manufacture of the meter prevent us from having 70 on the tone arm dial i was very bright few months ago in south africa and made this horrendous discovery that there is 70 on the tone arm dial but it cant be reached by the tone arm put this thing at 20 got your meter set there at 20 all right now lets say hes deadbody 20 hes deadthetan 20 see sticky needle this that the other thing high sensitivity down here and so on it doesnt read in these gradients by the way because the bank goes click and thud and shifts here and there but an actual totally slow read of this thing of his recovery will bring him down this is the deadthetan case bring him down to 15 now if you keep him hanging at 15 of course youre not making any progress with the case this is not suppression of the case because its gone down actually the way it reads is move it down now to 15 now move it down to where it wont go any further now twist it all the way up around here to above 60 now you see between that 10 and between that 60 on the bottom of the dial there should be 70 through which this tone arm should move this is limitation of the meter you see 15 is more responsibility than he had at 20 you got that so to have more responsibility than he had at 15 itd have to go down to 10 right to take more responsibility for life than he had at 10 hes got to go over here to 60 and thats more responsibility than 10 and then theres more responsibility at 50 you see and then theres more responsibility at 40 and then when he consistently again is reading here at his 30 for clear why he when he is cleared he will just hang there and it means hes totally responsible now theres the cycle of responsibility on that action and as you audit that is the one factor that you can check pc back against is he more responsible well the dead thetan is more responsible at 15 than he was at 20 see but there is 70 on your tone arm dial the limitations of manufacture of the meter prevent this thing from just twisting all the way through and coming back again otherwise actually its full circle so dont think that the case that goes dawn to 15 is special case it is not hes not special case hes more responsible than he just was only start worrying about this case if he sooner or later doesnt become 65 got it that means hes hung up hes not making progress but thats the way the case goes now on accs weve had this oddity of an auditor trying to read ordinarily he would run one tonearmdial division you see between 10 and 60 or hed hes really running two see but heres the way he goes he goes from 10 60 10 60 10 60 10 60 10 got the idea and actually the auditor is having to twist his tone arm dial now theres point there because 70 exists where the meter doesnt read theres point where the meter doesnt read and at some time or another very very rarely you very rarely while processing somebody ordinarily you will find somebody who is sitting at 70 and you cant get him on the top of the meter and you cant get him on the bottom of the meter and meter ever manufactured will be able to compensate this because of the tone arm limitations of just having the tone arm on pot you got the idea this is modern electronics theyll have to change modern electronics before we can get 70 you got it you probably could design one that would run this way but dont be too amazed if you go for instance from 60 to 10 60 to 10 or if all of sudden the pc doesnt read anyplace you start going this way he doesnt read anyplace on the dial hes not up hes not down sensitivity doesnt do anything well two things could happen either your meters out at which time it is just necessary for you to reach over and take the cans and put yourself on the meter see and pull the tone arm down oh the meter is reading give them back to the pc ah that tells you it all haha hes at 70 the pc is at 70 just go on and process him on something you figure will work or go on processing whatever you were processing that got him onto 70 if you picked him up originally off the street and he was on 70 very rare this is this is extremely rare but it could happen to you whats your final answer well youll just have to run him on something that will improve the case and he will read on the emeter this is bug in the construction of the meter okay all right now change of characteristic means that the meter on certain question has its needle shift into different action than it was in it resumes its old action when you longer ask the question when you ask the question it takes on any different reaction you got the idea change of characteristic thats all that means for instance it was thetabopping and you ask him about donuts and you started to get fall but you ask him about anything else and he thetabops again thats change of characteristic now reversewise you were getting fall fall fall everything you say to the pc you see you say well did you eat breakfast this morning do you like egyptian cotton what color is piece of tin you ask him anything and you get fall well that is the needle pattern of that pc its fall its fall its fall its fall its fall itd be maybe one division fall every time you say anything ordinarily youd get this if your sensitivity was just little high one of the ways to do it is just back your sensitivity off little bit but nevertheless you can read through that that is the pattern of the meter you usually read from still needle try to read from still needle but the pattern of the meter for this pc is fall do you like egyptian cotton have you seen jeweler recently have you ever shot grapes and its just fall its fall its fall its fall its fall the fall is always the same fall and then you say well are you pleased with your marriage now you get theta bop ahha ahha and you say do you like the union jack and you get fall and you get fall and you say are you pleased with your marriage and you get theta bop that means that that question is charged but which question is charged its the one that produces the change of pattern you got the idea now more loosely more loosely you can say that any time the pc has charged question within his level of reality you get change of pattern you could say fall is change of pattern theta bop is change of pattern rock slam is change of pattern dont you see so basically youre trying to change the pattern of this meter now lets get back to tension this meter has to be set up higher and higher and its reads are tighter and tighter the more and more tension there is on case and your goal of processing is to take that tension off and the meter of course registers this you get low sensitivity knob this starts to come in toward clear and eventually tension isnt even registered on the needle sort of falls out in this order the tension as the case gets better will fall out of the sensitivity knob then the tension starts you see at 65 on the tone arm dial thats not untense actually you go ding like this and the fellow hits high c you know all right there it comes out of the tone arm dial down and he gets down toward clear read and it pumps down over the hours and hours of processing you see gradually pumps down closer and closer in and eventually the tension totally disappears out of the needle and the needle then is free needle we have been careless in use of terms free needle means the needle is free null needle means it doesnt get change of pattern or react on the question but free needle just floats when youve seen free needle become unmistakable it just floats it just floats around actually it looks like your sensitivity knob you can actually approximate free needle by turning your sensitivity up maybe to about 16 on an average case and then not let him breathe and youll get float and this needle just floats around and of course thats tension isnt it now when youve cleaned up everything in life that he could possibly have any tension on which is called stabilizing clear you just go over more goals and more prehav scale just and do all the steps of sop goals on and on and on he starts blowing them by inspection and it gets easier and easier for him to blow them theres less and less tension on this needle and eventually you cant get any reaction on the needle and thats it youve got clear you got that so just ive taken you now from total tension which is deadthetan reading at clear then you get read on up the line more and different positions of the tone arm different characteristics of the needle eventually up to at particular stage of the game does it read certain combo beyond saying well the fellow does not now have to have his sensitivity jacked up all right he used to have so therefore hes getting better the fellow is not now reading at 60 on the tone arm he reads down around 35 40 well hes getting better dont you see and his needle doesnt get sticky and unstick and do jerky things and so forth and hes getting better dont you see and eventually when the needle the tone arm and the sensitivity knob longer produce matter what you do with them any reaction on the thetan that youre auditing oh of course you can still on floating needle you can pinch the guy madly and so forth and rough him up enough and go like this in front of his face and kick him around and if he did get annoyed with you which is not probable but if you did you could probably get another reaction on the thing if you hit him with truck something but now were getting up to theta clear now this requires an entirely different meter ill talk to you in just moment about the future of meters this meter will always be necessary just as it is because it tells us everything we need to know in order to clear person okay we neednt know any more than this we could know all about its design and how many pounds of weight the thing has you could probably be flunked on an emeter examination what is the exact weight in grams of we could get pedantic you know of mark iv british meter oh you dont know well you dont know how to run an emeter you get the idea we could go goofy like this as matter of fact they do in the army the private trying to make lance corporal why they ask him how many pounds does whatever the currentissue rifle weigh and all of this kind of thing and what is the exact muzzle velocity of stokes mortar and ah he isnt supposed to know the exact muzzle velocity hes supposed to be able to fire them accurately the next meter above this is not meter you would care to use on person up to clearing because its an oscilloscope meter and for you to stand there with green line dancing madly in front of your face during all of the auditing where this needle is you wouldnt like it you wouldnt like it its interesting and if case was real sticky you might take one of these ometers or theta meters and you might put lowtone case on it and you might be able to get him unstuck on his flows because it registers flows but you wouldnt like to audit him on it ive already discovered this ive been researching by the way for this next level meter for several years and i finally got it boxed in to i know exactly what were looking for and exactly what weve got to have now thats as far as its gone well ive got some people building one as far as that goes but for you to audit with bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz going on here furthermore theyre about two feet deep minimum and theyre about foot and half high and about foot and half wide and youd have to have the janitor come up and move it in your auditing room because theyre heavy now big one which it may eventually have to be is so big that it took peter and myself and we were very happy when we set it down to carry in the last experimental model into this office it took the two of us staggering so its not practical from that standpoint but it is practical from the point that if youre going to audit somebody up from clear you have to have something that reads in micromicrovolts you have to have something which is so sensitive that theres the body and theres the thetan now if the thetan is still in connection with his body in any way shape or form itll read on the meter you see so youd be able to tell what hes thinking and what he cant confront electrically you see and youd be able to sort him out even though he was off the top of this meter with this new theta meter you see hed think i hate cops you know hes clear as far as earth body is concerned and that sort of thing but hes still got bugs because look ill point something out to you he cannot well he builds houses thats kind of remarkable when you come to think about it he builds houses he builds them you know he puts planks together and puts up windows and why doesnt he say house pshew theres house so there must be something wrong with him obvious isnt it this actually doesnt read any higher than about 20 on the tone scale this goes up to about 20 on the tone scale from 20 to 40 on the tone scale you need another piece of equipment why because this measures games conditions called physical universe and you need something that shades the tiniest tiniest things to read the next level up but this will take you to clear well the funny part of it is that everything you need to know about this meter i have given you in this talk isnt anything else you need to know about this meter assess on the needle process on the tone arm diagnose on the sensitivity knob the thing represents tension the higher these things have to be set up the more tension is in the pc and as you run it you are simply taking the tension out of the pc and the needle and the tone arm and the sensitivity knob read more and more comfortably and eventually when they dont read at all youve got stable mest clear when i say they dont read at all its just frankly that i have piece of news for you just i might as well put onto this last few inches of tape here thats running that you will be interested in we have theoretically transcended mest universe weapons it may not mean much to you as sudden statement but as you go off the top of this meter in other words the meter is longer active on the individual it means his tolerance of motion his tolerance of change is so great that if you hit him with bullet you wouldnt hurt him you probably wouldnt even be able to hit him with bullet and the big boys walking up and down and mocking up space flights with their from their arsenals of atom bombs here they are with their nice polished atom bombs that can wipe out the world and so forth well nobody developed defense against the atom bomb and for number of years i actually worked on mest defenses against an atom bomb and i know they could be developed but it would cost billions and we all of sudden have defense against the atom bomb person who is supercleared probably up around the level of theta clear is not affected by them he could probably stand right in the middle of an atom bomb blast but his tolerance of change would be so great end of lecture
