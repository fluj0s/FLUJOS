6409c22 shspec40 review of study there are textbooks on how to study even in schools of education lrh plans to write one that would revolutionize the field of study and education in johannesburg tests on school children showed decrease in iq that was more marked the longer they stayed in school the longer person studies of course the more words he runs into that he doesnt understand and the more confusion he piles up artists writers etc in the workaday world have this peculiarity the successful ones have never taken course in their art field or even finished college at party given in new york for professional writers lrh did an informal survey to determine the educational background of the guests he found that most of them had either been expelled from college or had never attended college in the first place the one exception was man who piped up and said that he had obtained phd in literature he turned out to be literary agent failed writer in the years following lrh found out that writing courses dont teach writing they teach some technology that writers dont use and various gimmicks that writers also dont use writers do have and use technology but writing courses dont teach it the trouble is that writers are professional liars when then tell you how they write they tell the most incredible tales they never really say what they do so there are lot of pretended technologies in the area in any technical subject technology builds up in the area of correction such technologies as photographic retouching or correction lists tend to be more complex than the technologies that they correct if you have the technique of how to do it in the first place everything will move smoothly from there on but if technology is missing not known or not practiced we will now get complicated technology arising as lowerscale subject that will be corrective of the upperscale subject medicine is another example of corrective technology the upperscale technology would be that of making bodies properly in the first place as practiced today all education is corrective technology it is trying to correct its own failed corrections there is duress in the field to get students to learn this must be an effort to correct the students failure to get the material in the first place caused by early confusions duress in education is substitute for the missing technology of the misunderstood word and the cause of the failure of education the duress makes it impossible for the student to use his education he is left on suppress and an onlyone basis because the duress has caused him to go out of arc with the subject so he does nonapplication of the information he might even get weird and revengeful towards his subject schools keep kids in line until they are old enough for the police to take over the job freedom from is fighting something or worrying about it not true freedom one way in which you can have misunderstood is by getting what the writer is saying but having misunderstood or missed something perhaps earlier not getting what the writer is driving at how does the state suffer from miseducation in russia many students were given onthejob training for key posts but after their training 100 of the students left the posts that they were trained for what must have happened is that way back in school the communist love of changing the meanings of words got in there the english upper governing class lost their influence by being educated to death so the continuation of culture depends on having technology of study the government is trying to bring in law and order while creating disorder delinquency and stupidity in the schools once again scientology and dianetics collide with an area where there is pretended technology unlike the area of medicine and drugs the field of education is not one of vested interest because there is not as much money in it when you are teaching teachers about study technology you should recognize that you are moving them up from level 0 to level i see pp 521523 above for description of level 0 p 479 above for description of levels i and ii and p 462 above for summary of levels and classes iiv you can tell the teachers the iq of your children could be increased by study instead of decreased or your school could run with less upset or juvenile delinquency is caused by miseducation this will be very acceptable to them and they will never think to ask where this data and knowledge is coming from because they never think about anything in the first place you havent realized that they cant see where it is coming from because they cant see at all this is because they have been trained into stupidity when you fail to communicate to someone about scientology it is because you are talking to them above the level at which you should be talking to them youve got to give them the idea that there are data that data can be comprehended and that they can learn something then you can give them the idea that there is knowledge people dont expect anything to work because nothing ever has they dont think that there is anything to know if we are unreal to them it is because everything is unreal to them we have high commandvalue over them scientology could probably put the whole society into some kind of obedience basis but that is not our purpose you would have win if you approached someone on the following gradient 1 getting him into state where he could learn 2 showing him that there was something to be studied 3 showing him that there was body of information about study 4 showing him that there was body of information to study this hasnt been our normal approach we have generally overlooked the fact that if someone cant learn he cant even receive your message in fact his basic ptps have to do with not knowing if he knew that there was some way to learn about anything he would be very interested if he could know that there was some way to gather data he would be on your side because he could apply this to his ptps you would teach him that the first step to knowing about something is to observe it both you and he have probably taken it for granted that he is already doing that when he isnt you could ask him something like have you ever taken really good look at what your wife is doing or some such when you are teaching someone about study you take the obvious and expand it as an introduction to the field in dissemination you are not up against societys ignorance cussedness or unwillingness to be helped but against incorrect study tech and charge on study this jams your comm line incorrect study tech prohibits people from learning that there is more to know thus stultifying the intellect creating stupidity and discouraging observation therefore study is an excellent dissemination tool when disseminating stay simple concentrate on something like one learns through observation which is accomplished by observing tell them about the value of observing gaining familiarity etc dont start with the arc triangle the person that you are disseminating to doesnt know that knowledge hasnt already all been found out he has to come to realize that he can learn and that there is more to know since he first tried to learn something he has been subjected to technology that stultifies the intellect he has weird ideas about study that make him flinch from the idea of learning things you have to make him reach by giving him the obvious which he can see take the obvious points and get studious about them you can get away with being studious about what is obvious person isnt going to get anywhere except by observation anyway let him get complex about the subject of observation he will only wind up back at observing he will get to the fact that you observe by observing after he blows through the complexity by reach and withdraw of observation he gets more familiar eg with his wife thus study can bring him out of it
