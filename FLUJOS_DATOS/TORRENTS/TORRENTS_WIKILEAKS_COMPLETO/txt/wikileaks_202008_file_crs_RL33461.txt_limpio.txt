and industry division civilian nuclear waste disposal summary management of civilian radioactive waste has posed difficult issues for congress since the beginning of the nuclear power industry in the 1950s federal policy is based on the premise that nuclear waste can be disposed of safely but proposed storage and disposal facilities have frequently been challenged on safety health and environmental grounds although civilian radioactive waste encompasses wide range of materials most of the current debate focuses on highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 nwpa calls for disposal of spent nuclear fuel in deep geologic repository nwpa established an office in the department of energy doe to develop such repository and required the programs civilian costs to be covered by fee on nucleargenerated electricity paid into the nuclear waste fund amendments to nwpa in 1987 restricted does repository site studies to yucca mountain in nevada doe is studying numerous scientific issues at yucca mountain in pursuing license from the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for the planned repository major questions about the site include the likelihood of earthquakes volcanoes water infiltration and human intrusion the fy2009 budget request for the nuclear waste program is 4947 million 28 above the fy2008 appropriation however the fy2008 level of 3864 million is about 50 million below the fy2007 level and more than 100 million below the administrations fy2008 request the house appropriations committee approved does full request for fy2009 and the senate appropriations committee recommended 3884 million funding for the program is currently under continuing resolution pl 110329 nwpas goal for starting to load waste into the repository was 1998 but that date has been pushed back repeatedly the latest budget cuts are likely to delay waste shipments to yucca mountain until at least 2020 according to program managers doe submitted license application for the repository to nrc june 3 2008 and nrc docketed the application september 8 2008 nwpa requires nrc to issue licensing decision within four years of receiving does application the nrc license is to be based on radiation exposure standards set by the environmental protection agency which issued revised standards september 30 2008 the administration proposed legislation on march 6 2007 to repeal the statutory cap on the amount of waste at yucca mountain reduce the scope of environmental reviews for the repository change budget procedures so that program funding could be increased more easily exempt nuclear waste sent to yucca mountain from disposal requirements under the resource conservation and recovery act and allow preemption of state and local

3864 million is about 50 million below the fy2007 level and more than 100 million below the administrations fy2008 request the house appropriations committee approved does full request for fy2009 and the senate appropriations committee recommended 3884 million funding for the program is currently under continuing resolution pl 110329 under the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 nwpa the doe program is developing an underground nuclear waste repository at yucca mountain nevada doe contends that recent funding reductions will delay the earliest possible opening of the yucca mountain repository to 2020 22 years later than required by nwpa doe submitted license application for the yucca mountain repository to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc on june 3 2008 nrc formally accepted the application for docketing and review on september 8 2008 at the same time nrc staff recommended that the commission adopt does environmental impact statement for the project but with stipulation that supplemental groundwater analysis be conducted the environmental protection agency epa issued revised radiation exposure standards for the yucca mountain repository on september 30 2008 epas previous standards had established exposure limits for 10000 years but that compliance period was found to be too short by 2005 federal court decision epas final standard which nrc must use in licensing the repository sets an annual exposure limit of 15 millirems for the first 10000 years and 100 millirems for the period of 10000 through 1 million years separate exposure standard of 4 millirems from groundwater also applies during the first 10000 years doe updated its lifecycle cost estimate for the yucca mountain repository on august 5 2008 according to the new estimate the yucca mountain program will cost 962 billion in 2007 dollars from the beginning of the program in 1983 to repository closure in 2133 does previous estimate issued in 2001 was 575 billion in 2000 dollars major factors in the increase are inflation and higher estimate of spent fuel to be generated by existing reactors spent fuel from proposed new reactors is not included in the cost estimate the bush administration on march 6 2007 proposed draft nuclear waste legislation similar to legislation in the 109th congress that was not enacted hr 5360 s 2589 the draft bill would repeal the 70000 metric ton limit on the amount of waste that can be emplaced at yucca mountain limit that is expected to be crs2 exceeded by currently operating reactors during their lifetimes the bill also would reduce the scope of environmental reviews for the repository change the budget scoring of waste fee receipts so that program funding could be increased more easily exempt nuclear waste sent to yucca mountain from disposal requirements under the resource conservation and recovery act and allow preemption of state and local transportation requirements to remove potential obstacle to new nuclear power plants posed by yucca mountain delays the bill would require nrc to assume that sufficient disposal capacity will be available for waste produced by new reactors several of the administrations goals are addressed by bills introduced by senator domenici may 23 2007 s 37 and senator inhofe january 24 2008 s 2551 introduction nuclear waste has sometimes been called the achilles heel of the nuclear power industry much of the controversy over nuclear power centers on the lack of disposal system for the highly radioactive spent fuel that must be regularly removed from operating reactors lowlevel radioactive waste generated by nuclear power plants industry hospitals and other activities is also longstanding issue spent nuclear fuel under the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 nwpa and 1987 amendments the department of energy doe is focusing on yucca mountain nevada to house deep underground repository for spent nuclear fuel and other highly radioactive waste the state of nevada has strongly opposed does efforts on the grounds that the site is unsafe pointing to potential volcanic activity earthquakes water infiltration underground flooding nuclear chain reactions and fossil fuel and mineral deposits that might encourage future human intrusion despite those concerns doe contends that the scientific evidence indicates that yucca mountain is suitable and that licensing of the site by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc should proceed draft environmental impact statement eis completed by doe in july 1999 and finalized in february 2002 recommended that the project proceed as planned doe submitted license application for the repository to nrc on june 3 2008 however doe officials now do not expect the planned yucca mountain repository to open until 2020 at the earliest about 22 years later than the 1998 goal specified by nwpa1 the safety of geologic disposal of spent nuclear fuel and highlevel waste hlw as planned in the united states depends largely on the characteristics of the rock formations from which repository would be excavated because many geologic formations are believed to have remained undisturbed for millions of years it appeared technically feasible to isolate radioactive materials from the environment until they decayed to safe levels there is strong worldwide consensus that the best 1 nuclear energy institute key issues yucca mountain httpwwwneiorgkeyissues nuclearwastedisposalyuccamountain viewed april 11 2008 crs3 safest longterm option for dealing with hlw is geologic isolation according to the national research council2 but as the yucca mountain controversy indicates scientific confidence about the concept of deep geologic disposal has turned out to be difficult to apply to specific sites every highlevel waste site that has been proposed by doe and its predecessor agencies has faced allegations or discovery of unacceptable flaws such as water intrusion or earthquake vulnerability that could release radioactivity into the environment much of the problem results from the inherent uncertainty involved in predicting waste site performance for the one million years that nuclear waste is to be isolated the bush administrations global nuclear energy partnership gnep is intended to address some of those disposal problems by reducing the volume of waste that would be emplaced in repository and reducing its longterm radioactivity under gnep spent nuclear fuel would be reprocessed or recycled by separating various elements such as plutonium that could be made into new fuel and transmuted into shorterlived radioactive isotopes spent fuel reprocessing however has long been controversial because of the potential weapons use of separated plutonium and cost concerns other programs other types of civilian radioactive waste have also generated public controversy particularly lowlevel radioactive waste which is produced by nuclear power plants medical institutions industrial operations and research activities civilian lowlevel waste currently is disposed of in large trenches at sites in south carolina and washington state however the washington facility does not accept waste from outside its region and the south carolina site will be available only to the three members of the atlantic disposal compact connecticut new jersey and south carolina after june 30 2008 the lowestconcentration class of lowlevel radioactive waste is also accepted by utah commercial disposal facility threats by states to close their disposal facilities led to congressional authorization of regional compacts for lowlevel waste disposal in 1985 although new sites have been opened by any of the 10 approved disposal compacts pursuant to 2003 texas statute an application to build disposal facility for commercial and federal low level waste in andrews county texas was filed august 2 2004 by waste control specialists llc the texas commission on environmental quality issued draft license for the facility august 11 2008 nuclear utility lawsuits nuclear utilities which pay for most of the highlevel waste disposal program through fee on nuclear power have sued doe for failing to begin the removal of 2 national research council board on radioactive waste management rethinking highlevel radioactive waste disposal position statement of the board on radioactive waste management 1990 p 2 crs4 spent nuclear fuel from storage at commercial reactors by january 31 1998 the deadline established by the nuclear waste policy act industry officials contend that total damages for missing the 1998 disposal deadline could eventually reach tens of billions of dollars assuming that disposal ever takes place doe has been negotiating with various reactor owners since 1999 on the missed nuclear waste deadline and reached its first settlement agreement with nuclear utility peco energy co now part of exelon on july 19 2000 the agreement allowed peco to keep up to 80 million in nuclear waste fee revenues during the subsequent 10 years however other utilities sued doe to block the settlement contending that nuclear waste fees may be used only for the doe waste program and not as compensation for missing the disposal deadline the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit agreed ruling september 24 2002 that any compensation would have to come from general revenues or other sources than the waste fund exelon announced settlement with the department of justice august 10 2004 in which compensation for the companys nuclear waste storage costs would be paid from the federal judgment fund exelon which operates 17 reactors calculates that it would be reimbursed 300 million if doe began taking waste by its previous goal of 2010 and up to 600 million if the schedule slipped to 2015 as noted above doe now does not expect to begin taking waste until 2020 at the earliest the us court of federal claims has since ordered more than 400 million in payments to utilities in several other nuclear waste delay cases tva was awarded 349 million on january 31 2006 which was paid from the judgment fund in august 2006 three new england power companies were awarded 142 million

that the federal governments liabilities will reach as much as 11 billion by 2020 the current goal for starting waste shipments to the repository10 although some of the programs delays have been blamed on poor management doe contends that tight funding has been major barrier doe cannot spend the nuclear industrys mandatory waste fees without congressional appropriations and only about half the total fees collected have been appropriated to the program so far however some surplus in the fund may be necessary to pay future nuclear waste disposal costs after todays nuclear plants have ceased operation the nuclear industry and others have long urged changes in the waste programs funding mechanism but have consistently been blocked by budget scoring and policy issues congressional action continued delays in the yucca mountain project have prompted proposals for legislative redirection of the nuclear waste program the bush administration proposed draft legislation on march 6 2007 that would facilitate the licensing construction and operation of the repository by 2017 according to energy secretary samuel w bodman11 the administrations nuclear waste bill is nearly identical to legislation it submitted to the 109th congress hr 5360 s 2589 that was not enacted the bill would reduce the scope of environmental reviews for the repository change the budget scoring of waste fee receipts so that program funding could be increased more easily exempt nuclear waste sent to yucca mountain from disposal requirements under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra allow preemption of state and local transportation requirements and permanently withdraw the site from public lands use to remove potential obstacle to new nuclear power plants posed by yucca mountain delays the administration bill would require nrc to assume that sufficient disposal capacity would be available for waste produced by new reactors known as the waste confidence determination it also would repeal the 70000 metric ton limit on the amount of waste that could be emplaced at yucca mountain limit that is expected to be exceeded by currently operating reactors during their lifetimes notably excluded from the bill is an authorization for interim federal storage of nuclear waste pending disposal at yucca mountain after the 9 cawley kim the federal governments liabilities under the nuclear waste policy act congressional budget office statement to house budget committee october 4 2007 p 8 10 statement of edward f sproat iii director of the office of civilian radioactive waste management us department of energy to the house budget committee october 4 2007 p 3 11 secretary of energy transmittal letter for nuclear fuel management and disposal act march 6 2007 crs6 administration submitted the proposed legislation to the 110th congress doe office of civilian radioactive waste management director ward f sproat iii warned that if congress does not lift the yucca mountain capacity limit he will have to recommend that site search begin for second repository12 several provisions similar to those in the administrations bill are included in legislation introduced by senator domenici on may 23 2007 s 37 called the nuclear waste access to yucca nuway act s 37 provides for permanent land withdrawal repeal of the repository capacity limit infrastructure and rail line construction budget scoring changes and the nrc waste confidence finding it excludes the administrations proposed rcra exemption but includes an authorization for interim storage of certain waste at yucca mountain senator inhofe introduced nuclear waste bill on january 24 2008 s 2551 that would repeal the repository capacity limit provide for nrcs waste confidence finding and establish phased licensing system for the repository under the phased licensing proposal nuclear waste could be retrievably stored in the yucca mountain repository for up to 300 years before doe would need to receive license to leave the waste in the repository permanently the state of nevada strongly opposes the administrations yucca mountain legislation as an alternative approach senator reid introduced legislation on march 6 2007 to require commercial nuclear reactor operators to place their spent nuclear fuel into onsite dry storage casks which would then become the permanent responsibility of doe s 784 opponents of the proposal contend that it would leave spent fuel at reactor sites indefinitely and undermine the nuclear waste policy act however supporters argue that the waste would be safer in dry storage at reactor sites than if it were shipped across the country to yucca mountain because of delays in the yucca mountain project the senate appropriations committee included statutory authorization for the secretary of energy to designate interim storage sites for spent nuclear fuel as part of the fy2007 energy and water development appropriations bill hr 5427 sec 313 however the 109th congress adjourned without enacting the measure the senate committees provisions would have required the secretary after consultation with the governor to designate storage site in each state with nuclear power plant if feasible or to designate regional storage facilities representative buyer introduced broad energy bill hr 6001 on may 8 2008 that includes provisions to transfer the doe nuclear waste disposal program to an independent authority president bush recommended the yucca mountain site to congress on february 15 2002 and nevada governor guinn submitted notice of disapproval or state veto april 8 2002 as allowed by nwpa the state veto would have blocked further repository development at yucca mountain if resolution approving the site 12 hiruo elaine hoping to push repository forward doe resends draft bill to congress nuclearfuel march 12 2007 p 12 crs7 had not been passed by congress and signed into law within 90 days of continuous session an approval resolution was signed by president bush july 23 2002 pl 10720013 characteristics of nuclear waste radioactive waste is term that encompasses broad range of material with widely varying characteristics some waste has relatively slight radioactivity and is safe to handle while other types are intensely hot in both temperature and radioactivity some decays to safe levels of radioactivity in matter of days or weeks while other types will remain dangerous for thousands of years major types of radioactive waste are described below14 spent nuclear fuel fuel rods that have been permanently withdrawn from nuclear reactor because they can longer efficiently sustain nuclear chain reaction although they contain uranium and plutonium that could be extracted through reprocessing to make new fuel by far the most radioactive type of civilian nuclear waste spent fuel contains extremely hot but relatively shortlived fission products fragments of the nuclei of uranium and other fissile elements as well as longlived radionuclides radioactive atoms such as plutonium which remains dangerously radioactive for tens of thousands of years or more highlevel waste highly radioactive residue created by spent fuel reprocessing almost entirely for defense purposes in the united states highlevel waste contains most of the radioactive fission products of spent fuel but most of the uranium and plutonium usually has been removed for reuse enough longlived radioactive elements remain however to require isolation for 10000 years or more transuranic tru waste relatively lowactivity waste that contains more than certain level of longlived elements heavier than uranium primarily plutonium shielding may be required for handling of some types of tru waste in the united states transuranic waste is generated almost entirely by nuclear weapons production 13 senator bingaman introduced the approval resolution in the senate april 9 2002 sjres 34 and representative barton introduced it in the house april 11 2002 hjres 87 the subcommittee on energy and air quality of the house committee on energy and commerce approved hjres 87 on april 23 by 242 vote and the full committee approved the measure two days later 416 hrept 107425 the resolution was passed by the house may 8 2002 by vote of 306117 the senate committee on energy and natural resources approved sjres 34 by 1310 vote june 5 2002 srept 107159 following 6039 vote to consider sjres 34 the senate passed hjres 87 by voice vote july 9 2002 14 statutory definitions for spent nuclear fuel highlevel radioactive waste and low level radioactive waste can be found in section 2 of the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 42 usc 10101 transuranic waste is defined in section 11ee of the atomic energy act 42 usc 2014 section 11e2 of the act includes uranium mill tailings in the definition of byproduct material mixed waste consists of chemically hazardous waste as defined by epa regulations 40 cfr part 261 subparts c and d that contains radioactive materials as defined by the atomic energy act crs8 processes because of the plutonium longterm isolation is required tru waste is being sent to deep underground repository the waste isolation pilot plant wipp near carlsbad new mexico lowlevel waste radioactive waste not classified as spent fuel highlevel waste tru waste or byproduct material such as uranium mill tailings below four classes of lowlevel waste have been established by nrc ranging from least radioactive and shortestlived to the longestlived and most radioactive although some types of lowlevel waste can be more radioactive than some types of highlevel waste in general lowlevel waste contains relatively low amounts of radioactivity that decays relatively quickly lowlevel waste disposal facilities cannot accept material that exceeds nrc concentration limits uranium mill tailings sandlike residues remaining from the processing of uranium ore such tailings have very low radioactivity but extremely large volumes that can pose hazard particularly from radon emissions or groundwater contamination mixed waste chemically hazardous waste that includes radioactive material highlevel lowlevel and tru waste and radioactive byproduct material often falls under the designation of mixed waste such waste poses serious institutional problems because the radioactive portion is regulated by doe or nrc under the atomic energy act while the environmental protection agency epa regulates the nonradioactive elements under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra spent nuclear fuel when spent nuclear fuel is removed from reactor usually after several years of power production it is thermally hot and highly radioactive the spent fuel is in the form of fuel assemblies which consist of arrays of metalclad fuel rods 1215 feet long fresh fuel rod which emits relatively little radioactivity contains uranium that has been enriched in the isotope u235 usually 35 but after nuclear fission has taken place in the reactor many of the uranium nuclei in the fuel rods have been split into variety of highly radioactive fission products others have absorbed neutrons to become radioactive plutonium some of which has also split into fission products radioactive gases are also contained in the spent fuel rods newly withdrawn spent fuel assemblies are stored in deep pools of water adjacent to the reactors to keep them from overheating and to protect workers from radiation spent fuel discharged from us commercial nuclear reactors is currently stored at 72 power plant sites around the nation plus two small central storage facilities typical large commercial nuclear reactor discharges an average of 2030 metric tons of spent fuel per year an average of about 2150 metric tons annually for the entire us nuclear power industry the nuclear industry estimated that the total crs9 amount of commercial spent fuel was 56586 metric tons by january 200815 an amount projected to reach 62000 metric tons by 2010 including 7000 metric tons of doe spent fuel and highlevel waste that is also planned for disposal at yucca mountain the total amount would nearly reach nwpas 70000metricton limit by 2010 as long as nuclear power continues to be generated the amounts stored at plant sites will continue to grow until an interim storage facility or permanent repository can be opened or until alternative treatment and disposal technology is developed doe recently updated its estimate of the total amount of commercial spent fuel that may eventually require disposal from 105000 metric tons16 to 130000 metric tons17 new storage capacity at operating nuclear plant sites or other locations will be required if doe is unable to begin accepting waste into its disposal system until 2020 or later most utilities are expected to construct new dry storage capacity for their older cooler fuel onsite dry storage facilities currently in operation or planned typically consist of metal casks or concrete modules nrc has determined that spent fuel could be stored safely at reactor sites for up to 100 years18 the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 heightened concerns about the vulnerability of stored spent fuel concerns have been raised that an aircraft crash into reactors pool area or sabotage could drain the pool and cause the spent fuel inside to overheat report released by nrc january 17 2001 found that overheating could cause the zirconium alloy cladding of spent fuel to catch fire and release hazardous amounts of radioactivity although it characterized the probability of such fire as low in report released april 6 2005 the national academy of sciences nas found that successful terrorist attacks on spent fuel pools though difficult are possible to reduce the likelihood of spent fuel cladding fires the nas study recommended that hotter and cooler spent fuel assemblies be interspersed throughout spent fuel pools that spray systems be installed above the pools and that more fuel be transferred from pools to dry cask storage19 nrc has agreed to consider some of the recommendations although it contends that current security measures would prevent successful attacks the nuclear industry contends that the several hours required for uncovered spent fuel to heat up enough to catch fire would allow ample 15 spent fuel inventory at 56586 metric tons nuclearfuel january 28 2008 p

radioactive waste streams an overview of waste classification for disposal by anthony andrews current policy and regulation spent fuel and highlevel waste are federal responsibility while states are authorized to develop disposal facilities for commercial lowlevel waste in general disposal requirements have grown more stringent over the years in line with overall national environmental policy and heightened concerns about the hazards of radioactivity spent nuclear fuel current program the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 nwpa pl 97425 established system for selecting geologic repository for the permanent disposal of up to 70000 metric tons 77000 tons of spent nuclear fuel and highlevel waste does office of civilian radioactive waste management ocrwm was created to carry out the program the nuclear waste fund holding receipts from fee on commercial nuclear power and federal contributions for emplacement of highlevel defense waste was established to pay for the program doe was required to select three candidate sites for the first national highlevel waste repository after much controversy over does implementation of nwpa the act was substantially modified by the nuclear

congress for further instructions the 1987 amendments also authorized construction of monitored retrievable storage mrs facility to store spent fuel and prepare it for delivery to the repository but because of fears that the mrs would reduce the need to open the permanent repository and become facto repository itself the law forbids doe from selecting an mrs site until recommending to the president that permanent repository be constructed the repository recommendation occurred in february 2002 but doe has not announced any plans for an mrs waste facility schedules doe announced on july 19 2006 that it would submit license application to nrc for the planned yucca mountain repository by june 30 2008 at the same time doe announced that its new goal for starting nuclear waste shipments to yucca mountain would be early 2017 however congress cut the programs funding for fy2008 by about 50 million below the fy2007 level and more than 100 million below the administrations fy2008 request the funding cut will force at least 500 layoffs at the yucca mountain project and delay the repositorys opening until at least 202021 22 years later than required by nwpa in preparation for filing the yucca mountain license application doe certified on october 19 2007 that more than 35 million documents supporting the planned application had been made electronically available to the public as required by nrc doe submitted the repository license application on june 3 2008 and over the objections of the state of nevada nrc formally accepted the application for docketing and review on september 8 2008 at the same time nrc staff recommended that the commission adopt does environmental impact statement for the project but with stipulation that supplemental groundwater analysis be conducted22 doe announced on october 25 2005 that it would require most spent fuel to be sealed in standardized canisters before shipment to yucca mountain this change would largely eliminate the handling of individual fuel assemblies at the site doe issued draft supplemental environmental impact statement in october 2007 to reflect the new disposal strategy23 the major activity at the yucca mountain site so far has been the construction and operation of an exploratory studies facility esf with 25footdiameter tunnel boring machine the esf consists primarily of fivemile tunnel with ramps

after the secretarys recommendation and nevada governor guinn subsequently submitted notice of disapproval or state veto as allowed by nwpa an approval resolution passed by the house and senate to overturn the state veto was signed by the president july 23 2002 pl 107200 doe announced april 8 2004 that it planned to transport nuclear waste mostly by rail to the planned yucca mountain repository the record of decision on the waste transportation mode was published in the federal register along with the selection of corridor in nevada for 300mile rail spur to the yucca mountain site doe estimated that yucca mountain would receive 900010000 rail shipments and 30003300 truck shipments over 24year period after the repository opened on october 13 2006 doe announced in the federal register that second shorter rail route to yucca mountain would also be considered however permission to use tribal land for the shorter route was withdrawn on april 17 2007 so doe is again focusing

by epa under the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 epa was required to write new standards specifically for yucca mountain nwpa also requires the repository to meet general siting guidelines prepared by doe and approved by nrc transportation of waste to storage and disposal sites is regulated by nrc and the department of transportation dot under nwpa doe shipments to yucca mountain must

licensing requirements for yucca mountain at 10 cfr 63 require compliance with epas standards described below and establish procedures that doe must follow in seeking repository license for example doe must conduct repository performance confirmation program that would indicate whether natural and manmade systems were functioning as intended and assure that other assumptions about repository conditions were accurate the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 made number of changes in the nuclear waste regulatory system particularly that epa must issue new environmental standards specifically for the yucca mountain repository site general epa repository standards previously issued and subsequently revised longer apply to yucca mountain doe and nrc had raised concern that some of epas general standards might be impossible or impractical to meet at yucca mountain35 the new standards which limit the radiation dose that the repository could impose on individual members of the public

study by the national academy of sciences nas which was issued august 1 199536 the nas study recommended that the yucca mountain environmental standards establish limit on risk to individuals near the repository rather than setting specific limits for the releases of radioactive material or on radioactive doses as under previous epa standards the nas study also examined the potential for human intrusion into the repository and found scientific basis for predicting human behavior thousands of years into the future pursuant to the energy policy act epa published its proposed yucca mountain radiation protection standards on august 27 1999 the proposal would have limited annual radiation doses to 15 millirems for the reasonably maximally exposed individual and to 4 millirems from groundwater exposure for the first 10000 years of repository operation epa calculated that its standard would result in an annual risk of fatal cancer for the maximally exposed individual of seven chances in million the nuclear industry criticized the epa proposal as being unnecessarily stringent particularly the groundwater standard on the other hand environmental groups contended that the 10000year standard proposed by epa was too short because doe had projected that radioactive releases from the repository would peak after about 400000 years epa issued its final yucca mountain standards on june 6 2001 the final standards included most of the major provisions of the proposed version including the 15 millirem overall exposure limit and the 4 millirem groundwater limit despite the departments opposition to the epa standards does site suitability evaluation determined that the yucca mountain site would be able to meet them nrc revised its repository regulations september 7 2001 to conform to the epa standards threejudge us court of appeals panel on july 9 2004 struck down the 10000year regulatory compliance period in the epa and nrc yucca mountain standards37 the court ruled that the 10000year period was inconsistent with the nas study on which the energy policy act required the yucca mountain regulations to be based in fact the court found the nas study had specifically rejected 10000year compliance period because of analysis that showed peak radioactive exposures from the repository would take place several hundred thousand years in the future in response to the court decision epa proposed new version of the yucca mountain standards on august 9 2005 the proposal would have retained the dose limits of the previous standard for the first 10000 years but allowed higher annual dose of 350 millirems for the period of 10000 years through 1 million years epa also proposed to base the post10000year yucca mountain standard on the median dose rather than the mean potentially making it easier to meet38 nevada state 36 national research council technical bases for yucca mountain standards national academy press 1995 37 nuclear energy institute v environmental protection agency us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 011258 july 9 2004 38 especially high doses at the upper end of the exposure range would raise the mean or continued crs16 officials called epas proposed standard far too lenient and charged that it was unlawful and arbitrary39 epa issued its final rule to amend the yucca mountain standards on september 30 2008 the final rule reduces the annual dose limit during the period of 10000 through 1 million years from the proposed 350 millirems to 100 millirems which the agency contended was consistent with international standards under the final rule compliance with the post10000year standard will be based on the arithmetic mean of projected doses rather than the median as proposed the 4 millirem groundwater standard will continue to apply only to the first 10000 years40 nrc will have to revise its repository licensing regulations to conform to the new epa standards for more information see crs report rl34698 epas final health and safety standard for yucca mountain by bonnie c gitlin doe estimated in its june 2008 final supplemental environmental impact statement fseis for the yucca mountain repository that the maximum mean annual individual dose after 10000 years would be 2 millirems that is substantially below the level estimated by the 2002 final environmental impact statement which calculated that the peak doses occurring after 400000 years would be about 150 millirems volume 1 chapter 5 the fseis attributed the reduction to changes in does computer model and in the assumptions used noting that various elements of does modeling approach may be challenged as part of the nrc licensing process41 alternative technologies several alternatives to the geologic disposal of spent fuel have been studied by doe and its predecessor agencies as well as technologies that might make waste disposal easier however most of these technologies involve large technical obstacles uncertain costs and potential public opposition among the primary longterm disposal alternatives to geologic repositories are disposal in deep ocean trenches and transport into space neither of which is currently being studied by doe other technologies have been studied that while probably not replacing geologic disposal might make geologic disposal safer and more predictable chief among these is the reprocessing or recycling of spent fuel so that plutonium uranium and other longlived radionuclides could be converted to fasterdecaying fission products in special nuclear reactors or particle accelerators the spent fuel recycling provisions in recent energy and water development 38 continued average more than the median or the halfway point in the data

reductions required ocrwm to reduce its workforce by about 900 according to the programs director42 funding for the nuclear waste program is provided under two appropriations accounts as shown in table 1 the administration requested 2474 million for fy2009 from the nuclear waste fund which holds fees paid by nuclear utilities an additional 2474 million was requested in the defense nuclear waste disposal account which pays for disposal of highlevel waste from the nuclear weapons program in the planned yucca mountain repository the house appropriations committee recommended the full amount for both accounts for fy2009 while the senate panel recommended 1954 million from the waste disposal account and 1930 million from the defense account although nuclear utilities pay fees to the nuclear waste fund to cover the disposal costs of civilian nuclear spent fuel doe cannot spend the money in the fund until it is appropriated by congress through september 1 2008 utility nuclear waste fees and interest totaled 28136 billion of which 7094 billion had been disbursed to the waste disposal program according to does program summary report leaving balance of 21071 billion in the nuclear

radioactive waste which generally consists of low concentrations of relatively shortlived radionuclides is state responsibility under the 1980 lowlevel radioactive waste policy act and 1985 amendments most states have joined congressionally approved interstate compacts to handle lowlevel waste disposal while others are developing singlestate disposal sites under the 1985 amendments the nations three at that time operating commercial lowlevel waste disposal facilities could start refusing to accept waste from outside their regional interstate compacts after the end of 1992 one of the three sites closed and the remaining two are using their congressionally granted authority to prohibit waste from outside their regional compacts another site in utah has since become available nationwide for most class lowlevel waste but site is currently open to nationwide disposal of all major types of lowlevel waste despite the 1992 deadline new disposal sites have been opened under the lowlevel waste act legislation providing congressional consent to disposal compact among texas maine and vermont was signed by president clinton september 20 1998 pl 105236 however on october 22 1998 proposed disposal site near sierra blanca texas was rejected by the texas natural resource conservation commission and maine has since withdrawn texas governor perry signed legislation june 20 2003 authorizing the texas commission on environment quality to license adjoining disposal facilities for commercial and federally generated lowlevel waste pursuant to that statute an application to build disposal facility crs19 for commercial and federal lowlevel waste in andrews county texas was filed august 2 2004 by waste control specialists llc the texas commission on environmental quality tceq issued draft license for the facility august 11 200845 the midwestern compact voted june 26 1997 to halt development of disposal facility in ohio nebraska regulators rejected proposed waste site for the central compact december 21 1998 drawing lawsuit from five utilities in the region us district court judge ruled september 30 2002 that nebraska had exercised bad faith in disapproving the site and ordered the state to pay 151 million to the compact settlement was reached august 9 2004 resulting in payment of 1458 million46 and the compact is seeking access to the planned texas disposal facility most other regional disposal compacts and individual states that have not joined compacts are making little progress toward finding disposal sites the disposal facility at barnwell south carolina is currently accepting all class b and c lowlevel waste from the atlantic compact formerly the northeast compact in which south carolina joined original members connecticut and new jersey on july 1 2000 under the compact south carolina can limit the use of the barnwell facility to the three compact members and state law enacted in june 2000 phased out acceptance of noncompact waste through june 30 2008 the barnwell facility previously had stopped accepting waste from outside the southeast compact at the end of june 1994 the southeast compact commission in may 1995 twice rejected south carolina proposal to open the barnwell site to waste generators outside the southeast and to bar access to north carolina until that state opened new regional disposal facility as required by the compact the rejection of those proposals led the south carolina general assembly to vote in 1995 to withdraw from the southeast compact and begin accepting waste at barnwell from all states but north carolina north carolina withdrew from the southeast compact july 26 1999 the only other existing disposal facility for all three major classes of lowlevel waste is at hanford washington controlled by the northwest compact the hanford site will continue taking waste from the neighboring rocky mountain compact under contract since the south carolina facility closed to outofregion waste the 36 states and the district of columbia that are outside the northwest rocky mountain and atlantic compacts have had disposal site for class b and c lowlevel waste waste generators in those states must store their class b and c waste on site until new disposal sites are available regulatory requirements licensing of commercial lowlevel waste facilities is carried out under the atomic energy act by nrc or by agreement states with regulatory programs approved by nrc nrc regulations governing lowlevel waste licenses must conform to general environmental protection standards 45 available on the tceq website

issued by epa transportation of lowlevel waste is jointly regulated by nrc and the department of transportation most states considering new or expanded lowlevel waste disposal facilities including texas and utah are agreement states most states both agreement and nonagreement have established substantially stricter technical requirements for lowlevel waste disposal than nrcs such as banning shallow land burial and requiring concrete bunkers and other engineered barriers nrc would issue the licenses in nonagreement states concluding discussion disposal of radioactive waste will be key issue in the continuing nuclear power debate without national disposal system spent fuel from nuclear power plants must be stored onsite indefinitely this situation may raise public concern near proposed reactor sites particularly at sites without existing reactors where spent nuclear fuel is already stored several states have tied approval of new reactors to the availability of waste disposal capacity47 under current law the federal governments waste disposal policy is focused on the planned yucca mountain repository despite presidential and congressional approval for the yucca mountain licensing process to go forward doe will face relentless opposition from the state of nevada during nrc licensing proceedings epas proposed new environmental standards for yucca mountain may face legal challenges as well which could further slow the process because of their wastedisposal contracts with doe owners of existing reactors are likely to continue seeking damages from the federal government if disposal delays continue does 2004 settlement with the nations largest nuclear operator exelon could require payments of up to 600 million from the federal judgment fund and doe estimates that payments could rise to 11 billion if yucca mountain does not open before 2020 the nuclear industry has predicted that future damages could reach tens of billions of dollars if the federal disposal program fails altogether the administrations proposed nuclear waste legislation is intended to remove some of the obstacles to opening yucca mountain and to remove the lack of permanent waste disposal as an obstacle to licensing new nuclear power plants the house and senate appropriations committees in the 109th congress urged that the federal government provide interim storage of spent nuclear fuel pending permanent solution but that option has proven highly controversial in the past the administrations proposed global nuclear energy partnership would open the door for spent fuel reprocessing as longterm option for handling nuclear waste reprocessing or recycling proponents have long contended that direct disposal of spent fuel as currently planned would waste potentially vast energy resource 47 lovell david l wisconsin legislative council staff state statutes limiting the construction of nuclear power plants october 5 2006 crs21 and that reprocessing could reduce the longterm hazard posed by nuclear waste however the united states has not pursued commercial reprocessing since the 1970s because of concerns over nuclear weapons proliferation and costs
