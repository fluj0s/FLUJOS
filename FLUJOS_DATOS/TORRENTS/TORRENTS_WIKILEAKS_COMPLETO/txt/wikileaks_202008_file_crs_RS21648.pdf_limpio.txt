want to absorb those burmese who do not qualify as refugees moreover the camps were intended for temporary use and are not cons idered suitable for permanent habitation however the scale of the pr oblem for thailand goes beyond the refugee camps along the thaiburmese border or the re settlement camps just inside burma thousands of refugees are living elsewhere in tha iland the count ry was previously the recipient of large numbers of refugees from indochina curre ntly the thai government views burma as presenting the most immediate source of refu gee problems in 1999 the thai government began implementing new procedures at the border for registration and determination of status while thai willingness to work on the refugee issue was widely applauded implementation proved problematic partly b ecause authorities insisted on group screening rather than working with refugees on casebycase basis the unhcr and refugee representatives have been ac tively involved in addressing border issues and the problems of repatriation5 the thai government is not signator to the 1951 convention on refugees or the 1967 protocol6 the term refugee and the prot ections mandate recognized under international law are not formally recognized in thailand asylum seekers are technically viewed as illegal immigrants although the lega l issues are circumvented through the use of informal references ie temporary shelters instead of refugee camps or displaced persons fleeing fighting rather than refugees until an agreement can be reached with burma and it is safe for the refugees to return thailand has basically accepted the influx of asylum seekers on humanitarian gr ounds7 in october 2002 unhcr discussed the possibility of presence inside burma if repatriation agreements were reached but efforts have gone without success human rights watch identifies two refu gee groups border refugees and urban refugees border refugees are typically permitted to stay in camps for humanitarian reasons urban refugees are thought to be mostly political dissidents although this group includes some refugees who did not feel safe at the border if considered person of concern by unhcr then the refugee is supposed to return to and register at one of the refugee camps unhcr divides this urba n group into two subcategories those refugees who would have protection in camps at the border and

secondary fear of persecution by the burmese army and other armed insurgent groups at the border itself for the past several years thailand has been tightenin g the restrictions on urban refugees and defining anyone living outside the camps as an illegal immigrant the refugees are afraid of arrest and forced repatriation in july 2003 unhcr and the thai government reached an agreement regardin g the 1500 burmese residing in bangkok the thai government wanted to control the number of refugees in bangkok and their involvement in illegal political ac tivities or crimes such as drug dealing it also thought that unhcr had too much decisionmaking au thority to issue person of concern identity cards these issues of security and sovereignty were addressed in an agreement the highlights of which are listed below decisions about persons of cern would be more transparent system to send 1500 refugees from burma to camps would be implemented with the support of unhcr unhcr would encourage refugee compliance with thai laws andregulations any refugee refusing to move would have hisher status as person of concern revoked and an additional 300 persons would be resettled in third countries8 us

the import of goods and freezing government asse ts in the united states it continues the ban on visas to burmese leaders and restricts loans and technical assistance the united states hopes to strengthen burmas democratic forces and through this legislation again recognizes the nld as the legitimate government of burma the burmese government has apparently condemned the us legislation and

does not forcibly repa triate burmese to bu rma any differences in the provisions put forward by the house and senate must be resolved by the conferees current challenges for us nd international policymakers according to usaid the policy of the united states towards burma has three main aims first to make progre ss towards democracy second to improve human rights and third to reduce and eliminate the human costs of the conflict observers maintain that the effectiveness of us and international policies toward burma could be enhanced in three areas first to increase the impact of sanctions it is seen as important that burmas neighbors to participate in the sanctions regime the measur put forward in pl 10861 represent shift in bush administration po licy from one of engagement with the spdc and active encouragement for dialogue between the suu kyi and burmese minorities to one of tougher sanctions and isolation of the country wh ich it hopes will be supported by burmas neighbors european nations have so imposed sanctions japan has suspended aid to burma through the united nations and other avenues the international community regularly expresses its views c ondemning burmas human rights abuses use of forced labor and poor idp living conditions so far however china thailand india and other asian countries ve continued normal rela tions and opposed policies of isolating burma second while the refugee situation continues access for unhcr other international observers and reporters is generally seen as critical to assessing the problem and situation accurately observers believe that accurate information would be helpful in anticipating the needs of the populations on both sides of the border in the short term and they point out that in the long term if any repatriation is to occur arrangements for resettlement of refugees returning home will need to be determined before any agreement can be put in place the thai government has long been host to refugees from burma and by all indications will continue to be for the time being however most observers believe that an eventual longterm so lution must be found for these refugees third others maintain that the international community could consider ways to influence burmas longterm political development and encourage equal rights and autonomy under federal system that incor porated the different ethnic and religious groups within broader framework increased us and internationa l sanctions reveal shift towards greater isolation of the spdc however developing framework and outlining options for eventual discussion is seen as useful to the larger process of reconstruction and reconciliation in burma
