procedures ttps for counterinsurgency coin operations have evolve d over time but are largely based on experience from northern ireland however in recent operations1 armoured infantry ai units have been used to oppose insurgents and in doing so have developed ttps to exploit the capabilities of warrior wr 2 the purpose of this doctrinal note is to provide guidance to commanders on the employment of wr in coin operations the c ontent of this note supplements afm vol 1 pt 9 tactics for stabilizing operations and will in time be integrated into it the following areas are covered the threat to wr in particular t he operating environment and the tactics employed by insurgents patrolling deliberate offensive operations movement control measures in par ticular road blocks and check points public order operations protection of convoys and the provision of escorts surveillance and search arrest operations nonspecific wr ttps combat service support including casevac vehicle recovery and basing issues 3 in coin operations the characteristics of wr2 particularly its mobility and firepower enable commanders to achieve overmatch in most si tuations in addition wrs survivability ensures that commanders can seek to deter dominate and retain the initiative within their area of operations fundamentally wr together with its dismounts should be viewed as fighting system the vehicle often referred to as the third fire team 1 particularly op telic 4 and the experi ences of 1 pwrr and 1 cheshire bgs 2 capacity mobility firepower protection survivability and flexibility restricted 044 2 restricted the threat to wr 4 the operating environment insurgents may include military trained personnel and untrained civilians who are less let hal and arguably more unpredictable the insurgent will favour the environment that offers most protection be it urban or rural in either case insurgents will co nduct planned and opportunity attacks with little regard for collateral damage the motivation of insurgent s ranges from political and religious to financial with some groups offering bounties for engaging and killing security forces within this operating environment security forces wo rk within welldefined rules of engagement roe and theatre standard operating procedur sops which may require shooting incidents3 to be investigated 5 weapons and munitions the threat posed by insurgents is varied and unpredictable even the most primitive device c an prove lethal but the technical expertise and sophistication of insurgents should not be underestimated and complex combination devices which allow greater operator standoff are not uncommon however analysis of attacks on security forces can reveal trends that will shape the way wr is employed the following should be considered rpgs and small arms sa can be fired from multiple angles upwards downwards sideon headon and from t he rear and often simultaneously all round observation mutual support and dism ounting for close inprotection and deterrence must be considered whilst single rpg rounds may have lim ited effect against wr armour the enemys use of coordinated volley fire pos greater threat identifying the firing point and returning accurate fire must be done quickly and effectively often this will require dismounts to give target indication to the wr commander by radio or sa fire sa fire is of little concern to warri or although well directed heavy machine gun hmg poses greater threat ieds rciedcwiedvbied pose high threat as they are difficult to detect and can have significant blast and fragmentation effect commanders and drivers must balance the advantages of remaining openedup to achieve greater observation and situational aw areness against their increased vulnerability mines also pose threat as they too are difficult to detect insurgents have been known to hide mines in tyres potholes and other debris left on the road the wr surface clearance device s cd should be used when appropriate and in extremis chain gun can be used to disrupt mines but risks collateral damage drivers in particular should be briefed on the mine threat and scan accordingly wr crews and top cover tc sentries4 are susceptible to petrol bombs thrown at the turret however tc sentries equipped with federal riot guns frgs and commanders and drivers arm ed with pistols can deter petrol 3 op telic sops define shooting incident as an incident where shots have been fired by uk forces resulting in the death or injury of any person 4 the role of tc sentries is to provide 3600 observation and firepower for offensive and defensive purposes in support of the wr commander restricted 044 3 restricted bomb attacks considerations for the employment of tc sentries are covered in paragraph 2 8 one of the greatest threats to wr is combination of devices eg ieds to achieve mobility kill with an ambush fo llowup to mitigate this threat commanders must be fully aware of combat indicators see paragraph 7 and have well rehearsed drills to react to such attacks which must include casevac vehicle recovery and vehicle denial 6 techniques employed by insurgents against wr insurgents will use any number of increasingly sophisticated techni ques to attack wr planned or opportunity attack on wr patrol for example and the possi bility of disabling t he vehicle causing personnel casualties or capt uring the vehicle can achieve an effect well beyond the immediate tactical impact commanders should consider the following in the urban environment the insurgent will exploit alleys windows roofs disused buildings ruined st ructures and the use of preprepared positions rubble and vehicle hulks typical ranges of sa and rpg atta cks are 100 200 m but can be as little as 50 m insurgents may use civilians including children as human shields dickers5 and to move arms and ammunition their intent may be to hinder roe to obstruct engagement and put doubt in the mind of commanders and soldiers whilst some insurgents will simply tr and achieve hit on wr better trained individuals may specifically target v ehicle optics running gear the drivers compartment or commanders wr applique armour protects vulnerable areas but drivers and commanders must weigh the advantages and disadvantages of operating closeddown versus opened up the umbrella position for the driver is favoured as it achieves the optimum balance between protection and observation comm anders generally oper ate headup due to the limitation of wr vision blocks this afford s better all round observation and situational awareness streets overlooked by highrise buildi ngs provide insurgents with topattack shoots increasing the vulnerability of tc sentries choke points at the entry and exit to urban areas bridges intersections and narrow streets provide excellent engagement areas for the insurgent 7 combat indicators knowledge of combat indicato rs assist security forces recognise that an attack may be imminent can help mitigate the unpredictable nature of insurgents tactics and techniques and distingui sh the curious civilian from the insurgent with hostile intent troops must be constantly aware of the absence of the normal andor the presence of the abnormal in the envir onment around them these indicators may include some of the following heightened sense of antic ipation agitation or excitement amongst the civilian population absence of crowds at gathering plac eg markets outside municipal buildings 5 person who passes information to insurgents for the purpose of monitoring movement identifying patterns of activity or cueing an attack on security forces restricted 044 4 restricted absence of signs of normal life eg children playing in the streets absence of vehicles at normally busy times civilian population will oft warn of attacks in detail specifically citing the type of attack stones placed in regular places along road cars flashing headlights fo r the purpose of dicking the position of security forces and to dazzle drivers and commanders controllers on the streets sometimes identifiable by being better dressed and with mobile phones obstructions placed on roads to canalise movement patrolling 8 general patrolling principles6 and techniques described in section b to afm vol 1 pt 9 remain applicable and can be adapted to t he employment of wr however unlike saxon or snatch lr wr prov ides capability as wea pon system in conjunction with its ability to deliver infantry safely into and from hostile environment however commanders should remember that armour loses its value as an escalation measure very quickly if overused for routine taskings or deterrence operations in addition wr has the potential to damage civil infrastructure whic h can harm relations with local communities 9 patrol planning factors to be considered in patrol planning that are not necessarily peculiar to wr patrols but r equire greater consi deration include assessment of current threat levels to assist in determining the requirement for tc sentries use of operational analysi s to identify attack trends time of day locations type of attack oa staff are usually attached to the formation hq terrain analysis to identify suitable r outes choke points vulnerable points building type along routes and po ssible siting of barricades deception measures climatic conditions and what effect these may have on dismounts and drivers when closed down and the associated probl ems of restricted fields of view manoeuvre support to facilitate obstacle crossing identification of suit able lyingup positions lups and harbours reserves and their routes 10 patrol posture patrol posture will be function of the mission and the prevailing threat commanders must assess the risk to both vehicles and personnel in order to balance the advantages and disadvant ages of the options availabl the points listed below illustrate this armour can be used decisively against tactically naive enemy but still needs the protection of dismounts in close urban terrain7 6 mutual support deception all round defence communications and deception 7 during op telic 4 and the fighting to regain control of amarah the bde ops coy east of the river tigris in close terrain tended to destroy enemy most effectively with dismounts c coy 1 pwrr in more open streets to the west tended to ne utralise with turret systems restricted 044 5 restricted there are both advantages and disadvant ages of employing tc sentries tc sentries can act as deterrent to potential attackers provide 3600 surveillance and firepower but are vulnerable to blast fragmentation munitions petrol bombs as well as sa fire as enemy firing positions are extremely difficult to ident ify even with tc sentries deployed mutual support between vehicles is essentia l the decision to use tc sentries is command driven based on the prevailing thr eat and assessment of risk it is recommended that dismounts walk the vehicle through vps in builtup areas if commanders consider the threat too high vehi cles should be driven through vps at speed in rural areas wrs longer and wider fields of viewfire are better able to neutralise the threat without having to deploy dismounts speed may reduce the chance of being hit by rpg offroute mines and ieds though considered advance allows commanders and gunners to scan the ground carefully and use weapon sights gunners must traverse the turret in order to scan for potential targets but the civilian population can perceive this as provocative in these circumstances commanders should assess the risk to going headup 11 patrol techniques wr should normally patrol in pairs and multiples utilising their speed protection firepower and mobility to augment the overall patrol plan and create uncertainty in the mind of the insurgent patro lling in wr will be more restricted than foot or lr borne patrols as far as routing is c oncerned although when multiples are employed more than one route can be used 12 patrol equipment the nature of the patrol task will ve direct bearing on what extra equipment needs to be carri ed unit sois should inclu stowage lists however it is recommended that vehicles should carry the following as minimum first line ammunition scales selected ces equipment but mu st include recovery equipment firefighting equipment first aid equipment rations and water vcp equipment for both day and night 13 postpatrol activity patrol reports are essential in order to inform commanders critical information requirements ccirs and record events and observations in order to establish the modus operandi mo of insurgents learning ccounts should be initiated in accordance with landso 3207 when appropriate of particular importance to wr patrols is the requirement to report strikes on vehicle armour in order to initiate weapon intelligence section wis report it is essential that the wis inspect the strike as soon as practicably possible and gather as much evidenc to assist analysis of the munition and weapon system and its effect restricted 044 6 restricted deliberate offensive operations 14 the types of deliberate operations that wr subunit or battlegroup may undertake could include find fix strike defeat seize deter extrac t and interdict missions these will usually be part of larger combined arms operation that might so include airborne surveillance and strike 15 company level operation would usually be commanded by the oc from his tac hq operating with another wr as protecti on the company second in command 2ic should control and coordinate the operation fr om the operations cell however it is important that there are r ehearsed alternative command arr angements which in the first instance are likely to be one of the plat oon commanders assuming command until the 2ic can deploy 16 wr company may be tasked with providing cordon in support of deliberate search or arrest operation in some cases civilian agencies will l ead with military forces establishing the cordon once the cordon forc is in place wr can be held in bravo muster provide overwatch establish fi re support base or deploy

be used in the surveillance role any other available aircraft that is in the vicinity restricted 044 7 restricted movement control measures ro ad blocks and check points 18 the use of road blocks and vehicle check points vcps play an important role in interdicting insurgent activity as well as co mplementing other security measures in coin operations again secti on b to afm vol 1 pt 98 covers the general techniques and procedures for establishing and conducting road blocks and check points further considerations for this type of operation include using wr as roadblock to prevent vbied deploying wr to establish snap vcp away from the suspected target using wr as chicane to slow traffic using dismounts to provide local security at vcp turret crews to man vehicle weapon syst ems as well as achieve elevation for observation 5 and 20 m checks are equally applicable to vcp tablished with wr as any other type the vcp should be established with ecm deployed the controller and search team should operate using cover provided by the vehicle see fig 1 as with all vcps when the task is fi nished the route to the check point should be checked 19 fig 1 illustrates how vcp might be c onfigured on dual carriageway the same principles would apply on single carriageway ie using the wr to form chicane to provide cover to the controlle r and search team use of dismounts for close protection and cutoffs forward of the check point to deter icide bombers and to assist in traffic control fig 1 example layout of vcp using wr public order operations 20 wr can be used as part of graduated re sponse in public order po situations while it might be inappropriate to use wr to deal with peaceful demonstration or minor disturbances wr can be used very effectivel to breakup large

commanders must assess the crowd dynamics and t he environment in order to decide their course of action 21 tactics and techniques have been develop ed to utilise wr on po operations and suggested method is described in detail at annex 22 considerations for wr crew s conducting po operations include protecting the engine decks from petrol bombs provision of dedicated fire exting uishers for driver and turret crews actions on an rpg or similar weapon bei ng fired from within the crowd stowage of po kit inside wr with dismounts which can be tight personal kit to be stowed on the inside of the vehicle robust method of communicating between vehicles and dismounts is required as prr may be drow ned out by the noise of the crowd petrol bombs etc see paragraph 2 7 use of frg by turret cr ews as permitted by roe use of warning shots must consider safety aspects of where the round will land warning shot must not become lethal shot risk of crushing demonstr ators when manoeuvering protection of convoys and the provision of escorts 23 wr can be used in conjunction with cv rt aviation and b v ehicles to provide protection to convoys this is likely to be routine activity when the threat state is high convoys may comprise military or civilian vehicles or combi nation convoys will range in size from only small number of vehicles to up to 25 vehicles extending to 1 km in length it would be normal for minimum of 2 protection ve hicles to escort every 8 convoy vehicles inevitably command and control of large convoys and the accompanying escort can be problematic as with any other operation detailed planning and rehearsals attended by all the relevant agencies if time allows must be conducted 24 in providing protection to convoys wr has the flexibility to be uti lised in the following roles provide close protection picket the route strike group in response to an attack stand off and react to an incident on orders mobile reserve surveillance and searc h and arrest

introduction of bgti will give wr better surveillance capability restricted 044 9 restricted 26 search operations wrs tasks in support of search and arrest operations could include delivering the cordon dominating the ground assisting in the extraction of the detainees andor the find extracting the cordon provision of qrf nonspecific wr ttps 27 dismounting and mounting drills both vehicle and di smounts are extremely vulnerable at the mom ent of dismounting so ex ecution must be rapid10 there is hard and fast rule as to which side of wr to debu ss in coin operations having dismounted the critical factor is to establish and maintain communica tions between the dismounts and the turret crew in order to s end target information communi cations between dismounts and vehicles is currently difficult due to incompatibility between prr and cnr additionally interference from civilian radio users eg ta xis can disrupt communications therefore linkmen hand signals and voice must be used but this means that wr commanders must remain eyesup 28 topcover tc tc should be used intelligent ly commanders must balance the risk to tc sentries with the enhanced protection and surveillance they provide tc is most effective at deterring shortr ange attacks at low speeds eg gr enades petrol bombs short range cwieds and rcieds rpgs and close quarter shoots the deployment of tc sentries should be based on the commanders assessment of the th reat the environment and the options for dismounting key points to note are be alert to overhead wires wire cutters should be mounted on vehicles think deception unpredictable jack in t he box techniques are often the best way to deter the threat while minimising risk do not leave tc up unless there is need for it if the insurgent sees that tc is routine he will target it tc has little effect when moving at speed tc should never be up when enter ing or leaving sf bases coordinate tc with white light at night consider us ing spotlights to overcome cws or nvg whiteout consider the dangers of traversi ng the turret when using tc lubricate hatches so that they can be opened and closed quickly and silently practi the options for having either one or both hatches open consider having mix of weapons ava ilable to tc sentries including sa80 lsw minimi ugl frg 29 movement drills wrs size and speed influences movement drills and the following should be considered though noting that some def ensive measures may have negative community relations effect 10 the safety measures and drills described in infantry tactical doctrine volume

with the rear vehicle avoid stopping in front of side str eets to minimise the ramming and shooting threat do not get boxed in drivers should constantly consider escape routes leave enough space between vehicles in front to see tarmac and tyres wr will draw fire when static commanders must consider deploying dismounts even if static for short time do not forget 5 and 20 m checks consider using dismounts to prevent civilian vehicles pulling in between vehicles when static avoid setting patterns 30 stowage wr is designed to carry sufficient combat supplies and equipment to enable the section to operate for 48 hours without replenishment however in coin operations additional items such as po equipment may need to be carried increasing the overall stowed load individual units should detail stowage pl ans within sois to achieve commonality between companies poin ts for consideration are reducing ces to essential equipm ent but must include recovery kit availability of foam fire extinguishers to fight fires caused by petrol bombs and armour penetration bcf extinguishers can be used but be aware of the inhalation hazard stowage of magazines and grenades within the turret for

content the requirement to carry additional medics interpreters and media both routinely and for specific operations combat service support 31 casevac although wr offers considerable protection to crews and dismounts casualties may still occur the immediat response to any type of attack should be suppression of the immediate threat by v ehicle weapons and dismounts having achieved this and initiated first aid consideration can be given to evacuating casualties drills must be rehearsed for the extraction of personnel from any position in the vehicle the extraction of an injured driver requires particular consi deration whilst evacuation rearwards through the drivers tunnel and out th rough the backdoor is recommen ded it is accepted that sometimes this is impossible to achieve and the driver must be extracted through his hatch additional points for c onsideration include 11 an imminent wr armour uor will prevent use of most external stowage bins restricted 044 11 restricted extraction of crewmen should be c onducted under the pr otection of other vehicles fig 2 illustrates how this might be achieved however commanders must be prepared to exercise tactical judgment and balance the risk of concentrating wr in an actual or potential killing zone with the need for timely casevac all crew members should be familiarized with the drivers controls and be able to move the vehicle in an emergency having conducted the extr action the casualty shoul d be moved under armour to prearranged axphls outside the contact zone the availability of armoured vehicles for this purpose must be considered in the planning of both routine and specific operations heat injury can be major conc ern in wr when battened down and conducting combat operations drivers are at particular risk due to the additional heat generat ed by the engine sufficient water should be carried for each man fig 2 extraction of casualty from the rear and front 32 vehicle recovery broken down or battle
