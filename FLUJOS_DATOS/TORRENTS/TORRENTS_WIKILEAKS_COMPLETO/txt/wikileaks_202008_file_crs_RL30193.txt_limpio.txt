between the president and congress so that both share in the making of foreign policy the executive and legislative branches each play important roles that are different but that often overlap both branches have continuing opportunities to initiate and change foreign policy and the interaction between them continues indefinitely throughout the life of policy this report identifies and illustrates 12 basic ways to make us foreign policy the president or the executive branch can make foreign policy through 1 responses to foreign events 2 proposals for legislation 3 negotiation of international agreements 4 policy statements 5 policy implementation 6 independent action in nearly all of these circumstances congress can either support the presidents approach or seek to change it in the case of independent presidential action it may be very difficult to change policy in the short term in the case of legislative proposal by the executive branch or treaties and international agreements submitted to the senate or congress for approval congress has decisive voice in most cases congress supports the president but it often makes significant modifications in his initiatives in the process of approving them congress can make foreign policy through 1 resolutions and policy statements 2 legislative directives 3 legislative pressure 4 legislative restrictionsfunding denials 5 informal advice 6 congressional oversight in these circumstances the executive branch can either support or seek to change congressional policies as it interprets and carries out legislative directives and restrictions and decides when and whether to adopt proposals and advice the practices illustrated in this report indicate that making us foreign policy is complex process and the

president and congress 23 excerpts from the constitution 23 foreign policy roles of the president and congress introduction the constitution divides the foreign policy powers between the president and congress but not in definitive manner1 edward s corwin wrote what the constitution does and all that it does is to confer on the president certain powers capable of affecting our foreign relations and certain other powers of the same general kind on the senate and still other such powers on congress but which of these organs shall have the decisive and final voice in determining the course of the american nation is left for events to resolve2 events have confirmed that together the president and congress make foreign policy but they have not resolved the question of which branch originates or finally determines policy the two branches share in the process and each plays an important but different role the question of who makes foreign policy does not have more precise answer for several reasons first us foreign policy is not created in vacuum as some sort of indivisible whole with single grand design rather making foreign policy is prolonged process involving many actors and comprising dozens of individual policies toward different countries regions and functional problems second the complex process of determining foreign policy makes it difficult to decide who should be credited with initiating or altering any particular foreign policy the two branches constantly interact and influence each other under these circumstances it is difficult to trace an idea back to its origin determine when proposal actually influences policy and decide when modification creates new policy3 third the roles and relative influence of the two branches in making foreign policy differ from time to time according to such factors as the personalities of the president and members of congress and the degree of consensus on policy throughout american history there have been ebbs and flows of presidential and 1 see appendix for excerpts from the us constitution relating to foreign policy powers 2 corwin edward s the president office and powers 17871957 new york new york university press 1957 p 171 emphasis in original 3 baldwin david congressional initiative in foreign policy the journal of politics november 1966 p 754773 crs2 congressional dominance in making foreign policy variously defined by different scholars one study classified the period 17891829 as one of presidential initiative 18291898 as one of congressional supremacy and 1899 through the immediate post world war ii period as one of growing presidential power4 another study defined three periods of congressional dominance 18371861 18691897 and 19181936 with fourth one beginning toward the end of the vietnam war in 19735 during the reagan and bush administrations the pendulum swung back toward presidential dominance reaching its height in 1991 during operation desert storm against iraq6 in the postpersian gulf war era both president and the congress are confronted with issues in foreign policy that may well define which branch of government will play the dominant role during the first decade of the twentyfirst century for many years perception existed that the executive branch usually initiated foreign policy with the implication that this relegated congress to an inconsequential role writing in 1950 robert dahl wrote perhaps the single most important fact about congress and its role in foreign policy therefore is that it rarely provides the initiative most often initiative springs from the executiveadministrative branch7 in 1962 james robinson studied 22 case studies of foreign policies over the previous 30 years and found three cases of congressional initiative the 1943 repeal of the chinese exclusion laws the 1943 fulbright resolution calling for postwar participation in an international organization and the 1958 monroney resolution proposing the international development association8 francis wilcox who was staff director of the senate foreign relations committee from 19471955 and assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs from 19551961 has argued however that some of the most imaginative and constructive foreign policies since world war ii have originated in congress9 in the period after the vietnam war congress reasserted its role in foreign policy it on occasion initiated new policies and exerted decisive influence on policies initiated by the executive branch one study on the subject concluded that the fact remains that the president is still in charge of american foreign policy but it noted also that the american congress has more power to influence foreign affairs than its counterpart in any other country10 another study concluded for all the problems 4 cheever daniel s and h field haviland jr american foreign policy and the separation of powers cambridge harvard university press 1952 244 p 5 franck

involved more directly in foreign policy the system is working much more the way the founding fathers devised it than we have seen in some time11 this report identifies and illustrates 12 major ways to make us foreign policy six utilized by the president or the executive branch and six utilized by the congress attempt has been made to measure how often the various practices are used however the findings of the report are consistent with corwins classic statement that actual practice under the constitution has shown that while the president is usually in position to propose the senate and the congress are often in technical position at least to dispose the verdict of history in short is that the power to determine the substantive content of american foreign policy is divided power with the lions share falling usually though by means always to the president12 this report does not attempt to define how policy is made within branch as this is complex and varied process and would require detailed study of each case several case studies of this type are indicated in footnotes and illustrations mentioned in the report highlight some of the many individuals and groups within each branch who contribute to policy formation13 similarly the report does not examine the influence of groups outside the executive and legislative branches but the illustrations show that such groups including the judiciary interest groups the press and the public at large can sometimes play an important role 10 continued foreign policy washington congressional quarterly press 1980 p 3 11 ornstein norman

congressional research service and published by the house foreign affairs committee annually from 1974 to 1992 these committee prints are subsequently cited as congress and foreign policy together with their pertinent year of coverage crs4 the president as initiator following are six basic ways the president or executive branch can originate or initially shape foreign policy in these circumstances congress is put in the position of either responding positively to the presidents initiative or seeking to adjust or reverse the impact of his position response to foreign events current events in foreign countries or sudden action by foreign government often challenge us interests as spokesman and head of the foreign service the armed forces the intelligence services and the bureaucracy the president usually responds to such events and thus initiates us policy congress ordinarily supports the president but on occasion seeks change in policy for example congress supported president reagan in the falkland islands crisis between argentina and the united kingdom after argentina in april 1982 seized and occupied the falkland islands which the united kingdom claimed as crown colony the us executive branch sought to mediate the dispute when argentina refused one of the us peace overtures secretary of state alexander haig announced that the united states would prohibit arms sales to argentina and provide material support for british operations both houses of congress passed resolutions supporting the us action siding with the united kingdom14 the crisis ended in june 1982 and in december 1983 the department of state lifted the ban on arms sales to argentina congress helped bring about change in administrationinitiated policy in response to events in lebanon15 in september 1983 congress reached compromise with the reagan administration and agreed to authorize participation in the multinational force in lebanon for 18 months16 after terrorist bombing attack in beirut on october 23 1983 that killed more than 200 marines president reagan first took the position that the united states had vital national interests in lebanon and would continue to participate in the multinational force prominent members of congress questioned the policy and some proposed an amendment to cut off funds for participation while the amendment was defeated criticism of the policy continued the subcommittee on investigations of the house armed services committee and department of defense commission headed by retired admiral robert long both filed reports in december 1983 that questioned the us ability to achieve its objectives by the use of the marines public opinion polls also indicated that majority of americans thought the marines should be withdrawn on february 7 1984 president reagan announced that the marines would be redeployed to ships 14 us congress house congress and foreign policy 1982 p 10 15 for further discussions see preece

16 multinational force in lebanon resolution pl 98119 signed october 12 1983 crs5 off the coast of lebanon and in march he reported that us participation in the multinational force had ended on august 2 1990 president bush responded to the iraqi invasion of kuwait the previous day by immediately applying full economic sanctions against iraq and within week deploying us armed forces to help defend saudi arabia against potential attack in october congress supported continued action through the united nations and enacted the economic sanctions into law in january 1991 congress authorized the use of the us armed forces to implement security council resolutions17 president bill clinton authorized us actions in support of and nato operations aimed at halting the fighting in the former territory of yugoslavia particularly in bosnia under president clinton the united states participated in airlifts into sarajevo bosnia naval monitoring of sanctions aerial enforcement of nofly zone and aerial enforcement of safe havens in december 1995 president clinton authorized the deployment of over 20000 american combat troops to bosnia as part of natoled peacekeeping force to help enforce the dayton peace accords aimed at resolving the bosnian conflict subsequently in december 1996 president clinton agreed to provide up to 8500 american ground troops to participate in natoled followon force in bosnia termed the stabilization force sfor these actions were taken by the president in the absence of express congressional approval and despite continuing disputes between the congress and the president over the proper course of action for the us in the bosnian conflict18 following the seizure of haitis government by haitian military leader raul cedras in july 1993 from its president jeanbertrand aristide the united nations took number of steps to support the restoration of aristide to power including an embargo and in july 1994 authorizing multinational force to facilitate the departure of the military leadership in haiti in mid september 1994 president clinton sent us negotiating team to haiti to urge the peaceful departure of the military junta while ordering the us military to prepare for an invasion of haiti if necessary to restore president aristide the military junta agreed to leave haiti peacefully in the face of an imminent us invasion subsequently the us sent approximately 21000 military forces to haiti to disarm haitian military and paramilitary forces and to aid peacekeeping operation in restoring civil government and order in haiti president clinton undertook the haiti operation without the prior approval of congress and was criticized for this congress subsequently passed sj res 229 in october 1994 signed as pl 103423 which stated the

withdrawal as soon as possible19 administration proposal for legislation on occasion the executive branch wants to begin foreign policy program that requires legislation or appropriations and accordingly proposes legislation to congress congressional approval in this situation is essential congress may play more or less active role in the development of the legislation modifying the administration bill or developing entirely new legislation of its own the classic example of policy proposed by the administration but subsequently developed by both branches working together cooperatively is the marshall plan20 on june 5 1947 secretary of state george marshall proposed us assistance for european recovery on condition that the european nations initiate and agree on plans for an aid program the western european governments responded with proposal for program based on 4 years of us assistance to allow sufficient time for consideration president truman requested an interim aid program that was passed by congress in december 1947 he then submitted to congress the proposal for the longer term european recovery program congress created select committee on foreign aid that made an independent study of the needs in europe the senate foreign relations and house foreign affairs committees also held extensive hearings and the legislation that emerged was widely considered to be the product of bipartisan joint effort of both branches since then presidents have annually proposed foreign assistance programs that congress has authorized or appropriated after modifying as it saw fit often using the legislation as vehicle for initiatives of its own in 1978 for example congress required new emphasis in both bilateral and multilateral aid for programs designed to meet basic human needs and also launched women in development program to promote attention to women in the economic development process21 after democratic reforms occurred in poland and hungary during 1989 president bush proposed an aid package and trade benefits for the two countries as the year continued and all of eastern europe was transformed by the replacement of communist governments with democratic reforms congress enlarged the package and urged more active us support for the growing democratic movements22 19 see taftmorales maureen haiti under president preval issues

increase in united states assistance to russia following summit at vancouver canada with russian prime minister boris yeltsin the 16 billion us assistance package using existing appropriated funds included more concessional terms for agricultural loans and an increase in assistance targeted at privatization further funding was targeted at resettling russian officers and providing employment training to assist their return to civilian life while facilitating their withdrawal from the baltics the president stated that 75 of the assistance would be used outside of moscow to make it more highly visible to the average russian citizen than earlier us aid programs all such assistance efforts were aimed at advancing democratization in russia23 negotiation of international agreements the power of negotiation gives the executive branch dominant role in making foreign policy through international agreements but the president must take into account congressional opinion because often agreements must be approved by the senate or congress congress also influences agreements by placing in legislation instructions and views concerning international agreements indicating through various means what kind of agreement would be acceptable and attaching reservations or other conditions when approving an agreement few international agreements might be called sole executive agreements because the president considers that he has the authority to conclude them under his own powers and does not submit them to the senate as treaties nor to congress for approval24 examples are the yalta agreement of 1945 the vietnam peace agreement of 1973 the iranian hostage agreement of 1981 and the afghanistan settlement agreement of april 14 1988 most international agreements however have some form of congressional participation the senate must approve treaties by twothirds majority the bulk of executive agreements are either authorized by congress prior to their conclusion or approved after their conclusion and might be called congressionalexecutive agreements as an example of prior action congress has authorized the executive branch to conclude agreements on military and economic assistance space and nuclear energy cooperation and foreign trade and has set forth goals guidelines and criteria in the authorizing legislation as an example of action after conclusion congress approved the salt i interim agreement of 1972 by joint resolution with the jackson amendment which requested that the president seek future treaty that would not limit the united states to levels of strategic forces inferior to soviet levels 23 for further discussion see tarnoff curt us assistance to the soviet union and its successor states 19911996 history of administration

such as the north american free trade agreement nafta and agreements negotiated under the auspices of the general agreement on trade and tariffs gatt congress has authorized negotiations in advance but required that it approve the agreement prior to its implementation25 the implementing legislation for both the nafta and the gatt uruguay round agreements was considered under socalled fasttrack procedures in 1993 and 1994 respectively this process had been developed during the nixon and ford administrations to protect presidents ability to negotiate trade agreements with some confidence that they would not be undermined later by congress through the traditional rules applied to legislation under fasttrack rules congress was given 90 days to take action on the implementing bill after its formal introduction congress could not amend the bill each congressional committee of jurisdiction was given 45 days to review the proposed legislation the proposed bill was then only subject to yes or vote in the house and the senate since congress could not amend the final legislation practice developed over the years whereby informal committee markup sessions were held on the draft implementing bills to indicate to the president key areas of congressional concern regarding the specific trade legislation this process afforded the president the opportunity to address these concerns as he deemed appropriate prior to submitting final bill to implement the trade agreement the debates over the nafta and the gatt uruguay round agreements were very contentious following passage of the implementing vehicle for the latter in lame duck session of congress in late 1994 the presidents authority to use fasttrack procedures lapsed subsequent effort by the clinton administration to secure renewal of this authority was dropped in late 1997 due to insufficient bipartisan support for granting it in the fall of 1998 bill to restore fasttrack authority failed to pass the house of representatives26 legislativeexecutive branch interchange has been especially complex in the treaties relating to strategic arms reductions in preparation for the strategic arms reduction treaty start the senate and house formed observer groups to monitor the negotiations after the start treaty was submitted to the senate on november 25 1991 the soviet union ceased to exist and senators worked with the administration in deciding how to handle the new situation new protocol amending the treaty was negotiated in lisbon with the soviet successor states the senate approved the start treaty on october 1 1992 with several conditions including that belarus kazakhstan russia and ukraine be legally bound to all the obligations of the soviet union in the treaty 25 sek lenore

statements issued with other governments sometimes unilateral statements are broad descriptions of american goals and objectives in an address to the united nations on september 21 1992 president bush called for strengthening the peacekeeping capabilities of the united nations other times the president articulates policy on specific issue in the state of the union address of january 28 1992 president bush proposed that the united states and russia eliminate all their land based multiple warhead ballistic missiles on april 5 1991 president bush announced the united states would join international efforts to airdrop relief supplies to kurdish refugees along the iraqiturkish border in january 1994 the clinton administration proposed the expansion of the alliance at the nato summit with congressional support over the next four years number of gradual steps were taken leading to the senate giving its consent to the amendment of the north atlantic treaty on april 30 1998 by vote of 8019 permitting the admission of poland the czech republic and hungary to the alliance27 joint statementspolicy statements made with other countriesare not legally binding international agreements but they commit the president to course of action at the conclusion of the summit conference in tokyo on may 5 1986 for example leaders of seven nations including the united states issued joint statement pledging to fight terrorism through specified economic and diplomatic actions at the conclusion of the economic summit of the group of seven on july 8 1992 the leaders issued communique embodying wide range of policies including support for the strategy of cooperation between the russian government and the international monetary fund congress may support the policy enunciated by the president attempt to change it or find way to participate in the further development of the policy after the conference on security and cooperation in europe in helsinki on august 1 1975 president ford and 34 other heads of state signed the final act of the conference that provided for the freer flow of people and information between east and west europe congress by legislation established commission on security and cooperation in europe to monitor the implementation of the accords28 since that time the commission 12 of whose 15 members are members of congress has closely monitored the accords and played an active role in development of us policy in this area the executive branch makes policy statement when it casts the us vote in international organizations most measures adopted by international organizations such as united nations general assembly resolutions are not legally binding but they put the united states on record as for or against proposed course of action the executive branch also determines the us position on resolutions of the united 27 katzman kenneth war and peace in the middle east congress and foreign policy 1991 p 2153 gallis paul nato congress

for nations to use all necessary means to uphold earlier resolutions aimed at getting iraq to withdraw from kuwait congress sometimes influences the us vote in international organizations it has on several occasions directed us representatives in international financial institutions to vote in specified manner for example in 1992 congress provided that the secretary of the treasury should direct the us executive director of the interamerican development bank to vote against funding for any project of the multilateral investment fund if the project was likely to cause loss of jobs in the united states members of congress also serve on interparliamentary groups such as the north atlantic assembly and the parliamentary assembly of the organization on security and cooperation in europe where their views may affect the perspectives and votes of members from other participating nations29 whenever implementation of the measures promised by the executive in unilateral or joint statements requires legislation or appropriations congress has more power in deciding whether to support or modify us policy when the administration pledges funds to the multilateral development banks for example the funds must be authorized and appropriated by congress the united states could not increase its quota in the international monetary fund for assistance to russia in 1992 until congress appropriated the necessary funds30 policy implementation even when congress establishes foreign policy through legislation the administration continues to shape policy as it interprets and applies the various provisions of law this is illustrated in arms sales policy congress has established the objectives and criteria for arms sales to foreign countries in the arms export control act and it has required advance notification of major arms sales and provided procedures for halting sale it disapproves but the executive branch makes the daily decisions on whether or not to sell arms to specific countries and what weapons systems to provide as an example on september 14 1992 president bush notified congress of his intention to sell 72 f15 fighter aircraft to saudi arabia and after the 30day congressional review period expired the sale proceeded congress has found it necessary to maintain close supervision to prevent sales particularly to middle eastern countries that it did not approve in some cases its actions had the effect of halting sales and it has frequently brought about changes in proposed arms sales packages31 in 1985 congress passed joint resolution pl 99 162 prohibiting proposed sale of certain advanced aircraft and air defense systems 29 foreign operations appropriations act title i pl 102391 signed oct 5 1992 30 pl 102391 signed oct 6 1992 31 for further

congressional review process by grimmett richard f crs report for congress 96971f 6p crs11 to jordan prior to march 1 1986 unless direct and meaningful peace negotiations between israel and jordan were underway after the date passed the administration did not propose the sale apparently in the belief it would be disapproved by congress in 1986 both houses passed joint resolution disapproving sale of advanced missiles to saudi arabia and the president vetoed the resolution the senate sustained the veto by 6634 vote but only after the administration removed stinger hand held missiles from the package since the 1980s various administrations have used their authority to establish regulatory guidelines for the export of usorigin dualuse technologies in the case of exports to china since the 1989 tiananmen square crackdown us law has required that china cannot obtain commercial satellites or related technology from the united states unless the president issues waiver of this restriction on casebycase basis on the grounds that such transaction is in the us national interest or because china has made reforms in its human rights or political practices in march of 1996 president clinton transferred authority for issuing export licenses from the state department to the commerce department subsequently when it was discovered that two us companies had shared technical information regarding the cause of an explosion of chinese rocket launching us commercial satellite without having secured license to do so from the state department justice department investigation was launched in the wake of the controversy over this transfer of technical information regarding satellites to china and charges that insufficient scrutiny was being given to security issues involved in such prospective transfers congress by an amendment to the fy1999 national defense authorization act pl 105261 transferred authority to license commercial satellite and related data exports from the commerce department back to the state department effective in march 1999 independent action occasionally the president undertakes dramatic or sudden foreign policy action before congress is fully informed about it congress then is faced with the dilemma of supporting the action or being charged with undercutting the president before the world congress usually supports the president but on occasion it tries to halt or reverse the policy or pass legislation to restrain the president from similar actions in the future when president reagan launched military invasion of grenada on october 24 1983 congress essentially supported the president in his stated effort to prevent the formation of communist foothold there although both houses of congress passed separate measures that would invoke the war powers resolution neither measure was passed by both houses32 congressional leaders apparently received assurances 32 the war powers resolution pl 93148 was passed over the veto of president nixon in november 1973 to assure that both the president and congress participate in decisions that might involve the united states in war it requires the president to consult with congress in every possible instance prior to the introduction of armed forces into hostilities or situations of imminent hostilities and establishes time limit of 6090 days for us forces to remain continued crs12 from the white house that the troops would be out within 60 days and public opinion strongly supported the action congress also supported the presidents action by approving 15 million for grant economic assistance programs to grenada similarly when president reagan ordered the bombing of libya on april 15 1986 to counter statesupported terrorism and when president bush ordered the invasion of panama on december 20 1989 to apprehend general manuel noriega most members supported the presidents effort widespread public support greeted the presidents action and was also factor in determining the congressional response in another instance president clinton addressed financial crisis in mexico after devaluation of the peso in late december 1994 in an effort to prevent mexican default on billions of dollars worth of debt obligations in early 1995 the presidents economic advisors crafted package of support for mexico that did not require congressional vote on the controversial proposal this action was taken when it appeared possible that congress would not enact the administrations legislation to deal with the crisis the independent initiative by president clinton included 20 billion in credits from the exchange stabilization fund esf of the treasury department which is normally used to stabilize the us dollars value 10 billion in credits from the bank for international settlements and 178 billion from the international monetary fund imf the clinton administrations independent intervention in the mexican peso crisis led to significant criticism in congress but efforts to modify or block it were either defeated or abandoned33 occasionally however congress significantly refines or alters policy independently undertaken by the president this was the case in the 1979 policy change toward the peoples republic of china and taiwan on december 15 1978 president carter announced suddenly that the united states would establish diplomatic relations with the peoples republic of china on january 1 1979 and terminate the defense treaty with the republic of china on taiwan after the one years notice required by the treaty the administration also submitted legislation to govern future relations with taiwan while few members of congress opposed the establishment of relations with china move anticipated since president nixons trip to china in 1972 many members sought to modify the practical implications of the new policy and reassure allies in the pacific congress added sections to the taiwan relations act to affirm that the united states would consider any nonpeaceful effort against taiwan as threat to the western pacific and would provide taiwan with defensive arms to maintain sufficient selfdefense capability congress also made modifications in the 32 continued in such situations without congressional authorization 33 for background see storrs k larry mexicous relations issues for congress issue brief 97028 and clinton leads mexico bailout effort congressional quarterly almanac 1995 pp 1016 and 1017 crs13 legislation aimed at continuing economic ties and placing taiwanus relations on firmer legal basis34 senator barry goldwater and other members of congress filed suit against the president for terminating the security treaty with the republic of china without the approval of twothirds of the senate or majority of both houses of congress senator goldwater also introduced legislation to bar the president from terminating other defense treaties without congressional participation while neither effort was successful they illustrated that in undertaking independent action the president risks punitive action by congress that may reduce future flexibility in foreign policy actions the congress as initiator following are six basic ways in which congress can originate or shape foreign policy in these circumstances the executive branch is put in the position of responding positively to the congressional initiative or seeking to adjust or reverse its impact on the course of foreign policy resolutions and policy statements every year members of congress introduce large numbers of simple or concurrent resolutions stating the sense of the house senate or congress on foreign policy and many such resolutions are adopted many observers are skeptical about the effectiveness of these sense of the house senate or congress resolutions like presidential policy statements they express the policy of single branch of government but their effect is often weaker because congress does not execute policy since simple and concurrent resolutions are not legally binding the executive branch often ignores them in carrying out foreign policy nevertheless sometimes such resolutions play significant role in foreign policy by launching new idea or promoting new policy s res 264 introduced by senator s mike monroney and adopted july 23 1958 led to the establishment of the international development association as an affiliate of the world bank designed to make lowinterest longterm loans in 1973 the senate adopted s res 71 introduced by senator claiborne pell calling for an international agreement prohibiting environmental or geophysical modification activity as weapon of war such an agreement was subsequently negotiated and ratified by the united states in 1979 in 1979 the house passed h res 321 urging the united nations to convene an emergency session of the general assembly to deal with the refugee crisis in southeast asia this added to other calls for such conference and subsequently united nations conference was convened in july 1979 hcon res 248 adopted september 17 1990 called for higher priority for environmental concerns and urged increased attention to the linkage between the environment and national security 34 for further discussion see sutter robert congress and us policy in asia new relationships with china and taiwan in congress

occasionally given impetus to policy even though the resolution itself did not pass in 1967 senator pell introduced s res 172 relating to international regulation of ocean activities the administration opposed the resolution and it was not adopted but later the concept came to fruition in the seabed arms control treaty of 1971 simple and concurrent resolutions also serve as channel of communication between congress and foreign countries while often the communications to foreign governments are formal messages of sympathy congratulations and appreciation at other times they are more substantive h res 484 of august 8 1988 called on president zia of pakistan consistent with his pledge of may 29 1988 to hold free and fair elections not later than november 16 1988 h res 136 of may 24 1989 called on the chinese government to resolve the political crisis in china without violence congress annually passed resolutions calling for baltic freedom and commemorating captive nations week from 1959 until independence was achieved by lithuania latvia and estonia in 1991 sense of the congress resolutions also provide vehicle for support or advice to the president on foreign policy after the us military intervention in the dominican republic in 1965 for example the house passed h res 560 supporting the president in any action he deemed necessary to prevent communist subversive aggression in the western hemisphere35 on may 5 1986 the house adopted h res 424 supporting the presidents policy in libya by expressing gratitude to the united kingdom for allowing us bombers stationed there to participate in the april 14 1986 raid aimed at terrorist bases in libya congressional concerns over united states involvement in the developing internal conflicts in former

stated the sense of congress that dod funds should not be made available for the purpose of deploying us armed forces to participate in implementation of peace settlement in bosnia unless previously authorized by congress on march 11 1999 the house passed hcon res 42 by vote of 219191 expressing the sense of congress that the president was authorized to deploy us troops to kosovo as part of nato peacekeeping operation subject to conditions and various reporting requirements on march 23 1999 the senate by vote of 5841 passed s res 21 expressing the sense of the congress that the president was authorized to conduct military air operations and missile strikes in cooperation with our nato allies against the federal republic of yugoslavia serbia and montenegro this senate concurrent resolution was passed in reaction to the serbian military actions in kosovo and president clintons request on march 23 1999 for legislative support of his actions to deal with the kosovo crisis subsequently on

skepticism of current administration policy toward resolving the kosovo conflict36 legislative directives congress sometimes initiates foreign policy by using legislation to establish new program set objectives and guidelines authorize and direct the executive branch to undertake specified activities and by earmarking appropriations to be used in specified way the executive branch influences this kind of policy initiative because members regularly seek administration views in the process of formulating legislation the president must approve legislation unless it is passed over presidential veto and the executive branch implements the legislation as examples in 1991 congress took the lead in using defense funds to provide assistance to the former soviet union authorizing and appropriating funds to dismantle soviet nuclear weapons and provide military transportation for humanitarian assistance37 in 1992 congress placed new sanctions and controls against iran iraq and nations or persons who assisted them in acquiring weapons of mass destruction38 in 1997 and 1998 congress was principally responsible for advancing legislation aimed at elevating the importance of combating religious persecution worldwide among us foreign policy objectives on october 27 1998 the international religious freedom act was signed into law hr 2431 pl 105292 this act established within the state department an office of international religious freedom headed by an ambassador at large subject to confirmation by the senate this ambassador is charged with among other things recommending appropriate us government responses where the right to religious freedom abroad is violated including preparing an annual report on country practices regarding religious freedoms this law specifies sanctions against countries if they are determined to have engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom39 36 for background see kim julie and steven j woehrel

sometimes congress pressures the executive branch into new direction in foreign policy by threatening to pass legislation even though the legislation is not enacted or by continuing to exhort policy through many means an example is the congressional effort in the 1980s to pass legislation imposing economic and other sanctions against south africa the effort was widely seen to have prodded the reagan administration to establish limited economic sanctions dissatisfied with the administrations policy of constructive engagement and quiet diplomacy to bring an end to apartheid in south africa the house in 1983 approved legislation applying sanctions against south africa as part of an extension of the export administration act but the bill was rejected by the senate toward the end of 1984 american civil rights leaders began daily protests at the south african embassy in washington to focus greater attention on racial violence in south africa and the repressive policies of the white minority government in south africa in june 1985 the house passed hr 1460 imposing sanctions and threatening future cutoff of us investment the senate followed with s 995 providing military sanctions the conference report called for compromise that included ban on us import of south african krugerrands before the senate voted on the final bill on september 9 1985 president reagan issued an executive order imposing sanctions that banned computer sales to the south african police and military and other government agencies that enforce apartheid exports of nuclear technology to south africa and further bank loans to the south african government later the president banned the importation of south african krugerrands nonetheless in 1986 congress enacted comprehensive sanctions against south africa over the veto of president reagan40 congress for several years pressured president bush to take greater leadership role in protecting the international environment in 1989 many members criticized the president for not leading world effort to deal with global warming after numerous congressional efforts to persuade the administration including letters hearings and senate amendment calling for global conference on the environment in 1989 the president offered to host an international meeting as step toward negotiations on an international agreement to deal with global warming congress also pressed other countries to take environmentally beneficial action in foreign aid legislation41 on june 9 1998 congress passed the iran missile proliferation sanctions act hr 2709 which would have imposed various sanctions on foreign entities that aided irans efforts to develop ballistic missiles this legislation was vetoed by president clinton on june 23 1998 nevertheless

forcefully with russia in order to get it to curtail its technological assistance to irans ballistic missile program42 another example of legislative pressure is the reaction of various senators to the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change this protocol is the implementation vehicle for the climate change convention the kyoto protocol was concluded on december 10 1997 by delegates of 161 nations and sets binding targets for reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by developed nations the united states signed it on november 12 1998 but it has not been submitted to the senate for its advise and consent as of this writing due in part to indications given by some senators that it would be rejected unless their key concerns are addressed first the clinton administration has been attempting to secure actions from various nations that would assist in convincing the senate that the kyoto protocol should be approved43 legislative restrictionsfunding denials congress has been most visible in its foreign policy role when it has placed legislation prohibitions or other limitations on the presidents freedom of action in foreign affairs often these measures have been amendments to legislation authorizing or appropriating funds that the president was unlikely to veto the use of funding restrictions or denials by congress is classic illustration of the power of the purse under the constitution unlike other legislative action by congress its use is not subject to serious challenge by the president as an unconstitutional infringement on the presidents foreign policy powers major legislativeexecutive confrontations have occurred when such restrictions have been passed despite the opposition of the president some examples follow on january 23 1973 president nixon announced the signing of the paris peace accords to end us involvement in the vietnam war but attacks by the khmer rouge in cambodia continued and the united states resumed bombing in cambodia the administration wanted to maintain freedom of us action if north vietnam or its communist associates violated the accords but congress effectively halted such military action when it passed over the presidents opposition amendments to funding legislation stating that after august 15 1973 funds under any legislation could be used to finance combat activities by united states military forces in over or from off the shores of north vietnam south vietnam laos or cambodia44 42 for background see katzman kenneth iran current developments and

new york oxford university press 1979 continued crs18 in 1974 the nixon administration was pursuing policy of normalizing trade relations with the soviet union as part of the broader policy of detente against the wishes of the administration congress passed amendments to the trade act of 1974 which limited the amount of exportimport bank credits to the soviet union to 300 million and made the granting of mostfavorednation treatment conditional upon soviet adoption of more liberal emigration policies subsequently the soviet union stated that because of such restrictions it would not put into force the trade agreement which the united states signed in 1972 in early 1976 when the united states was supplying covert assistance through the central intelligence agency to factions in angola against an angolan movement supported by cuban troops and soviet military assistance congress prohibited any kind of us assistance to angola unless expressly authorized by congress45 this provision known as the clark amendment forced the administration to end us aid congress repealed the amendment in 1985 throughout the reagan administration congress legislated numerous restrictions and limitations on military assistance to central american countries in 1983 for example it limited the amount that could be spent on us intelligence activities supporting military or paramilitary activities in nicaragua46 in 1987 after the central american governments signed peace accord congress cut off military assistance to the nicaraguan contras antisandinista guerillas and in 1988 permitted only nonlethal assistance47 in 1992 congress prohibited the testing of any nuclear weapon until july 1 1993 and permitted using funds for nuclear tests after that time only in accord with strict guidelines and conditions including plan for achieving multilateral comprehensive test ban48 in 1993 congress established deadline for us troops to leave somalia funds could be used for

solidarity act pl 104114 often referred to as the helms burton act this legislation among other things codifies all existing cuban embargo executive orders and regulations this law does not provide for presidential waiver of any of these codified embargo provisions the legislation also allows us nationals to sue for money damages in us federal court those persons that traffic in property confiscated in cuba the president can waive this provision for six month periods of time the legislation further denies admission to the us of aliens involved in the confiscation of us property in cuba or in the trafficking of confiscated us property in cuba the helmsburton legislation has direct and important effect on us cuban policy and was strongly opposed by the clinton administration prior to its enactment50 in 1996 congress passed hr 3107 legislation that would impose us sanctions on foreign companies that invested in energy production in libya or iran or sold certain products to libya the legislation the iran and libya sanctions act of 1996 was signed into law by president clinton on august 5 1996 pl 104 17251 informal advice often members of congress shape foreign policy by providing advice to the executive branch in informal contacts such advice can also be given at meetings between the president and members where formal decisionmaking is contemplated but where general reactions to prospective policy initiatives may be solicited by the president an example is president eisenhowers decision not to intervene militarily in indochina in 1954 at meeting on april 3 1954 secretary of state dulles and other executive branch officials met with congressional leaders including senate majority leader william knowland minority leader lyndon johnson speaker joseph martin jr and minority whip john mccormack secretary dulles said unanimous congressional opinion developed in the meeting that there should be congressional action on resolution to support involvement until commitments for support were obtained from other nations without assurance of either congressional or allied support president eisenhower decided against intervention52 another example is the proposal for ussoviet nuclear risk reduction centers the idea had been advanced by senators henry jackson john warner and sam nunn in 1980 and congress had endorsed the concept in the 1985 defense

up the idea at the summit conference of 1985 with soviet secretary general gorbachev and the two leaders agreed to negotiations on the subject an agreement on nuclear risk reduction centers was signed september 15 1987 congressional letters helped bring about change in us policy toward cambodia 162 house members and 26 senators wrote secretary of state baker letter on november 29 1989 questioning administration policy on cambodia on july 24 1990 66 senators wrote president bush taking issue with past us support for representatives of three resistance groups including the khmer rouge to be the legitimate representative of cambodia in the united nations congressional critics also contended that the administration was placing too much emphasis on the need for compromise by the vietnamese and the state of cambodia and not enough on restricting the khmer rouge as result of congressional pressure administration officials stressed more their opposition to the khmer rouge and the aid program was changed from covert to an overt one which could be more openly debated53 oversight of policy congress shapes foreign policy through regular oversight of executive branch implementation of foreign policy this involves such mechanisms as hearings and investigations in particular hearings on annual authorizations and appropriations of funds for executive branch agencies carrying out foreign policy provide an opportunity for committee members to question and influence activities and policies the senate foreign relations and house international relations committees oversee the department of state and other foreign affairs agencies the armed services committees oversee the defense department the intelligence committees oversee the central intelligence agency and other parts of the intelligence community hearings and investigations may be on any subject within committees jurisdiction and raise questions about policy for public discussion senate foreign relations committee hearings on the vietnam war and national commitments in the late 1960s and early 1970s for example contributed to public opinion against continued us participation in the war in 1987 special house and senate committees investigated revelations that staff of the national security council had entered secret negotiations that linked the sale of us arms to iran with the release of american hostages and that part of the proceeds from the sale had been used to assist the nicaraguan rebels known as contras54 other frequently used oversight mechanisms are reporting requirements and requirements that certain decisions or international agreements be submitted to congress in advance of the date they would be effective the freedom support act of 1992 for example required several annual reports including one on the effectiveness of the assistance provided to each of the independent states of the 53 see support for third world resistance movements changing priorities by copson raymond wand

of programs to assist us companies in transacting business with the independent states and the activities of the democracy corps it required semiannual reports on soviet weapons destruction and numerous onetime reports it also required reports of proposed obligations of funds for nonproliferation activities in advance of actual obligation and certification that state was meeting certain criteria such as forgoing excessive military modernization prior to obligating funds for nonproliferation and disarmament programs55 since the early 1970s congress has used oversight mechanisms to advance human rights as an important factor in us foreign policy the house international relations and senate foreign relations committees have held hearings on human rights in various geographic regions and specific countries and cases involving violations of human rights of individuals in foreign countries in 1975 congress established machinery in the state department to carry out the human rights policy and required annual reports from the department on human rights observance by each recipient of us foreign aid in 1979 it required that the report cover all members of the united nations congress has monitored the reports and executive branch policies toward countries with poor human rights records frequently inserting in legislation conditions or restrictions aimed at improving human rights policies the foreign operations appropriation act for fy1993 for example prohibited aid to zaire because of continued reports of human rights abuses in that country56 in the mid1990s the indonesian governments use of military force to deal with internal political dissension in east timor province it took over by force from portugal in the mid1970s led to criticism in the congress of indonesias human rights practices this led to inclusion of restriction in the foreign operations appropriation act for fy1995 pl 103306 signed august 23 1994 against the sale or licensing of small or light arms and crowd control items by the us for indonesia pending report to the appropriations committees of congress by the secretary of state that there had been significant progress made on human rights practices in east timor and elsewhere in indonesia funding for grant military assistance training of the indonesian military was also denied in this legislation the restriction on funding for participation in grant military funding for the indonesian military has also been placed in recent appropriations acts57 conclusion the practices illustrated in this report show that making us foreign policy is complex process both the legislative and executive branches play important roles the roles are different although frequently overlapping both branches have 55 pl 102511 signed october 24

interaction between them continues indefinitely throughout the life of policy the president as the chief spokesman of the nation directs government officials and machinery in the daily conduct of diplomacy and has the principal responsibility for taking action to advance us foreign policy interests congress in its oversight responsibility can affect the course of policy through enactment of legislation governing foreign relations and through the appropriation or denial of funds experience has shown that cooperation between the two branches is necessary for strong and effective us foreign policy crs23 appendix division of foreign policy powers between the president and congress excerpts from the constitution article i section 7 all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house
