disallowing the counting of administrative costs as part of minimum distribution requirement for private foundations the ways and means committee has modiﬁed this provision in reporting out the bill by restricting the types of administrative costs eligible hr 7 was passed by the house on september 17 2003 the issue of administrative costs and minimum distributions has been the subject of series of changes in the past but currently there are restrictions other than that administrative expenses be reasonable the principal arguments for disallowing administrative costs in the minimum distribution requirement are to discourage excessive administrative costs and increase the level of grants the principal objections are that the restriction would increase the tendency of current requirements to erode real asset values and that the restriction would be especially harmful for those grant objectives that require signiﬁcant amount of monitoring the revision may deal in part with that last objectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs216031 see crs report rs21144 tax incentives for charity an overview of legislative proposals by jane g gravelle for an overview of the provisions in these

amount of monitoring the revision may deal in part with that last objection the senate has passed legislation s 476 that provides for series of tax benefits designed to encourage charitable contributi ons the house had passed its own version of this legislation in the 107th congress hr 7 the housepassed version included provision beneficial to privat foundations which would reduce small excise tax applied to investment earnings this issue was not addressed in the senate bill1 the version of hr 7 introduced by congressman blunt in the 108th congress added provision to the bill to disallow the counting of administrativ costs in determining the distributions of private foundations that make grants planned markup of the bill by the ways and means committee on september 4 2003 had been postponed to consider this provision further the ways and means committee in reporting out the bill on september 9 allowed administrative costs to be counted in distributions for purposes of the minimumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21603crs2 distribution requirement but re stricted the amounts eligible administrative costs must be directly related to the charitable purpose grant monitoring and

was similar but not identical to the ways and means proposal in the case of travel provi sions it would also disallow expenses for foreign travel hr 7 was passed by the house on september 17 2003this report explains the current minimum distribution requirements in the tax law and the history of this provision and disc usses the issues charitable contributions legislation is likely to recur in the 109 th congress although the cu rrent senate bill s 6 does not address this issue current tax treatment of private foundations donor who sets up the foundation can benefit from tax deductions for the contribution without immediately making the charitabl donation rather the foundation can retain assets and make contributions over time the f ounder or his heirs can retain control over the distribution of funds inve stment earnings are not subject to income taxes the tax law imposes some restrictions therefore on f oundations to ensure that the charitable purpose is realized and that the benefits do not accrue to private parties among these restrictions is requirement that 5 of investment assets be distributed each year in qualifying distribution if this distribu tion is not achieved there is an excise tax of 15 in the first year which then becomes 100 if the distribution is not made in the second year thus because this tax is confiscatory foundations must effectively distribute the 5 amount the proposed change in hr 7 would not llow administrative costs to count against the minimum distribution requirement for founda tions that make gran t technically called nonoperating foundations legislative history the excise taxes and regulati ons applicable to foundations reflect concern that the tax benefits not be used to provide privat benefits and that the charitable purpose be served by preventing the accumulation of assets in the foundation many of these provisions including the minimum distribution requirement were or iginally adopted in the tax reform act of 1969 part of the reason for the minimum distribution rule was to replace an existing system where foundations c ould lose their exempt status if they had excessive accumulations cumbersome nd difficult system which often involved expensive litigation the two taxwriting committees initially reported 5 minimum but that number was raised to 6 on the senate floor the figure could be adjusted by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21603crs3 2 helping charities sustaining foundations june 2 2003 and billion here billion there the empirical data add up july 8 2003 as of this writing these reports are posted on the web at httpwwwncrporg the second report was response to criticisms by the council of foundations discussed belowtreasury based on investment yields the provi sion also required distribution of all net income if that amount were larger this restriction was followed by two re ductions of the distribution requirement first the minimum distribution which d become 675 by 1976 was lowered to 5 and fixed at that level by the tax reform act of 1976 the econo mic recovery tax act of 1981 eliminated the requirement that all ne t income be paid out if that amount were larger the reason given for this 1981 change was that payment of all income would gradually erode the value of the real assets because of inflation problem that had become much more severe over time the deficit reduction act of 1984 temporarily limited admin istrative expenses that could be included in the minimum distribu tion rule to 065 of assets and the requirement that administrative expenses be reasonable and necessary was put into the statute it was already in the regulations this restriction reflected concern that much or all of the distribution re quirement could be met by ad ministrative expenses and that the public purpose of the charitable treatme nt was to provide the actual charitable benefits this limit was to expire at th end of 1990 and treas ury report mandated by the legislation recommended in 1990 that the termination occur and it did issues many of the arguments for excluding administrative costs from the payout requirement are presented in study by the national committee on re sponsible philanthropy2 the principal arguments in these st udies which also present data on the administrative expenses of foundations ar that the restriction would encourage foundations to be frugal in their administr ative overhead and would make available an additional amount of charitable donations from foundations of up to 32 billion in 2003 the reports also suggests that such restriction is quite manageable as foundation administrative costs average only 87 of distri butions or 04 of ssets and that based on historical evidence on earni ngs these amounts could be covered without reducing the size of foundations the reports also indi cate concern for excessive administrative costs particularly in the form of high salaries of officers citing some examples the studies also point out in response to critici sms that the higher payouts will reduce that value of foundati ons assets that private foundations receive funds from other sources than earnings on assets including ong oing donations by families foundations cr itical of this change have made two basic arguments first they dispute the argument above that foundations w ill be able to make larger payouts without eroding the value of assets indeed they argue that even the current 5 payout requirement inclusive of administrative costs would eventually erode real asset value accounting for inflation given historical minal returns they also argue that the provision would discourage grants to smalle r grassroots groups that require more administrative attention and tail higher costs to monitor and support recipients inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21603crs4 3 talking points fact sheet and rebuttal to the first study of the national committee on responsible philanthropy discussed above was issued by the council on foundations in june 2003 as of this writing it can be found at h ttp wwwcoforg the c ouncils website along with other materials addressing these issuesaddition to these arguments they also ggest that news stories reporting abuses by foundations in particular in the form of ex cessive salaries relative to grants are not representative3 historical data suggest that real earnings could exceed th 5 or 55 level if the portfolio contains significant risky assets s uch as corporate stock but probably not with relatively riskless assets during the period 19592001 the average return on 6month treasury bills was 17 the return on baa corporate bonds was 35 real returns varied substantially over time with returns quite low in the 1970s but relatively high in the 1980s and 1990s baa bonds earned real retu rns in excess of 55 in every year from 1981 on however corporate stock has typica lly over long period of time returned real earnings of 7 or more but earnings can fluctuate even more over time however even if the average foundation could not consistently earn the required amount to retain real assets there is so public policy question of whether it is important to preserve the real value of foundation assets in pe rpetuity absent any additional contributions from the sta ndpoint of the charitable objective payout requirements are really about the timing of charitable bequests and it might be desirable to pay out amounts earlier rather than later moreover there has always been concern that foundations are ways of avoiding income and estate taxes while preserving the power that comes with control over assets on the other hand increased restrictions on foundations may also make them less attractive and reduce ch aritable giving in the long run one method of restricting administrativ expenses without increasing total distribution requirements for foundations with m odest administrative costs is the separate restriction on these costs as adopted in 1984 this approach would be less restrictive than disallowing administrative costs but could mo re greatly constrain foundations with high grant monitoring costs the alternative of disallowing only certain types of expenses eg salaries above certain vel other items deemed to be luxury ones may have the effect of limiting the exclusion of administra tive costs for different type of foundation that has highly compensate d management and large founda tions would typically require highly compensated management expertise but these costs may not be significant part of the overall administrative cost
