to concerns that the united states may not be able to compete economically with other nations in the future due to insufficient investment today in science and engineering research and in science technology engineering and mathematics stem education similar concern led president bush to announce the american competitiveness initiative aci in january 2006 fy2008 appropriations met neither the administrations aci target nor america competes act authorized levels an issue for congress is whether fy2009 appropriations will the presidentss office of science and technology policy reports that the fy2009 budget request includes funding for america competes act initiatives at 88 of the fy2009 authorization level in june 2008 the house and senate approved the concurrent budget resolution conference report sconres 70 which provides sense of th congress on the america competes act stating the congress should provide sufficient funding so that our nation may continue to be the world leader in education innovation and economic growth for fy2009 the federal agencies that manage america competes act programs are funded through an interim continuing resolution until march 6 2009 funding for the remainder of fy2009 and all of fy2010 remains to be determined the act authorizes increases in the nations invest ment in science and engineering research at the national science foundation nsf the national institute of standards and technology nist laboratories and the department of energy doe office of science both the senate and house committees on appropriations recommended funding for nsf authorized at 73 billion while 69 billion was requested by the administration for nist both the senate and house committees provided funding for programs the administration requested eliminated the technology innovation program tip and the manufacturing extension partnership mep the doe office of science authorized level is 52 billion the president requested 47 billion the senate committee reported 46 billion and the house committee reported 48 billion the act also establishes within doe the advanced research projects agencyenergy arpae designed to support transformational energy technology research projects the presidents fy2009 budget does not request appropriations for arpae the house committee recommended 15 million for arpae while the senate committee did not include any funding in its report in stem education the act authorizes departme nt of education ed and nsf programs to encourage stem degree majors and professionals to become k12 stem teachers at ed the administration requests the elimination of the acts teachers for competitive tomorrow program authorized at 1512 million the senate committee included 2 million for this program while the house subcommittee did not fund the program at nsf the america competes act increased the authorization level for the robert noyce teacher scholarship program to 1150 million the

security of the united states to promote scientific and technological innovation in support of that mission and to ensure the environmental cleanup of the national nuclear weapons complex10 the doe is the largest federal government supporter of basic physical sciences research this research is conducted at its national laboratories as well as through its support of investigatorinitiated merit reviewed competitively selected awards conducted primarily at universities11 the america competes act authorizes the establishment of the arpae and the discovery science and engineering innovation institutes within doe based on the defense advanced research projects agency darpa model arpae is designed to support transformational energy technology research projects with the goal of enhancing the nations economic and energy security 12 discovery science and engineering innovation institutes would be multidisciplinary research institutes located at doe national laboratories that would apply fundamental science and engineering discoveries to technological innovations up to three institutes may be created each fiscal year the doe fy2009 budget request does not propose funding for either arpae or the discovery science and engineering innovation institutes dr john h marburger director of the white house office of science and technology policy testified the budget does not request funding for the advanced research projects agency arpa or new math and science education programs at the department of energy this is because the administration believes very strongly that the basic research programs at the doe office of science are higher leverage investment and in greater need of funding than new doe programs especially given the devastating impacts of last years omnibus appropriations bill on this agency 13 rather than create arpae or the discovery science and engineering innovation institutes the secretary of energy has issued new policy on technology transfer14 and proposes establishing 2530 multiinvestigator energy frontier research centers efrcs15 at universities or other 10 department of energy about doe at httpwwwenergygovaboutindexhtm 11 department of

policy doe will now reportedly pool funds from the office of science and other programs to fund six new collaborations that integrate basic and applied research funding for these collaborations will reportedly be based on congressional language that requires doe to set aside 09 of its applied energy research and development budget for technology transfer16 the goal of efrcs would be to focus on transformative research17 the requested fy2009 efrc budget is approximately 1000 million with initial fiveyear awards of 2050 million annually per center in contrast each of the three discovery science and engineering innovation institutes is authorized at 100 million annually for maximum of three years the act also authorizes the establishment of several new stem education programs at the k12 and postsecondary level within doe these activities include k12 student and teacher programs such as specialty high schools for science and mathematics pilot program experiential based learning opportunities eg summer internships for middle and high school students and summer institutes for teachers postsecondary programs include nuclear science talent expansion program and hydrocarbon systems science talent expansion program to enhance existing and create new educational programs in nuclear science and hydrocarbon systems in addition the act establishes new position within doe to direct stem education programs across the department and science engineering and mathematics education fund that is to include not less than 03 of does research development and commercial application funding although the relevant sections in the fy2009 doe budget submission note the authorization of the america competes act they do not make clear what specific educational programs within the act to which the request is responding 18 for example the fy2009 request for the office of nuclear energy references the america competes act and states it will designate 20 of its research funds for

scientists in the office of science budget justification doe notes the america competes act and mentions many doe stem educational programs but it does not identify any of them as either new america competes act initiatives or specify if some of the existing programs have been modified to accommodate the act in addition the doe office of science does not mention the early career awards for science engineering and mathematics researchers program in congressional testimony however the administration has identified two doe stem education programs and the early career researcher program from the act as included in the fy2009 budget request19 omb contends that the following doe programs correspond to programs authorized by the america competes act summer institutes 5003 corresponds to the preexisting doe academies creating teacher scientists program doe acts early career awards for science engineering and mathematics researchers 5006 corresponds to preexisting high energy physics outstanding junior investigator nuclear physics outstanding junior investigator fusion energy sciences plasma physics junior faculty development advanced scientific computing research early career principle investigator and the office of science early career scientist and engineer award programs and protecting americas competitive edge pace graduate fellowship program 5009 corresponds to preexisting computer science graduate fellowships graduate research environmental fellowships american meteorological societyindustrygovernment graduate fellowships spallation neutron source instrumentation fellowships and the fusion energy sciences graduate fellowships 20 the doe summer institutes authorization in the act is 20 million in fy2009 based on the information provided in does budget request for the programs identified above funding for these institutes is requested for 6 million in fy2009 the early career awards program is authorized for 25 million in fy2009 the testimony states that fy2009 funding of 10 million is requested for the programs specified above for the pace fellowships doe requests 19 million above the act authorization level of 12 million in fy2009 based on the programs listed above and the doe budget request 21 some of the competes act programs have addi tional requirements that may be beyond those that may be part of existing programs for example the america competes acts doe summer institutes programs has prioritization criteria focused on teachers from wide range of 19 attachment 4 in testimony of dr john marburger iii director white house

the budget spending amounts for each functional category of the budget31 the budget resolution did not allocate funds among specific programs or accounts major program assumptions underlying the functional amounts however are often discussed in the reports accompanying the resolution these program assumptions and budget functions are not binding32 in june 2008 the house and senate approved the conference report on sconres 70 the concurrent budget resolution for 2009 section 522 of the report provides sense of the congress on the innovation agenda and the america competes act stating the congress should provide sufficient funding so that our na tion may continue to be the world leader in education innovation and economic growth the resolution supports the efforts authorized in the america competes act providing substantially increased funding above the presidents requested level for 2009 and increased amounts after 2009 in function 250 general science space and technology and other functions the resolution also states that additional increases for scientific research and education are included in function 270 energy function 300 environment and natural resources function
