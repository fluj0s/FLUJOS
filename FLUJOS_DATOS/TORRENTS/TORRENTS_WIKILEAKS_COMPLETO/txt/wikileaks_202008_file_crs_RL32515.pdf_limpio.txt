best known member of the intelligence community the bulk of the nations intelligence effort is undertaken by the intelligence agencies of the departme nt of defense dod in particular the national security agency nsa the na tional reconnaissance office nro and the national geospatialintelligence agency nga formerly known as the national imagery and mapping agency nima are major collectors of information for dod and non dod consumers and absorb large pe rcentage of the annual intelligence budget the defense intelligence agency dia albeit large and important component of the intelligence community is more directly focused on dod requirements some members of congress and indepe ndent commissions most recently the national commission on terrorist attack s upon the united states the 911 commission have argued that lack of coordination among intelligence agencies contributed to the failure to provide warn ing of the terrorist attacks of september 2001 in response in december 2004 congress passed intelligence reform legislation pl 108458 that modifies th existing organization of the intelligence community and establishes more centra lized leadership under newly created director of national intelligence dni as the legislation was bein g debated in the fall of 2004 attention focused on the extent of the budgetary and administrative author ities to be assigned to the dni significant concerns were expressed by dod officials some members of congress and various outside observers that providi ng the dni with greater authority and control of intelligence agencies in dod could jeopardize the increasingly close relationship between these agencies and the operating military forces the conference committee on intelligen ce reform legislation s 2845 addressed these concerns with language that gave the dni substantial authorities over intelligence budget s but not operational control over their activities the final version of the legislation also provided th at the details of budgetary authorities to be exercised by the dni and other cabinet officers be worked out in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the pr esident after the dni is appointed this

for collection and analysis for all national intelligence agencies and to fo rward an annual intelligence budget to the president but he has not d control of the execution of budgets beyond that of the cia nor could he transfer funds or personnel from one agency to another over the objection of cabinet officers for some years there were proposals to gi ve the dci greater authority to manage the activities of all intelligence agencies including those in dod many observers suggested that earlier proposals were not enacted because of concerns by dod and some members of the armed services committees that such an initiative would weaken the ability of the secretary of defense to manage resources considered essential to carrying out dods statutory missions in the wake of the september 11 2001 attacks and flawed estimates about weapons of mass destruction wmd in iraq there were renewed calls for intelligence reform or reorganization to remedy perceived s hortcomings in the performance

tactical users in operation iraqi freedom than in earlier campaigns national security agency teams and related air force cryptologic units were forwarddeployed to the theater of operations to assist tactical commanders in accessing and interpreting signals intelligence from orbital and airbreathing sources the need to integrate intelligence resources has also become more important inasmuch as the

observers as well as the joint inquiry of the two congressional intelligen ce committees and the 911 commission concluded that the or ganization and management of the intelligence community was

commission took note of some of the limitations of the dcis au thority over the direction and priorities of the intelligence community especially its elements within the department of defense the dci has to direct agencies without controlling them he does not receive an appropriation for their activitie s and therefore does not control their purse strings he has little insight into how they spend their resources congress attempted to strengthen the dcis authority in 1996 by creating the positions of deputy dci for community management and assistant dcis for collection analysis and production

inquiry of the two inte lligence committees concluded that the dci was unable to establish comprehensive intelligence effort against qaeda even when the extent of the threat had become evid ent to the dci at least by 1998 it reported following the august 1998 bombings of two us embassies the dci placed bin ladins terrorist network among the intelligence communitys highest priorities the dci raised the status of the threat further still when he announced to cia senior managers in december 1998 we are at war with bin ladin i want resources or people spared in this effort either inside the cia or the intelligence community these were strong words rather than having galvanizing effect however the joint inquiry record suggests that the intelligence community continued to be fragmented without comprehensive strategy for combating bin ladin the joint inquiry concluded that the dci was either unable or unwilling to enforce consistent priorities and marshal resources across the community15 simply put the joint inquiry argued that although dci george tenet put the intelligence community on war footing ag ainst qaeda his writ did not run beyond the cia to other parts of the intelligence community including the major pentagon agencies accordingly the jo int inquiry and the 911 commission as well as others have urged that there should be single senior official having the title director of national intelligence or nati onal intelligence director responsible for managing the entire intelligence community including nsa the nro and the nga along with the cia and other intelligence

would include establishment and enforcement of consistent priorities for the collection analysis and dissemination of intelligen ce throughout the intelligence community the dni would have

precisely define the extent of the dnis authorities on august 2 2004 president bush announced his intention to seek changes in the national security act to establish national intelligence director appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate who will oversee and coordinate the foreign and domestic activities of the intelligence community19 the president indicated that the cia will be managed by separate director theadministration plan apparently did not envision the nid having the authority to control the budgets of the various agencies nor would the nid

intelligence reform less is more hoover digest spring 2004concerns about reorganization proposals whereas there appears to be question that failure to fully correlate information in the possession of intelligence and law enforcement agencies hindered the effort to uncover the 911 plot before it occurred some observers argue that the main obstacle prior to 911 was the regulatory framework that created wall between foreign intelligence and law enforcement analysts and not organizational arrangements per from their perspective the problem in large measure involved the cia and the fbi and among dod agencies primarily nsa which had to work within the constraints of the wall in regard to surveillance of us persons the 911 commission criticized nsas almost obsessive protection of sources and methods and its focus on foreign intellig ence and its avoidance of anything domestic22 it is noteworthy nevertheless that the 911 commissions list of ten missed opportunities for stopping the plot do not cite misstep by nsa or any other dod agency23 criticisms of proposals to establish dninid centered on the possibility or likelihood that they would undermine the au thority of the secretary of defense over agencies that are closely integrated into the operational capabilities of the military services writing in june 2004 former dci robert gates argued that more than 80 percent of foreign intelligen ce dollars are spent by agencies under the control of the secretary of defense virtually all of those agencies have tactical combatrelated tasks to perform for the pentagon and the military services in addition to the roles they pl ay under the guidance of the director of central intelligence in the real world of washington bureaucratic and congressional politics there is way the secretary of defense or the armed services committees of congress are simply going to hand those agencies over to an intelligence czar sitting in the wh ite house indeed for the last decade intelligence authority has been quietly leaching from the cia and to the pentagon not the other way around24 bruce berkowitz who has worked with the hoover institution and the rand corporation and is currently serv ing as dod consultant has written proposals to yank intelligence organizati ons out of the defense department also overlook the role they play in combat operations today the ability to feed electronic data to units on the battlefield th rough digital pipelines is essential for the kind of networkstyle warfare that has proved so effective in iraq and afghanistan combat forces use more of this data than anyone else it seems odd that anyone would want to drag seve ral intelligence organizations out of the defense department simply to create new megaorganization whose main mission would be supporting the defense department25 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32515crs10 26 richard k betts the new politics of inte lligence will reforms work this time foreign affairs mayjune 2004 p

2nd announcement usdi cambone tes tified that we early conclude d that the relationship between intelligence and operations was growing closer so close in fact that it was beginning to become increasingly difficu lt to separate the two expressing skepticism about plans to increase the ro of the dci or create dni cambone argued that absent the current deep and abiding relationship between the dci and the secretary of defense it is easy to see the ways in which seams would begin to grow up between organizations and in which the department of defense would not be benefitted and in fact the intelligence community as whole be hurt by that split so sustaining the existing re lationship we thi nk is essential27 cambones testimony echoe d testimony offered in 1996 by john p white then the deputy secretary of defense in the c linton administration in regard to earlier legislation to reorganize the intelligence community confusing the clear lines of authority that currently exist would make it more difficult for dod intelligence elements to perform their most important mission support to the warfighter in the drive to create strong intelligence community we must not damage the integration of military intelligence within the defense community28 concerns within dod persisted on october 21 2004 general richard myers the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff wrote to the representative hunter chairman of the house armed services committee maintaining that the budgets of the combat support agencies including nsa nro and nga should come up from the agencies throug h the

approaches consideration of legislation to establish dninid focused on the extent of this officials authorities to coordinate all intelligence agencies but some observers asserted that separate from organizational issues more significant steps had already been taken to improve sharing of inform ation implying that organizational issues were not necessarily the key factor they assert that the intelligence communitys failure to connect the dots before the 911 attacks resulted in large measure from barriers to communications between foreign intelligence agencies such as the cia and law enforcement agencies especially the fbi29 these barriers were in many cases purposefully erected in regulations in order to ensure that foreign intelligence agencies would not be used to target us persons as had occurred on earlier occasions when intelligence ag encies zealously investig ated groups and individuals opposed to the vietnam war after 911 congress adjusted these ba rriers through provisions in the usa patriot act of 2001 pl 107 56 and other legislati on the usa patriot act authorized the sharing of law enforcement and foreign intelligence information in addition the homeland security act pl 107296 provided that the intelligence analysis and infrastructure protection co mponent of the depa rtment of homeland security dhs would receive and analyze foreign intelligence and law enforcement information relating to terrorist threats to the us subsequently the bush administration established the terrorist threat integration center ttic to perform integrative analytical functions30 such initiatives have arguably torn down or at least significantly lowered the wall between foreign intelligence and law enforcement that may have contributed to the failure to detect the 911 plot in advance these developments according to some observers affect the need for enhancing the powers of proposed dninid ongoing technological innovations are also according to some observers working to remove longestablished ba rriers the phenomenon of stovepiping whereby imagery humint or sigint would be collected by separate agencies in the field and forwarded to respective washingt onarea headquarters to be processed and analyzed before being made availabl to users has received much criticism stovepiping in essence means the contro l of information by collection agencies inevitably processing transmission and fo rwarding lead to delays and impede the effort to bring all available data to bear on the intelligence needs of all levels of government the dangers of

revealed information considered irre levant noise by one set of analysts may provide critical clues or reveal signif icant relationships when subjected to analytic scrutiny by another this proce ss is critical for the terrorism issue where evidence is particularly scant often separated by space and time31 well before 911 the defense departme nt was taking advantage of new technologies to provide inte lligence support to its forces realtime intelligence has been especially important in the use of precision munitions allowing targeting of specific targets while minimizing casualties defense intelligence agencies are acquiring capabilities to collect comprehensive data to provide instantaneous transmission data storage and immediate re trieval at all echelons in many cases processing and analysis is undertaken at sites within the us even washingtonarea headquarters process known as reachba ck and can be directly accessed by military units around the world to suppor t ongoing tactical operations observers such as berkowitz have ggested that rather than undertaking revision of complex statutes efforts s hould be focused on generating the political will needed to make all intelligence organizations implement truly common set of security standards that balance the importance of keeping secrets with the importance of sharing information32 berkowitz notes that executive order 12333 which serves charter document for the intelligence community is over 20 years old and needs revision an effort that in his view would be faster more effective vehicle for intelligence reform than commission repor t or legislation such an order could also resolve the security barriers and other hurdles that currently keep intelligence agencies from working together more effectively in october 2002 testimony before the join t inquiry dia director jacoby argued that crucial need is to create new paradigm wherein ownership of information belongs with the analysts and not the collectors jacoby argued that the government should follow industrys practice in adopting standard for data storage that permit retrieval from multiple users at different agencies if we are to achieve an end state charact erized by the ability to rapidly share and integrate information we must move toward common data framework and set of standards that will allow interoperability at the data not system level and the sooner the better not just for limited group of intelligence producers and subsets of data it shouldnt be an elective option interoperability at the data level is an absolutely necessary ttribute of transformed intelligence environment because it enables horizontal integration of information from all sources not just intelligence at all levels of classification33 many observers believe that stovepiping can be gradually overcome because of the availability of technology for rapid dissemination of opera tional data and the press of operational require ments as

that the president lead governmentwide effort to bring the major national security institu tions into the information revolution36 the commission indicated role for the nid and the secretary of homeland security backed by the office of management nd budget to set common standards for information in the intelligence community ot her public agencies and relevant parts of the private sector the commission did not specifically address the issue within dod provisions were however ultimately included in pl 108458 directing the dni to establish uniform security st andards common information technology standards and policies and procedures to resolve conflicts between the need to share intelligence and the need to protect intelligence sources and methods pl 108458 the intelligence reform

2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32515crs14 37 as passed by the senate s 2845 provided that the nid would manage and oversee appropriations for the national intelligence program section 112 this would encompass execution of funds reprogramming of funds and the transfer of funds and personnel the senate bill also contained extensive acquisition and fiscal authorities for the nid to develop and implement program management plans for major intelligence systems section 162 the version of s 2845 as passed by the house would assign the nid the responsibility to facilitate the management and execution of funds appropriated for the national intelligence program section 102asome members sought to provide greater authority to the position others preferred more limited changes to current authorities on september 29 the senate voted to table an amendment 3706 that would give the nid authority to supervise direct and control the operations of th major dod intelligence agencies as well as the cia but ultimately the senate bill sought to create stronger niddni than was reflected in the house bill37 the ensuing conference reportedly had difficulty in reaching agreement on the issue but many of the media accounts of discussions did not provide precise tr eatments of the arguments after further consideration the conferen ce version of s 2845 was passed by the house on december 7and by the senate the following day the legislation was approved by the president on december 17 2004 in the signing the bill president bush stated it will be the dnis res ponsibility to determine the annual budgets for all national intelligence agencies and offices and to direct how these funds are spent these authorities vested in single official who reports directly to will make all our intelligence efforts better coordinated more efficient and more effective the new law will preserve the existing chain of command and leave all our intelligence agencies organizations and offices in their current departments our military commanders will continue to have quick access to the intelligence they need to achieve victory on the battlefield provisions regarding the budgetary authorities of the dni and other senior officials were complex and reflected the fact that significantly different views remain the conference report for s 2845 authorized the dni to provide guidance for national intelligence program budget to heads of departments containing intelligence organizations develop and determine an an nual consolidated national intelligence program budget present national intelligence program budget to the president forapproval together with disse nting comments from heads of departments containing intelligence organizations participate in the development by the

2845 version of november 20 2004 published by congressional quarterly 39 appropriated funds are not available to agencies until they are apportioned by the office of management and budget omb to government agenci in response to an agency request an apportionment may be further subdivided by an agency into allotments suballotments and allocations see office of management and budg et circular

would be initiated by the dni 40 see the separate comments of representatives hunter and hoekstra congressi onal record december 20 2004 pp e2207e2210direct the allotment or allocation of appropriations through the heads of departments containing intelligence agencies or organization provide exclusive direction to the office of management and budget omb regarding apportionm ent and subsequent allocations of appropriated funds transfer or reprogram funds fro m one program in the national intelligence program to another with omb approval and subject to other restrictions transfer personnel from one intelligence agency to another for up to two years under certain conditions38 taken together these authorities will provide the dni with significantly greater budgetary author ities than possessed by the dci in particular provisions authorizing the dni to direct allocations and allotments of appr opriated funds gives the dni significant leverage in the acqui sition and program ma nagement efforts of intelligence agencies in dod39 some members believed that this leverage would amount to degree of control inconsiste nt with the secretary of defenses responsibilities for managing intelligence agencies in dod that also support the combat forces although the proposed language clearly establishes extensive budgetary authorities for the dni other factor s such as the role of the personalities of the respective officials the priorities of the incumbent administration and the influence of congressional guidance will also have significant influences moreover the final version of the gislation includes provision section 1018 that requires the president to issu guidelines to ensure the effective implementation of authorities granted to the dni the director of the omb and cabinet heads in manner that maintains consistent with the provisions of this act the statutory responsibilities of the head of the departments of the united states government with respect to such departments the guidelines are to be issued within 120 days of the appointment of the first dni some observers suggest that this provision provides an opportunity for renewed consideration of the issues that made passage of pl 108458 difficult40 media accounts indicate that another key issue was daytoday operational control of the collection assets of inte lligence agencies in dod some observers suggest however that this issue is not clearcut the legislation gives the dni authority to apportion funds and the pportionment process affects the timing and rate of the flow of funds

directions july 29 2004 wwwdirectionsmagorg 43 s 2845 version of november 20 2004 section 1031appropriated funds does not automatically transl ate into the authority to direct dayto day operations there are already we llestablished distinctions between responsibilities for acquisition programs on the one hand and responsibilities for operational command on the other the military departments the departments of the army navy and air force have major re sponsibilities for the acquisition of systems to be used by the operating forces but ongoing operations are controlled by the unified commands eg central comma nd european command pacific command at the direction of the secretary of defense and the president analogously the dni would have responsibilities for acquisition of systems that are part of the national intelligence program the heads of defense intelligence agencies would be responsible to the secretary of defense for operating the systems daytoday tasking of the national systems operated by intelligence agencies in dod has been coordinated among consum ers from throughout the government including dod the state department the wh ile house etc the dci has long had authority to coordinate such ta sking in response to nsc guidance41 for geospatial imagery for example the source operations and management directorate of nga routinely meets with representatives of agencies outside dod to coordinate production priorities nga ac knowledges that authority to establish priorities derives from the authorities of the dci rather than solely from those of the defense department42 similar arrangements exist in regard to other intelligence disciplines such as signals intelligence the intelligence reform act also established joint intelligence community council jicc composed of the secretarie s of state and defense and other senior officials to advise the dni on estab lishing requirements developing budgets financial management and monitoring and evaluating the performance of intelligence agencies the statute also provides fo r the submission of advice or opinion of individual members of the jicc to the pr esident along with the recommendations of the dni43 past relationships among defense agencies the office of the secretary of defense and the intelligence community management staff have been complex the new legislation establishes dni with st ronger budgetary authorities than possessed by the dci nevertheless the requireme nt for close coordination between the dni and dod agencies will remain given the need for agencies to m eet different needs of different parts of the g overnment observers believe that this new relationship will also be complicated and that considerable time will be required to develop coordinative procedures
