though some may recur ne xt year the key issue which held up the conference agreement until after the midterm elections was whether to permit concurrent receipt of military retired pay and veterans disability benefits the senate authorization bill included provision to allow immediate full concurrent receipt while the house b ill phased in program to allow concurrent r eceipt for those with 60 or greater disabilities the white house threatened to veto bill that included either provision the conference agreement provides new benefit paid by the defense department to military retirees who have disability determined to be caused by combat or combatrelated injury the conference agreement on the defense authorization also resolved number of other issues the agreement include s amended versions of senate provisions tightening oversight of missile defens programs it drops house provision concerning application of the endangered species act to defense facilities but includes provision concerning the migr atory bird treaty act it prohibits fy2003 funds from being used to develop nuclear ar med interceptors for missile defense it provides funds for developing nuclearear th penetrator

its formal fy2003 budget request to congress the administra tion proposed 3968 billion for the national defense budget function about 46 billion above the estimated fy2002 level for an overview of the request see appendix b of the total requested 34 billion was for full accrual accounting of civilian pers onnel retirement benef its which congress ultimately did not approve without the accrual accounting change the request was 3934 billion of this amount 3667 billion wa s requested for programs covered by the defense appropriations bill 97 billion by the military construction appropriations bill 165 billion for department of energy defenserela ted activities funded in the energy and water appropria tions bill and the remainder in other appropriations bills with global war against terrorism underway congress was not inclined to make substantial changes in the administrations request for defense increase early in the year however there was some skirmishing particularly between the defense committees and the budget committees over two issues first how to treat the administrations request for 10 billion in fy2003 in an unallocated contingency fund for the war against terrorism and second how to treat the administr ations request for full accrual accounting of civilian retirement benefits which across the whole government would increase discretionary spending by about 9 billion and reduce mandatory spe nding by an equal amount see appendix b for discussion of accrual accounting national defense funding in the fy2003 budget resolution for their part the congressional defense committees would have preferred to be able to allocate the entire amount the admin istration requested for national defense as they saw fit the house budget committee however set aside the 10 billion requested for war costs in reserve fund av ailable only for that purpose the house also set aside funds for civilian accrual acc ounting in reserve fund while the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs4 budget committee rejected the shift to full accrual accounting altogether table 2 shows amounts recommended for national defense in the h ouse and senate versions of the budget resolution compared to the administration request the house approved its version of the fy2003 budget resolution hconres 353 on march 20 by vote of 221209 in all the measure recommended 3938 billion for the national defense budget function in fy2003 but 10 billion of that amount was in the reserve fund available only for costs of the global war against terrorism an additional 34 billion not s hown in the national defense total was available for defense in the reserve fund to cover costs of accrual accounting if congress approved it the senate budget committee version of the resolution sconres 100 was reported on march 22 but was never brought up on the senate floor the committee recommended 3934 billion for national defe nse in fy2003 and explicitly rejected shift to full accrual accounting for civilian employees the committee also recommended lower levels of defense spending after fy2004 than either the house or the administration though the committee set aside future funds in reserve to be available either for defense or defic it reduction recommende d national defense funding levels in the budget resoluti on are not binding on the

full civilian accrual accounting the 9 billion requested for full civilia n accrual accounting was at the center of debate over the total amount available for appropriations bills the housepassed budget resolution provided 759 billion in total discretionary funding to the appropriations committee which is equal to the administr ation request without the 9 billion governmentwide cost of shif ting civilian accrual payments from the mandatory to the discretionary side of the budget the senate re ported version of the budget resolution however provided 768 b illion in discretionary funds though it did not assume that congress would approve the shift of accrual funding as result without the 9 billion for accrual accounting the house ended up marking up appropriations bills with 9 billion less than the senate eventually this contributed to deadlock and none of the appropria tions bills except for defense and military construction have been enacted treatment of 10 billion contingency fund for global counterterrorism how to treat the 10 billion that the ad ministration requested as an unallocated contingency for war costs was matter of ongoing discussion on may 22 the house approved hres 428 the rule gove rning debate on the fy2002 supplemental appropriations bill hr 4775 which includes provision deeming the budget resolution as passed by the house to be in effect for purposes of subsequent house action on appropriations and other funding bills appropriators wanted the deeming language amended to allow the appropriations committee to remove the reserve fund designation for the continge ncy funding thus letting the committee use the 10 billion as it decided in the face of objections from some conservatives however the house leadership did not agree and the deeming language refers to the measure as passed by the house on march 20 the debate over treatment of the 10 billion contingency fund for war costs played out further in congressional action on the defense authorization bill the house armed services committee approved th 10 billion in separate bill hr 4547 the cost of war against terrorism aut horization act and used part of the money in that bill to finance programs that otherwise would have been included in the regular authorization bill see below for full discussion in the end however the conference agreement on the defense authorization bill approved the 10 billion as requested as an unallocated continge ncy fund for costs of the war against terrorism that amount was not appr opriated however the appropriations committees did not act on the 10 billion tingency request at all though funding for counterterrorism activities may be ddressed next year in suppl emental appropriations measure appropriations action the house version of the defense ppropriations bill hr 5010 approved on june 27 provided 3547 billion for defense activities it covers excluding military construction programs department of energy defenserelated activities and defense related activities of some other agencies this was 121 billion below the amounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs6 requested of which 10 billi on was the counterterrorism contingency amount the additional 21 bi llion reduction in defense was then available for other appropriations bills including the military construction bill which was 541 million above the request and the energy and wa ter bill which incl udes defenserelated programs the senate version of hr 5010 approved on august 1 provided 3554 billion 114 billion below the request th conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill provide s 2551 billi on 116 billion below the request see table c2 in the appendices for details key issues in congress along with negotiations bout the overall level of fense spending there was considerable debate in c ongress about priorities with in the budget and about number of specific programs the most contentious issue was whether to permit concurrent receipt of military retired pay and veterans disa bility benefits the house authorization bill included provision to pha in partial concu rrent receipt the senate bill included measure approved on the floor to provide immediate full concurrent receipt the white house statement of administration policy on the senate bill threatened to ve to any bill that includes eith er partial or full concurrent receipt the conference agreement on th defense authorization bill provides benefit payment only to military retirees with disability determined to be caused by combat or combatrelated injury another major issue emerged at the begi nning of may on the eve of the house armed services committee markup of the fense authorization bill when the committee received word that the office of the secretary of defense osd had decided to terminate the army crusader selfpropelled artillery program the committee did not agree to end the prog ram however and it included full funding for the crusader in the bill that passed the full house subsequently however as work on defense funding bills proceeded c ongress agreed to terminate the program though it added money for new artillery system that the administration had not requested major issue in the senate debate over the authorization bill was the level of funding for missile defense the senate armed services committee reduced requested missile defense rd funds by more than 800 million freeing up funds for among other things increased shipbuilding eight republicans on the committee voted against reporting the bill several citing the missile defense cut as the reason in floor action however th senate voted to allocate 8143 million in anticipated inflation savings either to missile defense or to counterterrorism other major issues over the course of the year included provisions concerning environmental l imitations on military training missile defense f unding and management and nuclear wea pons development and testing the following discussion provides an overview of major elements of the administrations request nd of congressional action to date with particularly controversial items highlightedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs7 counterterrorism funding the administration requested tota l of 194 billion in the fy2003 defense budget for costs of the global campaign agai nst terrorism of the total 10 billion was requested as an unallocated rese rve for future as yet unplanned military operations and the remaining 94 billion was requested for specified activities all of the money and an additional 700 million to support programs identified in the administrations nuclear posture review wa s requested to be appropriated to the defense emergency response fund derf transfer account from which money would then be allocated to operating accounts of the services this would allow the defense department consider able flexibility in using the money since funds can be shifted to different activities without going through normal reprogramming procedures the counterterrorism am ounts requested for fy2003 are to carry on activities that were financed in fy2001 and fy2002 mainly through emergency supplemental appropriations last autumn congress ppropriated 40 billion for responding to the terrorist attacks of september 11 of which 171 billion was devoted to defense programs on march 21 2002 the administr ation sent congress request for an additional 271 billion in fy2002 supplemental appropriations for responding to the terrorist attacks of which 140 billion was fo r defense on july 23 the house and on july 24 the senate pproved conference agreement on bill providing 288 billion in supplemental appropriations for fy2002 of which145 billion is for defense of the total in the bill 51 billion was appropria ted as contingent emergency funding which requires the pr esident to designate the funds as an emergency before it is made available the white house has announced that it does not intend to designate the funds as an emergency however of the 51 billion that will not therefore be ava ilable 983 million is for defense for full discussion see crs report rl31406 supplemental appropriations for fy2002 combating terrorism and other issues by amy belasco and larry nowels congressional action none of the congressional defense committees agreed to provide the 94 billion requested for specific counte rterrorism programs in the derf instead all the committees llocated funding to regular operating and acquisition accounts in the authorization nd appropriations bills all the committees also reduced funding for combat air patr ols and for some other programs requested in the derf in the end congress did not provide th 10 billion requested as an unallocated contingency fund though it may provide part or all of th amount requested next year in supplemental appropriations measure the house armed services committee considered the 10 billion in separate b ill hr 4547 in preliminary markup of the bill on may 1 the committee allocated 36 billion to specific programs later that amount was reduced to 31 billion all but about 200 million of that amount is for programs the administration requested as part of the 94 billion in specifically allocated counterterrorism money in effect the committee freed up about 3 billion of funds for other programs in the regular authorization bill by using some of the 10 billion in the unallocated contingency f und for counterterro rism projects that otherwise would have been finan ced in the regular authorization httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs8 the senate armed services committee authorized the full 10 billion in general provision section 1003 of its version of the authorization bill the provision authorized the full 10 billion fo r continuation of the war on terrorism subject to specific reque st for the funds and to subsequent appropriations on july 3 after considerable proddi ng from congress the administration submitted formal budget amendment revisi ng its request for the 10 billion the administration did not provide significantly more detail on the allocation of the funds however instead the revised re quest would authorize the secretary of defense to transfer the 10 billion to various dod appropria tions accounts 15 days after notifying congress of the transfer the letter accompanying the request estimated that up to 255 billion would be for military pers onnel accounts up to 557 billion for operation and maintenance accounts including the defense health program and overseas humanitarian disaster and civic aid military construction or working capital funds and up to 188 b illion for appropriations for procurement or research development the full text of the request is available electronically at httpw3accessgpogovusbudg etfy2003pdf15dod_amendpdf on july 18 the house armed services committee marked up and reported revised version of hr 4547 it provided 31 billion allocated to specific programs with another 69 billion in very broad cat egories the house took up the bill under suspension of the rules late in the evenin g of july 23 and the bill was passed on july 24 taken together the regular defense authorization bill hr 4546 and the cost of war against terrorism authorization hr 4547 as passed by the house authorized 3928 billion for national defense in the end however congress did not approve the house armed services committees effort to use part of the tingency fund for war costs to finance an increase in other defense programs the conference report on the defense authorization bill provides 10 billion as an unallocated reserve for war costs as requested and as in the senate version of the bill more importantly the disposition of the 10 billion requested for counter terrorism ultimately depended on what happened in appropriations bills the conference report on the defense appropriations bill does not provide any of the money and the appropriations committees did not take up separate legislation to provide additional funding for the war on terrorism personnel pay and benefits the administration request included 41 pay raise for military personnel additional selective pay increases for midg rade personnel that could increase their pay raise to 65 the extension of special pays and bonuses to bolster retention of personnel with critical skills and continued incremental increases in the basic allowance for housing intended to eliminat outofpocket offbase housing costs by fy2005 congressional action pay raises

house and the senate armed services committees approved the administrations proposed pa and benefits increases and the authorization conference report provides th full 41 pay raise and other targeted pay increases as requested number of significant pe rsonnel related issues emerged however the major issue concerned concurrent recei pt of retirement and disability benefits other issues included house cuts in funding for health benefits accrual and house and senate increase in authorized active duty military endstrength concurrent receipt of retirement and disability benefits under current law military retirees who leave after 20 years or more of service are eligible for payments from the veterans administration va for serviceconnected disabilities but their military retirement pensions are reduced by the amount of disability benefits received individua ls who qualify often accept the disability benefits however because va disability payments are not taxed while pensions are veterans organizations have long argu ed that individuals should be able to receive both full retirement pensions and va disability benefits without any offset last year congress approved measure to pha in partial concurrent receipt as in the house plan this year but it was contingent on the administration taking steps to fund the measure and the administrati on did not do so this year concurrent receipt was critical issue both in the house and in the senate the housepassed authorization bill approved plan to phase in measure that would allow military re tirees with disability of 60 or greater to r eceive both disability benefits and retirement pensions allowing phased in partial concurrent receipt as in the house bill would cost an estimated 516 million in fy2003 58 billion over the five years from fy 2003 through fy2007 and 17 billion over ten years through fy2012 these amounts would be scored not as discretionary funding in the defense bills but as mandatory spending coming either from mainly from the military retirement trust fund the measure would also require an increase in contributions to the military retirement fund to cover the accrual cost of the increased benefits payable in the future to current military pers onnel the house measure provides that the accrual payments will be made from the general treasury however rather than from discretionary funds in the defense budget including both increased payments to retirees and payments from the general fund into the military retirement fund the congressional budget office estimates that the total budget cost of the house plan would be 11 billion in fy2003 88 billion over the five years fy2003fy2007 and 226 billion over the next ten years through fy20121 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs10 the senate armed services committee included similar phased in partial measure in its reported bill but the committee also voted to offer an amendment on the floor that would immediately allow full c oncurrent receipt of disability and retired pay regardless of the level of disability senators levin and warner brought up that amendment on the floor on june 19 and it wa s approved by voice vote the senate passed measure did not insulate the defens department from the accrual costs of the increased benefits as the house measure did cbo estimated that the senate version of concurrent receipt would cost 43 billion in fy2003 258 billion over the next five years and 610 billion over the next ten years of those amounts the defense department would have to provide 11 billion in fy2003 25 billion over the next five years and 64 billion over the next n years in its budget to cover accrual payments for its current military personnel for full discussion of the budget issues see crs report rs21327

administration policy on the senate authorization bill available at httpwwwwhitehousegovomblegislativ esap1072s2514shtml the white house threatened to veto the defense author ization if it provided for either partial or full concurrent receipt the defense department also threatened veto in the package of appeals of provisions in the h ouse and senate authorization bills that it sent to the armed services committees on july 24 and in letter that secretary of defense rumsfeld sent to senator vin and senator warner on september 24 the dispute over concurrent receipt held up conference agreement

benefit fo r retirees who are determined to have disability caused by combat or combatrelated injury payments would be made to all retirees with disability of 10 or greater resulting from an injury or wound for which the retiree was awarded purple heart payments would also be made to retirees with disability of 60 or more resulting from combatrelated activities which include injuries received as direct result of armed conflict while engaged in hazardous service while performing duty under conditions simulating war or through an instrumentality of war as explained by the bill managers on the house floor on november 12 see congressional record pp h85368537 injuries caused by instrumentalities of war include an injury cause by mine accidents during combat or sickness caused by fumes gas or

services has requested an increase of personnel endstrength recently with army seeking the largest increment of as many as 40000 additional soldiers over the next few years secretary rumsfeld has resisted increases however arguing repeat edly that added pe rsonnel would be very expensive over the long term and that m easures should instead be taken to reduce demands on the force httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs12 it was not clear whether the house armed services committee intended the endstrength increase to be temporary measure related to the war against terrorism or permanent addition to the force once fully phased in an increase of 12552 in endstrength would cost more than 1 billion year in the personnel accounts see table 4 with additional costs required in

active duty endstrength by 12000 senator cleland called for an increase of 40000 service members over the next five years the defense departments package of appeals on the authorizati on opposed any increase in endstrength the house appropriations committee did not approve an increase in end strength arguing that requirements are uncertain the committee report said that any increase that might be needed in fy2003 should be addressed in supplemental appropriations request the senate ppropriations committee also did not approve an increase in endstrength the appr opriations conference report does not include funds for an overall increase in endstrength the conference agreement on the defense authorization bill does not include an increase in endstrength in report language conferees said that an increase is needed but that the appropriations bill did not provide enough money the conference agreement also allows the secretary of defense to increase endstrength by up to 3 above the authorized level standing law had allowed 2 increase and it gives the military service secretaries independent authority to increase endstrength by up to 2 the agreement also establishes floor on endstrength equal to the requested levels and it repeals measure that allowed the secretary of defense flexibility to reduce endstrength belo w authorized levels army modernization the armys modernization plan involve s three overlapping initiatives one to upgrade and recapitalize the existing legacy force of heavy armored forces second to build new more easily deployab interim brigade combat teams and third to develop the objective force of the future httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs13 key elements of legacy force modernization include upgrading existing weapons with digitized communications links nd new surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities the most controversial elements of the plan have been the comanche helicopter which has experienced repeated development delays and cost increases and the crusader artillery system the central element of the interim force is new light armored vehicle recently named the stryker cong ress has supported the inter im force concept although there has been some debate about the charact eristics of the armored vehicle in the past the issue was whether it should be tracked vehicle in stead of the wheeled system the army has selected more recently the issue has been whether the new vehicle will be transportabl on c130 airlift aircraft the key element of the objective force is the future combat system which is an integrated suite of capabilities including new armored systems and also improved communications intelligence and surveillance capabilities the armys fy2003 budget request includes funds to accelerate fcs development congressional action congress has genera lly supported the armys modernization plan including plans for the interim combat brigade teams and development of the future combat sy stem but several issues have been contentious including funding for the crus ader artillery system and for some army helicopter programs crusader artillery system one of the most contentious issues in the defense budget this year was the fate of the crusader selfpr opelled artillery system advocates of defense transfor mation have long been critical of the program arguing that the 40ton system is not readily depl oyable supporters of the system responded that the weight has been reduced substantially and that the system was needed to allow artillery to keep up with rapidly moving armored forces on the battlefield on the eve of the house armed services co mmittee markup of the defense authorization bill deputy secretary of defense wolfowitz informed committee members that dod was ordering the army to prepare an analysis of alternatives to the crusader within 30 days step toward canceling th 11 billion program dod officials later confirmed that secretary rumsfeld intended to terminate the project the crusader had considerable suppor t in congress however in the authorization markup the house armed services committee provided the full 4756 million for crusader rd that was in the administrations febr uary budget request the committee also included language in its report on the bill though not in the statutory language of the measure that prohibits cut in funding until after more extensive formal analysis of alternatives was completed which likely would not be until april 2003 this prompted the white h ouse to threaten presidential veto of any bill if it included any statutory pr ovisions limiting the administrations ability to cancel the program the rules committee did not permit any floor amendments to reduce crusader funding when it marked up its version of the

the house appropriations committee agreed to terminate the crusader progra m and to fund the alternatives that the administration proposed in its may 29 budget amendment but the committee also said that development of an alternative indirect fire system must be coupled with development of an appropriate platfo rm to carry new cannon th committee therefore added 173 m illion to develop platform

approach th at the air force proposed for future c17 procurement sets precedent that would erode dod policies designed to promote longterm fiscal discipline in the past dod typically requested enough money to procure specific number of fu lly equipped enditems funding requested for 15 c17 aircraft for example would be sufficient to buy 15 deployable aircraft this year however the air force request ed only enough money to finance progress payments on new 5year contract for multiyear procurement of the aircraft the effect is to reduce amounts requested early in the multiyear contract and increase costs in the later years this is technically at odds with longstanding dod policy which calls for full funding of the cost of endite ms being requested in any given year and it is the first time significant breach of the full funding policy has occurred in an area apart from navy shipbuilding for an exte nsive discussion see crs report rl31404 defense procurement full funding policy backg round issues and options for congress by ronald orourke and stephen daggett the house armed services committee approved the requested c17 procurement profile but warned dod agains t using this funding approach in the future the house appropriations committee rejected the air force approach and required the air force to use c17 funding in fy2004 to procure complete aircraft the committee also instructed the defense department to restructure future funding plans for the c17 to use full funding the senate ppropriations committee specifically rejected the air forces incremental fundi ng approach and instead added 5859 million to finance the full cost of pr ocuring 15 aircraft the appropriations conference agreement ma ndates full funding of the c17 as in the senate bill it adds 5859 million for full funding in fy2003 nd it retains house language instructing the air force to request full funding in the future tanker aircraft leasing last year the conference report on the defense appropriations bill included provision allowing the air force to pursue negotiations with the boeing corporation to lease ta nker aircraft for tenyear period the provision was structured so th at the aircraft would be returned to the manufacturerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs23 after the lease expired as result the l ease is considered an operating lease rather than leasepurchase agreem ent so that only the annual cost of actual payments on the lease would be scored in the ai r force budget on yeartoyear basis otherwise the full cost of the contract woul d have to be scored in the years when the money would be obligated boeing has ffered to lease 100 767 aircraft as tankers senator mccain and some ot hers have objected to th leasing provision arguing that it will cost the government more in the long run than simply procuring additional tanker aircraft both the office of mana gement and budget and the congressional budget office have prepared analyses which project considerably higher costs for leasing than for regular procurement the text of the cbo letter is available electronically at ftpftpcbogov34xxdoc 3413tankerspdf mitch daniels the director of omb has criticized the plan insisting that it will be cheaper either to buy new tankers or to reengine ol der aircraft in its markup of the defense authorization bill the senate armed services co mmittee approved an amendment proposed by senator mccain that would require congress to authoriz and appropriate funds for any tanker lease agreement in floor action on the defense appropriations bill however senator mccain offered but then withdrew similar amendment recently the air force has reported that it is very close to reaching an agreement with boeing on the tanker leases the appropriations conference agreement provides 3 million for the tanker lease program in operation and maintenance air force the agreement also includes general provision section 8117 th at provides that payment for tanker leases may be made one year in adva nce and that permits funds either for procurement of aircraft or for operation nd maintenance to be used for the leases on october 16 senator mccain made floor statement th at was strongly critical of the leasing provisions in the conference report congressional record pp s10519 10520 the authorization conference report in cludes provision section 133 revising senator mccains amendment the re vised provision prohibits the leasing agreement unless funds have been specifica lly authorized and appropriated for the program or unless reprogramming

in the year the program was under review because the cost growth violated nunnmccurdy cost cap provisions dod decided to c ontinue the program however though its status remains matter of concern ther continues to be extensive debate in congress about the status of the nationa l missile defense program which the administration has tried to accelerate nd about spacebased systems like the sbl congressional action the house armed services committee generally supported the administrations request the committee reduced funding for the abl now funded under the title airbased boost defense by 775 million on the premise that second test ai rcraft that was included in the request may not yet be needed that judgment was disputed in house floor action on the defense appropriations bill discussed below the committee distributed the savings to number of other missile defense programs the house armed services committee also refused to fund patr iot pac3 or medium extended air defense system meads development in the army budget as requested but instead shifted the money back to the missile defense agency during the house armed services committee markup representative spratt offered an amendment to reduce funding for the sbl and for spacebased kinetic interceptor development and to transfer the savings to the pac3 and arrow theater missile defense programs the amendment was defeated in the committee on the floor the house approved an alternative ffered by representative hunter to add funds for pac3 and arrow to be finan ced from funds available to the missile defense agency but without specifyin g the offsetting source of funds in committee markup representative spra tt also offered an amendment to prohibit deployment of nuclear tipped interceptor missiles for missile defense which was rejected on the floor the rules committee did not make in order an amendment on the issue but representative spratt offered motion to recommit the bill to committee with instructions to prohibit nuclear interceptor development and that motion was defeated the senate armed services committee re duced overall missile defense funding by 8143 million see table 9 for detailed tabulation of funding prompting several republicans on the committee to vote against reporting the bill most of the reductions were in systems gineering and other support activ ities which the committee argued are not adequately justif ied in support material provided by dod this became major issue on the senate floor the senate armed serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs26 committee also reduced abl funding by 135 million and sbirshigh funding by 100 million in addition the committee approved seve ral provisions designed to require stricter oversight of missile defense pr ograms and adherence to more traditional acquisition procedures in the developmen t programs one provision would require the independent director of operational test and eval uation to conduct an annual assessment of specific missile defense pr ograms another provision requires the secretary of defense to provi annual schedule and cost timates for major elements of the program to congress on june 12 secretary rumsfeld send at letter to senator levin opposing the senate armed services committee reduction in missile defense funding and objecting to the committees provisions regarding acquisition procedures the committees measures said rumsfeld would impose number of burdensome statutory restrictions that would under mine our ability to manage the program effectively the secretary said he would recommend veto if final authorization bill includes either the sena cuts in missile defense funding or the senate provisions regarding management of the program ombs june 19 statement of administration policy repeated the veto threat on june 26 the senate approved an am endment offered by senator warner with second degree amendment by senato r levin to restore some or all of the missile defense funding that the committee cut the amendment would permit the president to allocate up to 8143 million of an ticipated inflation savings either to missile defense or to count erterrorism programs th levin amendment stipulates that priority should be given to counterte rrorism the senate did not consider any measures to revise committee provisions on program management also on june 26 the senate approve d an amendment proposed by senators feinstein and stevens to prohibit devel opment or deployment of nuclear armed interceptors for missile defense this measure is similar to the spratt amendment that the house turned down the house appropriations committee made number of changes in requested missile defense funding the committee deni ed funding for navy seabased terminal defense replacement for the terminated navy area defense program saying that dod had not presented plan for using the research funds the committee also denied funding for the russianamerican observation satellite program ramos because the russian government has not yet responded to us proposal to implement the program the committee said it would revisit the issue in conference if the two governments sign an agreemen t the committee also cut funding for sea based and spacebased boos t phase defenses saying that requested large increases in funding were not justified in view of re quirements for near term programs like the pac3 system the committee added 30 milli on for additional pac3 testing and required report on planned testing of the theater high altitude area defense thaad system httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs27 in floor action the house approved an amendment by representative spratt to reduce funding for the spacebased kinetic interceptor program by 30 million and shift the funds to the airborne laser program the senate appropriations committee largely followed the senate authorization bill in general provisi on it provided an additional 8143 million for missile defense or for counterterrorism programs offset by anticipated inflation savings the provision also itemized the programs to and amounts for which funds are to be restored should the president choose to allocate these funds to missile defense the appropriations conferen ce report provides most of what the administration requested for missile defense in all it reduced funding by 43 million it added 45 million for patriot pac3 procurement ffset by 25 million reduction in support funding and 70 million for the usisraeli rrow program it reduced funding for ramos but did not eliminate it as in the house bill the authorization conference report includes revised provisions governing management of missile fense programs it requires that dod submit annual reports to congress on performance goals and development baselines for each development block of each missile defe nse system as part of annual budget justification material it re quires yearbyyear funding profiles for each block of each system that could be fielded and it requires the defense departments joint requirements oversight counc il jroc which is chaired by the deputy chairman of the joint chiefs to provide to congress onetime review of cost schedule and performance criteria the ag reement also requires that dod provide lifecycle cost estimate for the theater high altitude area defense thaad program the senate had prohibited obligation of more than 50 of the money authorized for thaad until the report is submitted while the c onference agreement permits 85 to be obligated the conference report also requi res the director of the missile defense agency to provide reports to congress on each flight test of the groundbased mid course national missile defe nse system the authorization conference agreement drops provisions in the senate bill requiring annual jroc reviews of missile defense programs and operational ssessments of some programs by the director of operational test and evaluation the

restrictions on dod training the defense department has voiced in creasing concern in recent years about the effect on training of environmental re gulations shortly before the house armed services committee markup of the defense authorization bill the administration proposed legislation to exempt dod trai ning activities from the requirements of several environmental statutes ranging from the endangered species act to the clean air act congressional action the housepassed version of the authorization bill includes provisions exempting dod from or waiving application of the endangered species act the migratory bird treaty act and the wilderness act to areas used for military training exercises on the enda ngered species act section 312 of the house bill would allow dod to subs titute its own integrated natural resource management plan to protect endangered species rather than having installations designated as critical habitat dod w ould however still be prohibited from taking any actions that would harm endangered or threatened species in designating new critical habitats the bill would also require that the effect on national security as well as the economic impact must be considered section 311 of the house bill provides that in the case of m ilitary training activities dod would not be subject to th part of the migratory bird treaty act that designates certain types of activities as unlawful according to the committee report this provision was intended to permit dod to ca rry out military exercises even if they might unintentionally harm migratory birds the language adopted would exempt dod more broadly from any ac tivity deemed to be unlawful under the act the house bill also permits dod to conduct training activities and have emergency access to the utah test and training range despite the fact that portion of that range has been designated as wilderness area with certain restrictions on noise and disturbances the house bill also includes provisions that would designate several areas owned by the bureau of land management that are adjacent to the utah test and training range as wilderness areas although dods training activities in these areas would also not be covered by wilderness act restrictions for discussion of these and other provisions see crs report rl31456 defense cleanup and environmental programs authorization and

authorizes 20 million to allow the secretary of defense to acqui re lands adjacent to military in stallations to serve as buffer zone and provide add itional natural habitat areas for endangered species in areas where animals have moved to military installations as result of development the authorization conference report incl udes revised version of the house provision regarding the migratory bird tr eaty act the house provision would have altered the act to exempt military training from certain provisions the conference revision temporarily exempts training activities and requires the secretary of the interior to prescribe regulations to exempt dod the conference report does not include the house provision regarding the endangered species act but it include s without change the house provisions regarding the utah test and training range cap on military personnel in colombia under current law there is cap of 400 on the number of us military personnel who can operate in colombia the cap specifically excludes personnel serving diplomatic functi ons or performing emergency missions the house authorization bill included provision th at would establish cap of

appropriations measures the largest of which is the defense appropriations bill congress also acts every year on national defense authorization bill which authorizes programs funded in all of th regular appropriations measures the authorization bill addresses defense programs in almost precisely the same level of detail as the defens erelated appropriations and c ongressional debate about major defense policy and funding issues usua lly occurs mainly in action on the authorization because the defense authorization and appropriations bills are so closely related this repor t tracks congressional ac tion on both measures the annual defense appropr iations bill provides funds for military activities of the department of defense dod includi ng pay and benefits of military personnel operation and maintenance of weapons and facilities weapons procurement and research and development as well as for other purposes most of the funding in the bill is for programs administere d by the department of defense though the bill also provides 1 relatively small unclassified amounts for the central intelligence agency retirement f und and intelligence community management 2 classifi ed amounts for national fo reign intelligence activities administered by the cia and by other agenci as well as by dod and 3 very small amounts for some other agencies five ot her appropriations bills also provide funds for national defense ac tivities of dod and other agencies including the military construction appropriations bill which finances construction of military facilities and construction and operation of military family housing all administered by dod the energy and water development appropriations bill which funds atomic energy defense activities administered by the department of energy the vahudindependent agencies appropriations bill which finances civil defense activities administered by the federal emergency management agency activities of the selective

2001 and fy 2002 included the total increase in defense in the last year is the largest in inflationadjusted dollars since the vietnam war the administration projects continued growth in defense throug h fy2007 though at much more modest pace table b1 shows the long term tr end in defense spending under the administrations plan the large increase requested for defense has not been enough however to allay the concerns of defense advocates in c ongress in their view the budget is not adequate to accommodate needed increases in weapons procurement in the house several members threatened to vote agai nst the proposed budget resolution because it set aside 10 billion for defense in rese rve fund available only for costs of the global counterterrorism campaign the administration requested the 10 billion as an unallocated contingency fund for costs of counterterrorism operations in fy2003 but several members of the armed services committees both in the house and in the senate have said they woul d prefer using that money to increase spending on major weapons programs especially shipbuildinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs39 table b1 national defense budget function and

important complicating element in the fy2003 defense budget is series of changes in accounting for military and civilian personnel re tirement benefits most federal retirement benefits including benefits for uniformed military servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs40 members and dod civilian pers onnel have long been f unded on the basis of accrual accounting in which the cost of fu ture benefits for current employees is charged to the employing agency as the benefits are accrued under accrual accounting procedures federal agencies pay the actuarily determined cost of future benefits into fund payments to retirees are then charged to the fund not to the agency in the fy2003 and fy2004 defense budgets three substantial adjustments involving accrual accounting have large effect on budget totals these are accrual accounting for over65 health care benefits for uniformed personnel the fy2001 defense authorization act pl 106398 included provision known as tricareforlife that guarantees dodprovided h ealth care to 65andover military retirees and their dependents beginning in fy2003 these benefits are being funded on an accrual basis this results in 1 an increase of 81 b illion in fy 2003 in the military personnel accounts to reflect the accrual cost of future benefits for current uniformed personnel and 2 reduction of 56 billion in operation and maintenance accounts to reflect pa yment from the health care trust fund to dod for providing care to over65 retirees accrual accounting for all civilia n personnel retirement pension and health benefits while most federal civilian retirement benefits have been funded on an accrual basis small part has not been the administration has proposed funding all retirement benefits on an accrual basis in fy2003 the proposed change results in an increase of 34 billion both in budget authority and in outlays in the department of defense budget omb has adjusted fy2001 and fy2002 figures though not figures for earlier years to be comparable to the new proposed treatment of civ ilian retirement and health benefits thus omb fi gures include 30 billion in fy2001 and 32 billion in fy2002 department of defense budget totals both in budget authority and in outlays for increased civilian retirement accrual even though this accounting procedure was not in place in those years accrual accounting for under65 health care benefits for uniformed personnel beginning in fy2004 the administration is also proposing to finance h ealth care benefits for under65 military retirees on an accrual basis in which again dod would pay into fund the cost of future benefits for current employees and would receive reimbursement from the f und for costs of under65 retiree health care that it provides both the contributions to the fund and reimbursements from the fund are reflected in budget projections from fy2004 on table b2 shows the yearbyyear impact of these changes in accrual accounting on the defense

defense budget the cost of changes in accrual accounting is only one of number of socalled fact of life or must pay bills in the fy2003 defense budget much of the fy20022003 budget increase is taken up by accounting changes inflation pay raises changes in weapons cost estimates and costs of the global counterterrorism campaign rather than by increases in weapons investment dod comptroller dov zakheim has told congressional committees that such must pay bills leave less than 10 billion for new initiatives according to the defense department increased costs include 67 billion for inflation 27 billion for pay raises 81 billion for accrual payments for 65andover health care benefits for current uniformed pe rsonnel when they retire discussed above 33 billion for increased accrual payments to retirement accountsfor current civilian dod personnel also discussed above the omb estimate is 34 billion for fy2003 74 billion for what dod calls realis tic costing half for revised estimates of weapons costs includi ng the f22 fighter and already contracted navy ships and half for closer to full funding of projected operating costs andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs42 194 billion for counterterrorism including 10 billion in an unallocated contingency fund for c ontinuing the war and 94 billion for specific costs associated with ongoing operations in all this adds up to 475 billion in new costs but the total is offset by 93 billion in savings from procurement programs th at were in the fy2002 budget but are not in the fy2003 plan so an increase of almost 50 billion in the defense budget by this account still leaves relatively little available for new programs although the point is generally well ta ken some items are missing from the arithmetic for one thing dod is receivi ng 56 billion in payments from the retiree health care trust fund in fy2003 to cover co sts of providing services to 65andover retirees money it did not receive in fy 2002 also some counterterrorism costs were included in the fy2002 budget so the increased cost in fy2003 is 16 billion rather than 19 billion moreover omb budget figures though not some of the figures dod used in its early briefings on the budget show 32 billion in costs of civilian accrual accounting in the fy2002 budg et for purposes of comparison with the fy2003 request so the added cost in fy2003 is only 02 billion and finally substantial part of the 94 billion for sp ecifically allocated wa rrelated funding will go to procure material such as unma nned aerial vehicles uavs intelligence infrastructure and communications equipment that will be in the force for some time dod officials have said that at least 3 billion of the amount for counterterrorism is for wea pons procurement so in all the money available for new initiatives in fy2003 compared to fy2002 is more like 2025 billion not the whole of the defense budget in crease but still not insubstantial the impact of growing personnel and operating costs the impact of fact of life cost incr eases on the fy2003 budget is relatively large because of some special factors but it is by means unique table b3 compares the fy 2003 defe nse request with fy2002 estimated funding by appropriations title fairly common way of looking at the budget with comments on major reasons for some of the changes what stands out is how much of the large increase between fy2002 and fy2003 is goin g to military personne l and to operation and maintenance om rather than to proc urement or to research and development though as noted some procurement is being financed from warrelated funds requested in the operation and maintenance titlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs43 table b3 changes in requested national defense funding by appropriations title

those years and is pr oposed to begin in fy2003 reversing the procurement holiday one key issue in congressional debate about the defense budget has been whether the 70 billion or so requested fo r procurement in fy2003 or even the 99 billion projected for procurement in fy 2007 is enough to reverse what former secretary of defense william perry called the procurement holiday in defense budgets that followed the end of the cold wa r decline in new weapons purchases said perry in 1996 was justified in the early 1990s first because threats had declined second because many new weapons ordered in the 1980s had just entered the force and finally because older weapons were retired first as the size of the force declined so the average age of equipment was dropping even without new acquisitions but the holiday would have to end soon said perry in order to avoid creating an unaffordable bow wave of costs in the future to replace large numbers of rapidly aging weapons at the time the joint chiefs set 60 b illion per year for procurement by fy1998 as the goal target reached in the c linton administrations final budget for fy2001 in the years since perry laid out the argu ment however the deba has shifted now the issue at least among defense advocates is long er whether 60 billion year is adequate but rather how much mo re than 60 billion is needed to meet modernization needs much of the discussion has been shaped by series of studies of the amounts needed to sustain steady state procurement rate for major weapons ie howhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs47 3 daniel

in fy2003 and in future years does not appear sufficient despite large increases in the defense total to finance planned weapons procurement progra ms in the fy2003 request committee members have been especially critical of the shipbuilding budget which calls for procuring just five new ships assuming 35year service life for navy ships it would take an average of 85 new ships per year to maintain force of 300 ships in the fleet only in the later years of the fy20032007 defense plan does the shipbuilding rate reach the nominal steadystate replacement rate some argue that helicopters munitions and other progra ms are inadequately funded as well the procurement bow wave most recently there have been reports that dod has been discussing how to cope with substantial bow wave of procurement costs in fy2007 and beyond analytically bow wave refers to the normal pattern of funding for weapons programs the annual budget for any major acquisition program tends to grow as system moves from technology development to full scale engineering development to production then the acquisition cost will decline again as production winds down thus the shape of bow wave very large cumulative bow wave can develop if many new system s are scheduled to begin full production at about the same time this situation now appears to be facing the defense department at the end of the decade when number of new system s will be in production including the f22 and f35 joint strike fighter aircraft the comanche helicopt er and several newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31305crs48 4 remarks by the president at

new security environment both presiden t bush and secretary of defense rumsfeld have reaffirmed their commitment to tr ansformation in major policy speeches in recent months4 defense transformation has been defined in diverse ways however and the administration has been under some pressure from congress to articulate its definition more fully most recently using categories of transformation laid out in the quadrennial defense review that was released last september5 deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz gave rough estimate of the amount of money requested for transformationrelated initiatives in fy2003 and future years in testimony before the senate armed services committee on april 96 wolfowitz said the six specific transformation goals iden tified in the qdr are first to defend the us homeland and other bases of operation and defeat nuclear biological and chemical weapons and their means of delivery second to deny enemy sanctuary depriving them of the ability to run or hide any time any where third to project and sustain forces in di stant theaters in the face of access denial threats fourth to conduct effective operations in space fifth to conduct effective information operations and sixth to leverage our information technology to give our joint forces common operational picture in all wolfowitz said about 21 b illion is requested in fy2003 for such
