has come under scrutiny by some scientists legal scholars politicians and other experts gene patenting may raise ethical legal and economic issues short discussion of these issues follows patents the patent act of 1952 codified in title 35 of the united states code defines current patent law according to section 101 one who invents or discovers any new and useful process machine manufacture or any composition of matter or any new and useful improvement thereof ma obtain patent therefore subject to the conditions and requirements of this title to be patentable an inventi on must be useful novel and nonobvious the requirement of usefulness or utility is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides tangible benefit to be judged nove l the invention must not be fully anticipated by prior patent publi cation or other knowledge within the public domain nonobvious invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of competent artisan at the time the invention was made the invention must be fully described once the united states patent and trademark office uspto issues patent the owner enjoys the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invention generally the term of patent is 20 years from the date the application was f iled in the process of obtaining patent the information associated with the patent is published and made available to the public gene patents genes are chemical compounds and as suc h they qualify as compositions of matter with respect to patent criteria within the parameters of patentability delineated by the patent act there are several exceptions as interpreted by the cour ts products of nature preexisting substance that is found in the wild may not be

thus one cannot patent naturally occurring gene or protein as it exists in the body but one can patent gene or protein that has been isolated from the body and is useful in that form as pharmaceutical drug screening assay or other application2 research indicates that by 2005 20 of human genes were claimed by patents in the united states3 according to the us patent and trademark office as of the end of fy2007 over 49000 patents issued relate to genes includi ng method of use this practice of awarding patents on genes wh ile upheld by the c ourts has come under scrutiny and criticism by some scientists legal scholars and politicians the subject of gene patenting involves various ethical gal and economic components while not mutually exclusive short disc ussion of several issues follows ethical issues an often held belief is that gene patents permit outsiders ownership of another persons genetic makeup often without their knowledge or consent4 this concern has led to complaints that patients longer c ontrol their own bodies and doctors are being constrained from testing for various diseases5 professor lori andrews argues that patents hinder access to testing procedures because genepatent holders can control any use of their gene they can prevent doctor from testing patients blood for specific genetic mutation and can stop anyone from doing research to improve genetic test or to develop gene therapy based on that gene6 this perceived constraint on research and testing options is an issue to opponents of gene patents7 according to dr debra leonard patents on speci fic genetic information limits the medical use of the information and impedes or prevents widespr ead research on the disease the traditional pathway by which medical knowle dge is advanced and shared8

to utilize existing genetic tests because of patents instead they maintain it is financial issue associated with the cost of health care andor an issue of profits for the doctor or clinical geneticist wishing to administer tests patented by other inventors10 similarly professor iain cockburn found there is little quantitative evidence thus far of negative impact of patents on scientif ic research activity11 from his perspective the disclosure obligations of the patent system may be tter serve the objective of encouraging the diffusion of knowledge and raising social returns than the chief legal alternative trade secret protection12 legal issues some commentators argue that genes ar products of nature discoveries not inventions that do not meet the cr iteria necessary to obtain patent13 as stated by professor andrews the us eful properties of genes sequence are not ones that scientists have inve nted but instead are natural i nherent properties of the genes themselves14 the fact that the gene has been isolated is considered technicality by experts who subscribe to this position15 the courts have upheld gene patents if they meet the re quirements of the patent act according to some experts the w allows for patents on discoveries despite what is repeatedly asserted by the opponents of gene patenting patent law applies equally to discoveries as to inven tions in fact article 1 section 8 of the us constitution explicitly refers to discoveries as does the patent statute whoever invents or discovers any new and useful proc ess machine manufacture or composition of matter or any new and useful improvement thereof may obtain patent therefor emphasis added16 as bendekgey and hamletcox point out many biotechnology products are built upon compounds existing in nature

awarded by the uspto is concern for some experts study by professors jordan pa radise lori andrews and timothy holbrook found that 38 of the claims contained in 74 patents on human ge netic material were problematic19 this research indicated that utility issues were identified as the most prevalent problem followed by the required written description of the invention20 in another paper andrews also argues gene pa tents do not meet the criteria of non obviousness because through in silico analysis the function of human genes can now be predicted on the basis of thei r homology to other genes21 this analysis is not without criticism as questions have been raised regarding the authors definition of probl ematic that is based upon the authors perspectives rather than court decisions in addition the data include patents issued in the early 1990s when gene patenting was in its infancy and there was little expertise and experience on which to grant these patents22 such concerns over patent quality however are not limited to gene patents the debate over whether or not the uspto is too lenient in awarding patents is ongoing and is par ticularly intense as new industr ies develop and seek patents the patent process is one size fits ll activity leading to claims that certain technologies are not amenable to patenting or that patents granted do not meet the requirements of the pate nt act however as patent ex aminers build up expertise in new field and develop prior art the quality of patents typically increase23 economic issues biotechnology industry leaders perceive pa

licensing fees27 however despite what so experts claim to be negative result of financial considerations in the biomedical research community28 others maintain that at most gene patents prevent the doctors and clinical geneticists from performing these tests for profit or in way that competes with the patent holder without reimbursement to the inve ntors of those tests29 some analysts assert that certain patents particularly those on research tools30 in biotechnology hinder the innovation process professors rebecca eisenberg and richard nelson state that ownership of research t ools may impose significant transaction costs that result in delayed i nnovation and possible future litigation31 they argue that patents also can stand in th way of research by others broad claims on early discoveries that are fundamental to emerging fields of knowledge are particularly worrisome in lig ht of the great value demonstrated time and again in the history of science and t echnology of having many independent minds at work trying to advance field public science has flourished by permitting scientists to challenge and build upon the work of rivals32 professor arti rai argues th at the most

trained in th tradition of open science are likely to have the greatest social value if they are widely disseminated to researchers who are taking different approaches to different problems34 other commentators dispute thes assertions professor f scott kieff maintains that there was such norm regarding open sc ientific access as opposed to intellectual property protection in the basic biological science community35 h n t s t h t experience shows that patents on inputs generally do not prev ent the pr oducti on of outputs and that the availability of intellectual property protection has expanded the resources available in the biotechnol ogy community and led to its success36 bendekgey and hamletcox agree that there is evidence that gene patents have caused decrease in research as whole in the biomedical arena or in gene therapies37 study by professors john walsh ashi sh arora and wesley cohen found little evidence that work has been curtailed due to intellectual property issues associated with research tools38 scientists are able to continue re search by licensing inventing around patents going offshore the development and use of public database s and research tools court challenges and simply using the tec hnology without license ie infringement according to the authors private sector ow ners of patents permitted such infringement in academia with the exception of those associated with diagnostic tests in clinical trials partly because it can increase the value of the patented technology later analysis by professors walsh cohen and charlene cho concluded that patents do not have substan tial impact upon basic biomedi cal research and that none of their random sample of academics reported stopping research project due to anothers patent on research input nd only about 1 of the random sample of academics reported experiencing delay or modification in their research due to patents39 however obtaining tan gible research inputs eg actual materials appear to be more difficult because of competition cost and time issues40 as genes continue to be pa tented and research in the field of biotechnology proceeds the discussion surrounding the ethical legal and economic issues of gene patenting remains ongoing in the public policy arena
