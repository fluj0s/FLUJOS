in the annual legislative branch appropriations bill but rather is automatically funded annuallymajor funding trends guide to determining legislative budget trends interpretation of budget trends is determ ined primarily by three factors 1 selection of current or constant dollars to express budget authority constant dollars reflecting the impact of inflation 2 selection of budget authority contained in annual appropriations bills with or without permanent budget authority permanent budget authorit not requiring annual approval by congress and 3 selecti on of fiscal years to be compared note this discussion excludes fy2000 supplemental appropriations selection of current or constant dollars currentdollar data reflect actual budg et authority appropriated each year constantdollar data reflect the conversion of actual budget authority into equivalent 2000 dollars for example congress appropriated budget authority of 41793000 for the senate in fy1968 excluding permanent budget authority converted into 2000 dollars 41793000 is 204641586 when reviewing the 31year growth of the senate budget from fy1968fy2000 in current dollars the increase amounts to 8308 in constant dollars the increase is 901 the constantdollar figure indicates budget growth after the effects of inflation are neutralized selection of fiscal years differences also appear based on choice of fiscal years used to compare budgets for example comparison of budget growth fy19 68 and fy2000 shows these changes in total legislative budgets after adjustment for inflation fy1968fy2000 901 fy1972fy2000 130 and

through fy1973 year of significant implementation of the 1970 act was 645 the legislative budget during the 1970s also reflected implementation of the 1974 congressional budget and impoundment control act which created the house and senate budget committees and the congressional budget office also congress began to provide significant funding for its computer capabilities this growth in the
