5005 107th congress was debated his initial plan to give the dhs secretary exclusive authority through the secretary of state to issue or refuse to issue visas was thorny point the house select committee on homeland security approved compromise language on visa issuances in hr 5005 that retained doss administrative role in issuing visas but added specific language to ddress many of the

doss consular ffairs continues to issue visas signing of 2003 memorandum of unders tanding mou that implements the working relationship between dos and dhss three immigrationrelated bureaus sparked immediate debate some have expressed the view that dos retains too much control over visa issuances under th mou maintaining that the homeland security act intended dhs to be the lead department and dos to merely administer the visa process proponents of dos play ing the principal role in visa issuances assert that only consular officers in the field have the country specific knowledge to make decisions about whether an alien is admissible and that staffing 250 diplomatic and consular posts around the world w ould stretch dhs beyond its capacity whether the visa security procedures are

108th congress oversees the implementation of the act va ried viewpoints are discussed belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32256crs8 as announced on june 6 2002 the administrations proposal for homeland security department would have included ins among the agencies transferred to new homeland security depar tment the stated goal of the administrations proposal was to consolidate into single federal department many of the homeland security functions performed by units within various federal agencies nd departments the administration would have placed all functions of ins under the border and transportation security division of the pr oposed department the narrative of the june 6 2002 plan did not go into details however it appeared that under the plan consular affairs in the depa rtment of state would have retained its visa issuance responsibilities this proposal precipitated considerable discussion on where the visa issuance should be located option locating all functions in dhs voices in support of moving consular affairss visa issuance respons ibilities to the proposed dhs asserted that consular officers emphasize the promoti on of tourism commerce and cultural exchange and are lax in screening foreign nationals who want to come the united states media reports of the visa expre ss that dos established in saudi arabia to allow travel agents to prescreen nonimmigrants raised considerable concern especially reports that several of the september 11 terrorist s allegedly entered through visa express critics argued that visa issuance was the real front line of homeland security against terrorists nd that the responsibility for this function should be in department that did not have competing prio rities of diplomatic relations and reciprocity with foreign governments some argued that keeping the ins ad judications and consular affairs visa issuances in different departments woul d perpetuate the ty pes of mistakes and oversights that stem from inadequate coordination and competing chains of command most importantly they emphasized the need for immigration adjudications and visa issuances as well as immigration law enforcement and inspections activities to be under one central authority that has border security as its primary mission option locating functions in different agencies proponents of retaining visa issuances in consular affairs asserted that only consular officers in the field would have the country specific knowledge to make decisions about whether an alien was admissible and that staffing 250 diplomatic and consular posts around the world would stretch the proposed hom eland security partment beyond its capacity they also pointed out that unde r current law consul ar decisions are not appealable and warned that transferring this adjudication to homeland security might make it subject to judicial appeals or other due process considerations the mrv fees as some point out have become an important funding stream contributing almost 10 of dos total budget they ma intained that the problems consular affairs evidenced in visa issuances have already been addressed by strengthening provisions in the usa patriot act p l 10756 and the enhanced border security and visa re form act pl 107173 those who supported retained immigrant ad judications and services in doj and visa issuances in dos point to the specializations that each department brings to the functions they asserted that the dual check system in which both ins and consular affairs make their own determinations on whether an alien ultimatelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32256crs9 enters the united states provides greater security proponents of the joint dojdos responsib ilities argued that failures in intelligence gathering and analysis not lax enforcement of immigration law were the principal factors that enabled terrorists to obtain visas others opposing the transfer of ins adjudications and consular affairs visa issuances to dhs maintained that dhs would be less likely to balance the more generous elements of immigration law eg the reunification of families the admission of immigrants with needed skills the protection of refugees opportunities for cultural exchange the facilitation of trade commerce and diplomacy with the more restrictive elements of the law eg protection of public health and welfare national security public sa fety and labor markets homeland security act representative dick armey majority leader and chair of the select committee on homeland security introduced the pr esidents proposal as hr 5005 the homeland security act of 2002 hr 5005 would have transferred all of the functions of ins to the newly created partment under its border security and transportation division as introduced hr 5005 would have bifurcated visa issuances so that dhs would set the polic ies and dos would reta in responsibility for implementation during the week of july 8 2002 the house committees on judiciary international relations and government all approved language on visa issuances that retained doss administrative role in issuing visas but added specific language to address many of the policy and national security concerns raised during their respective hearings breaking with the administration the house judiciary committee approved language that would ve placed much of inss adjudication and service responsibilities including its role in approving immigrant petitions with new bureau of citizenship and immigration services headed by an assistant attorney general at doj when the house select committee on homeland security marked up hr 5005 on july 19 2002 it approved language on immig rant processing and visa issuances consistent with the house judiciary committee recommendations as reported hr 5005 clarified that the secretary of dhs would have issued regulations regarding visa issuances and would have assigned st aff to consular posts abroad to provide advice and review and to c onduct investigations and that consular affairs would have continued to issue visas it would have further expanded the exclusion authority of the secretary of state by permitting the secretary to exclude an alien when necessary or advisable in the foreign policy or security interests of the us giving the secretary of stat an authority even broader than that in law before the 1990 immigration amendments reformed the grounds for exclusion it also would have clarified that decisions of the consular officers are not reviewable during the floor debate on hr 5005 only one

will also be responsible for establishing visa validity periods and fees based on reciprocity in the case of visa validity periods however he will consult with homeland security before lengthening them and homeland security will have authority to determine that certain persons or classes of persons cannot benefit from the maximum validity period for security reasons the secretary of state will

current issues competing concerns some have expressed the view that dos retains too much power and control over visa issuances under the mou they maintain the homeland security act intended dhs to be the lead department and that dos was to merely administer the visa process they warn that consular officers are too cerned about facilitating tourism and trade to scrutinize visa applicants thoroughly some argue that visa issuance is the real front line of homeland security against terrorists and that the principal responsibility should be in dhs which does not have competing priorities of diplomatic relations and reciprocity with foreign governments others have indicated satisfaction with the mou arguing that it strikes the proper balance between the tw departments and reflects the bifurcation envisioned in the act they maintain that it plays off the strengths of the two departments and allows for refinement of the implementation in the future28 proponents of dos playing the lead role in visa issuances assert that only consular officers in the field have the countryspecific knowledge to ma ke decisions about whether an alien is admissible and that staffi ng 250 diplomatic

funding data are not available the question of whether dhs and dos are adequately funded to process visas expeditiously while maintaining visa secu rity procedures may arise as the fy2005 budget is debated the modest size of the office of international affairs with 90 ftes has led some to questi on how many visa security re views and investigations it will be able to realistically handle some

has raised concerns on the other hand past use of the immigration examinations fee29 for investigations by the office of international affairs has been called into question by those who think it should be so lely used for uscis adjudications and services
