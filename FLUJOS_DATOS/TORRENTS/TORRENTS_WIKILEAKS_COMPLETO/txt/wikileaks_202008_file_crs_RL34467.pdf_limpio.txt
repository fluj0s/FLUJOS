sacquisitions congressional interest going forward is likely to focus on the proposed merger between delta airlines and northwest air lines although structured legally as an acquisition delta is the acquirer in the combination and the ceo of delta would manage the combined firm the proposal is most clearly viewed as merger it is widely believed in the aviation community that this merger could be the first of several in the industry press speculation for example focused until recently on possible united and continental comb ination as competitive response2 although unitedcontinental agreement failed united is continuing merger talks with us airways future proposed mergers will so likely be of interest to congress the authority to recommend approval or disapproval of airline mergers rests entirely with doj the ost makes recommendations to doj based on its evaluation of the effect of proposed merger on ai rline industry competition congress has specific statutory role in the airline rger review and appr oval process having legislatively charged the executive branch with that task members of congress can and do file statements with doj expressing their view of proposed merger during previous merger discussions individual members of congress have taken positions both for and against proposed mergers hearin gs have been held and some legislation has been introduced and considered for the most part however merger related legislation has not been enacted especially visavis specific merger proposal this does not mean however that congressiona l opinions about mergers do not matter historical perspectives s figure 1 shows airline mergers and acquisitions began occurring in the early to mid1980s during that period many of the socalled local service carriers of the regulated era such as ozark republic southern and psa were combined into larger airlines second wave of consolidation occurred in the later 1980s at least in part driven by the leveraged buyout lbo phenomena the effects of the first persian gulf war which depressed international airline travel for the first time in post world war ii history put an end to most consolidation discussions at least for time since then merger activity has been sporadic with some not able activity around the beginning of the new century significant combinati on in 2005 and the now proposed merger of delta and northwest during the 1980s most congressional interest in mergers seems to have been focused on service issues and on insuring that airline employees were fairly treated as firms were acquired andor combine d some members of congress expressedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34467crs3 3 anderson richard and steenland doug some myths about airline mergers the wall street journal april 16 2008 p a19their views on many of the combinations of that time period congressional concern was also expressed about how the merger approval process wa s exercised at the federal level many felt that the reagan administration dot was too friendly to mergers approving at least two mergers that doj had questioned ultimately in response to these concerns congress acted to strip dot of its preeminent role in the merger approval pro cess and moved it to doj beginning in 1989 recent merger discussions between 2000 and the end of 2007 there were three significant mergeracquisiti on proposals two americans acquisition of twa 2001 and america wests ac quisition of us airways 2005 were approved without major cong ressional opposition in each instance the airline being acquired twa and us airways was in significant financial difficulty and the acquisition was viewed by many as wa of preserving jobs and air service this was not the case for the may 2000 proposal by united to acquire us airways that proposal engendered cons iderable public opposition which was very much reflected by many members of cong ress the merger proposal had some novel features including proposal to create new airline based at reagan national airport and later link to the american and twa merger that were designed to deflect possible antitrust concerns related to the market power of combined united and us airways these proposals howev er were insufficient to ward off considerable concern about the anticompe titive nature of the proposed combination ultimately doj would reject the merger in july 2001 and united withdrew its offer congress played very active role in the consideration of the proposed unitedus airways merger although ther were individual mbers of congress who were in favor of the merger there seems to have been significantly more congressional opposition to the merger thes antimerger positions were especially apparent during several hearings held to examine the potential competitive effects of the merger although legislation blocking or otherwise altering the merger was passed several pieces of legislation that would have required these results were introduced and considered deltanorthwest executives of the merging carriers argue that this combination is necessary for competitive reasons in addition to creating the nations largest airline they believe the new airline will be more stable and be better able to grow to meet the challenges of the future in what they view as highly competitive world airline industry and difficult economic environment3 from their perspective the new combination which will keep the name delta will provi synergies that could reduce the firms operating costs by up to 1 billion from the costs that would be incurred by the two firms as separate entities as part of their merger they are promising not to close airport hubs reduce air service or fire large numbers of employees they are also suggesting numer ous other benefits th at are

find it hard to understand for example how firm that plans not to cut employees and close hubs will be able to come up with the cost savings stated above also the track record of airline mergers in the united st ates is spotty at best with some airline analysts believing that there has never been an indisputably successful merger in the industry4 even those who believe the merger might be positive question the likelihood that the transition from two airlin to one will be smooth for fliers and employees by pointing to the ongoing difficulties at us airways caused by merger related employee and infrastru cture integration issues5 approval of the merger is foregone c onclusion doj has stated its intention to closely examine the attributes of the merger and dot has begun its analysis of the competitive effects of the merger these reviews will likely take months to complete making it impossible to forecast when doj might announce its decision on the merger several members of congress including the chairman of house committee on transportation and infrastructure representative james oberstar and the chairman of tis subcommittee on aviati on representative jerry costello have reportedly expressed skeptic ism about the supposed positive aspects of the merger6 they have stated an intent to hold hear ings on the merger dditional congressional committees senate commerce senate judiciary and house judiciary are also expected to hold hearings on the issue airline bankruptciesfailures failure is normal feature of the us business system the failure of some firms however is more notable than for others this is the case for the airline industry in early spring 2008 four airlin filed for bankruptcy protection three skybus aloha and ata filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy have stopped flying and are in the process of liquidating frontier f iled for bankruptcy under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code and is to continue to operate while it attempts to reorganize all of these failures have attracted some level of congressional interest this is especially true for aloha which provided signif icant portion of hawaiis interisland transportation networkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34467 crs5 source crs analysis of various sources figure 1 selected airline mergers acquisitions and bankruptcies 19782007httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34467crs6 bankruptcy is far from rare in the airline industry it can almost be viewed as an accepted business practice as can be seen in figure 1 several major airlines have gone through multiple chapter 11 reorganizations since 1978 for example continental 1983 and 1990 us airway s 2002 and 2004 and america west which purchased us airways in 2005 1985 and 1991 in fact more than 150 airlines mainly startup firms not shown in figure 1 known in airline terminology as new entrants but also some well know n firms have filed for bankruptcy in the last 30 years in the vast majority of these cases the bankruptcy led ultimately to departure from the industry where ch apter 11 process ultimately led to successful reorganization the airline often looked very different from the airline that had filed for protection there is si ngle reason why airlines go bankrupt recessions fuel prices bad management d ecisions and labor problems can all play role unanticipated events like the firs t persian gulf war nd september 11 which led to significant declines in flying ve led straight to the bankruptcy court congressional interest in bankruptcy is generally focused on several issues primary among these is the loss andor prospective loss of air service at an airport in community or sometimes in region of immediate interest is the consumer fallout that accompanies bankruptcy filin g constituents who have been stranded or find they longer hold valid tickets frequently turn to congressional offices in search of redress also of interest to many members is the fate of airline industry employees employees may lose their jobs ve their salaries reduced or see their pensions eliminated or reduced the loss of airline pensions by former employees for example were major issue followi ng the round of airline bankruptcies that occurred after september 11 in some hub ai rline cities an airlines workforce can make up sizable portion of the local electorate congress does sometimes act to assist the airline industry in times of need most notably this occurred immediately after september 11 when congress passed the air transportation safe ty and system stabilizati on act atsa pl 10742 atsa provided immediate financial assistance and long term loans to the airlines to keep them operating atsa did not preclude bankruptcies but it arguably prevented additional airline failures beyond those that occurred anyway atsa as the event it responded to represented the extreme in terms of congressional response the more typical congressional response over time to airline bankruptcies could be characterized as disappointment combined with acceptance passenger rights issues recent incidents including passengers being held in aircraft for eight or more hours awaiting takeoff passe ngers being stranded by th shutdown of bankrupt air carriers as well as deteriorating airline ontime arrival performance have led to increasing interest in airline passenger consumer issues currently most passenger rights are set forth in the airlines contract of carriage language the contract of carriage is the legal contract between the airline and the ticket holder which describes the rights and responsibilitie s of both the air carrier and the passenger passengershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34467crs7 7 with the deregulation of aviation the airline contract of carriage took the place of rules tariffs that were under regulation adopted nd published by the airlines and that became effective upon civil aeronautics board approv for discussion of passenger rights tariffs under regulation see

law does provide procedures and compensation rule s for bumping and lost or damaged baggage9 the main power dot has to protect consumers is the departments power to take action against air ca rriers for deceptive trade prac tices the definition and interpretation of deceptive trade practices can significantly impact the scope of dots enforcement authority although airline deregulation was enacted 30 years ago some observers believe that some of the perceived protections of the regulated era should be reintroduced there are two major differences in the unregulated environment versus the regulated environment for air passenger transportation that are important to keep in mind when examining airline passenger issues first under regulation air carriers did not set their prices the civil aeronautics board cab did this meant that air carriers for the most part competed on service and freque ncy rather than price in addition with prices fixed by the cab interline agreem ents among airlines to accept each others delayed passengers were simple to manage because all the major carriers had very similar fare structures since deregulation nd especially with the advent of lowcost carriers as major players in the i ndustry the primary means of compe tition has become price not service second because the cab used cost plus basis for setting fares this encouraged air carriers to maintain si gnificant amount of extra capacity air carriers could have passenger load factors as low as 55 and still make money this meant that when there were flight delays or cancellations most carriers had seats available to accept transfers from other airlines in recent years air carriers have undergone period of intense price competiti on at the same time that fuel costs have risen rapidly most air carriers have responded by pursuing higher passenger load factors which are now often above 80 fo r some airlines and are even higher on some popular routes such high average passenger load factors mean that during flight delay or cancellation situations there may be limited available seats for transferred passengershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34467crs8 10 during the previous period of interest in passenger rights 19992001 pricing issues such as access to the lowest fares were also major focus of legislative efforts 11 see aid for stranded travelers by james bernstein newsday june 22 2007 ice pellets and passenger rights by abend flying v 134 july 2007 9295issues of congressional interest during congresss current considerati on of the reauthorization of the faa most of the interest in passenger righ ts has been focused on issues related to schedules and capacity flight cancellations delay and transfers between airlines10 under airline contracts of carriage consumers face major caveat many of passengers contractual rights regarding schedules and cancellations are limited to delays and cancellations that are under the c ontrol of the airlines all contracts of carriage have force majeure exclusions for events such as weather conditions war strikes and in some cases shortages of labor fuel and f acilities that cannot be reasonably anticipated by the airlines both the housepasse d and senatereported faa reauthorization bills include passenger rights provisions for summary of these provisions see crs report rl33920 federal aviation administration reauthorization an overview of selected provisions in proposed legislation passenger access to services on delayed aircraft and the right to deplane the treatment of passe ngers onboard delayed aircra ft is contractual not legislative and varies from air carrier to air carrier depending on the text of their contracts of carriage recent reports of pa ssengers being stuck in an aircraft that is stranded on the tarmac without access to ade quate food water and toilet facilities has led to calls for federal action to mitigate the impact of these situations on passengers options suggested include requiring the ai rlines to develop contingency plans to assure that passengers onboard needs are t during delays requiring airlines to set clear time frame under which they will be per mitted to deplane or mandating specific number of hours after which any passenger has the right to get off the aircraft11 the airlines oppose setting standa rd benchmark for the number of hours that passengers can be held on plane for variety of reasons they argue that most passengers would rather wait nd arrive late rather than have the flight cancelled and that being forced to return to the gate would likely be against the wishes of the majority of passengers they also point out that the most egregious incidents involve weather that impacts an entire airport making the deplaning of delayed plane passengers operationally difficult due to gates filled with other delayed aircraft and terminal waiting areas already crowded with passengers awaiting other departures delayed cancelled and diverted flights refunds and rerouting the refund and routing options as well as the amenities offered to passengers are also governed by the individual airlines contracts of carriage airline schedules are not guaranteed passenger options vary from airline to airline the consumer issues of recent interest include providing up front cancellation and delay statistics on flights and also the rebooking and transfer ability of tickets of delayed or cancelled flights in general passenger on can celled flight may request refund for the unused part of the ticket or accept the offer of seat on later flight of the ticketed airline there is federal requirement however that the airlines arrange for seat on different airline dela yed passengers may request tran sfer to different

cancellation fee on the original ticket or higher fare to make the change to transfer from one airlines flight to another airlines flight without paying full fare fo r the second airlines ticket passengers need to persuade the first airline to endorse the ticket to the second airline airlines generally will only ndorse tickets to or accept endor sed tickets from airlines with whom they have negotiated interline agreements regarding the treatment of transferred passengers in recent years the major airlines have narrowed the scope of their interline agreements often only negotiating them with their code share partners lowcost carriers generally do not have interline agreements even in cases where interline agreements exist making such arrangements is up to the airlines personnel on the scene some ar gue that the federal government should require airlines to accept transfers from other airlines delayed or cancelled flights however outside of regula ted environment others say this could be problematic especially given the differences between the fare structures of the lowcost and legacy airlines it also would mean that the or iginal ticketing airline would in effect be pricing the fare for seat on another airline12 honoring tickets of air lines that shut down the recent shutdown of ata airlines aloha airlines and skybus has raised the issue of whether operating airlines should honor the tickets of shut down carriers since november 2006 there has been requirement that airlines must honor the tickets of an airline that has ceased operations the aviation and tran sportation security act of 2001 pl 107 71 section 145 enacted november 19 2001 included provisions that required airlines providing service on route to pr ovide to the extent practicable service on that route to passengers tic keted by an air carrier that discontinued service on that route due to insolvency or bankruptcy pa ssengers had 60 days fro m the date of the suspension of service to make the tran sportation arrangements and the airline providing the service was allowed by dot to charge oneway fee of 25 the provision lapsed on november 30 2006 there has been some inte rest in

limited resources for its consumer protection responsibilities14 airline safety since the early days of commercia l aviation in the 1920s congress has maintained keen interest in the safety of airline operations over the past six years however congressional oversight of airline safety has not been as extensive largely because the airlines have maintained an impressive safety record during this period between 2002 and 2006 there were nine fa tal accidents involving commercial air carriers four of which involved passenger fatalities the acci dent rate over this period was roughly one fatal accident for every ten million hours flow n 001 fatal accidents per 100000 flight hours by co mparison decade earlier during the period from 1992 through 1996 fatal airline acci dents were occurring at rate of about one every 37 million flight hour s 0027 fatal accidents per 100000 flight hours thus the fatal airlin accident rate has been redu ced by factor of about 27 over the past decade preliminary data fo r 2007 indicate that it too was very safe year with fatalities among the 766 million passengers enplaned on aircraft that were flown cumulative total of more than 19 million flight hours15 despite these impressive statistics some aviation safety professionals and some members of congress have ex pressed concern that the i ndustry and regulators may have been lulled into complacency with regard to safety this concern has been heightened recently in response to various findings that airlines have failed to fully comply with aircraft inspections and repairs mandated by the faa16 congressional oversight and investigation of these inci dents have focused on the relationship between the faa and the airlines and the manner in which the faa carries out its mandate to regulate safety within the airline industry httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34467crs11 17 see 49 usc sec 44701 18 see 49 usc 44717faa authority by statute the faa has been given br oad authority to regulate

future accidents17 the faa issues operating certificates to air carriers that provide specific terms for ensu ring safety domestic air carriers and airlines operating as us flag carriers on international routes are governed by faa regulations codified in title 14 code of federal regulati ons part 121 and are therefore known among aviation professionals as part 121 ca rriers part 121 carriers generally have the most stringent safety requirements and receive the highest level of scrutiny by faa inspectors congressional involvement while congress has primarily relied on congressional oversig ht to press for aviation safety improvements at times it has legislated on airline safety matters for example amid growing frustration over the faas slow progress and airline resistance to equipping aircraft with cockpit collision avoidance systems congress included in the airport and airway safety and capacity expans ion act of 1987 pl 100223 language establishing specific time lines for the advancement of this technology and deadlines for the mandato ry operational deployment and use of traffic collision avoidance systems tcas on passenger airliners also as part of the fy1992 trans portation appropriations act p l 102143 congress included set of provisions referred to as the agin g aircraft safety ac t of 1991 directing the faa to establish regulatory framework for assuring the continuing airworthiness of aging aircraft under the provisions of the act the faa was directed to provide its inspectors with specific training in corrosion and metal fatigue auditing inspections the act resulted in the faas creation of an aging aircraft inspections program to study agerelated structural issues in the air carrier fleet through process of inspections and systematic record keeping18 faa oversight of the airline industry came under intense congressional scrutiny in the 1990s following string of accide nts involving usair in the early 1990s fatal crash of commuter turboprop after encountering inflight icing conditions in october 1994 and the fatal crash of valujet dc9 in the florida everglades in may 1996 largely as result of congressiona l findings following the valujet crash congress included two significant changes to faa safety oversight in the federal aviation reauthorization act of 1996 pl 104264 first the act eliminated the faas dual mandate to promote the av iation industry while at the same time regulating its compliance with safety mandates and it specifically designated in statute safety as the highest priority for air commerce second the act mandated that the faa establish system for protecting voluntarily submitted safetyrelated information to encourage employees with

more classical rulebased regulatory enforcement approach which it regards as being more of reactive approach22 in this regard the sms concept is viewed as one of several approaches to av iation safety

tragic accidents the sms approach does not however replace formal safety reporting processes compliance with faa directives and regulatory oversight inspections and enforcement but is meant to complement these aspects of safety regulation nonetheless some critics of the approach caution that potentially unintended effect of an sms approach is the deemphasis of these more traditional regulatory oversight functions which in their view may erode important checks and balances designed to ensure that high level of safety and regulatory compliance is maintained23 others argue however that as result of technology advances sa fety monitoring hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34467crs13 24 ibid 25 ibid 26 see 14 cfr 13401become much more of datadriven activity that relies on near realtime assessment of operational conditions that have necessitated significant changes in the manner in which airlines monitor safety and the f aa conducts its oversight activities under this line of reasoning advocates argue that meeting the changing nature of the industry requires faa oversight functions to be more directly focused on safety related processes and functions rather than the more specific details of regulatory compliance somewhat related concern has recently been raised however over the faas customer service initiative the initiative was first launched in late 2003 with the intent of creating more uniform and cons istent approach to regulatory oversight nationwide and be more responsive to concerns about the interpretation or application of regulatory matters by the faa24 the faa contends that misinterpretation of this initiative led some inspectors to treat airlines more as business clients of the faa rather th an regulated entities resulting in lax enforcement the faa has vowed to fi x this misunderstanding and emphasize that while inspectors should be respectful and re sponsive to airline concerns they should not be treating them as customers or clients25 datadriven safety processes to address the needs for datadriven safety monitoring airlines include various safety data collection and analysis tools as part of their overall sms approach for exam ple in addition to asap most major airlines conduct some form of flight operational quality assu rance foqa program to review electronically recorded data from flights to identify potentially unsafe operational conditions as part of their overall safety manage ment approach to encourage the use of these datadriven processes for identifying potential safety issues foqa data is afforded nondisclosu re protections and the faa is generally prohibited against using foqa data in ca rrying out enforcement action against an airline or its employees except in cases involving criminal or deliberate acts26 the sms concept relies on datadri ven processes like foqa to target and correct safety deficiencies hazards and other unsaf conditions in maintenance and flight operations the sms framework serves as th airline counterpart to the faas data driven approach to oversight the air transportation oversight system atos the air transportation oversight system atos the faas atos system has been phased in over the past 10 years and is now the primary tool for managing and administering faa oversight and inspections of part 121 operators as compared to more traditional inspecti on methods that rely heavily on individual inspector expertise and focus on regulatory compliance issues atos is datadriven program that relies on risk assessments and analysis to focus inspection activities on particular areas where safety deficiencies might be expected at specific air carrier while the programs objectives and principles are generally viewed as positive change for aviation safety by many

the design of an aircraft or aircraft component determined to compromise safety and the faa has the ultimate responsibility to regulate the process and ensure safety across the entire airline industry

these actions coming at time when airlines are facing rising fuel costs and economic conditions that make raising ticket prices to offset these rising costs difficult is placing si gnificant strain on the airline industry also some noted safety expe rts have questioned whether these actions have had any bearing on improving safety or whether the lapses in ad compliance constituted any significant risk to the safety of the traveling public30 maintenance outsourcing in addition to the current focus on faa oversight concerns over the degree to wh ich air carriers outsource maintenance to third party certificated repa ir stations and other fac ilities including noncertificated aircraft maintenance facilities and the level of faa oversight of these various facilities has been an ongoing concern us air carriers are increasingly outsourcing maintenance to thirdparty repair stations and outsour ced maintenance now accounts for more than 50 of air carriers total maintenance costs31 for airlines maintenance outsourcing has largely been view ed as cost saving approach in many instances airlines have contracted with fo reign repair stations which can often offer considerably lower costs because of lower labor rates in other countries however outsourcing practices both domestically and internationally raise concerns over the qualifications of maintena nce personnel and the ability of the faa to conduct effective regulatory oversight across th contract maintenance industry the ratio of workers to supervisors is not regulate d and often exceeds 10 to 1 raising questions over the adequacy of supervision in c ontract maintenance operations further contracted maintenance workers many of whom work parttime at repair facilities alongside fulltime regular employees often

with regard to the potential implications for airline safety concerns over faa inspector oversight of contract maintenance practices surfaced during the ntsbs investigation of the march 16 2003 crash of us airways commuter flight operated by air midwest in charlotte nc the inves tigation found that elevator control cables were improperly rigged by subcontracted maintenance workers at noncertificated facility and it has been suggested that faa had limited understanding of the contract arrangements and minimal know ledge of the work conditions and supervision of work being performed at this maintenance facility33 the crash investigation in conjunction with gr owing concerns over faa oversight of maintenance at facilities not required to be certificated as designated repair stations prompted dot office of inspector general oig audit of air carrier use of these noncertificated main tenance facilities the dot oig found that while these facilities operate outside the scope of regulations pertaining to certificated repair facilities there are specific limitations regarding the type and scope of work they perform and maintenance performed at these facilities is largely unmonitored by faa inspectors34 the safety implications of out sourced maintenance work and the faa oversight of vendors that perform this work remains an issue of considerable interest to congress some have also alleged that the increased use of outsourced maintenance is contributing to flight delays because airplanes are sometime s being returned to service by these repair stations with work performed incorrectly resulting in additional delays and cancellations to pull th aircraft out of service and fix them properly35 analysis of airlinecaused dela ys and maintenance outsourcing data among 14 major air carriers in 2005 tabulated by consumer reports indicated correlation of 047 on scale with 0 indi cating relationship and 1 indicating perfect relationship between the percent of maintenance outsourced by an airline and the percent of airlinecaused delays36 while this relationship provides some indication of possible link between outs ourcing and delays the correlation alone cannot establish causal link and the st rength of the correlation only weakly supports the notion that outsourcing and lays go handinhand nevertheless faced with increasing concerns of air carrier service delays this is another aspect of outsourcing that may warra nt further examinationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34467crs18 related legislation and possible options for congress related congressional oversight and legi slative activity have centered on options for improving the faa air safety inspector workforce the manner in which this workforce carries out its compliance audits of the airline industry and possible safeguards to reduce potential conflicts of interest that may compromise the regulatory role of faa inspection activities additional options are being pursued for increasing regulatory requirements and ove rsight of foreign repair stations and airline use of noncertificated repair fac ilities most of these options are being considered within the context of pending faa reauthorization gislation however complications and delays in bringing faa reauthorization legislation to the senate floor have prompted action in the house which passed standalone bill in july 2008 the aviation safety enhancemen t act of 2008 hr 6493 specifically addressing faa oversight of air carrier safety related provisions in f aa reauthorization bills specifically the faa reauthorization act of 2007 hr 2881 as passed by the house includes provision that would restrict the use of noncertif ied maintenance provi ders allowing only airline employees or employees of faa certified repair stations to carry out substantial and routine maintenance and complete required inspections of aircraft used in airline service air carriers would also be required to provide complete lists of their noncertificated maintenance provi ders whose activities would be restricted to nonroutine nonsubstan tial maintenance nd repair work under this provision the bill also adopts an amendment agreed to by the house that would extend the requirement for drug and cohol testing programs to safetycritical positions at foreign repair stations working on air carrier aircraft or components drug testing programs are already required for safetyc ritical maintenance personnel working for airlines and repair stations servicing air carrier aircraft within the united states and this extension to foreign repair stations agreed to by the house was widely regarded as closing gap that could have potentia l safety implications implementation and oversight of such requirement however may be complicated by specific privacy laws and rights in foreign countries that may limit the faas authority to impose drug and alcohol testing programs at fac ilities located in other countries that are comparable to existing programs in the united states the senate began consideration of the faa reauthoriza tion on april 28 2008 it has taken up consideration of hr 2881 as amended by the text of the aviation investment and modernization act of 2007 s 1300 and the american infrastructure investment and improvement act of 2007 s 2345 this legislation does not include similar provisions regarding regulations or oversight of repair stations or thirdparty air carrier maintenance providers the prior faa reauthorization act vision 100 pl 108176 enacted in 2003 directed the government general ccounting office now the government accountability office or gao to examine faa inspector training and tasked the national academies with conducting study of faa inspector workload

aviation safety inspectors postemployment restriction options for faa inspectors legislators in both the house and the senate have focused on options to establish cooling off period that would restri ct former faa inspectors from seeking employment with air carriers for some period after leaving their positions at the faa38 this proposed cooling off period is intended to redu ce potential conflicts of interest for inspectors who may go eas on air carriers they oversee in hopes that doing so could improve their chances of landing an airline job various post employment restrictions

have been raised regarding faa oversight of air carrier safety the bill would establish within the faa an aviation safety whistleblower investigati on office the offi ce director would be appointed by the secretary of transportati on to serve fiveyear term and would be charged with reviewing reports of safety violations submitted by whistleblowers within the faa and in the airline industr and recommending corrective actions to the faa administrator while maintaining the confidentiality of whistleblowers identity the administrator would in rn be required to respond to these recommendations in writing the aviation safety whistleblower investigation office would be required to re port annually to congress providing summaries ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34467crs20 whistleblower cases handled and their dispos ition the bill also seeks to redefine the faas customer service initiative by removing references to airlines as customers of the faa and ensuring that safety is given priority over air line satisfaction with regard to establishing cooling off period for former faa inspectors the bill proposes to prohibit an air carrier from hiri ng or offering promise of employment in position involving representing or acting as an agent on behalf of the airline in matters before the faa to faa safety inspectors whose duties within the past two years involved safety inspecti on and oversight of that specific air carrier the bill would also limit principal supervisory inspectors to maintaining post overseeing particular aircraft to five year period requiring them to rotate to oversight of other air carriers at least every five years for principal supervisory inspector posts occupied on the day of enactment the bill would allow individuals in these posts to remain in place until they reach cumulative of five years in the post or for two years after the date of enactment whichever is longer the bill would also require the faa to conduct headquarter slevel reviews of the at database on monthly basis to identify trends in regulatory compliance and appropriate corrective actions the faa would be required to report to congress quarterly on these atos review activities

corrective actions to ensure that they encompass all affected aircraft and adequately correct the disclosed problem within an acceptable timeframe the bill would also require the faa to establish secondary review process to ensure that issues disclosed under the vdrp have not been previously identified by an faa inspector or previously disclosed by the air carrier within the past five years the bill would also establish twoyear postem ployment moratorium on faa inspectors under this provision faa inspectors would be barred from representing or negotiating on behalf of an airline that they were responsible fo r inspecting in matters before the faa for period of two years after leaving their faa post the bill would also require the faa to establish system for tracking field office reviews of air carrier compliance with ads it would require full audit of all air carriers covered under atos to undergo comprehensive 100 ad compliance review every five years as part of these compliance revi ews faa inspectors would be required to conduct physical inspections on sampling of aircraft at each ai r carrier to ensure proper methods of ad compliance the bill would also require the faa to establish means for ensuring that appropriate local and regional faa offices and the faa administrator are alerted of air carrier nonc ompliance with an ad the bill also calls for an independent gao review and investig ation of safety issues identified and reported by faa employees and it would re quire the faa to establish national review team to conduct periodic random re views
