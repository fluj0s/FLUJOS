egypt is aimed at maintaining regional stability improving bilateral relations continuing military cooperation and sustaining the march 1979 egyptianisraeli peace treaty successive administrations have long viewed egypts leaders as moderating influence in the middle east though in recent years there have been increasing us calls for egypt to democratize congressional views of usegyptian relations vary many lawmakers view egypt as stabilizing force in the region but some members would like the united states to pressure egypt to implement political reforms improve its human rights record and take more active role in reducing arabisraeli tensions the united states has provided egypt with an annual average of over 2 billion in economic and military foreign assistance since 1979

approaches most observers believe that usegyptian relations must be revitalized although diplomatic ties remain strong the current paradigm of the relationship has grown stale and condemnation of egypts poor human rights and democratization record has increased both in the us media and in congress from egypts standpoint there has been deep disappointment and anger directed at the us government as many egyptian officials believe that their cooperation with us policy in the region has been taken for granted they argue that egypt dutifully upholds its peace treaty obligations with israel and has pushed other parties in the region to pursue peace in addition the egyptian military facilitates us military requests for transit of the suez canal overflight of egyptian territory and storage of us military equipment in egypt yet while other arab governments have received additional us support in recent years egypts annual foreign assistance package has remained flat and despite its lobbying plans for possible usegyptian free trade agreement have been put on hold us officials have found it more difficult to defend usegyptian relations in light of continued reports of regimesponsored suppression of peaceful opposition figures while many us policymakers continue to express gratitude for egyptian military cooperation intelligence sharing and contributions to international peacekeeping operations it would seem that both parties have had difficulty in publicly framing the relationship around any one issue egypt continues to push for more active us role in the middle east peace process while the united states continues to push for meaningful government reform in egypt albeit less intensely since the 2006 hamas electoral victory in palestinian authority legislative elections the core question for the administration and congress remains how to preserve the strategic benefits of close military intelligence and diplomatic relations with egypt while promoting political and economic reforms that will ensure the stability and development of egypt over the long term experts have posited variety of reasons for the current stagnation egyptian critics have called their government gerontocracy noting that 80yearold president hosni mubarak continues to be surrounded by some of the same advisors and cabinet officials from the early 1980s while some egyptians consider such stability reassuring others contend that the egyptian government needs to be infused with new generation of civilian leaders analysts continue to speculate over mubaraks 44yearold gamals possible ascension to the egyptian presidency and what his leadership would mean for usegyptian relations other observers contend that egypts regional prominence has declined in recent years and other countries such crs2 as saudi arabia have stepped in to the fill this void egypt is minimally affected by violence in iraq afghanistan and elsewhere the gaza strip is one of the few areas in the region where it remains influential in july 2007 as part of larger arms package to the region the united states announced that it would provide egypt with 13 billion in military aid over tenyear period since egypt has already been receiving approximately 13 billion year in military assistance the announcement represented major change in administration policy toward egypt soon after the announcement the united states and israel signed memorandum of understanding to provide israel with 30 billion in military aid from 2009 to 2018 25 increase historical background egypt during the colonial era egypts relations with the west including its current friendly relations with the united states are colored by long history of foreign intervention in egyptian politics which has made egypt along with other arab states wary of outside influences on their domestic affairs in the 19th century egypt was semi autonomous province in the ottoman empire which by then was in decline and being propped up by the british in order to serve as buffer between it and czarist russia at the time egypt was viewed as extremely valuable to the british and french empires and was prized for its agricultural output large domestic market and strategic location between the mediterranean and red seas most importantly the british saw egypt as vital to securing the sea route to its most prized colony india ottoman weakness led its sultans to grant europeans certain legal protections and economic advantages in egypt which stifled the egyptian economy by flooding it with european manufactured goods driving local merchants out of business1 over time egypt developed cash crop economy based almost solely on the export of cotton the price of which constantly fluctuated leaving the economy vulnerable and dependent on good harvests without strong diverse economy egypt could not generate enough capital to fund its modernization leading it to become even more financially dependent on the west as it rulers borrowed huge sums from european banks six years after the completion of the suez canal in 1869 egypt was forced to sell all of its shares in the suez canal company which operated the canal in order to make payments on its foreignowned debt when egypt could longer pay its debts the british and french became directly involved in egyptian politics trend that would continue until the mid 20th century2 1 library of congress federal research division egypt country study accessible at httplcweb2locgovfrdcsegtochtml 2 napoleon invaded egypt in 1798 the british invaded in 1882 and established facto protectorate they would keep sizeable military force in egypt until the 1950s crs3 figure 1 map of egypt the constitutional monarchy the british britain unilaterally declared egyptian independence in 1922 and for the next three decades political power in egypt was contested among three main actors the british the egyptian monarchy and the nationalist wafd party which was the driving force behind the egyptian independence movement after world war i thousands of british troops remained stationed near the suez canal and british officials served in the egyptian ministries egypts king could appoint government and dismiss parliament but ultimately relied on the british for support the wafd party dominated parliamentary elections during egypts experiment with parliamentary democracy 19221952 though the wafd gradually began to lose popularity to more radical organizations such as the muslim brotherhood nasser and egypt during the cold war by the early 1950s antibritish sentiment in egypt had sparked civil unrest allowing cabal of egyptian army officers known as the free officers movement to oust the king in what is referred to as the july 1952 revolution the free officer movement ushered in an era of military involvement in egyptian politics as all of crs4 egypts presidents in the postrevolutionary period have been high ranking officers in the aftermath of the coup colonel gamal abdul nasser the most charismatic of the free officers succeeded in gaining total control over the government nasser abolished the monarchy and outlawed the muslim brotherhood 1954 which at the time was the only potential rival for power nasser would rule egypt until his death in 1970 during the nasser era egypt found itself at the center of superpower competition for influence in the middle east wary of taking sides nasser managed for short period to steer egypt clear of either the soviet or western camp and was instrumental in helping to establish the nonaligned movement usegyptian relations soured when nasser turned to the soviets and the czechs in 1955 for military training and equipment after the west frustrated by nassers repeated rejections and his support of algerian independence against the french refused to provide egypt with defense assistance year later following usbritish decision to retract an offer of economic assistance and help for the construction of the aswan dam nasser nationalized the suez canal company to use its revenues to finance the dam project egypt owned the suez canal but the britishfrench company operated the canal and collected the revenues from which it paid small rent to egypt in october 1956 israel france and britain invaded egypt israel to stop palestinian guerrillas from using egypt as base for operations against israel and france and britain to occupy the canal president eisenhower persuaded the three countries to withdraw from egypt in early 1957 which briefly improved us egyptian relations3 after the 1956 suez war nassers popularity soared as he came to embody arab nationalism in the postcolonial era nasser did not hesitate to brandish his newfound authority and developed muscular egyptian foreign policy that attempted to destabilize prowestern governments in jordan iraq and lebanon support palestinian guerrilla action against israel create unified arab state by merging briefly with syria the united arab republic 19581961 and intervene against the saudibacked royalists in the yemeni civil war4 however egypts defeat at the hands of israel in the june 1967 war and other setbacks temporarily deflated nassers popularity and crushed his ambitions to spread panarab ideology across the region on the domestic front nasser turned egypt into socialist dictatorship with absolute power in the hands of the president all banks and commercial firms were nationalized large landowning estates were broken up into much smaller parcels and held in state trust and all political parties were banned the precursor to the present national democratic party ndp was formed by nasser in 1962 and was called the arab socialist union it served as the egyptian republics first mass party and an extension of the ruling elite other movements such as the muslim brotherhood 3 yapp the near east since the first world war london longman 1991 p 409 4 during the

assassination attempt against him in 19545 egyptisraeli peace after nassers death in 1970 anwar sadat one of the original free officers became president of egypt at the time egypt was humiliated by its defeat in the june 1967 war and the ensuing loss of the sinai peninsula to israel in addition military rebuilding expenditures were absorbing nearly 25 of egypts gross domestic product under these circumstances sadat calculated that military victory was needed to boost his own legitimacy and improve egypts position in any future negotiations with israel the october 1973 war which initially took israel by surprise was costly for both sides but succeeded in boosting sadats credibility with the egyptian people enabling him to embark on path which would ultimately sever egypts ties to the soviet union and bring it closer to the west in november 1973 egypt and the united states restored diplomatic relations which had been cut off in 1967 and in december the two countries participated in the geneva peace conference us secretary of state henry kissingers shuttle diplomacy led to egyptianisraeli and syrianisraeli disengagement agreements in 1974 and second set of egyptianisraeli disengagements in 1975 the united states resumed economic aid to egypt in 1975 after an eightyear hiatus the camp david agreement and 1979 peace treaty on november 20 1977 president sadat made his historic visit to israel where he addressed the knesset parliament sadats visit was symbolic as he became the first arab leader to visit israel thereby implicitly recognizing the jewish state sadat believed that his initiative would jumpstart the arabisraeli peace process which had stalled in the late summer of 1978 israeli and egyptian leaders accepted an invitation from president carter to attend talks at camp david maryland intended to save what had been faltering peace process after nearly two weeks of clandestine and exhausting negotiations on september 17 1978 egypt and israel with the united states as witness signed two agreements framework for peace in the middle east and framework for the conclusion of peace treaty between egypt and israel the first framework called for an autonomous palestinian entity in the west bank and gaza strip following an israeli withdrawal the latter agreement ultimately led to the signing of the 1979 israelegypt peace treaty israel maintained that the two agreements were not linked as it did not want to be obligated to grant self determination to the palestinians 5 one of the brotherhood activists arrested was sayyid qutb writer and former government official whose writings provided philosophical foundation for islamic radicalism qutb spent years in prison and after being briefly released in 1964 was rearrested and hanged in 1966 see

ever between israel and an arab country in ceremony at the white house three days later the arab league voted to expel egypt from it ranks at the time the rest of the arab world felt betrayed by egypt for making separate peace with israel the 1979 peace treaty between israel and egypt ushered in the current era of us financial support for peace between israel and her arab neighbors in two separate memoranda accompanying the treaty the united states outlined commitments to israel and egypt respectively in its letter to israel the carter administration pledged to endeavor to take into account and will endeavor to be responsive to military and economic assistance requirements of israel7 in his letter to egypt former us secretary of defense harold brown wrote that the united states is prepared to enter into an expanded security relationship with egypt with regard to the sales of military equipment and services and the financing of at least portion of those sales8 ultimately the united states provided total of 73 billion to both parties in 1979 the special international security assistance act of 1979 pl 9635 provided both military and economic grants to israel and egypt at ratio of 3 to 2 respectively though this ratio was not enshrined in the treaty as egypt would later claim for egypt us funds helped to subsidize its defense budget and upgrade its aging soviet hardware egypt became the secondlargest recipient of us aid after 1979 the us assistance program in egypt also helped modernize the countrys infrastructure as us economic assistance was used to build cairos sewer

attempts to serve as broker for israelipalestinian peace talks during the mubarak era conflict between egyptian islamists and the egyptian authorities continued culminating in period 19921997 of violent confrontations between islamic militants and egyptian police after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the ensuing us focus on promoting democracy in the middle east the mubarak regime has come under increasing us pressure to accelerate political reforms and make egypt more democratic in an effort to control the reform agenda without relinquishing their grip on power mubarak and the

upper house the peoples assembly debates legislation proposed by government ministries and calls for amendments to governmentsponsored bills but rarely initiates its own bills the shura council has

the peoples assembly 444 members are elected and ten are appointed by the president 176 members of the shura council are elected and 88 are appointed11 peoples assembly members are elected for fiveyear terms and shura council members for sixyear terms onehalf the council members are elected every three years the ndp controls 324 seats in parliament muslim brotherhoodaffiliated members hold

such as the muslim brotherhood are officially banned the role of the military in egyptian society although military officers longer play direct role in the affairs of the civilianrun government the military remains the preeminent institution in egyptian society and has been called on by successive governments to maintain internal security and regime stability12 the military also provides employment and social services for hundreds of thousands of young people in country with annual double digit unemployment rates military experts have often asserted that egypts armed forces are bloated and maintain manpower at unnecessary levels for peacetime while others contend that the large size of the military is justified based on the services it provides to soldiers and their families some experts estimate that the military trains 12 of young egyptian males and that defense industries employ over 100000 people13 the military has its own companies that produce consumer products pharmaceuticals and manufactured goods the officer corps also benefit from higher salaries better housing and high quality healthcare which help ensure their loyalty to the government some members of the opposition have criticized these special benefits and the militarys fiscal autonomy asserting that there is little civilian control over the militarys budget 10 continued language version f t h

politics disengagement or accommodation the middle east journal washington spring 2003 vol 57 issue 2 p 269 crs9 the national democratic party ndp14 as the ruling party the ndp dominates the political scene in egypt controlling well over 80 of the seats in parliament the party itself is more of coalition of business and political elites rather than coherent and disciplined organization with unifying ideology in the 2000 parliamentary election popular dissatisfaction with the status quo led to the defeat of many ndp incumbents though the party maintained its supramajority in parliament after number of independents who had been ndp members rejoined the party thereafter ndp officials embarked on campaign to improve the partys public image holding the first party congress in 10 years in 2002 since then the ndp has held conferences in each successive year touting number of political reforms under the slogan of new thinking more importantly the presidents gamal mubarak was appointed to the ndps higher policy council and other young figures have become more visible in the party reinforcing regime rule over the last two years the mubarak government has tightened its grip on power and cracked down on domestic opponents see below experts have posited myriad of theories behind both the increase in domestic opposition and the subsequent government crackdown some analysts assert that the government is deliberately flexing its muscles during delicate period of political transition as the president may be grooming his to succeed him others have speculated that the regime may be sending message to the international community particularly the united states that it will not be pressured into liberalizing its political system still other observers take more marxist approach citing the growing resentment among the poor and middle class of the private sector elite demographic group which has disproportionately benefitted in recent years from the states economic liberalization policies now entering its third year the government has used both legal tactics and brute force to suppress opposition activity independent analysts have long noted that the egyptian legal system is labyrinth of codes and procedures that can be twisted to the states benefit when necessary the following is sampling of recent government action to reinforce its rule on august 2 2008 an egyptian court sentenced prominent self exiled dissident saad eddin ibrahim to two years in prison for harming egypts reputation through his public writings the court ruled that ibrahim who is currently abroad could post bond of 1900 to remain free pending an appeal in response the us state department issued press release stating we are disappointed by the recent conviction in egypt of democracy activist dr saad eddin ibrahim on august 2 dr ibrahim was convicted of harming egypts reputation through his writings in the foreign press and was sentenced to two years in prison lawsuits

civil and political rights including freedom of speech and due process on may 26 2008 parliament approved twoyear extension of the emergency laws which have been in place since sadats assassination in 1981 during his 2005 election campaign president mubarak pledged to introduce number of reforms including the elimination of the emergency laws which have been used to quell political dissent by holding people without charge for long periods and referring civilians to military courts where they have fewer rights on april 8 2008 after twoyear delay egypt held nationwide municipal elections for local councils these councils had been of little importance in national politics but became more relevant after the egyptian constitution was amended in 2005 under the revision of article 76 which for the first time in egypts history legally established the framework for multicandidate presidential election the constitution now requires that all presidential candidate nominations must obtain the support of at least 250 members of various elected bodies including 65 members of the lower house of parliament 25 members of the upper house and 140 members of various local councils the muslim brotherhood mb the only well organized opposition group in egyptian politics boycotted the elections at the last minute citing various government attempts to thwart their participation and rig the results the mb had initially fielded several thousand candidates for 52000 seats in 4500 local councils bureaucratic obstruction eventually whittled the number of mb candidates down to few hundred of whom only handful perhaps 20 were expected to compete15 ultimately the ruling national democratic party obtained majority of seats helping to maintain its monopoly over the political system in september 2007 authorities closed the association for human rights and legal aid after it helped bring case against the government over political activist who died in police custody also in september judge sentenced four newspaper editors including ad dustour chief ibrahim issa also spelled eissa to prison sentences on charges of defaming president mubarak and his gamal issa was already on trial on charges of disturbing the peace and harming national economic interests after he published several speculative articles over the health and possible death of president mubarak according to oxford analytica the regime is exacting revenge against individuals such as eissa for their zealous criticism of the government since the war on iraq much of the criticism was seen as breaking previous publishing redlines while 15 egypt vote ends with little excitement agence france presse april 8 2008 crs11 it would not have been prudent to crack down then given the international pressure and attention the context has changed and the regime is feeling secure enough to repress16 on june 11 2007 egypt held midterm election for the shura council the upper chamber of parliament with modest legislative powers the ndp won 84 of 88 seats as usual opposition activists charged that the election was marred by irregularities and violations eg ballot stuffing obstruction of polling centers and underage voting committed by the state and ndp prior to election day police and security forces arrested hundreds of muslim brotherhood members including several shura council candidates claiming that they violated prohibitions against the use of religious slogans in political campaign material on march 26 2007 34 amendments to the egyptian constitution were approved in popular referendum widely considered to be managed by progovernment forces us officials criticized both the content of the amendments and the expediency of their approval while amnesty international called the amendments the greatest erosion of human rights in 26 years in egypt amended article 179 allows the president to have civilians tried in military courts and eliminates protections against arbitrary search and arrest in offenses related to terrorism revised article 88 curtails judicial supervision of general elections and transfers oversight responsibility to an electoral commission in 2000 the egyptian supreme constitutional court ruled that elections should have direct judicial oversight revised article 62 changes the electoral system from candidatecentered system to mixed system of party lists and individual districts this revision would further restrict the muslim brotherhood since as an illegal organization it cannot field list of party candidates brotherhood members run as independents this amendment also establishes quota for female lawmakers in parliament political opposition and civil society over the past few years political opposition in egypt has broadened to include an array of various groups both secular and religious however despite growing chorus of regime critics particularly over the internet the muslim brotherhood remains the only serious organized opposition movement in egypt today nevertheless labor strikes and spontaneous demonstrations organized by activist bloggers have received more international attention as of late despite widespread political apathy and resignation that pervades egyptian society 16 egypt press crackdown linked to succession oxford analytica november 1 2007 crs12 handful of legal opposition parties which must be approved by the government serve as the token official opposition to the ndp17 most experts regard egypts legal opposition parties as divided with limited popular support in the 2000 parliamentary elections the principal opposition parties secured just 17 seats despite widespread popular dissatisfaction with the ruling ndp in 2005 these parties fared even worse winning just 12 seats the muslim brotherhood18 the muslim brotherhood mb was founded in egypt in 1928 to turn egypt away from secularism and toward an islamic government based on sharia religious law and muslim principles19 the muslim brotherhood operates as religious charitable and educational institution having been banned as political party in 1954 however many muslim brotherhood members run for parliament as independents in the 2000 parliamentary elections 17 independent candidates who were regarded as brotherhood sympathizers were elected in 2005 brotherhood affiliated candidates won 88 seats in parliament over the years the egyptian government has alternated between tolerating and suppressing the muslim brotherhood sometimes arresting and jailing its members and other times allowing its members to operate almost without hindrance many foreign observers agree that the organization has renounced the use of violence as political tactic while many egyptian officials continue to perceive the brotherhood as threat and are unwilling to legalize the movement20 in the united states the issue of whether or not to recognize the muslim brotherhood as legitimate political actor continues to perplex policymakers particularly after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the one hand there has been general reluctance to push for islamist inclusion in politics out of concern that once in power groups such as the muslim brotherhood will pursue policies counter to us interests in the region or will transform states into theocracies like iran21 on the other hand some experts believe that if islamists were brought into functional 17 by law political parties must be approved by the sevenmember political parties committee ppc since 1977 the committee has approved 18 political parties and rejected almost 50 18 for more

rhetoric in order to appeal to wider audience most analysts believe that from an organizational standpoint the brotherhood is the only movement capable of mobilizing significant opposition to the government though opinions vary on how much mass support the brotherhood commands as is typical for islamist groups across the region the muslim brotherhood is strongest among the professional middle class controlling many of the professional syndicates associations including those representing engineers doctors lawyers and academics22 the brotherhoods party platform for years critics have charged that the muslim brotherhood like other islamists groups has been unable to articulate concrete policies and has relied too heavily on conveying its agenda through vague slogans such as the party mantra of islam is the solution when the brotherhood circulated draft party platform in late 2007 it generated great deal of attention and condemnation by its opponents the draft which was contested by more moderate faction of the brotherhood23 reportedly called for the establishment of board of religious scholars with whom the president and the legislature would have to consult before passing laws according to one critic reminiscent of irans guardian council this undemocratically selected body could have the power vested by the state to veto any and all legislation passed by the egyptian parliament and approved by the president that is not compatible with islamic sharia lawthe muslim brotherhood should have looked to turkey as model for how to integrate islam into secular system24 the draft platform also states that neither women nor christians may stand for president civil society in egypt although political opposition continues to be stymied observers note that over the past two decades egypt has developed vibrant civil society which some development experts hope will further democratization in the country the term civil society generally refers to the growing number of nongovernmental organizations ngos charities and advocacy groups that openly operate in egyptian society many of these groups pursue socalled safe issues such as womens rights human rights and social equality as way to work toward the much broader goal of democratization often times the egyptian government has created its own associations in order to boost its reform image at home and abroad such as the governmentsponsored national council on human rights 22 john walsh egypts muslim brotherhood harvard international review cambridge winter 2003 vol 24 issue 4 p 32 23 some observers contend

take years before the ministry rules on an application and many groups are routinely rejected if an ngos application is rejected it has few legal rights and can be shut down its members can be imprisoned however even registered ngos must tread carefully when engaging in sensitive political issues as some groups have been periodically closed or have had their legal status revoked ngos also must report all foreign donations to the ministry of social affairs overall tolerance for the activities of nonregistered groups varies and many ngos operate without any legal protection25 organized labor while reformminded intellectuals and conservative islamists have served as the backbone of political opposition in egypt series of successful worker strikes in 2007 have led some analysts to speculate that organized labor could be the most effective opposition movement in egypt today26 low wages and rising inflation have led to several strikes at mostly governmentowned textile factories one strike at textile factory in the nile delta town of mahalla kubra witnessed weeklong sit in of an estimated 20000 workers protestors not only demanded wage hike but expressed their opposition to the governments economic liberalization strategy fearing that privatization plans will lead to job cuts according to joel benin professor at the american university in cairo it seems like the decision is to pacify the workers and give them what they want and crack down on the intellectuals and not give them anything the workers are more of threat recent report by carnegie endowment for international peace speculated that recent strikes represented departure from the tradition of workers holding sitins while work continued because strikes were seen as hurting egypts national interest this perception changed however as the reform process advanced new feature of the most recent strikes is that they are ending peacefully whereas in the past they would be broken by police force some analysts have interpreted this as sign of the increased societal tensions around economic reform while others have seen it as result of increased international scrutiny27 25 human rights watch margins

assistance to egypt for the past four years congress has debated whether us foreign aid to egypt should be conditioned on among other things improvements in egypts human rights record its progress on democratization and its efforts to control the egypt gaza border some members believe that us assistance to egypt has not been effective in promoting political and economic reform and that foreign assistance agreements must be renegotiated to include benchmarks that egypt must meet to continue to qualify for us foreign aid others have periodically called for restrictions on us aid to egypt on the grounds that egypts record on religious freedom is substandard the administration some lawmakers and the egyptian government assert that reducing egypts aid would undercut us strategic interests in the area including support for middle east peace us naval access to the suez canal and usegyptian intelligence cooperation us military officials argue that continued us military support to egypt facilitates strong militarytomilitary ties the us navy which sends an average of dozen ships through the suez canal per month receives expedited processing for its nuclear warships to pass through the canal valued service that can normally take weeks for other foreign navies in addition some us lawmakers argue that cutting aid particularly military assistance harms the united states since all of egypts fmf must be spent on american hardware and associated services and training the fy2008 withholding of us military aid during consideration of the house version of the fy2008 state foreign operations and related programs appropriations bill hr 2764 lawmakers inserted new language that proposed to withhold 200 million in foreign military financing assistance fmf to egypt until the secretary of state certifies that egypt has taken concrete steps toward improving its human rights record strengthening judicial independence and curbing palestinian smuggling along the gaza border despite vociferous protests from the egyptian government asserting that this conditionality would harm bilateral relations congress passed legislation that temporarily suspended some aid to egypt pl

abuses and detect and destroy the smuggling network and tunnels that lead from egypt to gaza both during consideration of pl 110161 and after its passage egyptian officials charged that certain israeli officials were publicly supporting congressional efforts to condition us aid to egypt in order to compel for more egyptian cooperation in tightening control over the gaza border in january 2008 interview egyptian foreign minister ahmed aboul gheit said that israel has succeeded in crs16 inciting the us congress and not the us administration by putting some sticks in the wheels of this relationship some people on the us side adopted the israeli position and the us aid program to egypt came to be targeted we succeeded in cutting israel down to its real size as far as its talk about the tunnels is concerned28 israeli leaders suggested that egypts accusations were overblown during december 2007 israeli knesset foreign affairs and defense committee meeting israeli foreign minister tzipi livni defended the israeli foreign ministrys decision not to distribute alleged video footage of egyptian soldiers assisting hamas smugglers to us lawmakers stating that some things are done on stage some are done in congress and some other things are done behind the scenes every move needs to be calculated to take an extreme scenario would you sever relations with egypt over weapons smuggling29 although the administration ultimately waived the restrictions laid out in section 690 of the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act30 questions remain over whether congressional action successfully achieved change in egypts behavior according to representative steve israel from the moment congress began circulating the language conditioning aid to egypt the egyptians began to make an effort to close the tunnels31 during and after the debate on aid conditionality the administration sought to broker solution to the smuggling problem that was amenable to all parties in late 2007 the administration set aside 23 million of egypts annual foreign military financing fmf toward the procurement of more advanced detection equipment such as censors and remotecontrolled robotic devices

expressed concern over the security of the egyptgaza border israel claims that smuggling of sophisticated weaponry into the gaza strip could shift the balance of power in hamass favor israel also asserts that egypt is not adequately sealing its side of the border citing the breakthrough of hundreds of thousands of palestinians who rushed into egypt on january 23 2008 egypt claims that israel has not only exaggerated the threat posed by weapons smuggling but is deliberately acting to sabotage usegyptian relations by demanding that the united states condition its annual 13 billion in military assistance on egypts efforts to thwart smuggling hamasegypt relations hamass control of the gaza strip poses challenge for egypt which wants to keep hamas isolated but not be held solely responsible for failing to do so by either israel or the united states in addition the secular mubarak regime is opposed to islamists wielding real political power and it fears that hamas could serve as model for egyptian muslim brotherhood activists who may secretly yearn for an iranianstyle revolution in egypt moreover due to domestic political sensitivities in egypt its leaders have sought to avoid the appearance of harming palestinian civilians based on the events of january 23 egyptian forces appear unwilling to shoot either hamas members or civilians who breach the border fence unless it is in selfdefense hamas deftly exploits egyptian public opinion to its benefit and to the detriment of egypts military according to mouin rabbani an analyst at the international crisis group think tank in jordan egypt is confronted with what for them is nasty dilemma put in the position of being cojailer of gaza palestinians hamas has criticized egypt for indirectly supporting israels gaza isolation policy in an interview conducted by the international crisis group one unnamed hamas official said egypt and israel have turned gaza into prison in prison only five things are available air water light food and medicine that is all egypt and israel make available to us we cannot put egypt and israel on par but the egyptians share the responsibility they are doing nothing less than nothing if thats possible and it is disgrace32 on april 8 hamas spokesperson threatened to breach the border again stating that i expect that what will happen next will be greater than what happened before not only against the egyptian border but against all the crossings in may 2008 hamas again warned that desperate circumstances inside gaza would lead to an unprecedented explosionalong the border with egypt although hamas official sami abu zahri immediately softened the groups rhetoric stating that hamas has plan to knock down the border fence or to target egyptian border guards egypt

successfully brokered sixmonth israelihamas unofficial ceasefire agreement reportedly the united states supported egypts role as mediator between israel and hamas usdesignated foreign terrorist organization previous ceasefire arrangements have been short lived and many observers expect that this new arrangement will ultimately break down nevertheless media reports indicate that under the terms of the truce or calm israel will ease its gaza closure policy and may stop objecting to the reopening of the rafah border crossing34 if among other things discernible progress is made on the release of gilad shalit the israeli soldier who has been held by hamas for nearly two years since shalit was captured on june 25 2006 the rafah crossing point has been closed for normal operations and open on an exceptional basis only in order to resume its normal operation israel egypt and the international community have demanded that the palestinian authority be allowed to resume control over the gaza side of the border so far hamas has rejected this position and has insisted that it retain control over its side of the crossing inflation and prospects for social unrest with the price of oil at an alltime high consumers throughout the developing world are being financially squeezed by subsequent increases in the price of fuel food and other basic necessities in egypt where an estimated 20 of the countrys 80 million citizens live in poverty international estimates suggest that up to 40 of egyptians lived on less than 2 day there is some concern that inflationary pressures

the rafah terminal israel agreed to allow the european union to maintain border assistance mission eubam to monitor the rafah crossing without physical presence on the border israel monitored the

as food prices have increased consumer demand for subsidized bread also has risen35 many observers assert that the entire subsidy system is broken as many governmentsubsidized bakeries conspire with corrupt bureaucrats and inspectors to sell their allotments to private bakeries larger families in need of more bread must turn to private distributors whose prices have skyrocketed and shortages have compelled president mubarak to order the military to bake additional loaves in the past several months an estimated 11 people have died in bread lines either from heat exhaustion or stab wounds suffered in altercations for positions in line36 in 1977 when the egyptian government temporarily lifted its bread subsidy 70 people were killed in rioting and then president sadat had to order the military to deploy to cairo to restore order for five days the government lost control of its capital city as of june 2008 the economic situation for middle and lower class egyptians has not improved and some analysts are beginning to speculate that the food crisis and inflation may threaten the mubarak regimes very survival in early april 2008 spontaneous demonstrations and rioting broke out in mahalla kubra as protestors responded angrily to the governments heavyhanded attempts to deter activists from carrying out nationwide general strike called for sunday april 6 during the riot protestors destroyed portraits of president mubarak two schools were burned and 70 people were injured from tear gas and rubber bullets used by the police one bystander 15yearold was shot while standing in the thirdfloor balcony of his apartment37 the egyptian government sent highlevel delegation to the town to calm tensions offering bonuses and higher wages for workers in june protests again erupted in the mediterranean town of burullus after local officials banned the sale of subsidized flour directly to people in order to crack down on black market trading according to various reports 60 were injured in the melee and 87 arrested president mubarak and his government have made some attempt at easing the inflation burden on average consumers in april the president announced 30 publicsector wage increase month later the government expanded its food ration program to cover an additional 17 million people making more than 70 of the total population eligible for subsidized rations however after the government announced that these expanded social welfare benefits would be paid for by lifting fuel subsidies and thereby raising gas prices public anger grew and the government lost any of the good will it had accrued from earlier plans to relieve consumers human rights religious freedom and womens rights as major recipient of us assistance egypt has been of great

egyptian governments respect for human rights remained poor and serious abuses continued in many areas the 2007 report as in past years documents several instances of torture allegedly carried out by egyptian security forces the prison system particularly detention facilities used for incarcerating suspected islamist radicals has come under increasing international scrutiny for exacerbating militancy in the region due to its tendency to harden some criminals who have been tortured over prolonged periods of time several of qaedas leaders including secondincommand ayman zawahiri were former prisoners in egyptian jails international human rights organizations have long documented instances of torture arbitrary detainment and discrimination against women homosexuals and coptic christians in egypt in 2007 the international human rights watchdog group human rights watch actually commended the government for convicting two police officers on charges of illegally detaining beating and then raping 21yearold minibus driver while he was in police custody38 however some observers suggest that the incident was an attempt to placate the international community and would never have come to light had egyptian bloggers not circulated over the internet cell phone video of the bus drivers beating some egyptian and international human rights activists have charged that us human rights policy toward egypt is hypocritical asserting that us policymakers have not adequately championed improved human rights in egypt due to realpolitik considerations in the region in addition several reports suggest that since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the us central intelligence agency has deported several suspected qaeda operatives to egypt along with other arab countries in order to be interrogated and possibly tortured39 some observers have questioned the credibility of us human rights policy toward egypt if on the one hand the united states condemns egyptian practices of torture and illegal detainment and on the other hand the united states condones egyptian government behavior when it suits the interests of us national security religious freedom there is official government policy of discrimination against the 9 million coptic christians in egypt and the constitution provides for equal rights without regard to religion nevertheless critics note that there are christians serving as governors police commissioners city mayors public university presidents or deans40 although coptic christians play prominent role in the private sector the us state

is source of great aggravation to coptic christians under this law license is required to erect church in addition there are ten restricting conditions for the construction of churches including minimum distance between churches and between church and the nearest mosque as well as the absence of objection on the part of muslim neighbors in december 2004 president mubarak issued new decree that devolved church repair and reconstruction decisions to the provincial level and stipulated that churches would be permitted to proceed with rebuilding and repair without legal hindrance however permits for construction of new churches require presidential decree womens rights although egyptian women have played major roles in the countrys drive for independence and many women currently serve in prestigious public posts women face number of obstacles at the legal religious and cultural levels female genital mutilation fgm remained serious problem because of widespread cultural acceptance

for usaids democracy and education programs egypt claims that us assistance programs must be jointly negotiated and cannot be unilaterally dictated by the united states43 us economic assistance to egypt has been decreasing since 1998 when the united states began reducing economic assistance to egypt and israel in january 1998 israeli officials negotiated with the united states to reduce economic aid and increase military aid over 10year period 3 to 2 ratio similar to us aid to israel and egypt was applied to the reduction in aid 60 million reduction for israel and 40 million reduction for egypt but egypt did not receive an increase in military assistance economic aid dropped in annual 40 million increments from 815 million in fy1998 to 415 million in esf in fy200844 due to the egyptian economys strong macroeconomic growth growing desire for more usegyptian trade and reluctance by the egyptian government to accept conditions on us aid us and egyptian officials have expressed desire to graduate egypt from us bilateral economic assistance however neither the united states nor egypt seem to agree on how aid should be reduced over the coming decade egypt would like to establish an endowment to jointly fund development projects some analysts believe that the proposed endowment which reportedly would be matched by the egyptian government on dollarfordollar basis would serve as substitute for the annual appropriations process and shield egypt from potential conditionality agreements mandated by congress so far the administration has moved ahead with its own

three general components 1 acquisitions 2 upgrades to existing equipment and 3 followon support maintenance contracts according to us and egyptian defense officials approximately 30 of annual fmf aid to egypt is spent on new weapons systems as egypts defense modernization plan is designed to gradually replace most of egypts older soviet weaponry with us equipment45 that figure is expected to decline over the long term due to the rising costs associated with followon maintenance contracts egyptian military officials have repeatedly sought additional fmf funds to offset the escalating costs of followon support they point out that as costs rise static aid appropriations amount to reduction in net assistance egypt also receives excess defense articles eda worth hundreds of millions of

addition to large amounts of annual us military assistance egypt also benefits from certain aid provisions that are available to only few other countries since 2000 egypts fmf funds have been deposited in an interest bearing account in the federal reserve bank of new york and have remained there until they are obligated by law pl 106280 congress must be notified if any of the interest accrued in this account is obligated most importantly egypt is allowed to set aside fmf funds for current year payments only rather than set aside the full amount needed to meet the full cost of multiyear purchases cash flow financing allows egypt to negotiate major arms purchases with us defense suppliers 45 according to 2006 government accountability office report over the life of egypts
