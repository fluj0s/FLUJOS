chapter 12 of the us bankruptcy code dealing with family farmer reorganization temporarily extended 11 times since its or iginal enactment is made permanent by enactment of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act pl 1098 it is amended to include family fisherman as well this report surveys the highlights of this chapter background in 1986 congress added chapte r 12 entitled adjustments of debts of family farmer with regular annual income to the us bankruptcy code1 it was modeled after chapter 13 which governs c onsumer reorganization chapter 12 was created to provide farmers with the opportunity to reorganize and thus to preserve their farms through streamlined and expeditious bankruptcy process intended to respond to the downturn in the farm economy in the 1980s it was c onsidered experimental2 originally enacted as temporary measur with sunset date of october 1 19933 it was extended 11 times4 with enactment of the bankrupt cy abuse prevention and

act bapcpa it became permanent chapter of the us bankruptcy code5 the bapcpa made additional changes to chapter 12 which are discussed below in the absence of chapter 12 insolven t farmers bankruptcy options included reorganization under chapter 11 or 13 or liqui dation under chapter 76 c h p t r 1 1 governs business reorganization and is more expensive and procedurally cumbersome than chapter 12 or 13 chapter 13 was design ed for individuals with regular income or wage earners the nature of farming is ch that many farmers did not realize income on regular schedule comparable to that of wage earners also many farms were not individually owned but are opera ted as corporations or part nerships and when chapter 12 was enacted in 1986 chapter 13 had ju risdictional debt limit of 350000 in secured debt and 100000 in unsecured debt farmer s indebtedness often exceeded that limit so chapter 12 provided ju risdictional debt limit of 1500000 the bapcpa made major revisions to chapter 13 which make it even more unsuitable for farmers than it was previously new requirement for chapter 13 debtors is that disposable income reasonably necessa ry for living expenses retained by debtor and deducted from the amount allocated to repayment of creditors be calculated according to national and local living standards calculated by the internal revenue service irs this requireme nt alone would appear to ma ke chapter 13 wholly unsuited for family farmers and fishermen procedural overview the goal of chapter 12 indeed of all the operative bankruptcy reorganization chapters is to offer debtor means of financial rehabilitation outside of liquidation historically the quid pro quo for reorganization is the debtors obligation to commit postbankruptcy income to prebankruptcy indebtedness7 definition of family farmer and fisherman previously applying only to family farmers the bapcpa amended the chapter to include fishermen for chapter 12 purposes family farmer includes an individual and spouse or fa milyowned partnership or corporation with debts of less than 3237000 50 of which arises from the farming operation the debt or must derive at least 50 of gross annual income from farming8 family fisherman is an individual nd spouse or familyowned partnership or corporation engaged in commercial fi shing operation whose debts are less than 1500000 80 of which arises from the fishing operation the debtor must derive at least 50 of gross annual income from fishing9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20742crs3 10 11 usc 1221 11 11 usc 1224 12 11 usc 109 13 11 usc 1222expedited time frame chapter 11 debtor has at least 120 days four months after filing to submit proposed reorganization plan chap ter 12 debtor must submit proposed plan within 90 days of filing10 and the court must hol d confirmation hearing within 45 days11 only the debtor may propose the reorganization plan which must be completed within specified three to fiveyear time frame the debtors plan must meet the statutory requirements for chapter 12 but unlike chapter 11 creditor committees are not appointed and the plan is not voted on by creditors the debtor receives discharge of indebtedness upon completion of all payments under the plan appointment of standing trustee trustee is rarely appointed under chapter 11 although chapter 12 requires the pa rticipation of standing trustee the trustees duties are administrative and the btor retains possession and control of the farm or fishing operation th roughout the reorganization benefits of chapter 12 as noted above chapter 12 borrowed many debtor friendly features from chapter 13 prior to the bapcpa amendments and adapts some provisions specifically to the needs of chap ter 12 debtors among these provisions are prebankruptcy credit counseling although individual chapter 12 debtors must undergo credit couns eling from an approved nonprofit agency within 180 days prior to filing their ability to receive discharge is not conditioned upon completion of an instruction course on personal financial management as required of chapter 13 debtors12 contents of the plan nonpriority trea tment of certain priority claims the plan may treat certain claims owed to the government that might otherwise be considered priority claims under 507 as nonpriority namely claims owed to governmental unit that arise as result of the s l r t r n s f r f n f r m sset used in the farming operation likewise priority claims for domes tic support that have been assigned to governmental unit may be paid in less than full amount so long as the plan provides that all of the debtors projected disposable income for five years will be applied to payments under the plan sp ecified interest payments on unsecured claims that are nondischargeable may also be minimized13 liberalized cramdown cramdown is term used in bankruptcy law to refer to the procedure which enables debtor to modify creditors claim over the creditors objection chapter 12 debtors are not bound to the absolute priority rule which pplies in chapter 11 hence secured creditors of chapter 12 debtor desp ite objections they may harbor have less ability to influence or reject the reorganization plan than chapter 11 creditors dissenting creditors may object to the debtors reorganizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20742crs4 14 11 usc 1225 15 when secured creditor holds claim in whic h the value of the collateral is less than the contractual amount owed the creditor the bankruptcy code splits or bifurcates it it is treated as secured claim up the value of the collateral and an unsecured claim for the amount which constitutes the discrepancy between the collatera ls value and the contractual amount of the claim 11 usc 506 in other words the clai m of secured creditor is legally protected up to the value of the collateral which secures the claim 16 harmon v united states through farmers home admin 101 f3d 574 8th cir 1996 17 dewsnup v timm 502 us

the objection triggers the c odes requirement that all of the debtors projected disposable inco be applied to plan payments creditors must receive at least as much payout on their claims in chapter 12 as they would if the debtor were liquidated14 bifurcation of liens or lien stripping15 family farmer is permitted to reduce or strip the value of lien on secured property16 hence in situations where there is deflation in the value of the farmproperty the debtor may reduce the amount owed to the secured lender and discharge the unsecured portion lien stripping is not generally permitted in chapter 7 17 although lien stripping is permitted under chapter 11 creditors whose security in terests are bifurcated into secured and unsecured claims have greater power to shape andor veto the debtors reorganization plan chapter 12 also permits repayment of reformed secured claims over peri od of time exceeding the plan period because chapter 12 provides the debtor with expanded authority to renegotiate with lenders its influence may extend to informal renegotiations outside of bankruptcy as well adequate protection and tax requirements any bankruptcy debtor who retains collateral must provide the creditor adequate protection for the value of the collateral subject to the debtors use18 chapter 12 has its own standards for awardi ng adequate protection19 and provision governing special tax provisions20 although chapter 12 was enacted as temporary measure it was continuously extended prior to becoming permanent chapter in the code it has received significant support in the congress the chapter however is not without its critics they question whether the benefits of chapter 12 outweig h its costs whether it encourages economic inefficiency in the farm sector and whether the ability of farmers to write off secured debt has positive impact on agricultural lending21
