or expense up to 250000 of the total cost of certain asse ts placed in service in 2008 within certain limits without such an option firms would have to recover the cost over longer period using current depreciation schedules the rules governing the use of the allowance limit most of its benefits to relatively small firms this report focuses on the economic eff ects of the small business expensing allowance it begins by explaining how the allowance works moves on to summarize its legislative history and describe legislation in the 110th congress to modify the allowance and concludes with discussion of the allowances implications for economic efficiency the distributional effects of the federal income tax and tax administrati on the report will be updated to reflect significant legislative activity there has been substantial bipartisan support for enhancing the expensing allowance in the 110th congress in may 2007 the h ouse and senate passed bill hr 2206 pl 11028 that included an increase in the expensing allowance to 125000 and the phaseout threshold for th allowance to 500000 in 2007 indexing both amounts for inflation from 2008 to 2010 and extending through 2008 the enhanced expensing allowance for qualifie d property used in the gulf opportunity zone then in february 2008 the house and senate approved an economic stimulus bill hr 5140 pl 110185 that boosted the allowance to 250000 and the phaseout threshold to 80000 in 2008 only under current law the allowance will revert to 125000 and the threshold to 500000 in 2009 and 2010 several other bills would permanently enhance the allowance or extend its reach including s 3119 s 3162 and hr 6611 companion bills in the house hr 6587 and senate s 3322 would greatly increase the expensing allowance and phaseout threshold for qua lified assets placed in service in 2008 in areas of the midwest that were declared presidentia l disaster areas in the summer of 2008 the expensing allowance has seemingly minor effect on the composition and allocation of business inves tment the distribution of the federal tax burden among income groups and the cost of tax complia nce for smaller firm s these effects loosely correspond to the three traditi onal criteria for evaluating tax policy efficiency equity and simplicity while the allowance has the potential to spur increased small business investment by reducing the user cost of capital for eligible assets and increasing the cash flow of firms that claim the allowance it can impair economic efficiency by encouraging higher investment in activities yielding relatively low pretax returns at the same time the allowance appears to have measurable impact on the distribution of the fede ral tax burden among income groups in addition it has the advantage of lesse ning the burden of tax compliance by simplifying tax accounting for firms claiming ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31852contents c u r r n t x p n s i n g l l w n c 1 l g i s l t i v h i

business expensing allowance current status legislative proposals and economic effects provided certain conditions are met firms may expense or deduct up to 250000 of the cost of qualified assets they place in service in 2008 some refer to this option for capital cost recovery as the small business expensing allowance because the rules governing its use restrict the options benefits mainly to firms that are relatively small in asset employment or revenue size firms unable to claim the expensing allowance can recover the cost of the same assets over longer periods through claiming allowable depreciation deductions the expensing allowance represents significant tax subsidy for small business investment because it can reduce the marginal effective rate at which the returns to investment in qualified assets are taxed this report examines the current stat us of the small business expensing allowance its main economic effects and initiatives in congress to modify it the report begins by explaining the allowance s design and summarizing its legislative history it then discusses proposals in the 110th congress to alter the current allowance the report concludes with an assessment of the allowances implications for economic efficiency equity and tax administration current expensing allowance under section 179 of the internal reve nue code irc busin ess taxpayers have the option of deducting or expensing the full cost of qualified assets or property they purchase in the year when the assets are placed in service within certain limits business taxpayers that are unable or unwilling to take advantage of this option for capital cost recovery may recover this cost over longer periods by claiming allowable depreciation deductions in 2008 the maximum expensing allowance is 250000 for firms operating outside socalled enterprise and empowerment zones ezs renewal communities rcs and the areas affected the most by hurricane katrina also known as the gulf opportunity zone or goz1 for the sake of clarity this allowance is henceforth referred to as the regular allowance for firms operating within all the special areas except the goz the maximum allowance in 2008 is 285000 for firms located inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31852crs2 the goz the maximum allowance in 2008 for qualified assets purch ased on or after august 28 2005 and placed in service by december 31 2008 is 350000 the regular allowance is scheduled to fall back to 125000 in 2009 and 2010 with each amount indexed for inflation assuming change in current law it is scheduled to revert to 25000 its level before the enactme nt of the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliati on act of 2003 or jgtrra in 2011 and each year thereafter for firms operating outside th special areas in the same period the allowance will fall to 60000 for firms operating in all the special areas except the goz and to 125000 for firms operating in the goz business taxpayers choose the expensing option by following rules set forth by the internal revenue service irs under irs regulation 11795 these taxpayers may make or revoke an elec tion under irc section 179 for property placed in service through 2010 without the consent of the irs commissioner by submitting an amended tax return for the tax year in question for tax years beginning in 2011 an expensing election may be revoked only with the consent of the commissioner firms in all lines of business may claim the regular expensing allowance the same is true of the enhanced expensing allowance available to firms operating in the special areas with certain exceptions more specifically the allowance does not apply to qualified property placed in service in the following establishments located in ezs rcs and the newly created goz private or commercial golf courses country clubs massage parlors hottub and suntan facilities stores whose principal business is the sale of coholic beverages racetrack s and facilities used for gambling qualified property is define d as certain new and used depreciable assets as specified in irc section 1245a3 acqui red for use in the active conduct of trade or business with few notable ex ceptions this property consists of business machines and equipment used in conn ection with manufact uring or production extraction transporta tion communica tions electricity gas water and sewage disposal transportation equipment with an unloaded gross weight of more than 6000 pounds may be expensed but not h eating and air conditioning units in addition packaged computer software ac quired for business use may be expensed through 2009 most buildings and their structural components do not qualify for the regular allowance although research and bulk storage facilities do qualify in the case of firms located in the goz however certain residential and commercial properties do qualify the maximum amount of qualified propert that may be expensed in single tax year under irc section 179 is subject to two limitations dollar limitation and an income limitation under the dollar limitation the regular expe nsing allowance is reduced by the amount by which the total cost of qualifie d property placed in service during the year exceeds phaseout threshold but in the case of firms operating in ezs rcs and the nylz the expensing allowance is redu ced by half of the amount by which the cost of qualified property placed in service in tax year exceeds the threshold the threshold is set at 800000 in 2008 for all firms except those operating in the gozhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31852crs3 2 like the maximum expensing allowance the phaseout threshold is indexed for inflation in 2004 through 2010 in 2003 the threshold was 400000 in 2004 410000 in 2005 420000 in 2006 430000 and in 2007 500000 which face threshold of 14000002 as result of this dollar limitation business taxpayer operating outside the goz and th other special areas may expense none of the cost of qualified property it places in rvice in 2008 when the total cost of that property equals or exceeds 1050000 for exampl if such firm were to place in service qualified property whose total co st in 2008 were to come to 750000 it would be allowed to deduct the entire amount under irc section 179 the threshold for the regular allowan ce is scheduled to fall back to 500000 in 2009 and 2010 it is indexed for inflation in both years assuming change in current law the threshold is scheduled to revert to its pre jgtrra level of 200000 in 2011 and each year thereafter under the income limitati on the expensing allowance firm claims cannot exceed the taxable income including wages and salaries it earns from the active conduct of the trade or busine ss in which the qualified asse ts are used for example if the firm in the above example were to have taxable income in 2008 of 25000 in the business in which the qua lified property is used it w ould be able to claim maximum expensing allowance of 25000 instead of the 750000 it otherwise would be entitled to claim although busin ess taxpayers may not carry forward any expensing allowance lost because of th dollar limitation they may carry forward an allowance denied because of the income limitation in addition to the expensing allowance business taxpayers were able to claim temporary 30 firstyear deprecia tion deduction under the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107 147 or temporary 50 firstyear depreciation deduction under jobs and grow th tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra pl 10826 both deductions pplied to new but not used property depreciable under the modifi ed accelerated cost recove ry system macrs and having recovery period of less than 20 years qualified pr operty acquired between september 11 2001 and december 31 2004 and placed in service before january 1 2005 was eligible for the 30 depreci ation deduction th 50 deduction was available for qualified property bought between may 6 2003 and january 1 2005 and placed in service by january 1 2006 business taxpayer s were permitted to claim either the 30 or th 50 deduction but not both the economic stimulus act of 2008 pl 110185 reinstated the temporary 50 firstyear depreciation deduction that expired at th end of 2006 it applies to the same set of depreciable assets targeted by the earlie r deduction to benefit from the partial expensing allowance firm must buy qualified assets and place them in service between january 1 2008 and decem ber 31 2008 an exception is made for certain assets eg aircraft with relatively long produc tion periods the allowance expires at the end of 2008 for property eligible for both the expens ing and special depreciation allowances firm is required to recover the propertys co st in prescribed order the expensinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31852crs4 allowance must be claimed first reducing the taxpayers basis in the property by the amount of the allowance then the taxpayer may apply the 50 firstyear depreciation allowance to any remaining basis further reducing the taxpayers basis in the property finally the taxpayer may claim depreciati on allowance under the macrs on any remaining basis using the most advantageous depreciation method which is the double declining balance method legislative history of the expensing allowance the expensing allowance under irc secti on 179 originated as special first year depreciation allowance included in the small business tax revision act of 1958 pl 85866 it was intended to re duce the tax burden on small business owners stimulate small busin ess investment and simplif tax accounting for smaller firms the deduction was limited to 2000 4000 in the case of married couple filing joint return of the cost of new and used business machines and equipment with depreciation life of six or more years this allowance remained in force til the passage of th economic recovery tax act of 1981 erta pl 9734 erta replaced the special deduction with maximum expensing allowa nce of 5000 and specified timetable for gradually increasing the allowance to 10000 by 1986 despite these changes few firms took advantage of the new allowance some anal ysts ascribed such tepid response to the limitations on the use of the investment tax credit also established by erta business taxpayer claiming the credit for the purchase of an asset that also was eligible for the expensing allowance could claim the credit only for the portion of the assets cost that was not expensed for many firms the potential tax savings from claiming the credit ev idently outweighed the potential tax savings from claiming both the credit and the allowance faced with large and growing federa l budget deficits in the early 1980s congress passed the defi cit reduction act of 1984 pl 98369 which among other things postponed from 1986 to 1990 the scheduled increase in the maximum expensing allowance to 10000 claims for the allowance rose markedly following the repeal of the investment tax credit by the tax reform act of 1986 the maximum allowance reached 10000 in 1990 as scheduled and remained at that amount until the passage of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra93 pl 10366 obra93 retroactiv ely raised the maximum allowance to 17500 as of january 1 1993 nd added variety of tax benefits for special areas known as enterprise zones and empowerment z ones ezs one of these benefits was an expensing allowance for qualified assets placed in service in special area that was 20000 above the regular allo wance with phaseout threshold twice as large as the phaseout threshold for the regular llowance to be designated as an ez an area had to satisfy variety of eligibility criteria relating to population poverty rate and geographic size with the passage of the small busi ness job protection act of 1996 pl 104 188 the regular allowance embarked on nother upward path the act raised thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31852crs5 maximum allowance to 18000 in 1997 18500 in 1998 19000 in 1999 20000 in 2000 24000 in 2001 and 2002 and 25000 in 2003 and thereafter through the community renewal ta x relief act of 2000 pl 106544 congress expanded the list of special areas to include socalled renewal communities rcs and granted them the same tax benefits available to ezs including an enhanced expensing allowan ce the act also increased the maximum allowance for qualified assets placed in service in tax year in the special areas including rcs to 35000 above the regular allowance in response to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 c ongress established variety of tax benefits through the j ob creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107147 to encourage new business investment in the section of lower manhattan in new york city that bore the brunt of the attacks on the world trade center the act designated this area the new york liberty zone among the tax benefits offered to firms located in th zone was the same enhanced expensing allowance available for qualifie d investments in ezs and rcs the regular allowance remained on the upward path laid down by the small business jobs protection act until the doption of jgtrra under jgtrra the maximum regular allowance rose fourfo ld to 100000 in may 2003 and was to stay at that amount in 2004 and 2005 before returning to 25000 in 2006 and thereafter jgtrra also raised the phaseout threshold to 400000 over the same period indexed both the regular allowance and th threshold for inflation in 2004 and 2005 and added offtheshelf soft ware for business use to the list of depreciable assets eligible for expensing in 2003 through 2005 under the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca pl 108357 the changes in the allowance made by jgt rra were extended another two years or through 2007 in an effort to spur economic recovery in the areas of louisiana mississippi and alabama devastated by hurricane katr ina congress passed the gulf opportunity zone act of 2005 pl 109135 among othe r things the act designated these areas as the gulf opportunity zone goz and offered variety of tax incentives for new business investment in the goa including an enhanced expensing allowance for qualified assets purchased on or after august 28 2005 and placed in service by december 31 2007 the expensing allowance can be as much as 100000 above the regular allowance in addition it begi ns to phase out when the total cost of qualified assets placed in service by business taxpayer in tax year exceeds threshold that is 600000 above the phaseout threshold for the regular allowance finally the range of assets eligible for the enhanced allowance is greater than that for the regular allowance the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 pl 109222 extended the changes in the allowa nce made by jgtrra through 2009 finally in passing the us troop readin ess veterans care katrina recovery and iraq appropriations act 2007 pl 11028 congress extended the changes in the allowance made by jgtrra throug h 2010 raised the maximum allowance tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31852crs6 125000 and the phaseout threshold to 500000 in 2007 to 2010 and indexed both amounts for inflation from 2008 through 2010 the act also extended through 2008 the enhanced expensing allowance for qualified assets placed in service in the goz congress boosted the allowance to 250000 and the phaseout threshold to 800000 in 2008 only by passing the econo mic stimulus act of 2008 p l 110 185 those amounts revert back to 125000 and 500000 in 2009 and 2010 respectively legislative initiatives in the 110th congress legislative activity in recent congresses demonstrated that there was broad bipartisan support for enhancing the expe nsing allowance as means of both spurring increased business investment nd funneling aid to sm all business owners by all accounts this support remains as robust as ever in the current congress bills to extend the enhancements in the regular allowance made by jgtrra and to enhance temporarily the current allowance as way to spur faster domestic economic growth have been enacted other bills to further enhance the allowance on permanent basis have been introduced between late march and midmay 2007 th house and senate passed two bills hr 1591 and hr 2206 that included fu rther enhancements of the expensing allowance

showed renewed interest in using the allowance as tool for stimulating faster economic growth in early 2008 on january 24 the leaders of the house and the bush administration announced they had

billion from fy2009 to fy20184 economic effects of the expensing allowance to many lawmakers the expensing allowance represents desirable policy tool for aiding small business owners and s timulating the economy at the same time to many small business owners th allowance represents desirable tax benefit but to most public finance economists the allowance has economic effects that extend beyond its implications for the tax burden of small business owners in their view the allowance may affect the allocation of investment capital within the private sector the distribution of the federal ta x burden among major income groups and the cost of tax compliance for smaller firms these effects loosely correspond to the three traditional criteria for evaluating tax policy efficiency equity and simplicity each is discussed below efficiency effects efficiency lies at the heart of economic theory and analysis it refers to the allocation of resources in an economy and how it shapes the welfare of consumers and producers when such an allocation generates the greatest possible economic surplus defined as the total value to buyers of the goods and services theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31852crs8 5 according to unpublished irs estimates tota l of 55161 billion in assets eligible for the irc section 179 expensing allowance were placed in service in 2003 firms with assets of 10 billion or less accounted for 49 of this in vestment whereas firms with assets of 100 billion or more accounted for 16consume minus the total cost to sellers of providing these goods and services the allocation is said to be efficient but when an allocation is less than efficient some of the possible gains from exchange among buyers and sellers are not being realized for example an allocation is deemed ine fficient when most suppliers of good fail to produce it at the lowest marginal cost permitted by existing technologies in this case shift in supply from relatively hi ghcost producers to relatively lowcost producers driven perhaps by an unleashing of market forces would lower the total economic cost of providing the good ther eby raising the overall economic surplus one important policy issue raised by the small business expensing allowance concerns its effect on the allocation of resources in general and the allocation of investment capital within the private sector in particular in theory all taxes except lumpsum taxes lead to inefficient outcomes because they influence the decisions of consumers and producers in ways that leave one group or the other or both worse off nonlumpsum taxes have this effect because they inevitably distort the incentives facing individual and business taxpayers leading them to allocate resources according to the effects of the ta xes on the costs and benefits of the goods and services they buy and sell rather than their actual costs and benefits such distortion entails what economists call deadweight loss which is condition where the amount of revenue raised by tax is less than the loss of economic welfare it engenders the expensing allowance has the potential to affect the allocation of resources in the us economy by encouraging firms ab to claim it to i nvest in assets that qualify for the allowance possibly at the expense of other more productive assets there are two channels through which the allowance can have such an effect the more important of the two is thought to be reduction in the user cost of capital for investment in qualified assets relative to all other assets second channel is temporary increase in the cash flow or intern funds available to firms that purchase qualified assets restraining the allowances influence over the allocation of resources is its phaseout threshold which effectively confines the benefits of the allowance to firms that are relatively small in asset size5 as one would expect the user cost of capital plays major role in firms investment decisions this cost enco mpasses both the opportunity cost of an investment and the direct costs of that i nvestment such as depreciation the cost of the asset and income taxes in effect the user cost of capital determines the aftertax rate of return an investment must earn in order to be profitable and thus worth undertaking in general the higher the user cost of capital the fewer profitable projects firm can undertake and the lower its desired capital stock when change in tax policy decreases the user cost of capital many firms can be expected to respond by increasing the amount of capital they wish to own boosting overall business investment in the short runhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31852crs9 6 the user cost of capital is the real rate of return an investment project must earn to be profitable in theory firm will undertake an investment provided the aftertax rate of return exceeds or at least equals the user cost of capital rosen has expressed this cost in terms of simple equation let c stand for the user cost of capital for the purchase price of an asset r for the aftertax rate of return d for the economic rate of depreciation t for the corporate tax rate z for the present value of depreciation deductions flowing from 1 investment and k for the investment tax credit rate then c x r d x 1 t x zk1 t under expensing z is equal to one by plugging assumed values for each variable into the equation one sees that c increases as z gets smaller thus of all possible methods of depreciation expensing yields the lowest user cost of capital for more details see harvey s rosen public finance 6th ed new york mcgrawhillirwin 2002 pp 407409 7 in 1995 study douglas holtzeakin compared the cost of capital for an investment under two scenarios for cost recovery in one the corporation making the investment used expensing to recover the cost of the investme nt and in the other the cost was recovered under the schedules and methods permitted by the modified accelerated cost recovery system he further assumed that the interest rate was 9 the inflation rate 3 and the rate of economic depreciation for the asset acquire d through the investment 133 not only did expensing substantially reduce the cost of cap ital its benefit was proportional to the firms marginal tax rate specifically holtzeakin found that at tax rate of 15 expensing lowered the cost of capital by 11 at tax ra of 25 the reduction was 19 and at tax rate of 35 the cost of capital was 28 wer see douglas holtzeakin should small businesses be taxfavored national tax journal september 1995 p 389 8 for discussion of the economic logic behind such an outcome see jane g gravelle effects of the 1981 deprecia tion revisions on the taxation of income from business capital national tax journal march 1982 p 5how does expensing affect the user cost of capital expensing is the most accelerated form of deprecia tion under expensing the entire cost of an asset is written off in its first year of use rega rdless of the assets actual or useful life allowing firm to expense its acquisition of an asset is equivalent to the us treasury providing the firm or its owners with tax rebate equal to the firms marginal tax rate multiplied by the cost of the asset accelerated depreciation along with other investment tax subsidies such as an investment tax credit reduces the user cost of capital by lowering the pretax rate of return on investment firm must earn in order to realize desired aftertax rate of return6 expensing yields the largest possible reduction in the user cost of capital from accelerated depreciation this reduction can be considerable7 how beneficial is expensing one way to illustrate the tax benefit from expensing is to show how it affects the marginal effective tax rate on the returns to investment in an asset that is expensed for tax purposes expensing has the effect of taxing the stream of income earned by an asset over its lifetime at marginal effective rate of zero8 this is because expensing reduces the aftertax returns and costs for eligible investments by the same factor an investors marginal tax rate for example if the income received by small business owner is taxed at rate of 35 and depreciable asset he or she buys is expensed then the federal government effectively becomes partner in the investme nt with an interest of 35 through the tax code the federal governme nt assumes 35 of the cost of the asset by allowing its entire cost to be deducted in the first year of the assets use and it receives 35 of the income earned by the investment in subsequent years conversely expensinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31852crs10 9 raquel meyer alexander expensing in the encyclopedia of taxation and tax policy joseph j cordes robert d ebel and jane g gravelle eds washington urban institute press 2005 p 129 10 in the realm of business finance the term cash flow can take on different meanings here it denotes the difference between firms revenue and its payments for all the factors or inputs used to generate its output including capital equipment 11 for review of the recent literature on this topic see r glenn hubbard capital market imperfections and investment journal of economic literature vol 36 march 1998 pp 193225allows the small business owner to receive 65 of the returns from the investment but to bear only 65 of the cost such an outcome implies that for each dollar spent on the asset the owner earns the same rate of return after ta xes as before taxes9 expensing could also support sustai ned rise in business investment by augmenting the cash flow of firms that re ly heavily on internal funds or retained earnings to finance the bulk of their investments and have positive net incomes10 expensing can increase firms cash flow in the short run because it allows the firm to deduct the full cost of qualified assets it purchases in the tax year when they are placed into service there are variety of reasons why firms investments could hinge on its cash flow one is that the fi rms owners or seni or managers want to limit their exposure to external debt and the risks it entails another reason is that the firm has limited or access to debt and quity markets mainly because of lack of accurate information on its assets strategies or prospects for achieving relatively high rates of return on equity for firm in such position the cost of internal funds could be lower than the cost of external funds in which case the firm and its owners would be better off if the firm were to fina nce most of its investments out of retained earnings what is unclear is how increases in cash flow in the aggregate affect overall business investment some studies ve found significant positive correlation between changes in firms net worth or supply of internal f unds and its investment spending11 what is more this correlation wa s strongest for firms facing serious obstacles to raising funds in debt and equity markets because of insufficient information on the part of investors or nders nevertheless it would be mistake to interpret these findings as conclusive evidence that firms with relatively high cash flows invest more than firms with relatively low or negative cash flows after all strong correlation between two variable factors does not prove the existence of causeandeffect relationship between them it may be the case that firms with relatively high cash flows invest more on average than firms with relatively low cash flows for reasons that have little or nothing to do with the relative cost of internal and external funds the link be tween cash flow and business investment is complicated further research is needed to clarify it is there reason to believe that the expensing allowance has contributed to shifts in the size and composition of the domestic capital stock in the 25 years the allowance has existed in its present form this question is difficult to answer because there are studies analyzing the impact of the allowance on capital formation over time and empirical evidence is incomplete given that the expensinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31852crs11 12 two studies from the

obtained via email from the statistics of income division at irs on march 21 2006allowance lowers the cost of capital and may boost cash flow for many firms able to claim it and that investment in many of the assets eligible for the allowance seems somewhat sensitive to reductions in the cost of capital one might be justified in concluding that the allowance has caused dom estic investment in those assets to be greater than it otherwise would have been12 yet there are equally compelling reasons to infer that much of this investment would have taken place without the expensing allowance13 most economists would proba bly agree that investment in assets eligible for the expensing allowance is likely to be driven more by business expectations for future growth in sales the nature of the capital goods themselves and conditions in debt and equity ma rkets than by tax considerations14 this view finds some support in availa ble data on use of the expensing allowance although 22 of corporations filin g federal tax returns cla imed the allowance from 1999 through 2003 the total value of irc secti on 179 property placed in service was equal to only 5 of domestic gross investment in equipment and computer software15 when seen through the lens of conve ntional economic theory the expensing allowance acts like drain on efficiency that may worsen the deadweight loss caused by the federal tax code under the reas onable assumption that the amount of capital in the economy is fixed in the short r tax subsidy like the allowance has the potential to lure some capital away from highly profitable productive uses and into taxfavored uses conventi onal economic theory holds that in an economy free of significant market failures and dominated by competitive markets policy of neutral or uniform taxation of capital income would minimize the efficiency losses brought on by income taxation the expensing allowance however subtly encourages investment in specific assets by relatively small firms such subsidy can interfere with the flow of financial capital to its mo st profitable uses by making it possible for business owners to earn higher aftertax rates of return on investment in assets eligible for the allowance than on investment in other assets with higher expected pretax rates of return in addition the expensing allowance give s firms able to claim it an incentive to restrain their growth this unintended incentive stems from the rise in marginal effective tax rates on the income earned by an asset eligible for the allowance in

this incentive effect tax on growth by small firms17 equity effects equity is another basic concept in economic analysis it generally refers to the distribution of income among the individua ls or households in geographic area in the context of income taxation equity usually denotes the distribution of the tax burden among taxpayers divided into income groups economists who analyze the equity effects of income taxes tend to focus on two distinct kinds of equity horizontal equity and verti cal equity tax system is said to be horizontally equitable if it imposes similar burdens on individuals with similar incomes or standards of living and tax system is said to be vertically equitable if the burdens it imposes vary according to an individua ls or households ability to pay the principle of vertical equ ity provides the foundation for any progressive income tax system under such system an individuals total tax liability measured as fraction of income rises with income the current federal income tax system seems to lean more in the direction of vertical equity than horizontal equity many individuals with similar incomes before taxes end up being taxed at the same marginal rate but because of various tax preferences in the form of deductions pr eferential rates deferrals exclusions exemptions and credits enacted over many years significant share of individuals with similar beforetax incomes also end up being taxed at significantly different rates at the same time those with relatively high pretax incomes are generally taxed at significantly higher rates than those with relatively low pretax incomes the expensing allowance constitutes tax preference albeit one targeted at business investment in certain assets how does it affect vertical and horizontal equity to answer this question it is necessary to consider the tax benefits associated with the expensing allowance who receives them and how they affect the recipients federal income tax burdens the main tax benefit generated by the allowance is reduction in the marginal effective tax rate on the income earned by assets eligible for the allowance how much of re duction depends critica lly on the proportion of the assets cost that is expensed as was noted earlier if the entire cost is expensed then the marginal effective rate falls to zero nevertheless the allowance does

the actual marginal rates at which this income is taxed this is because accelerated depreciation does not in theory reduce the total am ount of taxes measured in current dollars that will be paid on an assets expected stream of income over its useful life rather accelerated depreciation simply changes the timing of depreciation deducti ons in ways that substantially boost the present discounted value of the tax saving s from depreciation allowances most of the assets eligible for the allowance are owned by smaller firms as result it would be reasonable to assume that most of the tax savings generated by the allowance end up in the pockets of small business owners but such an inference is implausible since the allowance does not alter the income tax rates facing small business owners and thus has direct effect on the distribution of the federal income tax burden among income groups as the allowance leaves the distributional effects of the income tax unc hanged it has impact on ver tical or horizontal equity tax administration yet another interesting policy question raised by the expensing allowance concerns its impact on the cost of tax compliance for business taxpayers most public finance economists would agree that desirable income tax system is one that imposes relatively low costs for administration and compliance research has shown that the administrative cost of tax system hinges on three factors 1 the records that must be kept in order to comply with tax laws 2 the complexity of those laws and 3 the types of income subject to taxation many public finance economists would so agree that the current federal income tax system fails this crucial test in their view the costs of collecting income taxes and enforcing compliance with the tax laws are needlessly high and the primary cause is the complexity of the federal tax code many small business owners have long complained about the costly burdens imposed on them by the record keeping and filings required by the federal income tax the expensing allowance addresses this concern by simplifying tax accounting for firms able to claim it less time nd paperwork are involved in writing off the entire cost of depreciable asset in its firs t year of use than in recovering that cost over longer period applying complicated depreciation schedules at the same time the rules governing the use of the credit in and out of specially designated areas add layer of complexity to the administration of the allowance by the irs tax simplification has long been key policy objective for most small business owners largely because of the relatively high costs they must bear in complying with federal tax laws these cost s were examined in 2001 study prepared for the office of advocacy of the small business administration according to the study the cost per employee for tax compliance in 2000 was an estimated 665 for all firms 1202 for firms with fewer than 20 employees 625 for firms with 20 to 499 employees and 562 for firms with 500 or more employees18
