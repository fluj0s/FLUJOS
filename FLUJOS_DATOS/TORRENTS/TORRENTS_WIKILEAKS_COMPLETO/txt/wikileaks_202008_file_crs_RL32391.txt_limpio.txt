analyst in science and technology policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress smallscale terrorist attacks using biological and chemical agents an assessment framework and preliminary comparisons summary this report which will be updated as necessary presents means of assessing the relative threat from terroristuse of individual chemical biological and toxin agents it focuses on smallscale targeted chemical and biological attacks rather than masscasualty attacks the framework considers the elements of access public health impact medical treatment prophylaxis and dissemination other factors that may affect potential use by terrorists include the range of lethality covert employment of an agent and the availability of dualuse technologies the results of this framework may be useful in addressing the threat these agents pose for example by indicating priorities for countermeasure funding other uses include weighing the potential effectiveness of policy options assessing threat reduction approaches to specific agents and serving as resource for developing other specialized frameworks defense against chemical and biological agents is high on the list of the nations priorities clear consensus exists with respect to which agents pose the greatest threat previous analyses of the chemical and biological threat have largely revolved around historical and comparative treatments or been based in military framework examination of the chemical and biological threat to civilians is more complicated agents whose characteristics make them poor military weapons may still be powerful if deployed as weapons of terror chemical and biological weapons used in the past have not always been chosen for the highest potential fatalities but rather for other reasons some chemical and biological agents are closely regulated both domestically and internationally expansion or further refinement of policies controlling these agents may lower the threat posed by terrorist use of them domestic policy options to reduce the threat posed by these agents include methods to prevent their use consequence management after their use and methods for protecting the public from them specific policies to implement these goals include improving the general public health system increasing prophylaxis research development of new medical countermeasures treatments increasing intelligence gathering and increasing regulation of dualuse technology international policy options include development of new biosecurity agreements and increasing participation in current non proliferation organizations it is impossible to eliminate the risk of chemical or biological terrorism important issues facing policymakers include balancing the need for increased security with the potential economic costs associated with increased regulation and redirected federal resources determining the relative ratio between general and specific countermeasures against chemical and biological terrorism and assessing the success of federal efforts at reducing chemical and biological terrorism vulnerability contents

chemical agents an assessment framework and preliminary comparisons introduction public concern about the nations vulnerability to chemical and biological cb terrorism was amplified by the consequences of the anthrax mailings that sickened 22 people and killed 5 between september and november 2001 subsequent cb terrorism events such as the ricin mailings to the white house in 2003 and to the senate in 2004 have served to highlight the potential for future terrorist attacks using cb agents cb weapons previously considered to be of interest mainly to military planners are now topic of public and congressional interest compared with most conventional weapons cb weapons are less well understood and have the potential to cause mass casualties even if used in smaller attacks cb weapons have the potential to cause mass terror potential effects of cb terrorist event vary widely depending on the agent used the effectiveness of its dissemination the target struck and the public reaction to the event this report addresses the potential terrorist use of cb agents including toxins the focus of this report is on smallscale targeted chemical and biological attacks in this framework manufacture and dissemination of modest amounts of material able to cause significant casualties in building subway station or other enclosed space rather than on citywide scale are discussed this approach attempts to analyze the threat posed by various agents if used by small nonstatesponsored terrorist groups that may lack the technology expertise or logistical capability to mount large masscasualty attack to provide policymakers with background and analysis for prioritization of federal resources this framework summarizes the characteristics of each agent into broad categories with coarse scale rather than highly differentiated multidimensional ranking it is likely that policymakers will find more detailed analysis than that presented here helpful when refining policy alternatives reports that discuss chemical and biological agents must be careful not to provide terrorist groups with information or opportunities that are not already known to them this report follows the precedent set by other publications in this field by not providing detailed information on the cb agents discussed herein1 it does not 1 publications in the cb arena include richard falkenrath robert d newman and bradley thayer americas achilles heel nuclear biological and chemical terrorism and covert attack cambridge ma mit press 1998 joshua lederberg ed biological continued crs2 contain any technical information regarding the growth or synthesis of biological or chemical agents furthermore all information in this report has been compiled solely from reports in the open literature classified information was used in the preparation of this report it raises issues expressed by other analysts in disparate open sources with regard to current terrorist motivational factors the material in this report is designed to be used as potential springboard to assess and prioritize responses to the various cb agents that might be used by terrorist it provides potential policy framework for use by congress as it considers legislative issues associated with the potential use of such agents by terrorists some previous assessments of the cb threat have highlighted the difficulty of developing and producing agents but these assessments may ignore significant advances in the areas of dualuse technology2 such technology may significantly ease cb agent production by small groups additionally concerns have been raised about the applicability of previous assessments especially those developed using military framework to civilian settings and casualties the classification of cb weaponry into the catchall category of weapons of mass destruction wmd has led to consideration of cb use primarily on masscasualty scale3 this treatment may misstate the potential civilian vulnerability to smallscale terrorist cb attack treatment of terrorist attacks on masscasualty scale has produced many worstcase scenarios but few assessments of the wide spectrum of potential cb agents the merging of all unconventional highconsequencelowprobabilityofuse weapons into single category is advantageous for some military planning but can obfuscate assessment of each weapon type or individual agent all of the weapons of mass destruction differ from each other significantly in effect effort required for development and production and dissemination while the impact of nuclear and radiological devices varies largely depending on the size of the device the impact of different chemical and biological agents has wider variation for example the agent used can determine if the result is temporary impairment injury and disfigurement 1 continued weapons limiting the threat cambridge ma mit press 1999 bill frist when every moment counts what you need to know

health organization health aspects of chemical and biological weapons geneva world health organization 1970 9899 crs3 or widespread death this report treats cb agents alone rather than assessing wmd to better address the threat posed by individual cb agents addressing events with smallscale casualties generally has been outside the purview of previous assessments though smallscale terrorism is noted as being more likely than masscasualty events4 after the events of october 2001 smallscale terror events also concern the public it is concern for policymakers that analyses on and preparations against largescale chemical and biological attacks may not be widely applicable to events occurring on smaller scales this concern was expressed in the first annual report of the advisory panel to assess the domestic response capabilities of the government for terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction also known as the gilmore commission looking at lower probabilityhigher consequence scenarios it stated such scenarios however are at odds with the focus of current policy and preparedness efforts which have been based on less than comprehensive information and analysis which seem to emphasize the lowerprobabilityhigherconsequence attacks at the expense of higherprobabilitylowerconsequence incidents the guiding assumption has been that smallerscale nonmasscasualty events are lesserincluded contingency that can be addressed adequately by preparations for the higherend mass casualty attacks this is by means axiomatic5 to address these concerns this report focuses on smallerscale targeted terror attacks rather than addressing cb weapons in masscasualty framework this report establishes an assessment framework for cb agents to help policymakers develop riskmanagement based policies to counter terrorist use of cb agents vulnerability threat and risk are related terms vulnerability represents the impact an event could have and contains measures of protection and preparedness threat represents the probability that given event will occur and contains measures of both capability and intention risk is the combination of vulnerability with threat risk management approaches rely on reducing vulnerability threat or both to lower the overall risk of attack the assessment framework presented here is generic in the sense that it does not incorporate the motivations or capability of specific terrorist organization risk assessment of specific terrorist organizations likelihood of using cb weapons would incorporate these factors independent think tanks and federal government agencies have developed and modeled scenarios through exercises including federal and local officials to assess the potential impact of cb attack these exercises provide vulnerability assessment rather than threat or risk assessment the potential public threat posed 4 see the advisory panel to assess the domestic response capabilities of the government for terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction the first annual report to the president and the congress of the advisory panel to assess the domestic response capabilities of the government for terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction i assessing the threat dec 15 1999 available online from rand at httpwwwrandorgorganizationnsrdterrpanel 5 ibid crs4 by cb terrorism is not accurately assessed through the development of worstcase scenario exercises such as dark winter topoff topoff 2 and others67 these exercises are instructive in establishing the united states current cb vulnerability but they do not assess many factors needed to understand the cb risk for example it is unclear whether the pathogens chosen for the exercises smallpox and pneumonic plague respectively represent agents likely to be chosen by terrorist without understanding the range of likely cb agents rather than the range of possible cb agents it is difficult to convert vulnerability assessments into threat assessments therefore it is difficult to make effective policy based strictly on vulnerability assessments the general accounting office gao has advocated using riskmanagement approach rather than vulnerability assessments to limit the potential damage done by cb attack8 background definition of cb terrorism there are several federal definitions of terrorism9 for example the us department of defense dod defines terrorism as the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political 6 the johns hopkins center for civilian biodefense strategies in collaboration with the center for strategic and international studies the analytic services institute for homeland security and the oklahoma national memorial institute for the prevention of terrorism held seniorlevel exercise in june 2001 entitled dark winter that simulated covert smallpox attack on the united states review of the dark winter exercise can be found in tara otoole michael mair and thomas v inglesby shining light on dark winter clinical infectious

accounting office homeland security risk management approach can guide preparedness efforts gao02208t october 2001 and general accounting office bioterrorism coordination and preparedness gao02129t october 2001 9 for an overview of the statutory language defining terrorism see crs report rs21021 terrorism and related terms in statute and regulation selected language by elizabeth martin crs5 religious or ideological10 the us department of justice doj defines terrorism as the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce government the civilian population or any segment thereof in furtherance of political or social objectives11 because of differences in federal definitions of terrorism especially in the areas of threatened use and articulation of goals this report uses more encompassing definition for cb terrorism for the purposes of this report cb terrorism refers to the use of chemical or biological agents by individuals or groups motivated by ideology but not necessarily accompanied by stated political or social agenda12 by using this definition attacks which have large apparently random component to them may be included as terrorist events13 this definition includes several cb terrorist events to date such as the ricin mailings in 2003 and 2004 the anthrax mailings in 2001 the aum shinrikyo sarin gas attack in tokyo in 199514 and the rajneeshees use of salmonella poisoning in oregon in 198415 probability of cb weapon attack most experts agree that the probability of cb attack on domestic target remains much smaller than that of comparably damaging attack with conventional arms the instantaneous consequence of greater access to and relative ease of using conventional weapons all contribute to the likelihood of conventional weapon use additionally terrorist organizations have historically chosen to use proven attack methods rather than attempt attacks with less wellestablished technologies16 experts debate whether cb agents have become weapons with special value to potential terrorists due to their psychological effect on the public some experts have 10 us department of defense dod dictionary of military and associated terms joint publication 102 as amended through december 17 2003 11 28 cfr 085 also see us department of justice terrorism in the united states federal bureau of investigation 1999 12 the definition used here closely follows that used by w seth carus in bioterrorism and biocrimes the illicit use of biological agents since 1900 center for counterproliferation research washington dc national defense university 2001 13 this definition is not the broadest definition for terrorism as it excludes actions taken by nationstates and does not require that the victims of terrorism be noncombatants 14 for an overview of the aum shinrikyo use of sarin in the tokyo subway system see david kaplan aum shinrikyo 1995 in toxic terror assessing terrorist use of

1984 in toxic terror assessing terrorist use of chemical and biological weapons op cit 16 see for example bruce hoffman holy terror the implications of terrorism motivated by religious imperative rand document p7834 1993 crs6 asserted that terrorist groups will continue to escalate the level of violence employed including cb agents so that reaction and attention is drawn to their actions17 some experts feel that it is simply matter of time until terrorists begin using cb weapons in earnest in 1999 washington post opinion article then defense secretary cohen stated also looming is the chance that these terror weapons will find their way into the hands of individuals and independent groups fanatical terrorists and religious zealots beyond our borders brooding loners and selfproclaimed apocalyptic prophets at home this is not hyperbole it is reality18 in may 2002 defense secretary rumsfeld told the senate appropriations committee they terrorists inevitably will get their hands on them weapons of mass destruction and they will not hesitate to use them19 experts holding this view believe it is matter of when rather than if terrorists will use cb or other wmd technology against civilian targets other experts believe that the historical record shows few successful attempts at cb terrorism and that past trends are relevant to future assessments for example milton leitenberg senior fellow at the center for international and security studies at the university of maryland has written the threat assessment most particularly regarding bw terrorism the potential for bw use by nonstate actors has been greatly exaggerated20 some experts claim that the ease of using conventional weapons so heavily outweighs the potential benefits of using more challenging unconventional method that it makes cb terrorism unlikely anthony h cordesman arleigh burke chair in strategy at the center for strategic and international studies stated most terroristextremist attacks to date on americans inside and outside the us have used conventional explosives and the 1993 world trade center and oklahoma city bombings show that such attacks can be very costly21 the publics response to highly visible acts of property destruction may provide disincentive for cb agent usage groups accustomed to shocking the populace 17 see for example jeffrey d simon the growing threat of bioterrorism

america asymmetric and terrorist attacks with biological weapons center for strategic and international studies february 12 2001 crs7 through infrastructure destruction may choose to use conventional weapons rather than unconventional arms because of the greater visual display of property destruction also cb agent development requires greater time and financial investment than development of conventional explosives and it demands higher degree of training groups may not be able or willing to invest such high proportion of resources in unconventional weapons given the relative ease of obtaining and using conventional weapons finally the effects of cb agents are more unpredictable than conventional weapons and may be delayed in time this uncertainty may make them less likely to be chosen by terrorist group especially group with limited resources or opportunity22 in contrast some analysts point out that the changing nature of terrorist organizations may lower the barriers for those groups who wish to use chemical or biological agents23 historically terrorist groups tended to possess clear defined political aims and easily identified constituents these groups activities were constrained by the cultural and moral beliefs of their constituents including the general aversion to the use of chemical or biological agents additionally the potential for disease transmission from an infected terrorist target to terrorist supporter was viewed as barrier to biological terrorism recently terrorist groups bearing fundamentalist extremist view lacking clear political goals and having diffuse less easily identified constituency have become more common many analysts suspect that the taboo against use of cb agents has weakened since these groups may be less susceptible to traditional deterrents and may be less concerned with maintaining high level of legitimacy to their constituents changes in political makeup of these groups also may result in reassessment of the terrorists choice between conventional and unconventional arms24 recent advances in dualuse technology may reduce the technological barriers for terrorist groups who wish to engage in cbrelated attacks industries and academia especially in the area of microbiology increasingly employ technologies that can be converted to cb agent production with moderate to low effort these dualuse technologies provide prospective terrorists with equipment that can be obtained by theft or purchase policymakers may be required to reassess the likelihood of terrorists using cb agents as technical barriers to cb agent development may become less of hindrance25 22 another possibility is the use of chemical or biological agents in conjunction with conventional weapons the combination of these two attack types presents additional policy challenges and considerations which are beyond the scope of this report 23 for an overview of the different factors potentially motivating terrorist groups

biological agents have been used in the past both during times of war and through terrorist action the former soviet union and the united states both possessed active chemical and biological weapons programs that attempted to develop new more deadly weapons26 currently international treaties restrict research to that for defensive purposes only other nations have at various times also developed their own biological and chemical programs though some of these programs are longer supported27 chemical and biological weapons were initially developed in military context as weapons with potential strategic and tactical use chemical agents were widely used in europe during world war i and biological agents were reportedly used in sabotage actions against animals in world war i28 also japan has been cited as using plague as an antipersonnel weapon against china during world war ii29 the former soviet union has been accused of providing toxin agents to allies in vietnam and laos and using these toxins during its war in afghanistan30 during the 1980 1988 iraqiran war both iran and iraq reportedly used chemical agents with both 26 the russian federation and the united states have

civilians to quell an insurgency32 some terrorist groups have adopted cb agents to further their aims in 1984 the rajneeshees sickened hundreds of people in oregon by producing and deploying salmonella typhimurium bacterium which normally causes nonfatal food poisoning33 aum shinrikyo attempted to develop an array of chemical and biological agents to be used against the japanese civilian populace in the early 1990s34 there are also many reports of small groups or individuals producing toxin agents35 while it is difficult to determine the extent to which terrorist groups are researching potential chemical and biological weapon use it has been reported that some known terrorist groups have an interest in acquiring such weapons36 cb assessments assessments by government agencies an assessment of terrorist threat is difficult to quantify since many of the variables involved are not reliably known some of these variables include the skill level of various terrorist groups the location and size of terrorist assets and the possession of any particular cb agent as consequence the exact threat faced is indeterminable from the open literature and the risk involved can only be estimated vulnerability can be assessed through the development of scenarios including worstcase scenarios vulnerability studies do not address the likelihood of an attack occurring they only assess possible outcomes if an attack very similar to the one modeled occurs it is commonly thought that worstcase scenario is unlikely to occur since many lowprobability events must occur for the worst to happen however given the nature of some cb agents even nonworstcase events could have huge psychological effects public health impacts and economic costs for the nation 31 julian perry

agency unclassified report to congress on the acquisition of technology relating to weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional munitions 1 january through 30 june 2003 november 2003 crs10 with few historical precedents for cb terrorism determining the current risk of cb terrorism from past events is difficult and perhaps misleading to assess the threat from other nations the us intelligence community has prepared several national intelligence estimates on the biological and chemical capabilities of foreign states37 within these classified estimates reportedly the cb agents that have the highest relative probability of use have been described but these reports are not available in the open literature38 presumably the directorate for information analysis and infrastructure protection in the department of homeland security and the terrorist threat integration center have developed or are in the process of developing similar cb threat assessments39 several other federal agencies have developed or are in the process of developing biological agent threat lists to determine the agents which have the highest relative probability of use40 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc in collaboration with law enforcement intelligence and defense agencies have developed list of agents that would have the greatest impact on the public health41 the us department of agriculture has developed two biological threat lists through collaborative international process42 the environmental protection agency under provisions of the clean air act has collected worstcase scenario plans and information regarding catastrophic toxic releases from chemical plants adjacent to or within communities43 as each agency has different requirements and perspectives each has generated individualized cb threat lists there is lack of consensus on the contents of definitive unified cb threat list militaryuse assessment compared to terroristuse assessment militaryuse analyses predominantly revolve around military management of cb 37 national intelligence estimate is the most authoritative written judgment concerning national security issue by the major agencies comprising the us intelligence community most national intelligence estimates forecast future developments and many address their implications for the united states national

inadequately address terrorist use of cb agents against civilian populations several key factors cited as necessary conditions for military use would not be required in smallerscale assault on civilian targets using limited dispersal of cb agents for example military assessments include factors such as stabilization of the cb agent for storage and transport purposes dispersal technologies for maximum airborne dissemination timeliness of agent effectiveness and integration within the battle plan additionally many of the military assessments especially those relating to chemical agents are made specifically in relation to use by an opposing military with considerations of chemical prophylaxis and protective equipment being included finally recurring theme in military assessments is the difficulties involved in disseminating an agent against target in the open tactic requiring training in meteorology and engineering in addition to chemical andor biological training concerns of storage stability and mass dissemination are examples of why military assessment may differ from one using terrorism framework while it is likely true that only statefunded biological or chemical weapons program could successfully develop the technology necessary to make bulk cb agents that are stable under longterm storage in munition form terrorist who wishes to make gram quantities of cb agent and disseminate it for example with modified pesticide sprayer would be unconstrained by these criteria this underscores the gilmore commissions concern that largescale wmd analysis may be inappropriate when applied to terrorist events44 agents whose characteristics make them poor military weapons may still be powerful if deployed as weapons of terror how difficult is it to develop cb agents for terrorist use experts disagree on the difficulty of cb agent manufacture many experts believe that it is relatively easy to manufacture some chemical agents45 while others point to the apparent difficulties that state actors have had in developing chemical weapons programs some experts claim that development of weaponized biological agents presents remarkably high hurdles particularly in mass dissemination which would require teams of scientists with state backing to overcome46 other experts believe that single moderately well funded individual could develop biological weapon in home basement47 richard danzig while he was under secretary of the navy stated the opinion that small pharmaceutical industry or even moderately sophisticated university or medical research laboratory can generate significant 44 some terroristuse assessments of biological weapon use focus significantly on mass casualty threats see for example centers for disease control and prevention

those used in the anthrax mailings could be made with very simple nonindustrial process very primitive process that could let you get trillion spores in one gram49 other experts dispute this assertion50 one explanation for some of the differences among expert views lies in assumptions of event size experts who opine that terrorist use of biological and chemical weapons is difficult tend to consider such agents in the framework of mass destruction with fatalities numbering in the thousands and casualties in the tens of thousands of people which would require mass production of agents and the independent development of efficient effective distribution systems51 in contrast others argue that the small batches required for targeted lowcasualty attack would be relatively ease to produce the aum shinrikyo sarin gas attack in tokyo and the anthrax mailings demonstrated that an attack utilizing either chemical or biological agent need not inflict mass casualties to cause widespread disruption figure 1 provides comparison between the steps necessary to develop mass casualty chemical weapon and those required for the same agent to be used on smaller scale in terrorist attack figure 2 shows similar comparison for biological weapons while the exact criteria needed to develop cb agent vary with the agent the primary difference between the two flowcharts is that for terrorist distribution of cb agent many steps considered to have high practical difficulties may be nonexistent in the case of terrorist groups that wish to launch only small scale attack and that have low regard for their personal safety52 such steps include developing agents that have long storage shelf life optimizing largescale dissemination device developing rigorous prophylaxis and optimizing the manufacturing process so as to make mass quantities of the cb agent these steps indicated by italics in the flowchart for military use are not necessarily required for terrorist group use and therefore have been removed from the flowchart for terrorist programs 48 see richard danzig biological warfare nation at risk time to act strategic forum institute for national strategic

suicide attacks by audrey kurth cronin crs13 experts contend that for large scale attacks these steps represent barriers of comparable importance to terrorist organization if terrorist groups focus on smaller scale distribution of cb agents the amount of agent necessary to inflict dozens to thousands of casualties can be made using only researchscale rather than massproduction facilities if terrorist group decides that smallscale distribution is acceptable disseminating agents either as crude aerosol or solution through the use of converted industrial equipment would become viable if inefficient distribution method the problem of longterm agent storage is bypassed if only enough material for each use is prepared shortly before being used these compromises reduce the effective lethality of given amount of agent as several nonoptimized steps are involved but this could be addressed through production of more agent these compromises result in removing many of the hurdles cited as being of maximal difficulty in nationstatelevel cb development crs14 figure 1 comparison of state chemical wmd and terrorist chemical agent development source adapted by crs 2002 from

terrorist capability is found on the right italics reflect differences between programs crs16 agent analysis cb agents are presented in matrix framework in this section with the agents ranked by number of barriers to their use in small scale terrorist attacks rather than use in masscasualty attacks or military use because of the differences among the agents they are divided into three categories chemical agents biological agents and toxins toxins are separated from biological agents because they do not reproduce in host and are separated from chemical agents because of their biological origin each cb agent type is analyzed according to criteria specific to its category negative sign denotes an aspect that poses significant barrier to terrorist use or that is negative influence to terrorist use positive sign refers to an aspect that does not pose significant barrier to terrorist use or that is positive influence to terrorist use the rank represents an intermediate state the matrices present agents for comparison within category but agents should not be compared across different matrices as the criteria used vary for each matrix appendix contains detailed description of the methodology used to develop these matrices the successful development of cb agent requires certain level of individual competence and training53 the analysis here applies only to cases where terrorist groups possess such levels of skill also reasonable financial means on the part of the terrorist is assumed since this report focuses on the ability of groups or individuals to develop smallscale production capacity it is also assumed that there is overt statesponsorship of the terrorist group and as consequence there has been documented technology transfer to the terrorist group from national biological or chemical weapons program in order to compare the impact of different cb agents the target is assumed to be the same in each case mediumsized enclosed space such as an office building or subway station the effect of changing these assumptions is explored in the discussion section chemical agent comparison most chemical agents unlike biological or toxin agents do not naturally occur typically larger amount of chemical agent is required for equivalent effect than biological or toxin agent some chemical agents were discovered during research in chemical warfare and others in civilian research areas such as pesticide development chemical agents have widely varying effects and forms some chemical agents are toxic or corrosive gases commonly found in industrial processes54 other chemical agents are not used in manufacturing processes and are used only as weapon finally some chemical weapons have found civilian applications in other areas and are manufactured for those purposes for example nitrogen mustard has been used for cancer chemotherapy 53 many experts agree that graduate education in chemistry or biology provides the necessary skills to produce laboratory quantities of chemical biological or toxin agent respectively others believe that some agents might be within the capabilities of intelligent and dedicated high school students 54 toxic chemicals such as chlorine phosgene hydrogen cyanide and anhydrous ammonia are often used in chemical manufacturing processes crs17 choice of chemical agents assessed there are many toxic chemicals but most are illsuited for terrorist use because of their physical properties the chemical agents discussed in this report are subset of all available toxic chemicals criteria for selecting these agents include their coverage by the chemical weapons convention cwc55 their inclusion on the cdcs chemical agent list56 their inclusion in north atlantic treaty organization nato57 and us military medical fieldbooks58 their inclusion in the us doj guide for the selection of chemical and biological decontamination equipment for emergency first responders59 and finally their reported presence in

group agents with roughly comparable rank crs19 ease of acquisition most chemical agents require artificial synthesis and manufacture so prospective terrorist would be concerned with their relative ease of production while dualuse chemical agents are potentially available by theft or purchase in large quantity many chemical agents require dedicated synthetic effort to acquire in bulk in some cases precursor chemicals required to synthesize agents can be purchased on research scale without undue difficulty61 the technology necessary to manufacture most chemical agents is known through the open literature the safety and efficiency of chemical synthesis and manufacturing practices have increased substantially since the early manufacture of chemical agents while the equipment necessary for largescale manufacture of these agents is regulated through export controls equipment necessary to create smallscale amounts of chemical agents at home in makeshift laboratory facilities can be purchased through many chemical distributors attempting to manufacture chemical agents under such circumstances comes with increased risk of discovery and inadvertent exposure to the agent in the ease of acquisition column of table 1 the symbol denotes chemical agents that are created via processes that are technically straightforward and have few noxious side products or those chemicals that have industrial dualuses and therefore might be obtained rather than manufactured the symbol denotes chemical agents that generate significant toxic side products during manufacture endangering the person manufacturing the agents62 the symbol denotes chemical agents that require closely monitored precursor chemicals for manufacture create significant lethal side products or require sophisticated synthesis equipment public health impact this report combines morbidity mortality and load placed on the public health care system to describe this aspect of an agents effectiveness effects of chemical agent are agentspecific some agents kill exposed people other agents primarily incapacitate victims these agents predominantly choking agents tend to have wide range of effects from temporary tightness of chest and difficulty breathing to lifethreatening pulmonary edema finally some agents incapacitate those exposed through painful tissue damage these agents called blister agents or vesicants cause damage on contact with the skin and do not need to be inhaled for effect single scale of impact such as lethality would strongly underreport the impact of blister agent which requires relatively large quantities to kill but little to cause intense pain and disfigurement on the other hand using lethality as the only scale would overreport the impact of nerve agent which can be lethal but generally causes much less harm at sublethal dosages because of the above factors this report uses more general criterion to describe an agents effectiveness namely impact on the health care system mortality 61 special report better killing through chemistry scientific american december 2001 62 the synthesis of some agents involves the generation of toxic side products these side products could significantly complicate the production of chemical agents as they increase the level of danger to the person making the compound crs20 and morbidity from the release of nerve agent would have high impact on the health care system as would cases of extensive chemical burns from the release of blister agents and cases of pulmonary edema from choking agents by using this more indirect gauge of effectiveness useful comparisons can be made between agents with different mechanisms of causing harm in the public health impact column of table 1 the symbol denotes chemical agents whose use would create high deleterious public health consequence the symbol denotes chemical agents whose use would create more moderate deleterious public health consequence the symbol denotes chemical agents whose use would create relatively low deleterious public health consequence63 resistance to medical treatment the degree to which treatment can ameliorate or prevent symptoms is primary concern in treating chemical casualties this factor is essential to defusing the impact of chemical attack injuries from some chemical agents cannot be reversed injuries from other agents may be successfully reversed through treatment immediately after the attack depending on the agent and the quantity of agent to which victim is exposed the time frame in which these treatments are effective varies from minutes to hours64 in the resistance to medical treatment column of table 1 the symbol denotes chemical agents that lack any treatment to prevent the onset of symptoms the symbol denotes chemical agents that first responders would likely be able to treat the symbol denotes chemical agents which can be treated after significant time delay ease of dissemination chemical agents are typically dispersed as gas or liquid depending on the ambient temperature and the agent gases dilute themselves into the surrounding atmosphere limiting their effectiveness in most cases chemical agent effects arise from some form of interaction with the vapors or the aerosols of these agents liquids that are not volatile do not provide enough vapor for inhalation and must either be aerosolized or heated to maintain their effect in the ease of dissemination column of table 1 the symbol denotes chemical agents which do not require inhalation to inflict damage the vapors or aerosol cause an effect upon skin contact the symbol denotes chemical agents which require inhalation of small quantities of vapor or aerosol the symbol denotes chemical agents that require inhalation of large volumes of vapor or aerosol examples chlorine is chemical commonly used in many manufacturing and industrial processes ranging from the pharmaceutical industry to water treatment facilities because of its wide availability chlorine receives in the ease of 63 symbols appear in this column as chemicals with low public health impact did not pass the selection criteria for inclusion in this framework 64 for information on the aging times of various nerve agents see frederick r sidell nerve agents in medical aspects of chemical and biological warfare eds frederick r sidell ernest t takafuji and david r franz washington dc tmm publications 1997 129179 crs21 acquisition category because chlorine can cause serious lung damage but is rarely lethal chlorine receives in the public health impact category these injuries cannot be cured and can only be treated with supportive care therefore chlorine receives in the resistance to medical treatment category finally for chlorine to cause harm large volumes of the gas must be inhaled and therefore chlorine receives in the ease of dissemination category in contrast to chlorine the nerve agent vx is much harder to acquire65 there is industrial use for vx and the known existing sources are under military guard terrorist bent on using vx would most likely need to manufacture it from precursor chemicals however these chemicals are controlled under the cwc and would not be easy to obtain additionally the synthesis of vx produces highly toxic side products so vx receives for ease of acquisition vx is deadly at relatively low concentration and many people could be affected by smallscale attack therefore vx receives in public health impact treatment is available for victims of vx exposure especially those who receive lower doses and prompt attention however vxs persistent nature requires first responders to don specialized equipment to enter and treat victims in the contaminated area this time delay may significantly complicate effective treatment therefore vx receives for resistance to medical treatment although vx is liquid at room temperature it need not be inhaled skin contact with small quantities is lethal vx receives for ease of dissemination the most effective known use of chemical weapon in terrorist attack occurred in 1995 when the aum shinrikyo cult released sarin into the tokyo subway sarin is not widely available like chlorine gas but is technically easier to manufacture than vx it receives for ease of acquisition twelve people died in the attack more than one thousand were injured and more than five thousand sought treatment66 sarin is deadly at relatively low concentration and many people could be affected by smallscale attack therefore sarin receives for public health impact treatment is available for victims of sarin exposure especially those who receive lower doses and prompt attention therefore sarin receives in resistance to medical treatment because sarin is liquid at room temperature and must be inhaled to injure it receives for ease of dissemination67 sarin reportedly was not the original agent of choice for aum shinrikyo as previous attempts were made to develop botulinum toxin and anthrax the cult reportedly developed other chemical agents such as phosgene and vx but for various internal political and technical reasons was unable to effectively use these weapons to inflict mass casualties68 65 vx is the common name for oethyl sdiisopropylaminomethyl methylphosphonothiolate toxic nerve agent 66 tim ballard et chronology of aum shinrikyos cbw activities monterey institute of international studies march 15 2001 67 liquid sarin can be deadly upon prolonged skin contact but its predominant threat is through inhalation of sarin vapor 68 david kaplan aum shinrikyo in toxic terror assessing terrorist use of chemical continued crs22 biological agent comparison potential biological agents include the many bacteria and viruses that induce disease in human beings many pathogens are not suitable biological agents because of their fragility long incubation time or other characteristics biological agents differ from chemical agents in that large amounts of agent can be grown from tiny initial supply biological agents may be considered especially insidious compared to other agents because the pathogens can multiply within infected individuals thus the dosage needed to induce illness can be very low an amount much smaller by weight than required of chemical or toxin agents choice of biological agents assessed the biological agents chosen for inclusion in table 2 were compiled from several sources including the biological weapons convention bwc draft compliance protocol annex list69 the cdc select agent list70 the cdc biological

criteria table 2 categorizes biological agents based on six criteria ease of acquisition public health impact prophylaxis resistance to medical treatment ease of dissemination and whether the pathogen has been developed for use in military setting weaponized agents are listed in descending order of combined ranking with respect to the criteria for further information on the methodology regarding criteria choice ranking and weighting see appendix see table 5 in appendix c for technical data used to rate each agent ease of acquisition in marked contrast to chemical agents most biological agents can be obtained from natural sources but natural strains vary widely in their virulence in some cases biological agents are endemic in an animal reservoir population simplifying access and development this availability provides terrorists with options in developing selfcontained biological agent capacity terrorists could attempt to isolate pathogen found in nature obtain sample from natural human outbreak or purchase or steal sample from commercial culture collection or hospital this would provide enough source material for smallscale production facility using litersized fermenters or even petri dishes to grow enough material for smallscale attack in assessing the ease of pathogens acquisition several factors were weighed the first is whether the biological agent is available in an accessible area biological agents which are rare cannot be readily or reasonably obtained from nature and would need to be acquired from preexisting samples for example marburg virus would be very difficult to obtain from nature78 it could be obtained from culture collection but such transfers are closely regulated and observed there would be large practical barriers to their acquisition regardless of the legality of such transfer in contrast salmonella bacteria would be easy to obtain from natural sources and are available in many culture collections in the ease of acquisition column of table 2 the symbol denotes biological agents that are endemic in nature have well documented outbreaks or are routinely disseminated from culture collections the symbol denotes biological agents that are available in nature only in very localized or remote areas have small or poorly documented outbreaks or are obtained primarily through culture banks the symbol denotes biological agents that are located predominantly in restricted culture banks and are rarely documented in the wild 78 marburg virus causes rare hemorrhagic fever with high lethality the location of the natural reservoir for

see appendix c for detailed data used to generate rating note see text for explanation of symbols breaks within the table group agents with roughly comparable rank crs26 public health impact biological agents like chemical agents can induce range of effects some agents are primarily incapacitating in nature while other agents are acutely lethal79 the public health impact criterion used here is the same as used above for chemical agents in the public health impact column of table 2 the symbol denotes biological agents that have high deleterious public health impact the symbol denotes biological agents that have more moderate deleterious public health impact the symbol denotes biological agents that have relatively low deleterious public health impact prophylaxis vaccines and other prophylactic measures are important factors in assessing whether particular agent would be useful weapon in either military or terrorist terms the availability of vaccine could provide civilian targets with high protection from particular agents if the vaccine is routinely administered the presence of widely used vaccine might significantly deter terrorist use of that biological agent80 biological agents against which the population is routinely vaccinated have been removed from this analysis81 in the prophylaxis column of table 2 the symbol denotes biological agents with established prophylaxis the symbol denotes biological agents with experimental prophylaxis lacking food and drug administration approval the symbol denotes biological agents with an approved vaccine resistance to medical treatment there is uniform medical treatment for biological agents some diseases are not curable and can only be treated with generalized supportive care to limit symptoms other diseases can be cured through the use of specific medicines furthermore some diseases are treatable at any time in the progression of the illness while others can only be successfully treated during onset treatment potential is likely to be an important consideration for terrorist an agent which is easily treated has little offensive utility while an agent which is not curable might have high value even if it only leads to an incapacitating disease additionally the chance for selfinfection with an incurable pathogen may also factor into the terrorist decisionmaking process in the resistance to medical treatment column of table 2 the symbol denotes biological agents which have specific treatment outside of supportive care the symbol denotes biological agents which can be treated with agentspecific medicine in narrow time frame or have potential but unproven treatment the symbol denotes biological agents which can be cured without restriction 79 incapacitating agents may still result in fatalities depending on the infectious dose the individuals immune system strength and other complicating factors 80 the existence of effective prophylaxis may conversely enhance prospective terrorists ability to use an agent if the terrorists place premium on their own safety the level of external mechanical protection required to handle and produce biological agents is decreased when effective prophylaxis is available 81 polio is an example of disease against which the population is routinely vaccinated terrorist attack using this pathogen would likely cause little harm crs27 ease of dissemination unlike chemical agents biological agents can reproduce and are generally grown suspended in liquid solutions they are more difficult than chemical agents to effectively disseminate in the air they may be disseminated via other media see below some biological agents can be dried and ground into small particles which can be released as aerosols but this is fairly advanced technique because of the natural filtering capacity of the human airways there is an optimal range of particle size that will deeply penetrate the lungs many experts cite the difficulty of preparing or disseminating biological agents in such particle size range as primary barrier to terrorist use other experts counter that commercial dissemination equipment namely technologies similar to yard foggers and crop dusters can be adapted to provide aerosols that while not optimal in size will still be infectious additionally not all biological agents must be lodged deep in the lungs to cause infection some biological agents are contagious from person to person each person infected with biological agent which is contagious by casual contact can become new dissemination vector these highly contagious agents might be viewed by terrorists as more useful than other types of biological agents as people not in the original exposed area may fall ill through such contact all other factors being equal contagious agents that require close contact may be viewed by terrorist as less useful than those needing only casual contact due to the lower probability of secondary infection another common infectious pathway is through ingestion via contaminated water beverages or food but some pathogens are less virulent by this route than by inhalation it is logistically complex to affect large numbers of people with significantly lethal pathogen through contaminating the food or water supply still as shown by the rajneeshees use of salmonella typhimurium to contaminate restaurant salad bars in oregon lowtechnology approaches such as food contamination may be effective in the ease of dissemination column of table 2 the symbol denotes biological agents that are amenable to dissemination as an aerosol and through ingestion or are contagious through close contact82 the symbol denotes biological agents that can be disseminated as an aerosol the symbol denotes biological agents that require ingestion or dissemination using animal vector such as mosquito tick or other insect weaponization some biological agents were reportedly developed by either the soviet unions or the united states former biological weapons program while most of these agents were only research targets several pathogens were successfully converted into military grade weapons due to these research efforts the knowledge necessary to convert naturally occurring disease into an optimized weapon may be 82 for the purposes of this report close contact refers to situations in which infected body fluids may come in contact with others this includes health care professionals and family members who may provide care for those infected crs28 available for purchase83 in assessing the degree to which these agents have been studied in munitions framework agents are categorized in table 2 as weapon research or unknown if an agent has been reported as successfully weaponized it is listed as weapon if an agent was known target of weapons program but it is not reported as successfully weaponized it is listed as research if it is unknown whether an agent was the target of weapons program it is listed as unknown examples the bacterium yersinia pestis causes the disease commonly known as plague this bacterium is found naturally in many locations with reservoirs in rodent populations it causes publicized outbreaks in locations around the world the united states averages 10 to 15 cases each year84 thus plague is considered easy to acquire by terrorist and receives in this category in table 2 there are several subcategories of plague depending mostly upon the method of infection naturally occurring plague is usually transmitted by flea bites and has mortality rate of 5 12 despite the availability of effective antibiotics85 pneumonic plague is more serious type of plague caused when the bacteria infect the lungs pneumonic plague is much more lethal than that caused by flea bites the victims require isolation and intensive hospital care therefore plague receives for public health impact there is vaccine against plague but it has not been shown to be effective against pneumonic plague if an outbreak is detected antibiotics can be taken prophylactically to prevent infection thus plague receives for prophylaxis because pneumonic plague responds well to antibiotics only within the first 24 hours after symptom onset it receives for resistance to medical treatment in contrast to the type of plague transmitted by fleas pneumonic plague is contagious through casual persontoperson contact86 therefore each initially infected individual could eventually infect several others this would allow terrorist to bypass the technically challenging development of an aerosolizing device each infected person becomes potential vector for the spread of the disease because of this plague receives for ease of dissemination plague was reportedly studied by both the us and former ussr weapons programs87 the former 83 ken alibek former high ranking official in the soviet weapons program and widely quoted expert on biological weapons claims that many scientists who worked for the former soviet unions biological weapons program have been approached by groups interested in purchasing their expertise see for example ken alibek biohazard the chilling true story of the largest covert biological weapons program in the world told from inside by the man who ran it op cit pp 271272 84 centers for disease control and prevention plague fact sheet available online at

determinants for modeling pneumonic plague outbreaks emerging infectious diseases 10 2004 608614 87 the united states former biological weapons program reportedly did not weaponize plague but only studied it as research target stockholm international peace research institute the problem of chemical and biological warfare volume i the rise of cb weapons stockholm almqvist wiksell 1971 crs29 ussr reportedly successfully weaponized plague and is rumored to have developed antibioticresistant strains88 anthrax is caused by the bacterium bacillus anthracis this bacterium occurs naturally in many locations around the world therefore in table 2 anthrax receives for ease of acquisition untreated inhalational anthrax is nearly always fatal the aggressive medical treatment victims received during the 2001 anthrax outbreak reduced the mortality rate to approximately 50 five of eleven because of the high mortality rate and the need for hospitalization for treatment inhalational anthrax rates for public health impact because the anthrax vaccine and antibiotics work prophylactically anthrax receives in the prophylaxis category antibiotics are used against anthrax but the success of this treatment depends on diagnosis shortly after onset of symptoms therefore anthrax receives for resistance to medical treatment in table 2 traditionally it is considered difficult to produce the very fine particle size necessary to inflict mass casualties however to inflict causalities on more modest scale tens to hundreds cruder preparation with nonoptimal particle size distribution may be sufficient therefore for smallscale attack anthrax receives for ease of dissemination anthrax was reportedly successfully weaponized by both the us and former ussr programs antibiotic resistant strains could be developed while this would increase the public health impact the technical ability required to do this would decrease the ease of acquisition in 1984 the rajneeshee cult successfully employed salmonella typhimurium in oregon restaurants sickening 751 people this bacterium is ubiquitous causing an estimated 40000 cases of food poisoning in the united states each year therefore salmonella receives for ease of acquisition in table 2 because salmonella usually does not require hospitalization it receives for public health impact there is vaccine for salmonella because of the lack of vaccine salmonella receives for prophylaxis since antibiotic treatment for salmonella is well established salmonella receives under resistance to medical treatment salmonella needs to be ingested so the only effective route for dissemination would be through deliberate food beverage or water contamination therefore salmonella typhimurium receives for ease of dissemination toxin agents comparison toxins are poisonous substances that are produced by living organisms including plants animals algae and bacteria these substances cause damage when introduced into the body often toxin is the lethal agent in bacterial infection rather than the bacteria themselves for example intestinal infection with clostridium botulinum is lethal due to the toxins that are exuded into the body not simply because of the presence of bacteria in some cases these toxins can be produced in sufficient quantities and isolated from the organisms that produce them unlike living pathogens toxins do not replicate the human body is capable of developing antibodies to neutralize many toxins 88 ken alibek biohazard the chilling true story of the largest covert biological weapons program in the world told from inside by the man who ran it op cit crs30 toxins are intermediate between biological and chemical agents in efficacy as weapons requiring greater amount of material than in the case of biological agent but less than required for chemical agent toxins generally cause injury within hours of an attack therefore toxins may act more quickly than biological agents which may take days or weeks to incubate but more slowly than chemical agents which generally act immediately toxins often have effects similar to chemical nerve agents such as paralysis and nerverelated damage countermeasures for toxins resemble those for biological agents toxoid vaccines are used for prophylaxis and antitoxins for patients after exposure choice of toxin agents assessed the toxins chosen for inclusion in the matrix were compiled by comparing several sources including the bwc draft compliance protocol annex list89 the cdc select agent list90 the cdc biological diseasesagents listing91

technical data used to rate each agent ease of acquisition toxins must be extracted from the material in which the toxin was formed thus acquiring toxins is more complicated than growing biological agents but can be less complicated than synthesizing chemical agents the production capacity needed to make enough agent for terror event within mediumsized enclosed space could be developed in basement lab without access to manufacturing plant limiting factor is how ubiquitous the source of toxin is some toxins are commercially available due to their dualuse nature98 the source plants or bacteria for other toxins are commercially available in few cases neither the toxin nor its source is commercially available to obtain these toxins one would need to find the plant animal bacteria or algae that produces the toxin in nature in the ease of acquisition column of table 3 the symbol denotes toxins for which the source of the compound can be found widely in nature easily purchased or grown the symbol denotes toxins for which the source of the compound is purchased or grown with some difficulty the symbol denotes toxins for which the source of the compound cannot be purchased is found only in few locations or is grown with great difficulty public health impact toxins can be incapacitating or lethal99 the variety of effects and methods of dispersal necessitate more indirect estimation of the agents impact again the burden placed on the medical system will be used as the measurement for effect on the target as an example toxin may have low lethality but high public health impact due to its effects in the public health impact column of table 3 the symbol denotes toxins that have high deleterious public health impact the symbol denotes toxins that have more moderate

several other toxins are commonly used in biomedical research 99 this distinction is made between different toxins not between different types of cb agents for example although staphylococcus aureus

were only research targets several toxins were successfully converted into military grade agents due to this research the knowledge necessary to produce toxins efficiently and formulate them into warfare agents may be available for purchase in assessing the degree to which these agents have been studied in munitions framework agents were categorized as weapon research or unknown if an agent has been reported as successfully weaponized it is listed as weapon if an agent was known target of weapons program but has not reported as successfully 100 tetanus toxin is an example of toxin against which the population is routinely vaccinated terrorist attack using tetanus toxin would likely cause little harm crs34 weaponized it is listed as research if it is unknown whether an agent was the target of weapons program it is listed as unknown examples botulinum toxin is the most poisonous substance known101 it is produced by clostridium botulinum ubiquitous soil bacterium therefore in table 3 it receives for ease of acquisition persons affected by botulinum toxin suffer nerve damage and paralysis leading to asphyxiation and death although deaths rarely occur from naturally occurring botulism outbreaks victims require intensive hospital care additionally even small terrorist attack may overwhelm the capacity of local health facilities resulting in many deaths therefore it receives for public health impact because there is toxoid vaccine for botulinum toxin available in limited supply from the centers for disease control and prevention it receives for prophylaxis botulism antitoxin can mitigate the effects of exposure but there are limited available supplies supportive care including mechanical ventilation can also prevent death because of its well established medical treatment it receives for resistance to medical treatment botulinum toxin is fairly stable existing for extended periods at room temperature but is inactivated by cooking it can therefore be aerosolized or delivered via uncooked food or drink it receives for ease of dissemination both the soviet unions and the united states weapons program reportedly successfully weaponized this toxin ricin is very toxic compound found in castor beans during the production of castor oil bean mash with 5 percent ricin content is produced recipes for extracting the ricin from this mash are available on the internet102 because of the ready availability of both the raw material and the necessary information to refine the toxin ricin receives for ease of acquisition in table 3 persons exposed to ricin exhibit different symptoms depending on the exposure route ingestion of ricin causes nausea diarrhea gastric hemorrhaging and shock leading eventually to death injection of ricin produces severe internal necrosis and hemorrhage which usually culminates in systemic collapse inhalation of ricin leads to irritation of airways and lungs causing pulmonary edema and pneumonia because the progressive nature of the toxins effects requires continual hospitalization and care ricin receives for public health impact an investigational new drug ind ricin toxoid could be made available consequently ricin receives for prophylaxis exposure to large amounts of ricin is almost invariably lethal as ricin acts rapidly and irreversibly and lacks known treatment ricin receives for resistance to medical treatment ricin is very stable and can be stored in either purified or impure forms ricin can be used either as an aerosol or as food or drink contaminant it receives for ease of

examining the legend national security notes formerly the crypt february 20 2004 crs35 dissemination the united states reportedly researched ricin under its former biological weapons program and iraq reportedly attempted to weaponized ricin103 saxitoxin is very toxic compound best known for its role in paralytic shellfish poisoning it is produced by dinoflagellate marine algae because of the difficulties growing and collecting large amounts of toxin from the algae or from shellfish in which the toxin has concentrated saxitoxin receives for ease of acquisition in table 3 persons who ingest saxitoxin suffer nerve damage and slow paralysis similar to botulinum toxin inhalation of saxitoxin causes fast blockage of nerve impulses leading to death within minutes saxitoxin receives for public health impact there is toxoid vaccine available for saxitoxin and so it receives for prophylaxis it is difficult to successfully treat victims within the necessary time window dictated by inhalation of aerosolized saxitoxin supportive care including mechanical ventilation can prevent death because of this established treatment saxitoxin receives for resistance to medical treatment it can be used to contaminate food or drink or as an aerosol this flexibility gives saxitoxin for ease of dissemination the us central intelligence agency researched the use of saxitoxin as covert weapon but it is unlikely to have been developed as weapon for military use104 discussion potential uses of framework many expert analyses focus on the use of cb agents to cause mass casualties through catastrophic terrorism in this view cb agents that can be mass produced are contagious or are markedly stabile are identified as the greatest threats therefore government policy towards cb terrorism has been designed to reduce the impact of cb agents such as nerve agents smallpox and anthrax that possess these specific qualities while some of these agents have been used in terror attacks this analysis of the potential for smallscale use leads to different assessment of cb agent threat cb agents that were considered high threats in other frameworks appear to present lesser threat when viewed in the small scale attack context conversely cb agents that were considered of lesser threat when considering mass casualty attacks may be ranked more highly in the small scale context as barriers to mass use may be missing when the agent is used on small scale because of these differences policies designed to protect against catastrophic cb attack may not provide equivalent protection against small scale cb attack potential use for the above framework is to help prioritize approaches to address the threat presented by small scale use of cb agents this analysis provides 103 iraq reportedly performed field tests of munitions filled with ricin in november 1990 unscom reports to the security council january 25 1999 annex c 104 us senate unauthorized storage of toxic agents hearings before us senate intelligence committee 94th cong 1st sess washington dc us senate september 1618 1975 crs36 information relevant to the formation of general approaches to reduce the threat from terrorist use of different cb agents as well as information that may allow policymakers to reduce the dangers from specific agents for example policymakers may wish to develop specific remedies via research targeted towards developing cures prophylaxis and detection equipment or more efficient public health mechanisms for detecting and treating the agents towards the tops of these matrices because the agents analyzed in this framework are those which appear in preponderance of past assessments they represent subset of potential cb agents other dangerous agents which may be amenable to similar analysis have not been included for example newly emerging diseases such as nipah virus and sars may pose future threat but have not been included in past assessments therefore while policymakers may find this framework useful in formulating policy more detailed analysis may be required when refining policy alternatives another potential use of this framework is to qualitatively highlight the effects that different policies may have in reducing cb vulnerability this overview indicates which agents of concern might be amenable to particular countermeasures for example policymakers may wish to focus on prophylaxis of toxins to reduce the threat that their use by terrorists would present by reviewing the data presented in this assessment framework policymakers might identify toxins for which approved vaccine exists this might aid in prioritizing regulatory review or directing research funds to develop new toxoid vaccines similarly by weighing and considering the ease of acquisition of cb agents for example it may become apparent which agents are susceptible to regulatory control perhaps because of their development for industrial use and which agents might not be perhaps because of their endemic nature this may aid in developing additional policy against cb terrorism another application for this framework might be to develop threatreduction approaches for specific agents depending on the agent funding for research and development regulation or directed advances in public health may lower the threat posed for example regulation regarding the sale of the source of the toxin abrin might be considered an effective approach to reducing its ease of access thereby lowering the threat posed by this toxin the data presented in this framework and in the appendices may also serve as resource to develop other more specialized frameworks policymakers might reorder agents based on specific criteria for example response to medical treatment based on the data provided in this report some may wish to emphasize certain criteria over others providing nonequivalent weighting to the different criteria these manipulations might provide legislators with more tailored matrices for use in exploring policy options for example while the agents in this assessment have been sorted by considering the difficulties terrorist group might encounter in developing an agent sorting according to specific priorities might present different final product especially in the cases where specific knowledge is held about criteria presented here sorting the agents while excluding certain criteria would provide other insights for example marburg hemorrhagic fever is ranked lower on table 2 because of the difficulty in obtaining the causative virus in the current sorting algorithm this crs37 significant disadvantage to its use determines its ranking below other agents which lack any comparable disadvantage if for reasons outside the confines of this assessment it was known that marburg virus was available to terrorist organization resorting this matrix without regard to the ease of acquisition would place marburg hemorrhagic fever at the top of this matrix thus the risk posed by marburg hemorrhagic fever would be increased under those conditions whether an agent has been weaponized or was the target of weapons program was not used as primary ranking factor rather it was used to adjust the relative ranking of agents that are comparably rated thus two agents that have the same relative numbers of and in the matrix would be equally rated if one of these agents was known to be successfully weaponized while the other was never studied then the agent known to be weaponized would be ranked higher on the matrix the exclusion of weaponization status as an independent category might be seen as inappropriate if there are credible reports of information or technology transfer from bioweapons program to terrorist group in such an event it might be more appropriate to directly include the weaponization status into the ranking and sorting procedure deviations from assumptions several assumptions mainly about the resources and skills of the groups attempting to develop cb agents have been made in developing this framework if these assumptions are invalid then the results of this report will be less applicable for example if terrorist group is unable to recruit or train members to the degree necessary to reproducibly and repeatedly synthesize or grow cb agents then the effort expended in acquiring sufficient amounts of the cb agent may be much higher than estimated through this framework if terrorist group lacks financial means similar increase in the difficulty of manufacture might occur this could cause the criteria to have distinctly unequal weights where the ease of acquisition would dominate all other criteria if terrorist group is sponsored by nationstate then the capabilities of the terrorist group may be much greater than those assumed here for instance ease of acquisition and ease of dissemination could be drastically different as technology transfer from the sponsor to the terrorist group could remove these barriers and thus remove the influence of these criteria from the ranking terrorist group planning mass citywide assault using cb agent might face difficulties in the scale of material and logistics necessary and the threat might more closely parallel previous assessments of massdissemination105 one policy issue regarding cb defense is that threat assessments rely on probability estimates this means that while analysts may speak of likelihood of an agent being used one besides terrorists who use them can speak with authority about the agents that will be used terrorists may act opportunistically if presented with an agent either purchased or stolen they may use that agent even if 105 see us congress office of technology assessment technologies underlying weapons of mass destruction op cit crs38 it is not optimal for their purposes purchase or theft of cb agent alters relative threat assessments as many of the factors contributing to the relative threat are weighted differently consequently while relative threat assessment is useful framework for rational discussion it cannot be used as definitive statement on the likelihood of future cb use terrorist motivationspecific factors the above analysis assumes terrorist group has decided to use chemical biological or toxin weapon and is considering the relative potential of all of these agents equally however this analysis does not necessarily reflect all factors that may contribute to the choice of particular agent the following section explores other factors that specific terrorist group might consider based on its objectives or motivations106 potential for covert deployment some experts claim that it is increasingly likely that terrorist group would not claim responsibility for cb attack107 the incidence of catastrophic anonymous terrorist attacks is projected to increase as terrorist groups organize around issues that have less local concrete political goals but instead are more ideologically driven108 this tendency complicates analysis of the bioterror threat as terrorists may successfully covertly attack using disease found within the united states with small outbreak lack of any claim of responsibility could raise the question of whether the outbreak was terrorist act or simply an unusual natural epidemic for example releasing ebola virus in building in new york city would immediately be treated as terrorist attack regardless of whether any group claimed responsibility on the other hand the salmonella attacks perpetrated by the rajneeshees were not identified as deliberate release until over year after the event when member of the cult confessed to the crime one of the factors that led the cult leaders to choose salmonella was that it was less traceable agent in the hopes that their act would remain undiscovered109 since the probability that terrorist group will opt for covert rather than open deployment may not be known it is difficult to factor this choice into an analysis terrorist group could choose to deploy biological agent covertly because of the advantages the group would gain an agent release disguised as natural 106 for more on this topic see crs report rl31831 terrorist motivations for chemical and biological weapons use placing the threat in context by audrey kurth cronin 107 national commission on terrorism countering the changing threat of international terrorism august 2 2000 chapter 3 108 national intelligence council global trends 2015 dialogue about the future with nongovernment experts december 2002 109 another factor involved in the rajneeshee attack was their reported wish to influence local elections by incapacitating rather than killing the electorate w seth carus the rajneeshees 1984 in toxic terror assessing terrorist use of chemical and biological weapons op cit crs39 outbreak could allow for trial runs to be conducted before large attack as was done by the rajneeshees such trials could test the government response to an apparently natural outbreak possibly allowing terrorists to further refine attack plans to exploit weaknesses uncovered during the trials by using local pathogen there may be serious though reasonable disagreement between public health and law enforcement officials with respect to the outbreaks origin leading to over or underreaction to the outbreak finally during smallscale outbreak questions over the magnitude of local state or federal response may arise to the potential advantage of terrorist wishing to instill confusion at low cost110 the department of homeland security has developed and deployed system of biological weapon detectors called biowatch111 the biowatch program has installed detectors in more than thirty cities they are primarily designed to detect the catastrophic release of biological weapons not the release of small amounts of biological weapons in october 2003 the biowatch system in houston tx detected aerosols of francisella tularensis subsequent analysis revealed that this signal arose from detection of naturally occurring bacteria112 considering the apparent sensitivity of this detection system it is possible that smallscale releases might be detected determining whether such signal was from naturally occurring bacteria or from smallscale act of terrorism may be challenging since the federal response to an act of terrorism will likely be substantially different than to detection of naturally occurring bacteria quickly differentiating between the two events is important range of lethality and impact the media attention given to civilian deaths may induce terrorist to prefer an agent with high fatalities over agents that inflict high number of casualties but low fatalities if they believed that this would garner more media attention terrorists may believe that such media coverage of terror events may further recognition of their cause or increase the impact of their actions potential cb agent user is also faced with the possibility that the cb agent may kill the user either during an accident in the preparation stage or during dissemination the events of september 11 2001 have shown that there are individuals motivated enough to die for their beliefs who wish to strike at assets within the united states113 consequently the idea that cb agent might be too 110 coordination between federal agencies and the preparedness of state and local responders have been highlighted in testimony by the gao testimony of janet heinrich director health care public health issues before the house committee on government reform october 5 2001 us congress general accounting office bioterrorism coordination and preparedness gao02129t october 5 2001 111 for more information about the biowatch program see crs report rl32152 the biowatch program detection of bioterrorism by dana shea and sarah lister 112 robert roos signs of tularemia agent detected in houston air cidrap news october 10 2003 113 not all terrorists who might be willing to die committing an act of terrorism would be continued crs40 lethal or too toxic to be used belief held in some previous treatments of this subject should be reexamined if one assumes that the user of the cb agent is willing to die during its use casualties and fatalities from an agents dissemination can be maximized because an agent lacking both treatment and prophylaxis can be used similarly an organization with supply of members willing to be placed at risk during the manufacture of biological agent can produce large amounts of an incurable pathogen by training members in the specific techniques necessary to grow that agent the threat of selfinfection combined with the need for advanced technical knowledge is often cited as another barrier to terrorist development of biological agents the use of trained technicians willing to die would allow production of agents under improvised safety conditions by training others to act as technicians terrorist organization could reduce the danger to its knowledgeable scientists distribute the techniques for developing pathogen program among the members of the organization and increase the rate of pathogen production it is not necessary for members of terrorist group to be without regard for their lives to develop cb agents terrorist groups with access to prophylaxis especially prophylaxis with limited distribution could develop biological agents at less personal risk alternately effective mechanical protection might guard terrorists manufacturing chemical agents even if the civilian population has some access to the vaccine or other prophylaxis the impact of dissemination would still be very high if these materials are uncommon some biological and toxin agents have vaccines available to select individuals such as troops or research scientists but not the general public therefore some terrorists may find highly lethal incurable agents to be most effective in achieving their objectives however as seen in the salmonella attack not all terrorists choose the most lethal agent available the cult leaders chose salmonella because nonlethal agent was deemed sufficient to achieve the desired outcome of decreasing voter turnout in local election114 contagious dissemination pathogens contagious through casual contact may be preferred by some terrorists one scenario could involve dissemination of contagious pathogen through selfinfection selfinfection is especially important to consider because it is lowtechnology method for highly selective targeting of initial infection points terrorist who is contagious could choose to fly through multiple airports in single day potentially causing many different foci of infection to erupt while the terrorist 113 continued likely to commit an act of chemical or biological terrorism cultural and religious norms regarding chemical or biological weapons use as well as the potential for significant suffering from selfinfection or exposure may limit the number of individuals willing to engage in chemical or biological terrorism 114 this case study shows the importance of developing further refined risk assessment based on the known goals motivations and capabilities of specific terrorist organizations crs41 would have to endure the full effects of the untreated illness the consequences of such method of distribution could be high some experts claim that the progression of the illness would prevent the terrorist from being well enough to proceed with such plan other experts have cited historical natural outbreaks on public transportation such as trains as evidence that individuals with diseases in the contagious stage have been able to travel and infect others115 the lack of controllability of contagious pathogens in comparison to other biological agents may serve as deterrent to groups unwilling to engage in indiscriminate infection for example terrorist groups that have constituency in or near the exposure area might not be willing to risk infection of their constituents alternately apocalyptic groups or terrorist groups acting geographically distant from their support may not view the lack of controllability as significant drawback previous use of cb agents some terrorists lacking knowledge of potential agents may choose cb agents because they have been used in the past terrorists may look to previous attacks to learn which cb agents were effective and how the cb agents were dispersed the difficulties in performing successful cb attack are illustrated through the examples of the rajneeshees 1984 salmonella attack and aum shinrikyos 1995 sarin attack both groups attempted to develop several different cb agents before being successful116 terrorist could view past examples as decreasing the need to extensively test their cb agent since successful use had already been previously demonstrated significant media attention may influence cb agent choice in the case where the media has reported widely on cb agent more information is available regarding the strengths and weaknesses of an agents use while the cb agent may not be optimal for the terrorist groups purpose easily available information may provide lower barrier than that provided by the group investing its resources in independent research for more optimal cb agent thus there may be bias towards choosing those cb agents which receive publicity some cb agents have garnered reputation among extremist groups such reputation regardless of its basis in fact may influence choice of agents for example ricin has been promoted by domestic paramilitary groups as silent tool of justice117 one of the factors that led members of the minnesota patriots council to choose ricin over other alternatives was apparently such promotion118 115 dr william bicknell at bioterrorism and smallpox ring containment mass vaccination or individual choice cato institute june 4 2002 116 toxic terror assessing terrorist

ibid crs42 source of cb agents among the most important variables to terrorist choosing an agent is what agents are available to the group regardless of the ideal preference of terrorist group if the cb agents available to it are limited the group will choose from among those available from manufacturing site some chemical agents are used commercially in manufacturing water treatment and other industries theft of such agents in bulk from such facility is of special concern to law enforcement officials due to the large volumes of agents used in many industrial processes the regular rail and truck shipments of chemicals are also potential sources for terrorists before september 11 2001 the chemical industry had been heavily criticized for its low plant security the american chemistry council chemical trade organization dedicated to best practices has increased its member security requirements in response to recent events for further information on chemical plant security see crs report rl31530 chemical plant security by lindajo schierow from natural source the ease with which naturally occurring pathogens and toxins can be recovered from nature is topic of much debate their natural prevalence is one of the most important criteria in determining the relative threat there are strong differences in opinion regarding how easy it is to isolate microbial pathogens from nature because many biological agents are widely found in nature covertly collecting these agents is not viewed as difficult however some experts claim that it is difficult to isolate pathogens with high virulence from these environmental samples disease epidemics either among humans or animals may also be sources for pathogens some experts assert that obtaining pathogens from disease outbreak would be difficult they point to the efforts public health officials exert to identify the source of the disease during an outbreak119 other experts contend that the availability of pathogens during an outbreak is high as any victim of the epidemic is plentiful source of pathogens not just the initial case further complicating debate on the topic is the prevalence of viral outbreaks in countries with limited health care systems in 2002 an outbreak of crimeancongo hemorrhagic fever on the afghanistaniran border occurred over threemonth period with multiple outbreaks among humans and animals120 epidemics such as this could be an ample source of pathogenic material provided that the terrorist group was international in scope or had support among hospital staff in the outbreak region terrorist groups which infiltrate into hospital infrastructure laboratory production and other medical positions is an area of great concern laboratory workers handle many tissue and 119 public comments of

fever reported at afghaniran border the associated press june 6 2002 crs43 blood samples containing potential pathogens these samples could be used as starting point for growing biological agents from culture collection culture collections are repositories of bacteria and viruses maintained typically for scientific research121 in the past culture collections have been largely unregulated for example in 1995 larry wayne harris was able to fraudulently purchase plague bacteria from private germ bank the american type culture collection this event caused great concern among health and law enforcement officials and resulted in greater oversight and regulation of the transfer of pathogens122 this higher level of oversight has not been duplicated worldwide the world federation of culture collections an international organization that indexes culture collections has established member guidelines to adopt best practices and follow domestic and international regulation with respect to pathogens123 however approximately twothirds of the world culture collections are not members of this federation124 additionally many culture collections are not financially secure this situation may provide the opportunity for wealthy terrorist group to acquire seed microbes from culture collection which has well characterized pathogens manufacture and preparation of cb agents most experts agree that terrorist groups lacking specialized training and knowledge in the weaponization of cb agents will likely produce suboptimal quality agents these cb agents may be more likely to degrade during storage than cb weapons produced by nationstates this degradation may lead terrorist groups to produce the agent immediately before the attack or to plan smaller scale attacks so as to minimize agent loss the preparation of cb agents for dissemination will also play significant role in the effectiveness of terror attack terrorist groups lacking experience and specialized knowledge will likely be unable to generate weaponized cb agents and instead will be forced to utilize cruder less refined mixtures of cb agent and other material such as nonviable pathogens and media or residual solvent dissemination of cb agents using adapted technologies such as improvised aerosolization 121 there are also toxin collections toxins do not reproduce and so the purchase of small amounts of toxins from collection is not as potentially dangerous as the purchase of small amounts of microbial pathogens on the other hand the availability of toxinproducing agents such as aflatoxinproducing mold strains through such collection would raise concerns similar to those surrounding culture collections 122 the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 p l 104132 requires the secretary of health and human services to create the select agent list and regulate these agents transfer within the united states this part of this act closed the loophole allowing harriss purchase of select agent pathogen 123 for more information about the world federation of culture collections see their website at httpwwwwfccinfo 124 michael barletta amy sands and jonathan b tucker keeping track of anthrax the case for biosecurity convention bulletin of the atomic scientists mayjune 2002 crs44 devices is unlikely to produce optimal particle size distributions thereby limiting their effect therefore the effectiveness of cb attack by terrorists is likely to be significantly lower than that predicted under optimal conditions these factors may lead to the appearance of smaller scale attack even if catastrophic mass casualty attack is attempted the above considerations may significantly influence the cb agent choice of terrorist group cb agents which lack well documented storage procedures or manufacturing information may be avoided by terrorist group even if the cb agent would otherwise be more highly ranked similarly reduced dissemination effectiveness may dissuade terrorist groups from selecting cb agents difficult to manufacture or store due to concerns about producing and stockpiling enough cb agent policy issues current regulation international regulation the development proliferation and use of chemical and biological weaponry are closely regulated the united states is signatory to both the biological weapons convention bwc and the chemical weapons convention cwc and is actively involved in their implementation125 both the bwc and cwc prohibit offensive cb development as well as provide proliferation barriers to states not possessing cb capability cwc international implementation is overseen by the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons126 additionally the united states and 32 other nations participate in the australia group an organization developed to voluntarily harmonize national export controls on chemical weapon precursor compounds dualuse equipment and biological agents that could be used to develop chemical andor biological weapons capability127 domestic regulation the use or threatened use of weapon of mass destruction is illegal more specific restrictions apply to chemical and biological weapons128 it is

prophylactic medical and diagnostic activities also the department of health and human services is required to create and maintain list of those agents the select agent list dangerous to the public health129 the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 pl 107188 requires the secretary of health and human services to create registry of all persons possessing agents on the select agent list and registry containing identifying characteristics of the agents possessed it also requires the secretary of agriculture to create similar registry regarding agents deemed to be an agricultural hazard for more on p l 107188 and specifically on the new select agent requirements in that law see crs report rl31263 bioterrorism legislation to improve public health preparedness and response capacity by c stephen redhead donna u vogt and mary tiemann dualuse concerns dualuse technologies are technologies that have legitimate uses but are adaptable for terrorist purposes and can provide terrorist groups with readymade proven technology to aid in their cb agent production an issue of great concern to antiproliferation agencies is the potential of dualuse technology to jumpstart access to cb production the export and import of dualuse technologies is primarily addressed through trade regulation the us department of defense the us department of state and the us department of commerce are all involved in determining regulating and implementing export controls for dualuse technology additionally the united states supports and participates in the australia groups antiproliferation campaign these policies are directed primarily at nationlevel programs and only partially block an individuals access to dualuse technology especially when the purchases do not cross national borders130 addressing the issue of dualuse technology is complicated for analysts regulators and policymakers strict control of cb dualuse technology could provide an accurate accounting of such sales but this level of control may greatly impact both the business and health sectors pharmaceutical and chemical industries would likely fall under any regulations dealing with chemical threats while hospitals medical laboratories and biotechnology firms would likely become further regulated academic research into number of fields including molecular biology chemistry microbiology virology neuroscience and others might be significantly affected as 129 the select agent list is defined in 42 cfr 734 130 under project bacus the defense threat reduction agency successfully built cb agent production facility in nevada from dualuse technology without drawing regulatory attention as reported in judith miller stephan engelberg and william broad germs biological weapons and americas secret war new york simon and schuster 2001 121 crs46 well131 the addition of such technology regulation might be successful at lowering the risk of cb terror but could come at high regulatory burden and economic cost132 new multinational regulation options some experts advocate as means of controlling cb terror biosecurity treaty to further enhance the transparency of national biodefense and industrial biotechnology programs133 one aspect of this proposed evolving framework is harmonization of internal national standards to regulate the handling storage and transfer of biological pathogens signatories would determine list of covered pathogens and set general guidelines each signatory would then develop specific methods to implement the guidelines in theory this would lower the probability that terrorist could acquire dangerous pathogen from foreign germ bank for use in the united states proponents of such treaty point to the largely successful use of regulatory inspections and control of raw starting materials in stemming transfer of radiological and nuclear materials from nation states to terrorist groups they also cite the short travel time between distant points as factor which requires international cooperation and attention to combat potential bioterrorism134 it is not clear whether regulation on the nationstate level could provide significant barriers to smallscale production nationstatelevel mechanisms have been relatively successful at stemming nuclear proliferation because of the technical difficulties involved in developing an infrastructure capable of manufacturing nuclear bomb combined with the need for localized easily detected and tracked nuclear material however revelations regarding the dissemination of nuclear weapon technology from pakistan highlight some of the difficulties in this approach even with nuclear weapons proliferation of chemical and biological agents is not as limited by required technology as nuclear weapons and source material is much more readily available also because of the dualuse nature of the technologies used with cb agents export control of chemical and biological weapons development is difficult for example iraq was able to significantly expand its chemical and biological weapon capabilities before the first gulf war through the purchase of dualuse technology

op cit 134 christopher chyba toward biological security foreign affairs mayjune 2002 crs47 in obscuring the purpose of dualuse technology and the difficulty in conclusively identifying cb program additionally there are serious concerns with international regulatory inspections including the transparency of onsite inspections the degree to which inspectors should be allowed to document and access commercial sites because of concerns over protecting proprietary information and the practicality of challenge inspection system135 there is also concern that multinational regulation would not adequately address the cb terrorist threat some analysts point out that export and import controls prevent only the transfer of such items or technology over international borders and do little to address cb agent development within the country they contend that domestic terrorist groups or international groups which establish themselves within the united states would be unaffected by enhanced multinational cooperation and transparency prevention versus consequence management law enforcement options the approach that us law enforcement agencies take towards counterterrorism is still evolving fbi director mueller has stated that the fbi is shifting its counterterrorism efforts from reactive philosophy to proactive one136 as examples of this shift director mueller pointed to efforts to restrict fundraising efforts of terrorist groups and increased counterterrorism intelligence gathering this approach is based on preventing future terrorist attacks but it is unlikely that all possible attacks can be discovered prevented or planned for secretary of defense rumsfeld is reported to have stated it is physically impossible to defend at every time in every place against every conceivable technique vice president cheney and fbi director mueller have reportedly stated that another terrorist attack is inevitable137 related approach is deterrence this approach has generally worked well at nationstate level for example during the first gulf war coalition forces faced an adversary who apparently chose not to use the chemical biological and toxin weapons in its possession it has been argued that iraq was deterred from using these weapons by veiled threat of massive retaliation138 it is less clear that deterrence would be effective against terrorist group in particular international agreements and threats of massive retaliation are unlikely to deter terrorist group that is willing to deploy cb agent anonymously and has identifiable infrastructure vulnerable to counterattack 135 for an overview of the issues surrounding international inspections see crs report rl31559 proliferation control regimes background and status by sharon squassoni steven r bowman and carl behrens 136 robert mueller testimony before the senate judiciary committee june 6 2002 137 david westphal rumsfeld terrorists access to deadlier weapons inevitable scripps howard news service may 21 2002 138 judith miller stephan engelberg and william broad germs biological weapons and americas secret war op cit crs48 some policymakers may suggest increasing the resources devoted to investigating the incidents and prosecuting the perpetrators this approach of deterrence on an individual scale is common in law enforcement in the case of bank robberies for example it is widely believed that identifying arresting and punishing bank robbers is effective at deterring others who might be contemplating similar crime criminal prosecution derives its deterrence value from the wish of the assailant to succeed at the event and escape this approach may be adequate against some terrorist groups however it is unlikely to deter groups with members willing to die during action or groups that insulate the leaders and planners from those carrying out the attack hence normal forms of policing may be inadequate to deal with those terrorists who choose suicide or place low value on escape proactive measures such as intelligence gathering or infiltration of terrorist groups may be the more effective approach to prevent suicide attacks health care options policymakers may want to address whether to focus on prophylaxis against specific diseases or to address the bioterror threat through broader approach the targeted approach is illustrated by secretary of health and human services thompson who is reported as saying that the governments position with respect to smallpox vaccine is that every man woman and child will have vaccine they can say has their name on it139 vaccines for many diseases are available under investigational new drug protocols and there has been legislative interest in spurring private sector research into the development of new vaccines and treatments140 with development and largescale availability of vaccines for bioterror agents the threat posed by those specific agents is diminished proponents of targeted approach claim that additional vaccines will appreciably lower the global threat as fewer pathogens become viable masscasualty agents critics argue that the vulnerability to agents lacking vaccine would be fundamentally unchanged under the targeted approach furthermore the decision of what agents to protect against may reflect the ease of vaccine production or other factors rather than the risk an agent will be used it is not certain that vaccine can be produced in timely manner for the highest threat agents further criticism of the specific vaccine approach is the logistical effort required to vaccinate the population the cost of repeatedly vaccinating large populations may offset the economic benefit of providing specific prophylaxis for many agents finally as seen in the smallpox vaccination efforts the perceived risk from vaccination must be weighed against the potential risk of biological attack 139 susan okie and justin gillis us mounts smallpox vaccine push officials want dose for every person in the country by the end of 2002 the washington post october 28 2001 140 for example in 108th congress s 15 s 1504 and hr 2122 the project bioshield act of 2003 sen judd and rep tauzin would guarantee government market for certain biomedical countermeasures against potential bioterror agents and s 666 the biological chemical and radiological weapons countermeasures research act sen lieberman would provide tax and market based incentives to encourage companies to develop treatments for bioterror agents crs49 broader approach is advocated by other experts who claim that the best defense against bioterror attack is to increase the capacity of the public health sector to treat ill people track emerging diseases and provide care to those made ill during bioterror attack proponents of an increase in public health advocate that this approach provides an equal and general application to most naturally occurring diseases and accidents141 yet critics contend that increasing the nationwide quality of public health care would be too expensive to implement at the required level and to sustain indefinitely furthermore the threat posed by untreatable agents would remain unchanged as this approach would not attempt to discover new specific treatments separating assessments of chemical and biological agents the concept of wmd while useful in military framework may obscure some dangers of terrorist threat policymakers may want to consider whether continuing attempts to treat all nonconventional weapons within the same framework is adequate for the terrorist threat an alternative is to treat the different threats in separate frameworks methods for controlling proliferation and production of cb agents are often assumed to be equally applicable to both types of agents policymakers may want to determine whether it is valid to regulate biological including toxins and chemical agents jointly since inhibition of cb proliferation involves similar issues namely large volumes of dualuse machinery similar educational and financial component and sliding production scale combined regulatory approach may be reasonable solution it may provide for clear uniform standards and simplify the regulatory process alternatively policymakers may wish to regulate chemical and biological agents separately focusing on areas where they differ technically for example biological agents lack signatures which can be detected from distance while chemical agents have signatures unique to these agents laser remote sensing has been used to determine if clouds contain nerve agents detecting biological agents requires sensitive agentspecific detectors and this difficulty in detecting biological agents complicates remote monitoring of potential biological agent laboratories also since most biological agents unlike most chemical agents are available in nature preventing access to seed stocks of biological material is more difficult than blocking access to chemical precursors detection methods for biological agents need to be able to differentiate between naturally occurring and anthropogenic pathogens142 for example to find hidden terrorist anthrax laboratory sensor would need to distinguish between the background naturally occurring levels of anthrax spores and 141 for example see greg seigle feds could make bioterror impossible expert says global security newswire april 9 2002 142 see crs report rl32152 the biowatch program detection of bioterrorism by dana shea and sarah lister crs50 those coming from the covert facility143 creating regulations addressing chemical and biological agents in separate frameworks may provide more rigorous control of these agents acceptable level of cb terrorism risk further issue policymakers may consider is how to balance an acceptable degree of risk from cb terrorism against the amount of security required to address this risk viewed from statutory and regulatory perspective the cb terrorism risk appears to be reduced from the 2001 level current laws limit access to record possession of and limit the transfer of pathogens on the select agent list144 congress has allocated funding to improve aspects of the public health system including research into agent detectors and epidemiological surveillance to reduce the vulnerability level increased law enforcement efforts designed to reduce the general terrorist threat also reduce the probability of cb terror attack there appears to be concerted attempt to significantly lower the risk of cb terrorism complete removal of domestic cb vulnerability is probably impossible maximum effort would likely require among other measures indepth searches of all materials entering the country strict purchasing controls on all dualuse technologies and industrial controls such as registration increased security procedures and regular inspection of sites engaged in chemical or biological manufacture the cost of such program could be high both in economic terms and civil liberties policymakers may likely consider the balance between further decreasing vulnerability and the continued success of industry and research when crafting additional legislation and regulation advances in science and science policy scientific advances may alter some of the conclusions of the above analysis which addresses naturally occurring strains of pathogens their natural distribution and the known methods of treatment for them it does not for example address intentionally induced antibiotic resistance

reportedly possible with current technology their production requires greater degree of knowledge and experience than that needed to produce pathogens chemical agents and toxins addressed in this report the successful synthesis of polio virus146 and the development of genetically engineered strain of mousepox highly lethal to even vaccinated mice147 stand as stark examples of how advances in relevant research can potentially change fundamental assumptions underlying an analysis conclusions this report is designed to provide framework for legislators to use in developing riskmanagementbased policies rather than vulnerabilitybased policies to protect against chemical biological and toxin attacks this analysis addresses relatively smallscale attacks that could be accomplished by determined nonstate sponsored terrorists the analysis presented in this report is consistent with the findings of the gilmore commission which stated that preparation against largescale chemical or biological attack would not necessarily simultaneously protect against smaller scale attacks this analysis suggests that agents that are effective for smallscale attacks are not necessarily the agents of choice for massivescale attacks this is in part explained by the higher availability of commercial equipment to prepare store and disseminate an agent and in part explained by the less restrictive safety and logistical requirements of small attack in comparison to large attack small attacks require amounts of equipment and supplies that are less likely to trigger regulatory notice the presence of dualuse equipment in industrial settings may mean that obtaining the required technology for cb production may be less difficult than previously thought another potential use for this analysis is to determine possible priority with which the threat presented by specific agents should be addressed this analysis provides information on the general approaches to reduce the threat from terrorist use of different cb agents as well as information that may allow policymakers to reduce the dangers from specific agents the analysis could be useful in decisions related to policy options such as developing specific remedies eg cures prophylaxis detection equipment and more efficient public health mechanisms for detecting and treating the agents towards the

the awareness of the vulnerabilities of the united states to asymmetric attacks policymakers are carefully reexamining many policies to reduce the threat of future attacks some policies already changed include an increase in public health funding an increase in cb related research funding an increase in regulatory oversight of cb agents and greater limitations on access to potential cb agents while some steps have been taken towards increasing the robustness of the public health system how increased funding will translate into greater preparedness for and response to cb attack is still an open question148 efforts to limit the risk of bioterrorism through greater physical control of certain pathogens have elicited concerns regarding unexpected costs149 other issues that may be of interest to policymakers in the future include limiting access to cb related scientific data150 and increasing electronic and physical surveillance to discover cb use at an early stage151 the department of health and human services has established national science advisory board for biosecurity to aid in determining whether unclassified federally funded fundamental research may pose threat to national security while the department of homeland security is supporting the biowatch program for early detection of catastrophic bioterrorism whether these programs are successful in addressing the threat posed by cb terrorism including small scale cb terrorism will likely be an area of congressional interest 148 see crs report rl31719 an overview of the us public health system in the

crs report rl32152 the biowatch program detection of bioterrorism by dana shea and sarah lister crs53 appendix methodology how criteria were chosen the matrix approach is derived from that used by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc in prioritizing potential biological terrorism agents152 it should be emphasized that there are many different ways to develop an assessment framework for terror agents the approach taken here is not the only valid approach and different results may occur if different criteria and weighting systems are chosen military assessment public health assessment and an assessment focusing on terrorist use may have different criteria and relative weighting depending on the assumptions and needs of each assessment type the cdc assessed biological agents in public health framework using criteria appropriate for considering public health response these criteria included the public health impact the dissemination potential public perception and special public health preparedness needs this report contains modified criteria to address qualities that terrorist groups planning small scale attack might consider for example more general criterion than used by the cdc of public health impact was developed for use in this report as defined for this report public health impact refers to more general impact on the health care system incorporating both casualties and fatalities this criterion allows for example more direct comparison of agents which are lethal with those that predominantly injure in contrast to the cdc approach this report provides framework that separates ease in making and disseminating into separate criteria ease of acquisition and ease of dissemination since both acquisition and dissemination may pose significant barrier to the use of cb agent it was deemed important to separate these two criteria additionally the persontoperson contagiousness of pathogen was not considered as distinct category in contrast to the cdc assessment from public health perspective massive attack using contagious pathogens could quickly overwhelm the surge capacity of the public health system however in assessing distribution of such an agent contagiousness may be considered as making the agents easier to disseminate contagion may leverage the dissemination of pathogen for example the initial release may need only to successfully infect single individual to be effective this infected individual might now further disseminate the pathogen inadvertently infecting others for this reason this report considers contagion as positive in terms of ease of dissemination if pathogen is transmissible through casual contact in contrast agents that are contagious only through close contact or by exchange of bodily fluids may be less effective means of dissemination this report addresses smallscale terror attacks and so does not postulate any enhanced requirements for preparation the number of casualties and fatalities arising from smallscale attack may have large public health impact but the mechanisms already in place to provide rush pharmaceuticals if available track and locate affected people and perform required diagnostics should be sufficient for 152 centers for disease control and prevention public health assessment of potential biological terrorism agents emerging infectious diseases 8 2002 225 crs54 events of this scale consequently the cdc assessment of special preparation has been reduced to two remaining components the response to medical treatment of various agents and the preevent prophylaxis which may be available to the population to ameliorate the impact of the event these two criteria may have equal weight to terrorist as either would reduce the effects of terror agent dissemination the final criterion used in this report is the degree to which various agents have been investigated by military weapons programs agents which reportedly have been weaponized or were research targets for weapons program may be available for purchase or theft by terrorist groups additionally records of the weaponization process information about successful or unsuccessful research routes and knowledge of optimized processes for these agents may be available while there are few data available in the open literature about the level of information available to terrorist groups from these weapons programs the possibility that there could be technology transfer from state program to terrorist group factors into the relative threat analysis additionally the fact that an agent may not be explicitly cited as being part of weapons program does not preclude its presence in one instead this merely means that it is unknown from open sources whether any weaponsrelated research has been performed regarding it these criteria were originally developed for pathogens and since this report also considers chemical and toxin agents the criteria were further adapted for use with toxin and chemical agents since the chemical agents considered in this report have been considered as chemical weapons for many years chemical agents status in weapons program seemed superfluous and was omitted from the assessment also prophylaxis for chemical agents in general refers to physical protection comprised of impermeable suits and barriers to personal exposure since this report focuses on the threat to an unprepared civilian population it was considered unlikely that prophylaxis would be available for such surprise attack consequently this criterion was removed the weighting system between criteria in this analysis each individual criterion is given equal weighting this was done to imply that each of the criteria can be viewed from generic perspective of use to have roughly equal importance as discussed elsewhere in this report some terrorist groups because of specific aims ideology or expertise may place more importance on some categories than on others for example group with extensive practical experience in dissemination technology may place much less importance on this category than group lacking this specialized knowledge by weighting all the criteria equally this limited analysis attempts to rate the domestic risk of potential terrorist use of these agents to first approximation the criteria have been made equivalent in the absence of information requiring different weighting other weighting systems using these data may be useful for other purposes within criteria each criterion was divided into three segments to develop relative scale of influence consequently refers to an aspect that is negative influence to terrorist use while refers to an aspect that is positive influence to crs55 terrorist use the rank represents an intermediate state for example in the prophylaxis criterion denotes licensed prophylaxis while denotes prophylaxis at all denotes an experimental prophylaxis lacking food and drug administration approval in defining the scale within criteria an effort was made to logically group the range of possibilities into three segments the separation between segments is more distinct in some categories than in others because of the coarseness of this scale agents that receive the same symbol within criterion do not necessarily possess the same exact properties but instead should be considered roughly comparable the full scale of potential response may not be presented in these categories as the agents presented here are those agents which have been identified as having the potential to be used as bioweapon these agents have generally been preselected to possess appropriate characteristics for use as consequence the definitions developed address the characteristics of bioweapons rather than cb agents in general the full spectrum of potential agents is not represented in these matrices the selection process for agents described in the text requires that potential agents be identified by multiple lists of agents of concern this process removes many agents which appear to have low terrorism potential and agents not considered threat to the populace at large because of this truncation there are few examples of very poor cb agents found on the matrices ranking agents were ranked based on the symbols assigned within each criterion agents were first sorted by the number of barriers to their successful terrorist use the incidence of symbols for given agent initially determined the ranking of an agent agents with equivalent numbers of symbols were then sorted according to the number of symbols present in the case of further equivalency the number of symbols were considered if equivalent rankings result agents which have been successfully weaponized are presented above those which have been research targets agents which are fully equivalent in ranking and weaponization status are presented in alphabetical order agents are presented in the matrices in inverse order to the number of barriers to their successful terrorist use thus agents which possess the greatest number of barriers are presented at the bottom of the matrix agents with equivalent ranking are presented grouped together within the matrices this type of analysis is not designed to produce highly differentiated ranking of agents but qualitative understanding of relative dangers therefore this list does not attempt to discriminate agents of roughly equal ranking the sorting mechanism used here is not the only mechanism which might be applied to this framework but it was felt that sorting according to the number of barriers would more properly address criteria which might block successful use of given agent this implies that terrorist may use an agent which is less wellsuited but lacks significant barriers rather than an highly effective agent which has significant barrier to its use further refinement of the range of characteristics involved in given symbol or criterion or reranking agents using other methods may lead to different assessment of each agent and its relative threat for example crs56 some may wish to sort this framework according to positive factors this changes the order of some agents although the overall ordering of the matrix remains similar crs57 appendix b table 4 comparison of chemical agent characteristics chemical agent ease of acquisition public health impact
