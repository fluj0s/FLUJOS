for reconstruction and stabilization scrs was established in 2004 to address longstanding concerns both within congress and the broader foreign policy community over the perceived lack of the appropriate capabilities and processes to deal with transitions from conflict to stability these capabilities and procedures include adequate planning mechanisms for stabilization and reconstruction operations efficient interagency coordination structures and procedures in carrying out such tasks and appropriate civilian personnel for many of the nonmilitary tasks required effectively distributing resources among the various executive branch actors maintaining clear lines of authority and jurisdiction and balancing short and longterm objectives are major challenges for designing planning and conducting postconflict operations as is fieldi ng the appropriate civilian personnel in his january 23 2007 state of the union address president bush called for congress to work with his administration to design and establish volunteer civilian reserve corps included in the administrations february 4 2008 budget request for fy2009 is 2486 million civilian stabilization initiative that seeks to establish that corps since july 2004 scrs has worked to establish the basic concepts mechanisms and capabilities necessary to carry out such operations working with staff of about 73 individuals from the state department other executive branch agencies and on contract as of early january 2007 scrs has taken steps to monitor and plan for potential conflicts to develop the first phase of rapidresponse crisis management capability to improve interagency and international coordination to develop interagency training exercises and to help state department regional bureaus develop concepts and proposals for preventive action the issues for the second session of the 110 th congress include whether to provide permanent authorization for that office and whether to authorize and fund the administrations civilian stabilization initiative csi presented with the annual budget request in february 2008 the csi would establish threepart 4250person civilian response corps crs that would include 1 an active force of 250 state department employees 2 2000member standby force and 3 2000member civilian reserve of nonfederal government personnel in 2008 congress has made some progress on these matters on march 5 the house passed the reconstruction and stabilization civilian ma nagement act of 2008 hr 1084 which would codify the establishment of scrs and authorize the crc provisions of this bill are included in the fy2009 national defense authorization bill hr 5658 as passed by the house in june also in june 2008 congress appropriated 75 million for the csi in

initiatives requesting that the administration provide more information on its plans thus far the second session of the 110th congress has two issues under consideration the first is whether to authorize and fund new mechanisms that would operationalize the state department that is transform it from an institution devoted to diplomacy to one that would effect change through ontheground personnel and programs dedicated to promoting security and stability in transitions from conflict and postconflict situations one such mechanism is flexible noyear discretionary conflict response fund the other is readiness response corps consisting of various components including small unit of active duty federal employees and large civilian reserve corps analogous to the military reserve the second is whether to put into permanent law the state department office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization scrs and its operations created in mid2004 scrs was tasked with designing and in some cases establishing the new structures within the state department and elsewhere that would allow civilian agencies to develop effective policies processes and personnel to build stable and democratic states according to the march 2006 national security strategy the latest authoritative administration document mentioning these capabilities scrss role is to plan and execute civilian sr efforts and to integrate all relevant united states government resources and assets in conducting such operations 1 in 2008 the bush administration kicked off discussion of these issues in february with its announcement of the civilian stabilization initiative csi for which it requested almost 649 million in the fy2009 budget request through the csi the administration seeks to develop coordinated capacity across the15 united states government civilian agencies and the department of defense for whole of govern ment response to emergent reconstruction and stabilization crises2 in the

2005 state of the union address to build and preserve community of free and independent nations with governments that answer to their citizens and reflect their own cultures cast the oncediscredited concept of building or rebuilding government institutions economies and civic cultures in new light during the 1990s many policymakers considered the establishment of new institutions in troubled countries to be an overly expensive if not futile exercise the use of us military forces for such activities particularly in the first half of the decade was troubling to many members in the past few years however the bush administration in response to concerns about the threats posed by weak and fragile states reframed both us security and international development policy and undertaken dramatic corresponding changes in us governmental structures and practices these changes it argued would enable the united states to perform such tasks more efficiently and at lesser cost particularly in transitions from conflict and in postconflict situations key component of these changes is the establishment and reinforcement of new civilian structures and forces in particular scrs and the civilian reserve corps year ago the bush administration made these new civilian entities prominent feature in two initiatives the national security presidential directive 44 n spd44 of december 2005 on the management of interagency reconstruction and stabilization operations and the transformational diplomacy reorganization of state department personnel and practices announced in january 2006 these initiatives are intended to enhance the unit ed states ability to function effectively on the world scene in the post911 environment in that environment according to secretary of state condoleezza rices remarks introducing transformational diplomacy the greatest threats to us security often emerge within states that are either too weak to police their territory or lack the political will or capacity to do so to deal with that environment secretary rice outlined new us foreign policy strategy focusing on the intersections of diplomacy democracy promotion economic reconstruction and military security and involving extensive changes in government to carry that strategy out 3 statebuilding or nationbuilding as it is often called is at the center of this strategy both initiatives reinforced the important role that the bush administration has given the new state department office of the coordina tor for reconstruction and stabilization scrs in policymaking and implementation dealing with conflict transitions and weak and fragile states 3 remarks at georgetown school of foreign service january 18 2006 available at httpwwwstategovsecretaryrm 200659306htm this theme was

to the need for civilian reserve corps as tool in the generational struggle against terrorism such corps would function much like our military reserve he said it would ease the burden on the armed forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when america needs them it would give people across america who do not wear the uniform chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time4

july 2004 responded to increasing calls for the improvement of us civilian capabilities to plan and carry out postconflict statebuilding operations several factors have combined since 911 to lead many analysts to conclude that such operations are vital to us security and that the united states must reorganize itself to conduct them effectively in particular by creating new and improving existing civilian institutions to carry them out foremost among these factors for many analysts is the widespread perception since 911 that global instability directly threatens us security and that it is vital us interest to transform weak and failing states into stable democratic ones related to this is the expectation that responding to the threat of instability will require the united states and the international community to intervene periodically in foreign conflicts with peacekeeping 6 and stabilization forces at about the same intensive pace as it has done since the early 1990s because that pace has stressed the us military many policymakers believe that the united states must create and enhance civilian capabilities to carry out the peacebuilding tasks that are widely viewed as necessary for stability and reconstruction in fragile conflictprone and postconflict states finally numerous analyses distilling the past decade and half of experience with multifaceted peacekeeeping and peacebuilding operations have raised hopes that rapid comprehensive and improved peacebuilding efforts can significantly raise the possibilities of achieving sustainable peace postconflict operations are complex undertakings usually involving the participation of several united nations departments and system agencies the international financial institutions and plethora of nongovernmental humanitarian and development organizations as well as the military and other departments or ministries of the united states and other nations 7 the united 4 according to the 2006 national security strategy the ci vilian reserve would also be used for both postconflict reconstruction and international disaster assistance p 45 5 parts of this background section and the following section on scrs are drawn from now archived crs report rs22031 peacekeeping and postconflict capabilities the state departments office for reconstruction and stabilization by nina m serafino and martin weiss 6 peacekeeping is broad generic and often imprecise rm to describe the many activities that the united nations and other international organizations and sometimes ad hoc coalitions of nations or i ndividual nations undertake to promote maintain enforce or enhance the possibilities for peace these activities range from providing election observers recreating police or civil defense forces for the new governments of those countries organizing and providing security for humanitarian relief efforts and monitoring and enforcing ceasefires and other arrangements designed to separate parties recently in conflict many of these activities are ofte n also referred to as nationbuilding better term some analysts suggest is statebuilding as used here the term encompasses both p eace enforcement operations sent to enforce an internationa l mandate to establish peace and peacebuilding activities peacebuilding activities usually undertaken in postconflict environment are designed to strengthen p eace and prevent the resumption or spread of conflict including disa rmament and demobilization of warring parties repatriation of refugees reform and strengthening of government in stitutions electionmonitoring and promotion of political participation and human rights 7 the term postconflict stabilization and reconstruction is broad but is usually understood to encompass tasks

peacekeeping operations of the 1990s on an ad hoc basis with little interagency planning and coordination and often with the us military in the lead the military was called upon to perform such missions not only for its extensive resources but also because other us government agency could match the m ilitarys superior planning and organizational capabilities in addition because of its manpower the military carried out most of the us humanitarian and nationbuilding contribution even though some believed that civilians might be better suited to carry out such tasks especially those involving cooperation with humanitarian ngos during the 1990s many analysts began to perceive the need to improve and increase civilian contributions to peacekeeping operations especially for those activities related to planning and conducting operations and to establishing secure environment an important clinton administration initiative was the may 1997 presidential decision directive pdd 56 entitled the clinton administration s policy on managing complex contingency operations according to the white paper explaining it pdd 56 sought to address interagency planning and coordination problems through new planning and implementing mechanisms 8 due to what some analysts describe as internal bureaucratic resistance pdd 56s provisions were never formally implemented although some of its practices were informally adopted in december 2005 president bush issued national security pres idential directive nspd 44 which replaced pdd 56 for more information see below the clinton administration also attempted to remedy the shortage of one critical nationbuilding tool international civilian police forces through pdd 71 which white paper describes as outlining policy guidelines for strengthening criminal justice systems in support of peace operations9 while never implemented by the clinton administration pdd 71 has been partially put into force by the bush administration10 improvements in the provision of social and economic assistance are also viewed as crucial to successful outcomes postconflict populations need safety net and poverty alleviation programs as well as technical assistance and advice on monetary and fiscal policy and debt management in order to create an environment conducive to democratization and economic growth11 while the popular image of us postconflict assistance is the postworld war ii marshall plan through which the united states provided the foreign assistance needed for europes postconflict reconstruction the united states is longer the sole and often not the dominant donor in postconflict situations multilateral institutions became increasingly continued hostilities in the past many of the stabilization activities we re loosely labeled peacekeeping see footnote 1 reconstruction involves repairing in some cases creating the infrastructure necessary to support longterm ec onomic growth and development this infrastructure can

following the collapse of the soviet union international organizations such as the world bank and the international monetary fund now play crucial roles working with the us government to provide economic assistance and technical advice on rebuilding postconflict economies nevertheless although the united states has provided some funding for economic reconstruction multilaterally for the recent afghanistan and iraq operations most us funding for postconflict operations is provided bilaterally many analysts now judge that multilateral assistance is more effective for the recipient country than bilateral aid for two reasons 12 first disbursing funds multilaterally through agencies or international organizations gives greater assurance that it will reach recipients than providing aid bilaterally with direct payments to individual governments or nongovernmental organizations ngos in addition analysts find that bilateral aid is more likely to be apportioned according to the donors foreign policy priorities rather than the economic needs of the recipient country 13 for many analysts and policymakers the ongoing iraq operation illustrates us government need for new planning and coordination arrangements that would provide leadership role for civilians in postconflict phases of military operations and new civilian capabilities to augment and relieve the military as soon as possible and greater international coordination the perception of continued need for such operations and the perceived inefficiencies of the still largely ad hoc us responses have reinvigorated calls for planning and coordination reform the bush administrations reluctance to use military forces for nationbuilding tasks and the extreme stresses placed on the military by combat roles in iraq and afghanistan have pushed those calls in new direction to the development of adequate civilian capabilities to perform those tasks

strengthen us and international capabilities to foster security good governance and economic development especially in postconflict situations the 911 commission and the commission on weak states and us national security judged weak states as well as unsuccessful postconflict transitions to pose threat to us security 14 these groups argued that such states often experience economic strife and political instability that make them vulnerable to drug trafficking human traf ficking and other criminal enterprises and to linkage with nonstate terrorist groups such as the links between the previous taliban government in afghanistan and the qaeda terrorist network weak states also are unprepared to handle major public health issues such as hivaids that can generate political and economic instability 15 these commissions and other analysts argued for assistance to the governments of 12 milner helen why multilateralism foreign aid and domestic principal agent problems available at

control their territories meet their citizens basic needs and create legitimate governments based on effective transparent institutions these and other studies recognized need to enhance us government structures and capabilities for conducting postconflict operations16 although differing in several respects the studies largely agreed on five points 1 the current ad hoc system needs to be replaced with permanent mechanism for developing contingency plans and procedures for joint civilmilitary operations led by civilians 2 mechanisms to rapidly deploy us civilian government and government contracted personnel need to be put in place 3 preventive action needs to be considered 4 the us government needs to enhance multinational capabilities to carry out postconflict security tasks and to better coordinate international aid and 5 flexible funding arrangements are needed to deal with such situations in addition some urged substantial amounts of funding for flexible us and international accounts 17 g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g156g561g143g152g155g561g16g142g160g561g5g146g159g146g149g146g138g151g561g8g152g155g140g142g156g561 prominent feature of several of the recent reports on stabilization and reconstruction operations was recommendation to develop rapidlydeployable civilian forces to undertake statebuilding functions particularly those related to rule of law even before hostilities had ceased many analysts view the early deployment of rule of law personnel as essential to providing security from the outset of an operation which they argue will enhance the possibilities for longterm stability and democracy in an intervened or postconflict country many view the development of civilian groups to do so as permitting the earlie r withdrawal of military personnel than would otherwise be possible six studies between 2003 and 2005 endorsed the creati on of cohesive rapidlydeployable units of civilian experts for stabilization and reconstruction operations 18 16 the reports are 1 play to win the final report of the bipar tisan commission on postconflict reconstruction center for strategic and international studies csis and the association of

recommended the concurrent deployment of civilian stabilization and reconstruction personnel with combat forces in order to expedite the transfer of nationbuilding responsibilities to civilians the report recommends the creation of standing interagency stabilization and reconstruction team within the government and the development of an oncall civilian crisis management corps of medical legal language and law enforcement personnel from state and local governments and the private sector 19 the march 2004 report of the center for strategic and international studies csis recommended the establishment of an agency for stability operations reporting directly to the secretary of state the agency would be responsible for preparing for such operations as well as the management and deployment of civilian stability operations corps of 200300 us government civilians who are organized trained and equipped for conducting such operations and of civilian stability operations reserve of an unspecified number of non government civilians with related expertise who would be oncall for rapid deployment 20 the april 2004 report of the us institute of peace on the rule of law component of building civilian capacity recommended the creation of reserve corps as well as of separate office in the office of the secretary of state that would have authority to recruit deploy and manage constabulary police units judges attorneys and other legal professionals21 us institute of peace analyst recommended the creation of us stability force comprised of 1 robust military forces 2 civilian constabulary units 3 civilian police and 4 rule of law prof essionals lawyers judges and corrections experts that would deploy concurrently in order to provide the needed security from the outset22

the civilian roles in reconstruction operations and that it prepare deploy and lead the civil components of the reconstruction missions the study finds that the civilian police judges civil

states currently deploys other rule of law personnel with experience in justice and corrections systems through department of justice contracts funded by inl the state departments civilian police program requests contractors to identify such personnel in an effort to create capability within the civpol to deploy them to many analysts even these recommendations do not provide for the full range of personnel needed in timely manner according to some expert s if the role of the military is to shift at the end of major combat operations from combat to providing perimeter security then the united states must create constabulary unitseither military or civilianwhich would take responsibility for internal security some also argue the need for improvements in the us civilian police system regardless of whether civilian reserve is established24 g5g155g146g157g146g140g156g561g20g142g156g153g152g151g141g561 some analysts have questioned the utility of scrs and of the rationale that underlines its creation and the adoption of the transformational diplomacy strategy more broadly two think tank studies published in january 2006 dispute the concept that weak and failed states are per among the most significant threats to the united states they point out that weak states are not the only locations where terrorists have found recruits or sought safehaven as they have exploited discontent and operated in developed countries as well report of the center for global development states that many factors beyond the weakness or lack of government institutionsdemographic political religious cultural and geographiccontribute to the development of terrorism 25 as result an emphasis on weak and failed states can lead the united states to give short shrift to more tangible threats and to areas of greater us interest the cato institute study worries that secretary rices focus on promoting responsible sovereignty as an underpinning of transformational diplomacy may provide potential justification for eroding the current international norm of respect for national sovereignty leading the united states into fruitless interventions 26 in addition some analysts are skeptical that the problems of weak and failed states can be most dealt with through military and political interventions aimed at creating viable government institutions the effectiveness of past efforts is subject of debate with differing views on the criteria for and the number of successes draws and failures as is the best means to achieve success 24 for more discussion on issues regarding civpols

success in most instances in the words of one scholar barring exceptional circumstances the war against the taliban after 911 we had best steer clear of missions that deploy forces of whatever kind into countries to remake them anew the success stories germany japan are the exceptions and were possible because of several helpful conditions that will not be replicated elsewhere27 others however point to cases such as mozambique and salvador as examples that state building efforts can promote peace after civil strife

to foster security and stability in troubled situations 42 from the beginning lugerbiden legislation has sought to authorize the establishment of such corps the bush administration 41 hr 1084 s 613 and samdt 5340 contain the following nine functions 1 monitoring in coordination with relevant bureaus within the department of state and the united states agency for international development usaid political and economic instability worldwide to anticipate the need for mobilizing united states and international assistance for the stabilization and reconstruction of country or region that is at risk of in orin transition from conflict or civil strife 2 assessing the various types of stabilization and reconstruction crises that could occur and cataloging and monitoring the nonmilitary resources and capabilities of agenciesthat are available to address such crises 3 planning in conjunction with usaid to address requirements such as demobilization rebuilding of civil society policing human rights monitoring and public information that commonly arise in stabilization and reconstruction crises 4 coordinating with relevant agencies to develop interagency contingency plans to mobilize and deploy civilian personnel to address the various types of such crises 5 entering into appropriate arrangements with agencies to carry out activities under this section and the reconstruction and stabilization civilian management act of 2008 6 identifying personnel in state and local governments and in the private sector who are available to participate in the civilian reserve corpsor to otherwise pa rticipate in or contribute to reconstruction and stabilization activities 7 taking steps to ensure that training of civilian personnel to perform such reconstruction and stabilization activities is adequate and is carried out as appropriate with other agencies involved with stabilization operations 8 taking steps to ensure that plans for united states reconstruction and stabilization operations are coordinated with and complementary to reconstruction and stabilization activities of other governments and international and nongovernmental organizations to improve effectiveness and avoid duplication and 9 maintaining the capacity to field on short notice an evaluation team to undertake onsite needs assessment the list of s 613 contains the same items some with slightly differ ent wording most importantly the lack of reference to usaid as well as one additional item coordinating plans and procedures for joint civilianmilitary operations with respect to stabilization and reconstruction activities 42 at speech given to the international republican institute in 2005 president bush stated that the needs perceived during the startup of us operations in afghanistan an d iraq influenced the creation of scrs many fine civilian workers from almost every department of the government volunteered to serve in iraq noted the president but the process of recruiting and staffing the coalition provisi onal authority was lengthy and difficult remarks by the president at international republican institute di nner office of the white house may 18 2005

be to provide assistance in support of stabilization and reconstruction activities in foreign countries or regions that are at risk of in or are in transition from conflict or civil strife all versions would codify the establishment of civilian reconstruction and stabilization capability by am ending the state department basic authorities act of 1956 all three versions would also codify as

to stabilize and reconstruct country or region that is at risk of in or in transition from conflict or civil strife s 613 also states that section 618 determination would be necessary to deploy members of the standby and reserve components of the corps hr 1084 and samdt 5340 state that such determination would be necessary to deploy the reserve component s 613 the latest version of which is the senate foreign relations committee version reported in 2007 contains specific details regarding the composition of threepart response readiness corps the secretary of state would establish and maintain the all components of the corps in consultation with the usaid administrator and the heads of other appropriate us government departments and agencies the first two components consist of federal employees the active duty federal component would be comprised of up to 250 personnel recruited employed and trained specifically for the job this number is in addition to any other full time personnel of the department of state or usaid authorized to be employed under any other provision of law federal standby component would consist of up to 2000 federal personnel who have volunteered for deployment on sr missions and have the necessary training and skills to perform them these may include employees of the department of state including foreign service nationals of usaid or of any other ex ecutive branch agency as well as of legislative and judicial branch employees the third component civilian reserve of nonus government personnel trained and available as needed would include at least 500 members within year after enactment these could include retired employees of the us government contractor personnel nongovernmental organization personnel state and local government employees and individuals from the private sector 43 in its fy2006 and fy2007 budget requests the bush administrations budget proposed funding for scrs to establish 100person readyresponse cadre of government employees congress has not yet provided funds for establishing such cadre or civilian reserve corps although in 2007 congress approved 50 million in supplemental funds available through

contained in samdt 5340 were proposed after the administrations announcement of the csi their provisions regarding corps personnel are nearly identical like s 613 these measures also provide for threepart corps but in less detail recruitment and training would be carried out by the secretary of state the usaid administrator and the heads of other participating departments and agencies response readiness corps src of federal employees would be composed of active and standby components consisting of us government personnel including employees of the department of state usaid and other agencies who are recruited and trained to provide reconstruction and stabilization assistance when deployed to do so by the secretary of state specific number is provided for members of these components the legislation notes that members of the active component would be specifically employed to serve in the corps note the use of the term response readiness corps applies only to the two federal employee components unlike s 613 which also uses the term to include the civilian reserve corps the secretary of state is authorized to establish and maintain the src in consultation with the administrator of usaid and the heads of other appropriate us government agencies the secretary of state alone is authorized to deploy its members civilian reserve corps crc would cons ist of individuals with the skills necessary for carrying out reconstruction and stabilization activities and who have volunteered for that purpose the secretary is authorized to establish the corps in consultation with the administrator of usaid and is authorized to employ and train its members as well as to deploy them subject to presidential determination under the proposed section 618 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended size was specified for the civilian reserve corp hr 1084 but not samdt 5340 contains provision to authorize to be appropriated to the secretary of state such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2007 through 2010 for the office and to support educate train maintain and deploy response readiness corps and civilian reserve corps proponents of the creation of civilian reserve corps foresee variety of advantages from the creation of such corps dod has promoted th concept on the grounds that it would free military personnel from statebuilding tasks during military operations thus increasing the personnel available for combat and other more strictly military tasks 44 proponents also view such 44 however dod di rective 300005 military support for stability security transition and r econstruction ssr operations issued november 28 2005 states that many stability operations tasks are best performed by indigenous foreign or us civilian professionals but nonetheless us military forces shall be prepared to perform all tasks necessary to establish or maintain order when civilians cannot do so among the tasks listed are the rebuilding of various types of security forces correctional facilities and judi cial systems the revival or building of the private sector and the development of representative governmental institutions points

as the personnel who would be sent to perform such tasks would in general have much higher level of expertise and depth of experience than soldiers and could unlike many military personnel assigned to such tasks perform at peak efficiency from the outset many view this as particularly true at the national level where extensive experience with developing nationallevel structures is desirable over the long run although military civil affairs officers are largely reservists whose civilian jobs are relevant to statebuilding tasks many analysts state that there are too few civil affairs personnel to provide the depth needed to deploy the appropriate person in most circumstances many argue that civilian personnel are also preferable for symbolic reasons as they may signal greater commitment to the construction of democratic state skeptics look at the concept of civilian reserve as untested and potentially not feasible some wonder whether qualified experts will sign up in sufficient quantities to make the corps an effective replacement for military troops in sr operations 45 some question whether the existence of such corps would provide an incentive to interventions of various types that the united states otherwise would not have undertaken or that it might be used for purposes other than postconflict sr operations some proponents have argued that such corps would be useful for preventive deployments some proposals for enhancing us counterinsurgency capabilities have argued for the creation of civilian reserve for such operations this cbo cost estimate is included in hrept 110537 while some may view the potential cost of the civilian corps as high some proponents argue that the costs of deploying civilian personnel would result in net savings to the military it is likely however that any possible savings would depend on the circumstances in which such civilian personnel were deployed and the effect of their deployment on the number of military personnel needed proponents also maintain that even if high the monetary cost to maintain and deploy civilian reservists would still be relatively inexpe nsive when compared to the multiple costs both tangible such as money and lives and intangible such as domestic and international political support and loss of strategic leverage of prolonged or failed military interventions

the model as potentially co stly the congressional budget office estimated that the cost of implementing hr 108446 if employed in manner consistent with the presidents civilian stabilization initiative at 620 million over the 20092013 period of this the cbo estimates that the establishment of 250member response readiness corps would require appropriations of 76 million in 2009 and 67 million in 2010 the cbo also estimates that training and equipping 2000member st andby component would require 39 million in appropriations in 2009 and 31 million in 2010 for the civilian reserve corps the cbo continued it will always be desirable to have trained military civil affairs officers who can deal with civilian leaders and populations involved in statebuilding efforts at the local level as means of demonstrating goodwill toward such populations and enhancing the image of soldiers especially in counterinsurgency operations 45 for information on the experiences of the germany

the state department operational for sr operations is the provision of conflict response fund the provision for flexible replenishable fund was included in early versions of the lugarbiden legislation the current version of s 613 like the version of hr 1084 as introduced contains provisions for 75 million replenishable fund that could be used by the president to respond to crises in countries or regions at risk of in or in transition from conflict or civil strife of that some 25 million could be used for expenses related to the development training and operations of the response readiness corps neither of the two 2008 versions of the reconstruction and stabilization civilian management act ie hr 1084 and samdt 5340 provides for such replenishable account hr 1084 and samdt 5340 would both provide permanent authority codified as section 618 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended for the president to furnish up to 100 million annually to respond to reconstruction and stabilization crisis such assistance would be furnished to assist in reconstructing and stabilizing country or region that is at risk of in or is in transition from conflict or civil strife the president would be required to consult with and provide written policy justification to congresss foreign affairs and appropriations committees before exercising this authority per section 613a3 of the 1961 faa hr 1084 would limit the exercise of that authority to three fiscal years ie fy2008 fy2009 and fy2010 congress has long resisted the provision of blank check pots of money as an abdication of constitutional appropriation and oversight powers and has thus far refused to provide it for sr purposes through the state department or fo reign operations budget on the other hand proponents of replenishable conflict response fund argue that it is needed because many crises that demand us rapid response cannot be foreseen and thus planned for in annual budget submissions such as lebanon in 2006 in addition they argue the existing mechanisms for transferring funds to an emergency situation are too timeconsuming to provide an immediate response proponents have argued for mechanism like the automatically replenishable emergency refugee and migration assistance erma emergency relief account funded through foreign operations appropriations many proponents suggest that erma provides model for conflict response fund several bills were introduced that would among other provisions permanently establish conflict response fund but none passed congress
