governed primarily by the general mining law of 1872 the law grants free access to individuals and corporations to prospect for minerals in public domain lands and allows them upon making discovery to stake or locate claim on that deposit claim gives the holder the right to develop the minerals and may be patented to convey full title to the claimant continuing issue is whether this law should be reformed and if so how to balance mineral development with competing land uses the right to enter the public domain and freely prospect for and develop minerals is the feature of the claimpatent system that draws the most vigorous support from the mining industry critics consider the claimpatent system giveaway of publicly owned resources because of the small amounts paid to maintain claim and to obtain patent congress however has imposed moratorium on mining claim patents through th annual interior spending bill since fy1995 the lack of direct statutory authority for environmental protection under the mining law of 1872 is another major issue that has spurred reform proposals many mining law supporters contend that other current laws provide adequate environmental protection critics however argue that these general environmental requirements are not adequate to assure reclamation of mined areas broadbased legislation to reform the general mining law of 1872 the hardrock

minerals on federal lands is governed primarily by the general mining law of 1872 the original purposes of the mining law were to promote mineral exploration and development on federal lands in the western united states offer an opportunity to obtain clear title to mines already being worked and help settle the west the mining law grants free access to individuals and corporations to prospect for minerals on open public domain lands and allows them upon making discovery to stake or locate claim on the deposit valid claim entitles the holder to develop the minerals the 1872 mining law originally applied to all valuable mineral deposits except coal 17 stat 91 1872 as amended public domain lands are those retained under federal ownership since their original acquisition by treaty cession or purchase as part of the general territory of the united states including lands that passed out of but reverted back to federal ownership acquired landsthose obtained from state or private owner through purchase gift or condemnation for particular federal purposes rather than as general territory of the united statesare subject to leasing only and are not covered by the 1872 law some public lands may be withdrawn or closed to mineral entry the 1872 mining law was one of the primary forces behind the development of mineral resources in the west along with the industries and services that supported mineral production major hardrock minerals developed in the west include copper silver gold lead zinc molybdenum and uranium during the 19 th century major mining districts for silver and gold were developed under the mining law in colorado california idaho and nevada early in the 20th century there were major developments of porphyry copper in arizona large molybdenum and tungsten deposits in colorado were also developed the mining law continues to provide the structure for much of the western mineral velopment on public domain lands western mining although not as extensive as it once was is still major economic activity and high percentage of hardrock mining is on public lands

believed to contain valuable mineral to hold claim on public land claimants must pay an annual maintenance fee of 125 per claim 1 claimants with 10 claims or fewer are exempt from the annual maintenance fee there also is 30 fee for firsttime locators to locate and record claim2 the fees above are to be adjusted every five years based on the consumer price index 30 usc 28 j c the last adjustment was made on september 1 2004 prior to 2004 the fees were 100 and 25 respectively the annual maintenance fee is in addition to the requirement that 100 of annual development work be conducted per claim the maintenance and location fees generated revenue estimated at 475 million in fy2005 and 323 million in fy2006 according to the bureau of land management blm revenues from fees have fluctuated over the years and were 359 million in fy1997 1 30 usc 28f 2 30 usc 28g httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33908g15g146g151g146g151g144 g561g152g151g561 g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g14g138g151

recoverable and at least 500 of development work has been performed the claim holder may file patent application to obtain title to surface and mineral rights beginning january 3 1989 fee of 250 per patent application plus 50 per claim within each application has been required if the patent application is approved the claimant may purchase surface and mineral rights at rate of 250 per acre for placer claims and 5 per acre for lode claims placer deposit is an alluvial deposit of valuable minerals usually in sand or gravel lode or vein deposit is of valuable mineral consisting of quartz or other rock in place with definite boundaries 3 placer claim is usually limited to 20 acres but lode claim may be slightly greater than 20 acres these peracre fees were substantial when the mining law was enactedclaimed land and minerals now far exceed these amounts in value the following provisions currently apply to claims there is limit on the number of claims person can locate there is requirement that mineral production ever commence4 mineral production can take place without patent or royalty payments to the federal government and claims can be held indefinitely with or without mineral production subject to challenge if not developed most of the current mining activity and mineral claims under the mining law are in nevada arizona california montana and wyoming as of the end of fy2005 approximately 35 of mining claims were in nevada alone and anothe r nearly 35 were in the other four states according to the bureau of land management the number of active claims declined from about 12 million claims in fy1989 to 294678 for fy1993 many claims were dropped as result of provisions of law charging 100perclaim annual maintenance fee the number of active claims subsequently rose to 324651 in fy1997 reflecting the relative strength of the gold and copper industries the number of active claims fell to low of 207757 for fy2001 reflecting decline in the gold and copper industries and according to the blm changes in public land policy that significantly lengthened the time necessary to get permission to mine active claims stood at 207241 in fy2005 only small percentage of claims is ever patented totaling about 34 million acres from 1867 through 2006 this represents approximately 15 of all public lands patented most public lands have been patented under homestead entries statehood grants railroad grants and other nonmineral public land laws it is not required to patent claim to mine deposit and great deal of mining activity is currently taking place on unpatented claims however patenting claim gives the holder legal title to both the surface and the minerals and relieves the holder of having to pay the annual fees beginning in fy1995 congress has enacted in the interior appropriations laws series of one year moratoria on the issuance of mineral patents however applications meeting certain requirements that were filed on or before september 30

contractors are authorized to process the mineral examinations on those applications the patent moratorium will not stop the production of valuable mineral resources from the public lands but will prevent the further transfer of owne rship of public lands to the private sector with the exception of the 237 patent applications already in the pipeline5 the annual oneyear moratorium on patenting continues the uncertainty over whether efforts will continue to try to reform the 1872 mining law the mining industry would like to end the uncertainty to facilitate its longterm business planning environmentalists who were hoping for new environmental protection language in major mining law reform bill argue that the patent moratorium does not protect the environment from current mining practices

1920 the mineral leasing act removed oil gas oil shale phosphates sodium and certain other minerals on federal public domain lands fr om the claimpatent system of the 1872 mining law and set up system of leasing in which the federal government retains ownership of the leased lands coal which previously had its own claimpatent law the 1873 coal act was also included in the 1920 leasing act6 after 1955 common variety minerals such as sand stone gravel cinders and pumice were sold under the materials act of 1947 as amended strong push for an allleasing system developed during the 1930s and 1940s but such legislation was enacted as mentioned acquired federal lands were never subject to the general mining law the mineral leasing act for acquired lands of 1947 authorized the leasing of leasable minerals in some acquired federal lands7 the reorganization plan 3 of 1946 and earlier acts authorized the leasing of hardrock minerals on acquired forest lands8 during the 1960s and 1970s the multiple use sustained yield act wilderness act national forest management act national environmental policy act nepa and federal land policy management act flpma addressed environmental protection multiple use and management of federal land generally by imposing new requirements on agency actions and by withdrawing some federal lands from development these acts have affected mineral development under both the leasing system and the mining law claimpate nt system the mining law contains direct environmental controls but mining claims are subject to all general environmental laws as precondition for development the mining industry must comply with applicable requirements of the clean water and clean air acts state reclamation standards where they exist and federal and state statutes relating to the handling and disposal of certain toxic wastes among other laws the evolving leasing system and later withdraw als of lands from hardrock exploration and development diminished the amount of lands under the mining law authority for those hardrock minerals that remain under the mining law however the claimpatent system is essentially the same as it was when the law was enacted 5 pl 103332 6 30 usc 181 etseq 7 30 usc 351359 8 60 stat 1007 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33908g15g146g151g146g151g144 g561g152g151g561 g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g14g138g151

law is obsolete and inconsistent with other federal natural resource policies supporters maintain that the combination of leasing for some resources and claimpatent system for others works well and should be maintained the national mining association nma states that the existing law more than adequately meets the four criteria essential to any mineral tenure law free and open access to explore for minerals on unappropriated public lands exclusive exploration rights the right to develop the valuable minerals discovered and security of tenure when oil shale was transferred from the 1872 claimpatent system to the leasing system in the 1920 mineral leasing act large number of existing unpatented oil shale claims were continued under the terms of the 1872 mining law during the 1980s the department of the interior sought to invalidate these unpatented claims and refused to issue patents to claim owners the claimants challenged the departments actions the us court for the district of colorado held that any oil shale claimant who had made 500 wo rth of assessment work on the land in question had satisfied the requirements for issuance of patent and that the department could not promulgate new policy to the contrary 9 legislation to resolve oil shale issues was enacted as part of the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 this law offers general and limited patents based on the status of the application at the time of enactment limited patent holders receive title to the oil shale only and are required to post reclamation bond or financial guarantee patent fees remain 250 per acre g3g151g138g149g162g156g146g156g561 g5g149g138g146g150g556g18g138g157g142g151g157g561g21g162g156g157g142g150g497g561g18g155g152g156g561g138g151g141g561g5g152g151g156g561 the right to enter the public domain lands and prospect for and develop minerals is the feature of the claimpatent system that draws the most vigorous support from the mining industry modern hardrock mineral exploration requires continuous effort using vast tracts of land and sophisticated and expensive technology industry officials argue that being able to obtain full and clear title to the land enhances companys ability to bring an economic deposit into production financing the project for example may be more feasible they contend that restrictions on free access and security of tenure would curtail exploration efforts among large and small mining firms in their view the incentive to develop w ould be lost longrun costs would increase and the industry and the country would suffer mining law critics consider the claimpatent system giveaway of publicly owned resources because of the absence of royalties and the small charges associated with keeping claim active and obtaining patent they maintain that although such generous terms may have been effective ways to help settle the west and develop minerals there is solid evidence that under different system minerals would not be developed today they also believe the current system by conveying title and allowing other uses of patented lands creates difficult land management problems through the creation of private inholdings on public land and that current law does not provide for adequate protection of the environment 9 tosco corp v hodel 611 f supp 1130 colo 1985 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33908g15g146g151g146g151g144

without any mineral production once lands are patented to convey full title to the claimant the owner can use the lands for variety of purposes including nonmineral ones however using land under an unpatented mining claim for anything but mineral and associated purposes violates the mining law critics believe that many claims are held for speculative purposes however industry officials argue that claim may lie idle until market conditions make it profitable to develop the mineral deposit another issue surrounds discovery and prediscovery protection the law requires that location of mining claim shall be made until the discovery of the mineral within the limits of the claim if discovery is made and valid location established the claimant has valid possessory right against all other parties one purpose of the discovery requirement was to help reduce speculation however demonstrating discovery of valuable mineral deposit often requires considerable time effort and expense on the part of prospector the prospector may find indications of deposit but demonstrating its value may involve exploration over large area and drilling and analyses of core samples to define the quality and extent of the mineral typically in practice the federal government has allowed claims based on general indications that mineral deposit exists and required proof of discovery only upon application for patent unless circumstances warrant full proof sooner for example mineral claims in sensitive areas the industry has indicated it wishes to avoid major challenges to the principle of free access and the right to obtain patent the industry generally opposes placing hardrock minerals under leasing system because this would give the federal government discretionary control over development impose royalty payments and retain government ownership of surface andor mineral rights g18g138g156g157g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g156g561 proposals to amend the 1872 mining law have fallen under the following broad categories modify the claimpatent system to retain the patent feature but require payment of fair market value for all or part of the value of the land the government also would collect some percent of the value of mineral production as royalties convert the claimpatent system to permitting system and prohibit further patenting advocates of this proposal argue that permitting system would be effective in achieving fair market value return to the federal treasury for public lands this system would collect royalties and add new environmental standards to mining operations mineral industry supporters on the other hand contend that the department of the interior is already overburdened with the current leasing system and that comprehensive hardrock mining reform would only add to its inefficiency and ultimately increase costs through royalty and rents continue the current claimpatent system but with some amendments proposed changes have included eliminating the distinction between lode and placer claims imposing time limit within which claims must be developed expanding the size of claim providing better

without patent and without paying royalties or rents to the federal treasury this is considered subsidy or giveaway by many because the miner does not pay for factor of production ie land and mineral resources by contrast royalties are paid to the federal government for oil gas coal and other leasable minerals on federal lands and nonfederal land owners eg private and state owners typically receive royalty from those who produce minerals on their lands also if the claimant patents the surface and mineral estate for the 250 or 500 per acre this too can be considered subsidy because the claimant is paying less than fair market value for the surface and mineral estates various tax incentives such as the percentage depletion allowance tax deduction for the depletion of mineral resource and expensing writing off in the year of expenditure the costs of exploration and development have been characterized as subsidies to the industry as well eliminating some of the natural resource subsid ies in the clinton administrations view would have been one way to increase revenues to the treasury and help ensure fair return to the taxpayer for the development of public lands in its fy2001 budget request the clinton administration proposed charging mining companies 5 fee on net smelter production from hardrock mining on federal lands the bush administration has not made similar proposal in any of its budget requests as has been previously noted the original intention of the mining law was to develop the nations minerals and to develop the west proponents of retaining the current system contend that an incentive still is necessary for those who take substantial financial risk to develop mineral deposit mining is capitalintensive process that often takes years of development before minerals are produced imposing royalties increasing holding fees and repealing the percentage depletion allowance would have some impact on domestic hardrock mineral production but the level of any production decline attributable solely to new fees is difficult to estimate the mining industry generally has opposed legislation to repeal the percentage depletion allowance the elimination of some incentives to the industry would come at time when the west is already developed and mineralmetal demand is relatively good however hardrock mineral prices fluctuate and often are cyclical also several mineralproducing nations are reportedly rewriting their mining laws to attract more us and western investment mineral investment in developing countries however face political risk the industry argues that new cost increases in one area without cost reductions in others may make us mineral deposits less competitive or uneconomic

law it receives royalties or rents from mining activities conducted under the law in addition the 250 and 500 peracre price for clear title to the surface and mineral rights has not changed since the law was enacted the peracre price appears to be based on the value of western farmland and grazing land before the enactment of the law in 1872 determination of fair market value of mineralbearing lands is complex because many geologic engineering and economic factors must be considered and fair market value determinations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33908g15g146g151g146g151g144 g561g152g151g561

accounting office gao the fair market value of mineralbearing lands is substantially more than the 250 and 500 per acre that claimant pays for patenting claim gao estimated that for 20 patents it reviewed the federal government had received less than 4500 since 1970 for lands valued between 138 million and 479 million10 the gao appraisal method however was criticized by the bureau of land management blm in may 1989 report to the secretary of the interior the gao report obtained information on land values from blm forest service officials and local real estate brokers gaos estimates were based on recent sales of comparable land not the value of the land at the time claims were patented much of the land may have had very little value at the time it was claimed or patented blm argues that sales of adjacent tracts that either have mineral development potential or are sold for mineral rights alone cannot be used to establish fair market value of the surface of patented mining claims and that data on comparable sales are rare the congressional budget office estimates the value of hardrock mineral production on federal land at 600 million for fy2005 decrease from an interior department estimate of 18 billion in fy1993 the decline can be attributed in part to acreage conveyed out of federal ownership through patenting according to the blm

another major issue that has spurred reform proposals many mining law supporters contend that other current laws as noted above provide adequate environmental protection critics however argue that these general environmental requirements are not adequate to assure reclamation of mined areas and that the only effective approach to protecting lands from the adverse impacts of mining under the current system is to withdraw them from development under the mining law further critics charge that federal land managers lack regulatory authority over patented mining claims and that clear legal authority to assure adequate reclamation of mining sites is needed in addition cleaning up the reportedly over 500000 abandoned hardrock mine sites in the united states 11 is an ongoing and major concern for many in congress the blms abandoned mine lands program has inventoried 11000 of the estimated 70000 abandoned mine sites on public lands and has initiated cleanup efforts in western states in cooperation with state and local governments mining companies and public interest groups12 in addition the us environmental protection agency lists over 40 abandoned hardrock mine or processing

supervises the mineral operations on about 56 million acres of indian trust lands some of these lands are withdrawn from mineral development withdrawal is an action that restricts the use or disposition of public land in some cases land is reserved for specific use that may preclude locating mining claims and granting leases blm study determined that of the approximately 700 million acres of federal subsurface minerals under the agencys jurisdiction approximately 165 million acres have been withdrawn from mineral entry leasing and sale subject to valid existing rights lands in the national park system except national recreation areas the wilderness preservation system and the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr are among thos that are statutorily withdrawn also of the 700 million acres mineral development on another 182 million acres is subject to the approval of the surface management agency and must not be in conflict with land designations and plans according to the blm wildlife refuges except anwr wilderness study areas and roadless areas among others are in this category14 the federal land policy management act flpma mandated review of public land withdrawals in 11 western states to determine whether and for how long existing withdrawals should be continued according to the blm the retention of withdrawal requires compelling show of need and an agency manager must convince the blm director secretary and the public that certain lands should not be opened to multiple use including mining and mineral leasing and that there is reasonable alternative to continued withdrawal 15 mineral industry representatives maintain that fe deral withdrawals inhibit mineral exploration and limit the reserve base even when conditions are favorable for production mineral reserves are not renewable thus they argue that whether minerals are in the public or private sector without new reserves or technological advancements mineral production costs may rise they further contend that higher domestic costs may lead to greater exploration on foreign soil boosting import dependence mining industry supporters also assert that too much land has been unnecessarily withdrawn from mining through administrativ actions to pursue preservation goals critics of the mining law argue that mining often is an exclusive use of land in as much as it can preclude other uses and that in many cases there is way to protect other land values and uses short of withdrawal of lands from development under the law they point to unreclaimed areas that have been mined for hardrock minerals in the past superfund sites related to past mining and smelting and instances where development of resources could adversely affect or destroy scenic historic cultural and other resources on

hearings were held on hr 2262 by the house committee on natural resources subcommittee on energy and minerals on july 26 august 21field hearings and october 2 2007 industry groups testified in opposition to much of the bill particularly opposed to the 8 net smelter royalty as defined in section 613 c1 of the internal revenue code of 1986 and the more stringent environmental standards some testified that if the government were to impose royalty that it be based on net profit or the ability to pay which would then not distort production decisions others however countered that an advalorem royaltybased on value that is contained in the billmight be more appropriate way to collect revenues claiming that net profit royalty is fraught with complexities and high administrative cost thus minimizing the government take those in favor of the bill pointed out the high number of uranium claims staked on public land near sensitive sites and the need to create dedicated revenue
