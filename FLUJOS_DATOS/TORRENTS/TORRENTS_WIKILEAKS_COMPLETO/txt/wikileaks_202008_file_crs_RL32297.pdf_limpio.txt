corporate income taxes description and analysis summary state corporate income taxes have become subject of interest to both state and federal policymakers the cause of this elevated interest may be the expansion of electronic commerce and federal tax policy that affects state corporate income taxes congress has had role in state corporate income taxes for at least two reasons 1 interstate commerce regulatory oversight and 2 federal and state corporate income tax interaction congress may become more involved in state corporate tax issues because of recent changes in interstate commerce and how states administer corporate taxes the state corporate income tax is not major source of revenue for states but is still contributor to state finances ov er the last decade state corporate income taxes generated approximately 5 of stat tax revenue the revenue generated by the tax measured as percentage of gross domestic product gradually declined to its lowest point in fy2002 ce then revenue s rebounded several explanations have been offered for thes fluctuations including 1 state policy decisions to lower the tax burden on corpor ations 2 aggressi ve tax planning by corporations 3 broad economic cycles altering the base and 4 federal corporate income tax policy many corporations operate in multiple tax jurisdictions which makes the state corporate income tax relatively complex tax to administer the base of the corporate income tax net income or profits must be fairly appor tioned to all of the states where the firm has established presence or nexus mosaic of nexus standards has been created through multistate tax compacts state and federal legal decisions and congressional actions at present states do not use uniform definition of taxable profits or use uniform method of apportioning income in the 110th congress s 1726 and its twin hr 5267 would establish more uniform standards generally higher sta ndards for the level of business activity that would trigger nexus or presence and thus state corporate income taxability the legislation is often identified as brightline legislation in the 109th congress the house judiciary committee approved similar legislation hr 1956 the congressional budget office estimated that hr 1956 would have cost the states 31 billion over the 2007 to 2016 budget window nexus issues are also addressed in what has been identified as streamlining legislation generally the st reamlining legislation would llow states to require out ofstate vendors to collect sales taxes even if the out ofstate vendor does not have nexus in the taxing state participating states would have to simplify sales and use taxes before congress would confer collection enforcement authority interstate commerce has complicated the nexus issue for sales and use tax administration and how this issue is resolved may have broader implications for state corporate income taxes this report w ill be updated as legisl ative events

estimate that businesses could have paid as much as 44 of total state and local taxes an estimated 577 billion3 even though state corporate income taxes represent relatively small portion of total state tax revenue in most states the state corporate income tax still generated 534 billion in 2007 and in some states the corporate income tax contributes much larger share of total tax revenue for

clearing hous cch publication st ate corporate income tax guide six states have enacted uditpa as written and 13 more states have generally adopted uditpa with some modificationsthe mechanics of the stat corporate income tax generally the state corporate income tax is levied on the accounting profits of corporation5 the portion of profit that can be attributed to state serves as the base for that states corporate income tax profits are allocated to state based on the amount of economic activity that occurs in th at state following is more detailed description of the state corporate income tax structure federal starting point when calculating state tax liability most states and the district of columbia incorporate the federal income tax code as currently amended or as of specific date the remaining states typically use measure of income that closely follows the federal definition of taxable income using the federal starting point likely eases the compliance burden for corporations particularly those that have nexus in several states nevertheless many states still require corporations to addback to income exclusions that are allowed under federal corporate income tax rules6 the uniform division of income for tax purposes act uditpa the uniform division of income for tax purposes act uditpa is model act drafted and adopted by the commissioners on uniform state laws and the american bar association the act sets standards fo r separating income in to business income which is apportioned to stat and nonbusiness income wh ich is allocated entirely to the entitys home state7 generally nonbusiness inco is defined as passive income on corporate owned ssets income from these assets could include dividends rents and royalties cor porations could avoid paying taxes on nonbusiness income by locating in states without corporate income tax8 some states through the multistate tax compact mtc have voluntarily adopted uniform rules and procedures for the allocation and appor tionment of income as defined under uditpa to ease the compliance burden on multistate businesses9 many of the states that have not formally adopted udi tpa standards still closely adhere to the uditpa standards the profit apportionment formula typically three factors of economic activity are used in the apportionment fo rmula to measure th economic presence of firm in state the percentage of property the percentage of sales and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32297crs4 10 james francis and brian h mcgavin m arket versus production states an economic analysis of apportionment principles in state taxation of busi ness issues and policy options thomas pogue ed new york praeger publishers 1992 p 61ππiti tsi tpi tls swp pwl lw percentage of payroll not all states weigh factors equally some overweight sales or use only sales to allocate income often called singlefactor sales apportionment in theory the weighting should accurately portray the economic presence of the firm there is consensus on the definition of economic presence and hence there is variation among state apportionment formulas some analysts have suggested that formula that doubleweights sales is the ideal formula because it gives equal weight to input factors property and payroll and an output factor sales10 others have argued that the business tax should be levied based on the businesss use of gove rnment services provided by the firms resident state for example corporate income tax that is levied according to the value of one input only such as property could be justified because the value of property is closely related to the level of government services provided to the business by the home state however corpor ations also receive benefits from an out ofstate customers well functioning legal system and public infrastructure an apportionment formula that includes just the property factor would not compensate the outofstate customers government for the benefit to the corporation of those public services the general form of the apportionment formula is reproduced below the superscript i represents the profits b sales s property p and labor l state attributes to the ith firm the superscript t represents the total value of each factor and profits for the firm in given tax year the subscript w represents the weight of each respective factor as defined by state law the weights sum to one for example states that use an evenweight formula would use 033 for each w meaning each factor contributes equally to the determination of profits attributable to state if the state were to doubleweight sales that means that the ws is twice the amount of each of the other two weig hts in the case of doubleweight sales ws050 wp025 and wl025 nexus the apportionment formula does not imply that business that sells goods and services into state owes taxes to that state stat can levy corporate income tax on business only if the business maintains substantial nexus in the state the nexus rules governing the corporate income tax were partially circumscribed by congress through pl 86 272 the act the act established that the mere solicitation of the sale of tangible goods by firm in state was not substantial nexus for corporate income tax purposes for intangible goods and services however there is significant variation from state to state in how substantial nexus is defined httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32297crs5 11 bureau of national affairs 2008 survey of state tax departments vol 15 4 apr 25 2008 12 several states indicated that server did not create nexus only if an unrelated third party owned the server several states did not re spond or do not have corporate income tax 13 the converse is also true income could also be overtaxed because of the variety of apportionment formulas employed by states 14 see bna apr 25 2008 delaware and pennsyl vania did not respond to this question and the question is not applicable to texasthe bureau of national affairs periodica lly surveys state revenue departments about activities that could create nexus11 the responses highlight the differential treatment from state to state of business activities deemed to create nexus for example according to the report 15 states and the district of columbia reported that an outofstate corporation that maintained website on server in the state had established nexus whereas 24 states reported that the activity would not12 throwback rule because of the statebystate variation in nexus rules the first step for corporations be fore apportioning income is to determine the states where the firm has established nexus the firm then allocates profits to these states based on each respective states apportionment formul and nexus rules the different state apportionment formulas and nexus rules however often lead to what is termed nowhere income13 nowhere income arises because not all states have the same apportionment formula or nexus rules nd some states do not levy corporate income tax at all however if the destination state imposes franchise tax or business license tax that is based on some measure of business activity then this does not apply thus some states impose corporate income tax rules that stipulate that all sales to customers in states in which the firm does not have nexus and are not obligated pay any tax based on economic activity are thrown back to the home state for example california firm that sells goods to customers in nevada which does not have corporate income tax nor any other tax based on business activity would include nevada sale s in the numerator of the sa factor component of the california apportionment formula if nevada had corporat income tax with sales factor in the apportionment formula and th firm had establishe d nexus california would not require the firm to include the nevada sales in the california corporate income tax apportionment formula the thro wback rule is applied in 24 states new york city and the district of columbia 19 states do not impose throwback rule and four states do not impose corporate income tax see table 2 14 combined reporting combined reporting of income from all subsidiaries is an accounting rule states use to minimize corporate income tax avoidance arising from income shifting or strategic transfer pricing generally there are two degrees of combined

explanation was that cyclical economic changes led to the decline in state corporate tax revenues note that cyclical economic effects are unrelated to the behavior of policymakers or corporations the effect of economic cycles on revenue was difficult to identify because the legislated changes and the corporate behavior described above likely exacerbated or attenuated the cyclical ec onomic changes recent research into the causes of state budg et deficits suggested that the current cumulative state defic it is largely structural22 the implication of this finding was that policy structural

following section analyzes these two aspects of state corporate income taxation that are most directly affected by congressional action interstate commerce regulation and oversight the interstate commerce regulation and tax interaction issues have attracted interest for three principal reasons 1 the complex internet sales tax debate 2 the recent federal business tax cuts and 3 state fiscal issues the link between the internet sales tax debate and state corporate income taxes is complicated and centers on the prohibition on states reaching bey ond their borders to compel outofstate vendors to collect sales and use taxes25 as general rule state can require vendor to collect sales and use taxes only if the vendor has substa ntial nexus in the state26 typically the substantial nexus stan dard is satisfied if the vendor has physical presence in the state27 thus remote internet transactions where the vendor has physical presence in the customers home state do not have the sales and use tax added to the price of the good by th vendor these types of transactions have grown considerably over the st several years and have c ontributed to the erosion of the sales and use tax ba of most states28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32297crs12 28 continued commerce alone will result in states losing between 215 billion and 337 billion in 2008 there is considerable debate however

sufficient nexus for corporate income taxes for firms selling tangible goods pl 86272 was passed shortly afte r the supreme court issued ruling that seemed to offer an ambiguous definition of sufficient nexus the supreme court language that generated this concern s cited in the senate report on s 2524 the senate version of what became pl 86272 is reproduced below we conclude that the net income from th interstate operations of foreign corporation may be subjected to st ate taxation provided the levy is not discriminatory and is properly apportioned to local activities within the

provided the following as reasoning behind the enacted legislation pl 86272 that clarified the definition persons engaged in interstate commerce are in doubt as to the amount of local activities within state that will be regard ed as forming sufficient nexus that is connection with the state to support the imposition of tax on net income from interstate operations and properly apportioned to the state32 the legislation passed by congress clarified nexus by identifying those activities which would not establish nexus generally solic iting sales of tangible goods in state for shipment by

what constitutes nexus for corporate income tax clarified nexus standards however do not seem destined to fundament ally alter the administration of state corporate income taxes as noted above current laws would already shield outof state vendors from corporate income tax lia bility if the business were only soliciting the sale of tangible goods into the state as for intangibles goods and services policymakers would likely insert language to ensure that corporation would not establish nexus by virtue of collecting sales and use taxes33 tax interaction the jobs and growth tax relief r econciliation act of 2003 jgtrra pl 10827 included severa l provisions that reduce the federal tax burden on business investment34 the federal tax changes also affected state taxes because of the interaction between federal taxes and stat taxes on corporations generally states use the federal tax code as the base fo r the state income tax see the background section titled federal starting point35 thus when the federal definition of the tax base changes so does the state definition of income jgtrra included two temporary provisions designed to accelerate the depreciation of capital assets purchased by businesses the first is temporary increase in the amount of capital expenditure that small business can deduct in the year of purchase36 the larger deduction reduces th base of the federal corporate income tax and thus the state corporate income tax base for those states that link directly to the federal tax code the chan ge in federal law w ould have generated significant

outcome of the two countervailing forces is uncertain and relies on debata ble assumptions about the response of businesses to investment incentives deliver ed through the federal tax code the jgtrra

income tax law changes on the states changes in corporate income tax rates would have minimal impact on the states unlike changes in the tax base federal tax rate chan ge would not directly affect state corporate income taxes legislative activity as noted earlier two related issues have received legislative attention in the 110th congress one is socalled streamlined sales and use tax legislation and the other is identified as business activity ta x bat nexus legislation s 34 and hr 3396 were intended to addr ess the streamline issue39 the focus here will be on s 1726 and its twin hr 5267 this legislation would establish moreuniform standards generally higher standards for the level of business activity that would tri gger nexus or presence and thus state corporate income taxability the legislation is often identified as brightline or bat legislation hr 5267 and s 1726 under current law sales of tangible personal property into state are not sufficient to trigger tax liability hr 5267 and s 1726 would expand the protection beyond sales of tangible personal property to include transactions furnishing or gather ing of information and services40 this expansion would

one such critique see tomalis matt some fatal flaws of s 1726 hr 5267 and all bat nexus bills state tax notes mar 3 2008 pp 691704of services while in the state for six or fewer days would create nexus41 in addition the legislation is somewhat unclear on what activities would be classified as furnishing of information to customer s and gathering of information in addition to the expansion of protected interactions this legislation would also define physical presence as the standard for collecting business activity taxes42 under this proposal physical presence woul d be established nd business activity tax allowable if the individual or business is physically within the state for at least 15 days not including trips to buy goods or services for the business or gathering and furnishing information the individual or business uses the services of another individual or business for more than 15 days nd the hired individual or business does not do business for any other entity or the individual or business leases or owns tangible personal property or real property in the state for more than 15 days provision in the legislation would define physical presence to exclude individuals whose activities are limited or transient business activity43 thus activities need only be one or the other to avoid establishing nexus and thus taxation this feature may prove confounding to stat tax administrators as clear definition of limited is not provide d and transient is also somewhat ambiguous analysis the bat legislation in the 110th congress hr 5267 and s 1726 is intended to further modify the state taxation of businesses engaged in interstate commerce the legislation would impos new regulations on how states impose taxes on multistate businesses through 1 imposing uniformity on the time component of nexus determination 2 expanding the definition of goods and services subject to the nexus rules and 3 creating safe harbor for activities that are limited or transient the legislation would not directly address the complexity of the state corporate income tax structure in particul ar the various apportionment formulas and allocation rules described earlier many economists and other researchers who analyze state corporate income taxes agree that the critical issue with the current state corporate income tax structure is the variability in the allocation and pportionment of corporate income from state to state44 the current mosaic of state corporate income tax rules creates economic inefficiencies for the following reasons 1 relatively high compliance costs 2 increased opportunities for tax planning by businesses and 3 potential gaps andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32297crs16 45 for more see rosen arthur r and jeffrey s reed setting the

underlying inefficienci because the threshold for business the 15day rule and the safe harbor for limited or transient activity would increase opportunities for tax planning and thus tax avoidance and possibly evasion in addition expanding the types of activities that are cove red by pl 86272 would also expand the opportunities for tax planning supporters of the legislati on counter that the legislation simply codifies the existing nexus rules as applied by most states and updates pl 86272 to reflect changes in the economy and marketplace in addition the supporters of hr 5267 and s 1726 suggest that the bat legisl ation would eliminate the double taxation of businesses th double taxati on they claim arises from the various state apportionment and throwback rules45
