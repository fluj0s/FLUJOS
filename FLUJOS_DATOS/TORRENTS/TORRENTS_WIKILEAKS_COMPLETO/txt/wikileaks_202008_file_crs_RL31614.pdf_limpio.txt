characteristics of agricultural workers in the united states 19962001 summary an issue before congress is whether to change immigration policy to increase the number of legal foreign agricultural workers in the united states in 2001 approximately 34 million persons were employed in the agriculture industry in the united states or about 24 of the total u s labor force most persons in the agricultural labor force are nativeborn wh ile most foreignborn persons in the agricultural labor force are mexicanborn from 1996 to 2001 the total us labor force increased by an estimated 79 million persons or 59 during the same period the agricultural labor force declined by an estimated 340000 persons from 28 to 24 of the total labor force in 2001 the number of mexicanborn persons in the agricultural labor force was approximately the same as in 1996 530000 and 533000 respectively nevertheless from 2000 to 2001 the numbe r of mexicanborn persons in the agricultural labor force fell from an estimated 611000 to 533000 compared to the overall labor force men make up greater share of the agricultural labor force and an even great er share of the mexicanborn agricultural labor force the mexicanborn agricultural labor force is significantly younger than the nativeborn agricultural labor force from 1996 to 2001 unemployment was gr eater among mexicanborn persons in the agricultural labor force than am ong nativeborn persons from 2000 to 2001 while the national unemployment rate increased from 41 to 49 the unemployment rate among mexicanborn agricultural workers increased from 107 to 145 and from 40 to 48 among nativeborn agricultural workers in 2001 fulltime wage and salary agri cultural workers had median weekly earnings of 365 compared to 597 for all fu lltime wage and salary workers the median weekly earnings of nativeborn agri cultural workers 400 were greater than the median weekly earnings of mexicanborn workers 300 an analysis of changes in employment and median weekly earnings of fulltime wage and salary workers suggests that from 1996 to 2000 ie before the decline in employment from 2000 to 2001 the relativ supply of and demand for labor in farmworker and technical ccupations were essentially unchanged in managerial and farming occupations the analysis ggests that both the supply of and demand for labor increased compared to workers in all industries agricultural workers are more likely to be selfemployed nativeborn workers are more likely than mexicanborn workers to be selfemployed b less likely to ve finished high school or graduated from college c more likely to be employ ed in production service and operator occupations d less likely to work yearr ound more likely to have annual money income below the official pove rty

the labor ma rket effects of temporary alien farm worker programs by linda levine p 16labor market characteristics of agricultural workers in the united states 19962001 introduction an issue before congress is whether to change immigration policy to increase the number of legal foreign agricultural workers in the united states some proposals would increase the number of gal immigrants by allowing number of undocumented immigrants to become legal permanent residents while other proposals would increase the number of legal non immigrants by creating new guestworker program or by making change s in the existing temporary guestworker h2a program for agricultural workers1 the purpose of this report is to provide information to policymakers considering new smaller or larger agricultural guestworker program2 the report examines selected labor market social and demographic characteristics of the agricultural labor force in the united states for each year from 1996 through 2001 the analysis examines differences among nativeborn foreignborn and mexicanborn workers the characteristics examined include ag education earnings occupation union membership weeks worked per year poverty status and health insurance coverage the report analyzes data on wage and salary workers in both the agriculture industry and for all industr ies combined the data are from the monthly current population survey cps which is the main source of labor force information for the united states detailed desc ription of the data and thods used in the report is provided in appendix in this report nativeborn persons are defined as individua ls who were born in the united states puerto rico or other us territory or who were born in foreign country to at least one parent who was u s citizen all othe r persons are defined as foreignborn foreignborn persons include both naturalized citizens and noncitizens the cps does not ask noncitizens if they are legal or undocumented immigrants or whether they are nonimmig rants who are in the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31614crs2 3 according to the results of the us depart ment of labors national agriculture workers survey naws for fy1998 52 of us farm workers were undocumented workers the survey defines farm workers as crop workers who are engaged mainly in growing and harvesting farm crops harvest workers are fined to include workers employed in tasks such as field packing sorting and grading us department of labor findings from the national agricultural workers survey naws 19971998 p 2 22 30 4 for an analysis of the labor market for hired farmworkers ie farmworkers employed by growers or by farm labor contractors that uses data from the naws and other sources see crs report rl30395 farm labor shortages and immigration policy by linda levine p 715 hereafter cited as crs report rl30395 farm labor shortages and immigration policy 5 h2a visas are one of several temporary visas granted under the immigration and continuedtemporarily eg on busin ess or as students3 therefore in this report the definition of foreignborn persons includes legally admitted immigrants refugees and temporary residents as well as undocumented immigrants in this report agricultural workers are persons working in the agriculture industry the agriculture industry include s crop eg fruits vegetables and tobacco and livestock eg cattle poultry and hogs production as well as landscaping veterinary and other agricultural services the agriculture industry includes the same range of occupations found in the economy at large thus an analysis of the labor market characteristics of workers in the agriculture industry includes persons employed as managers sales workers mech anics machine operators security guards laborers and other occupati ons data source other than the cps may include narrower range of occupations for exam ple the national agriculture workers survey naws is survey of crop workers see footnote 34 data from the cps allow comparisons among groups within the agriculture industry as well as comparisons between agricu lture and other industries because the focus of this report is on the us labor market it does not examine other social political or demographic issues related to guestworker programs nor does the report examine the bene fits and costs of guestwor ker programs to the us government or to state and local governme nts finally the analysis examines data covering 6year period study coveri ng longer or different time period may yield different results proposed policy changes proposals to change us agricultural worker immigration policy focus on two broad issues whether to provide some kind of amnesty ie legalization for undocumented workers in the agriculture industry who are already in the united states and b whether to create new temporary guestworker program to increase the availability of legal agricultural work ers in addition many policymakers favor changes in the existing temporary agricultural worker program which is known as the h2a program and is the only program for legal temporary foreign agricultural workers in the united states5 proposals to change us immigration policy includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31614crs3 5 continued nationality act ina the h2a program allows employers to hire foreign agricultural workers to perform temporary work provided there are us workers available an h2a visa may be issued for period of up to year extensions may be granted for up to total of 3 consecutive years limits are imposed on the number of h2a visas granted

from different perspectives changes in us policy with respect to agricultura l guestworkers would likely involve changes in the us ie aggregate labor market and in local or regional labor markets for different occupations this report analyz selected labor market social and demographic characteristics of the agricultural labor force in the united states labor markets can be examined in terms of how changes affect the allocation of labor ie economic efficiency and the distribution of earnings ie equity this section describes the basic framework for labor market analysis used in this report according to standard economic analysis competitive markets result in the most efficient allocation of resour ces ie labor capital and na tural resources in turn economic theory holds that an efficient allocation of resources provides the greatest output and consumer satisfaction from given quantity of resources most modern economists believe that compared to ot her economic systems market economy provides greater incentives to work save invest and innovate the expected result is higher standard of living at th same time many econo mists acknowledge that some markets may not fit the model of perfect competition if markets are not competitive economic analysis indicates that government action may improve economic efficiency in addition mark et economy may result in distribution of income that is socially unacceptable governments may also adopt policies that reduce earnings or income inequalityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31614crs6 15 the following are the characteristics of competitive labor market 1 there are many employers and many workers each employer is small relative to the size of the market 2 employers and workers are free to enter or l eave labor market and can move freely from one market to another 3 employers do not organize to lower wages and workers do not organize to raise wages governments do not intervene in labor markets to regulate wages 4 employers and workers have equal access to accurate labor market information 5 employers do not prefer one worker over another equally qualified worker ie equally qualified workers are perfect substitutes workers do not prefer one employer over another employer who pays the same wage for the same kind of work 6 employers seek to maximize profits while workers seek to maximize satisfaction reynolds

of the public sector 3rd ed new york ww norton co 2000 p 76 85efficient labor markets in general competitive labor markets are thought to provide the most efficient allocation of labor ie workers and hours worked15 in practice many labor markets do not fit the model of perfect competition16 for example some employers or workers may be able to influence wages some employers may not have sufficient information or equal access to the kind of information needed to make informed decisions about hiring workers on th other hand when l ooking for work job seekers may not have access to the same information available to employers job growth may not be sufficient to empl oy all persons who want to work when labor markets depart from the model of perfect competition government intervention may improve economic efficiency17 but government intervention may not be necessary or desirable in some cases departures from perfect competition may be selfcorrecting in addition government policies aimed at improving efficiency may fail to achieve their objectives or policies that improve efficiency at one point in time may have little or effect at another point in time changes in us immigration policy might harm the overall allocation of labor if the changes add to total unemployment eg if immigrants leave full or parttime jobs in their home countries and move to the united states where they are unemployed changes in immigration policy might also harm efficiency if ease of entry into the united states is not matc hed by similar ease of exit and perhaps reentry on the other hand economic theo ry holds that labor mobility can improve the allocation of labor if unemployed worker s in another country move to the united states where they are able to find work or if workers move from less productive jobs in their home countries to more pr oductive jobs in the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31614crs7 18 reynolds et labor economics and labor relations p 2425 19 an increase in the relative supply of skilled workers everything else remaining the same would reduce the wages of skilled workers relative to the wages of unskilled workers conversely an increase in the relative supply of unskilled workers again everything else remaining the same would reduce the wages of unskilled workers relative to the wages of skilled workersthe distribution of earnings efficient labor markets or improvements in economic efficiency may improve the allocation of labor but the improvements may result in socially unacceptable distribution of earnings in competitive labor markets if the supply of unskilled labor increases relative to demand the result will generally be more unequal distribution of earnings on the ot her hand if the demand for unskilled labor increases relative to supply the result will generally be more equal distribution of earnings18 because wages tend to rise as labor productivity i the quantity of output per hour increases the distribution of earnings may change if the growth in labor productivity is greater in some occ upations than in others finally the distribution of earnings may change becau of institutional or policy changes including changes in the minimum wage or the degree of unionization immigration to the united states can affect the distribution of earnings in both the united states and in immigrants home c ountries if skilled workers move to the united states the distribution of earnings in their native countries may become more unequal while the distribution of earning s in the united states may become more equal conversely if unskilled workers m ove to the united states the distribution of earnings in the workers native count ries may become more equal while the distribution of earnings in the unite d states may become more unequal19 governments can reduce earnings inequality directly through progressive taxation income transfers and subsidiz ed consumption eg for health care or housing or indirectly by improving th distribution of earningsproducing human capital eg education and training im provements in the distribution of earnings may involve tradeoffs with an efficient allo cation of labor eg if taxes or transfer payments affect decisions to wo rk or the number of hours worked immigration and competitive labor markets in general individuals may wish to m ove from one country to another if the expected gain from temporary or perman ent immigration exceeds the cost of moving all else being equal the expected gain from immigration will generally be greater the larger the differences in earnings between two countries the expected gain will likely be greater for younger persons who have more working years to earn higher incomes in general the expected cost of moving should be lower the shorter the distance between labor markets the expected cost of m oving should also be less for younger persons who may have fewer fa mily and other ties to their existing communities in addition workers may have greater access to information about differences in wages the shorter the distance between labor markets similarlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31614crs8 20 filer randall k daniel s mermesh and albert

95408 immigration the effects on nativeborn workers by linda levine p 515 herea fter cited as crs report 95408 immigration the effect s on nativeborn workers employers may have greater information bout the supply of labor in nearby labor markets20 government policies can aff ect the allocation of labor between countries eg by improving the accuracy and availability of labor market information or by removing barriers or disincentives to employment but in world economy improving opportunities for employment or easing restrictions on the movement of labor across borders is generally the pr erogative of governments in individual countries since improvements in economic efficiency may have socially undesirable effects on the earnings of workers in par ticular occupations so policymakers may favor policies that limit the overall level of immigration or that limit immigration to workers with specific skills21 findings the remainder of this report examines selected characteristics of the agricultural labor force in the united states first the report provides an overview of recent trends in the size and composition of the agricultural workforce second the report examines selected demographic and social characteristics of the agricultural labor force including age gender and education next the report examines selected employment characteristics of agricultural workers including unemployment self employment median earnings occupati on and union membership finally the report examines additional indicators of economic wellbeing including health insurance coverage and poverty status for each characteristic the analysis comp ares the agricultural labor force with the overall us labor force because mexicanborn persons make up the largest portion of foreignborn persons in the

the higher unemployment rates in the united states among mexicanborn workers imply that immigration harms the allocation of labor some evidence suggests that from 1996 to 1998 unemploym ent rates in the mexicanborn labor force in the united states were higher than unemployment rates in mexico using definitions of the labor force and unemployment that more closely match the definitions used in the cps martin calculated that the unemployment rates in mexico for the years 1996 through 1998 were 72 49 and 48 respectively these estimates are based on survey that includes only state capitals and cities of 100000 or more the nationwide unemplo yment rate may have been lower24 in metropolitan areas of 100000 or more in the united states the unemployment rates in the mexicanborn labor force ie em ployed and unemployed workers in all industries for the years 1996 to 1998 were 98 72 and 66 respectively from 1996 and 2000 ie before the rise in unemployment in 2001 the demand for labor in the united states incr eased faster than th increase in supply ie the number of persons employed incr eased more than the number of persons in the labor force an economic slowdown or recession would likely affect the most recently hired since layoffs commonly begin with the least experienced workers ie last hired first laid off25 nevertheless differences in earnings and job growth are probably better predictors of immigration than differences in unemployment rates26 thus even if the unemployment rate among mexicanborn persons in the unitedstates is higher than the unemployment rate in mexico economic theory maintains that labor mobility improves the overall allocation of resources since the main economic reason why people move is to improve their economic situation in addition comparison between unemploymen t rates in mexico and among mexican born workers in the united states does not take into account higher unemployment rates among recent as opposed to ll immigrants to

markets relative earnings may change for different reasons first the supply of workers to an occupation may increase relative to the s upply of workers to other occupations in which case employment in that occupation will generally rise and earnings will generally fall relative to em ployment and earnings in ot her occupations second the demand for workers in an occupation may increase relative to the demand for workers in other occupations in which case both employment and earnings in that occupation will generally rise relative to other occupations third relative earnings in an occupation may rise if labor productivity in that occupation increases relative to labor productivity in ot her occupations finally relative earnings may change because of institutional or policy changes g change in the degree of unionization or an increase in the minimum wage in practice all of these conditions may change simultaneously but to different degree making it difficult to identify the exact causes of

employment in farmworker occupations wa s essentially uncha nged median weekly earnings increased in all occupations these findings suggest different combinations of changes in labor supply demand and productivity to some degree labor productivity may have increased in all occupations in addition the results suggest that in farmworker and t echnical occupations the rela tive supply of and demand for labor were essentially unchanged in managerial nd farming occupations the results suggest that both the supply of and demand for labor increased interpreting the data in table 3 requires some caution first separating the effects of changes in relative supply and demand changes in productivity and institutional or policy changes is beyond the scope of this paper second the broad categories

the wage s of comparable nonunion workers as noted above in the discussion of the distributi on of earnings in addition to relative changes in supply and demand the degree of inequality may change because of policy or institutional changes unions may either reduce or increa earnings inequality for example if unions raise the wages of workers with above average wages the effect of unions would

the analysis in this report is based on data from the current population survey cps the cps is monthly survey conducte d by the us bureau of the census for the bureau of labor statistics bls of th us department of labor the monthly cps is the main source of labor force statistics for the nation including data on monthly unemployment rates the cps coll ects wide range of social demographic and labor market data such as informati on on age gender race level of education family size and composition ma rital status occupation indus try and earnings each month about 59000 households are intervie wed either in person or by phone about 9000 households are not eligible to be interviewed and about 3200 are not interviewed thus about 46800 households are currently interviewed each month the monthly survey collects informa tion for approximately 94000 persons ages 15 and over each month onefourth of the cps sample is asked questions about current earnings the cps sample is re presentative of the civilian noninstitutional population it does not include persons on ac tive duty in the armed forces or persons in institutions such as nursing homes or correctional facilities the survey collects information on persons who are temporarily absent from surveyed household and who have other usual address thes persons include individuals who are on vacation away on business and college st udents the survey includes civilian noninstitutional persons living in group quarter s group quarters are living quarters where residents share common facilities examples may include group homes fraternities or sororities45 the bls defines the labor force as the sum of employed and unemployed persons unemployed persons are indivi duals who are not working but who are available and looking for work employed persons are individuals who are working for private or public employer are lfemployed or who work 15 hours or more per week as unpaid workers on family farm or business also counted as employed are persons who are temporarily absent fro m work because of illness bad weather vacation job training labormanagement di spute childcare problems maternity or paternity leave or other family or personal reasons bls defines wage and salary workers as persons who work for privat or public employer and selfemployed persons whose business is incorporated ie these persons are paid employees of corporation because bls does not coll ect earnings information on selfemployed persons in this report wage and salary workers are indivi duals employed by private or public employers46 each march the cps includes supplement to the basic questions the supplement includes questions about i ndividual and family income sources of income weeks worked and health insurance coverage these questions refer to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31614crs31 47 bureau of labor statistics current population survey design and methodology p 113previous year thus in this report the information in figures 8 to 10 in the text and tables b11 to b13 in appendix b for 19962001 are from the march supplements for 199720 01 the sample for the march supplement includes military personnel who live in household with at least one civilian adult47 the estimates from the march cps for 2000 and 2001 use sample weights based on the 2000 decennial census in this report the data shown from th basic monthly cps are annual monthly averages the monthly data for each year from 1996 to 2001 were combined to calculate annual monthly averages the an alysis in the report focuses on the labor market characteristics of persons age 15 and over who are in the labor force the cps sample is weighted to represent the civilian noninstitutional population official bls labor force statis tics use composite weight that is not available in the public use files for years before 1998 for consistency this report uses final weight for all years fro m 1996 thr ough 2001 diffe rent weight is used for the analysis of earnings the difference in weights has minimal effect on the percentage calculations in this report beginning in january 1994 the monthly cps began to ask households questions about citizenship ie where individuals we re born how long they have lived in the united states and whether foreignborn pers ons have become citizens because of uncertainty about the relia bility of responses to these questions for 1994 and 1995 this report begins with data for 1996httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31614crs32 appendix b data used in analysis this appendix provides the absolute numbe rs
