constitute genocidal acts in certain circ umstances though they may nevertheless constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity the mental and physical elements of the crime of genocide each present their own analytical requirements this is primarily due to the crimes highly sensitive subject matter and the lack of cases pr osecuting acts of genocide from the 1950s until the 1990s over the past decade interna tional tribunal decisions have created an influential understanding as to what c onstitutes genocide under international law they have also provided real world context to an otherwise academic debate regarding the applicability of the genocide convention however the legal definition of the crime of genocide remains in form ative state both tr ibunals still have many more cases to hear and judgments to render moreover these decisions are not binding precedent on the icc or national courts including those of the united states international legal developments concerning the crime of genocide will likely be largely based on these courts approaches this also applies to crimes against humanity such as ethnic cleansing as th debate concerning the substantive difference between

principl underlying the convention are principles which are recognized by civilized nations as binding on states even without any conventional obligation11 however various terms and phrases w ithin the convention remained undefined for several decades largely due to an ab sence of cases prosecuting individuals for committing genocide12 indeed according to one commentator for most of its

the united states or the courts of other nations that have not submitted to the tribunals jurisdiction this report provides an overview of the current framework for prosecuting individuals for genocide and analyzes tribuna l case law concerning the nature of this crime obligations and scope of the genocide convention as of september 7 2004 the united states and 134 other countries are parties to the genocide convention which entered into force in 1951 after being ratified by 20 states parties to the convention r ecognize that genocide whether committed in time of peace or in time of war is crime under interna tional law which they undertake to prevent and to punish15 accordingly if member parties declare an act or activity to constitute genocide they would appear to have clear obligation under the genocide convention to prevent and punish such action16 under the united states system of government the pr esident is the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations17 and presumably the president or the state department acting with his author ization would have ultimate authority as to whether or not to declare on behalf of the united states that foreign act constitutes genocide the scope of this obligation to p revent and punish however remains unclear18 at the very least parties have an obligation under c onvention article 5 to provide effective penalties for persons guilty of genocide or any other acts enumerated19 such other acts include 1 conspiring to commit genocide 2 attempting to commit genocide 3 inciting others to commit genocide and 4 being complicit in the commission of genocide20 in accordance with their domestic laws and treaties par ties to the genocide convention so pledge to make genocide

required to be punished whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers public officials or private individuals22 the obligation to undertake to preven t and to punish genocide might arguably be understood to impose an affirmative ob ligation upon state to take other actions against those committing acts of genocid beyond providing effective criminal penalties against persons who commit genocidal acts it does not appear certain that such preventive and punitive efforts woul d necessarily include military measures given that the charter generally prohibits member states from engaging in armed attacks against other c ountries unless those attacks we re either made in self defense or authorized by the security council23 convention article 8 does provide that conve ntion parties may call upon the competent organs of the united nations to take such action under the charte r of the united nations as they consider appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide24 but this language appears to set fort h permissive option rather than mandatory obligation convention article 2 define s genocide by stating both the mental elements and physical elements of the crime article 2 reads in the present convention genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in pa rt national ethnical racial or religious group as such killing members of the group b causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group c deliberately inflicting on the group c onditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruc tion in whole or in part d imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group forcibly transferring children of the group to another group the introductory statement chapeau of article 2 identifies four subparts to the mental element of the crime of genocide these are 1 the intent 2 to destroy 3 in whole or in part 4 national ethnic racial or religious group as such this is followed by listing

united nations and became party to the genocide c onvention on november 25 1988 the united states included certain reservations and understandings with respect to treaty interpretation nd application within its instruments of convention ratification two of which ar relevant to this report the two conditions are 1 that the term intent to destroy in whole or in part national ethnical racial or

racial or religious group as such by the acts specified in article 2 and 2 that the term mental rm in article 2b means permanent impairment of mental faculties through drugs torture or similar

physical elements of the crime of genocide as including inter alia causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the protected group32 the us statute criminalizing genocide divides this element into two parts and it further specifies acts constituting mental harm of genocidal nature if the requisite genocidal intent is fulfilled person can be convicted under us law for either 1 causing serious bodily injury to members of protected group or 2 causing the permanent impairment of the mental facilitie s of members of the group through drugs torture or similar techniques33 genocide is also an extraditable offens meaning that the united states may surrender person accused of committing genocide to another state if that state has jurisdiction over the offense and an extradition

and genoc idal intent to describe it68 this understanding coincides with the specific intent requirement of the us genocide statute69 specific intent requires performance of the actus reus but in association with an intent or purpose that goes bey ond the mere performance of the act70 in practice tribunals have found that specific intent can be inferred from actions taken by the accused even if the accused s specific intent to commit genocide was never proclaimed in prosecutor v jelisic the icty appeals chamber stated that as to proof of specific intent it may in the absence of direct

evidence on the accuseds actions the trial chamber stated that the material element of the crime of genocide has been satisfied73 however the trial ch amber held that although jelisic obviously singled out muslims he did not demonstrate the necessary specific intent74 this is mostly due to evidence that he randomly released detaineeshttp75 and that his personality revealed opportunistic and inconsistent behaviors76 therefore the trial chamber c oncluded that the prosecutor had not demonstrated that the defendant possessed ge nocidal intent since the prosecutor has not provided sufficient evidence allowing it to be established that there existed plan to destro the mus lim group77 the appeals chamber disagreed with this reasoning stating that the existence of plan or policy is not legal ingredient of the crime however in the context of provi ng specific intent the existence of plan or policy may become an impor tant factor in most cases78 the appeals chamber then inferred an intent by the accused to commit genocide from the facts and circumstances of the case79 this approach has also been applied by the ictr in prosecutor v akayesu the ictr trial chamber stated it is possible to infer the genocidal intention of particular act inter alia from all acts or utterances of the accuse d or from the general context in which other culpable acts were perpetrated systematically against the same group regardless of whether such other acts we re committed by the same perpetrator or even by other perpetrators80 in akayesu the accused oversaw and participated in the widespread massacre of tutsi civilians81 in determining the defendants specific intent the akayesu trial chamber looked to icty decisions that in ferred intent from number of facts such as the general political doctrine which gave rise to the acts or the repetition of destructive and discriminatory acts82 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32605crs12 82 continued consideration of the indictment within the fr amework of rule 61

in criminal law schabas explains it should be noted at the outset that intent and motive are not interchangeable notions several individuals may intend to commit the same crime but fo r different motives domestic criminal law systems rarely require proof of motive in addition to proof of intent as an element of the offence under ordina ry circumstances motive requirement unnecessarily narrows the offence and allows individuals who have intentionally committed the prohibited act to escape conviction this is not to say that motive is irrelevant evidence of motive or lack of it may always be germane to the outcome of trial if an accused can prove lack of motive this will colour assessment of ostensibly inculpatory fa ctors especially if the evidence is indirect finally motive will normally be taken into account in assessing the appropriate penalty once the offenders guilt has been determined crime driven by passion will not be punished as severely as one motivated by avarice or pure sadism 86 schabas supra note 50 at 245256 detailing the bate over the inclusion of motive requirement in the genocide convention b oot supra note 16 at 41011 87 report of the ad hoc committee on

themselves consider to violate the very foundation of the group acts which are not in themselves covered by the list in article 2 of the genocide convention but which are co mmitted as part of the

specific nature which aims at undermining what is considered to be the foundation of the group84 another issue in determining specific intent is whether to consider the accuseds personal motives85 although the genocide convention does not list applicable motives the issue was widely deba ted during the conventions formation86 the ad hoc committee of 1948 included list of mo tives in its draft of the genocide convention it stated that genocide mu st be committed on gr ounds of the national or racial origin or religious be lief of the members of the group87 although this language was not

religious prohibitions on muslim womans ability to remarry an intent to destroy existed since actions taken against the community potentially consigned it to extinction107 in whole or in part once an intent to destroy group has been determined the court hearing claim of genocide must assess whether the scope of the intended destruction was extens ive enough to constitute genocide108 the words in whole or in part make clear that an intent to completely destroy group protected by the genocide convention is not necessary for person to be guilty of genocide according to the internati onal law commission body established to promote the codification nd progressive development of international law it is not necessary to intend to achieve the co mplete annihilation of group from every corner of the globe nonetheless the crime of genocide by its very nature requires the intention to destroy at least substantial part of particular group109 both the icty and ictr have discussed the meaning of substantial part for purposes of the genocide convention in the ictr case of prosecutor v bagilishima the trial chamber agreed with the international law commission and stated although the destruction sought n eed not be directed at every member of the targeted group the chamber considers th at the intention to destroy must target at least substantial part of the group110 i n prosecutor v kayishema and ruzindana the ictr trial chamber defined in pa rt as the intention to destroy considerable number of individua ls who are part of the group111 it also reiterated statement from the

the total population of the group and 2 whether the defendant intended to destroy significant secti on of the group such as its leadership113 the chamber explained that when the evidence is insufficient in relation to each element in isolation intent can so be determined by considering the evidence from both factors as whole114 in the sikirica case the defendant detained and killed male muslims and croats from the prijedor municipality of bosnia and herzegovina115 although the defendant did not seek to destroy the entire group of muslims and nonserbs living in bosnia and herzegovinahttp116 he was charged with the intent to eliminate muslim and nonserb males in the municipality of prijedor in part117 t h prosecution argued that the defendant committed genocide by intending to destroy not only substantial part of the community of bosnian muslim detainees in keraterm and omarska camps but also the leadership of that group including those members defending nonserbs118 although several camps existed in the prijedor municipality the courts analysis was limited to one camp keraterm since the number of detainees was not known for the other camps119 in determining the first element of whether reasonably substantial number of people were destroyed relative to the total population of the group the chamber found that only 2 to 28 of muslims and very small number of croats from the prijedor municipality were detained at keraterm and they would therefore hardly qualify as reasonably substantial part of the group120

analysis the sikirica chamber assessed whether the destruction was related to sign ificant section of the group such as its leadership121 in defining the groups leadershi p the chamber explained that it was looking for bosnian muslims who whether by reason of their official duties or by reason of their personality had this special quality of directing the actions or opinions of the group in question that is those with significant influence on its actions122 the sikirica chamber found that very little evidence has been adduced as to the leadership status of thos whose professions were know n they did not appear to have been persons with any special si gnificance to their community except to the extent some of them were of military age 123 although the sikirica chamber upheld the defenda nts motion for acquittal based on the foregoing evidence the court noted that the extent of the actual destruction did not in itsel f indicate whether the defenda nt intended to destroy group in whole or in part124 however the chamber c oncluded that when these facts are considered along with other as pects of the evidence it becomes clear that this is not case in which the intent to destroy substantial number of bosnian muslims or bosnian croats can properly be inferred125 subsequently in the krstic case the icty appeals chamber stated that in addition to the numeric size of the targeted portion its prominence within the group can be useful consideration if specific part of the group is emblema tic of the overall group or is essential to its survival that may support finding that the part qualifies as substantial 126 national ethnic racial or religious group as such although genocidal acts target individuals these individuals are chosen because of their membership in larger group127 in sikirica the icty trial chamber stated that whereas it is the individuals that constitute the victims of most crimes the ultimate victim of genocide is the group although its destruction necessa rily requires the commission of crimes against its members that is the individuals belonging to that group128 this is also emphasized by the phrase as such in the genocide conventions definition of protected groups which is understood to mean that the evidence must establish that it is the gr oup that has been targeted and not merely specific individuals within that group129httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32605crs18 130 genocide convention art 2 131 see generally s chabas supra note 50 at 13445 b oot supra note 16 at 426 the original convention drafts presented by the

convention wa s intended to protect permanent and stable groups joined at birth as oppos ed to mobile groups based on voluntary membership132 in akayesu the ictr attempted to define the conventions four enumerated groups the akayesu trial chamber defined nationality as collection of people who are perceived to share legal bond based on common citizenship coupled with reciprocity of rights and duties133 the chamber defined an ethnic group as group whose members share common language or culture134 racial groups were determined by the hereditary physical traits often identified with geographical region irrespective of linguistic cultura l national or religious factors135 religious group was understood to be one whose member s share the same religion denomination or mode of worship136 one area of continuing ambiguity is wh ether permanent and stable groups that are entered into at birth but are not clearly of national ethnic racial or religious nature are also protect ed by the convention137 i n akayesu the trial chamber concluded that the tutsi did not constitu an ethnic groupdistinct from the hutu because they shared the same language and culture138 nonetheless the trial chamber held that the tutsi were stab and permanent group protected by the genocide convention since hutu and tsi group members and local authorities treated the tutsi as distinct ethnicity139 the subjective approach employed in akayesu to determine whether persons c onstituted protected group under the genocide convention was expanded in the icty case of kayishema and ruzindana where the

ictr even further in prosecutor v jelsic in this case the icty trial chamber stated that for purposes of determining whether pe rsons constitute group covered by the genocide convention groupings should not be define d objectively but instead through the alleged perpetrators perspective141 such analysis can be made using either positive or negative approach142 under positive approach victims are identified through characteristics which the perpetrato rs deem to be par ticular to national ethnical racial or religious group143 negative approach identifies the victimized group as one which the perpetrators reco gnize as different from their own group along national ethnic r acial or religious lines144 under the negative approach all individuals thus rejected would by exclusion make up distinct group145 the negative approach to defining gr oup membership established by the icty in jelsic was later rejected by another icty trial chamber in stakic the stakic trial chamber stated that the genocid convention protects national ethnic racial or religious groups in cases where more than one group is targeted it is not appropriate to define the group in general terms as for example nonserbs146 although both the ictr and icty ve tried to determine group iden tity for purposes of assessing cove rage under the genocide conve ntion debate continues as to the proper approach to use in asse ssing whether group is protected by the convention physical elements the genocide convention lis ts five physical acts that may constitute genocide if coupled with the requisite intent 1 killing members of the group 2 causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group 3 deliberately inflicting on the group c onditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruc tion in whole or in part 4 imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group or 5 forcibly transferring children of the group to another group147httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32605crs20 148

that the requisite mental element is also present jurisprudence concerni ng each of these acts will be discussed separately killing members of group i n akayesu the ictr identified three elements for determining whether the accused could be punished in accordance with the genocide convention for killing member s of group these elements are 1 the victim is dead 2 the death resulted from an unlawful act or omission of the accused or subordinate and 3 at the time of the killing the accused or subordinate had the intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased148 the third element listed by the akayesu trial chamber was the most contentious because it required the chamber to deter mine when killing constituted prohibited murder under the genocide convention the trial chamber looked at both the english and french language texts of the genocide convention to determine the precise scope of this prohibition the ch amber concluded that the english language texts use of the word killing was too general as it could potentially apply to acts that the convention drafters did not intend to be covered under the genocide convention such as unintentional homicides149 therefore the chamber looked to the official french language version of the genocide convention which uses the word meurtre meaning intentional killing150 relying on the french language text of the genocide convention the ictr c oncluded that the conventions provisions relating to killing members of the protected group were intended to cover only intentional killings151 causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group over the years the icty and ictr have tried to identify actions constituting serious bodily or mental harm under the genocide convention the akayesu trial chamber stated that serious bodily or mental harm without limiting itself thereto means acts of torture be they bodily or mental inhumane or degrading treatment or persecution152 however the akayesu trial chamber stated that serious bodily or mental harm does not nece ssarily mean that the harm is permanent and irremediable153 with respect to mental rm this understanding appears to diverge from the us statute

that torture and inhumane or degrading treatment causes seri ous bodily or mental harm and therefore could be considered genocidal acts if the requisite mental element was fulfilled155 in the ictr decision in kayeshema and ruzindana the trial chamber said that this element could be construed to mean harm that seriously injures the health causes disfigurement or causes any serious injury to the external internal organs or senses156 the kayeshema and ruzindana trial chamber stated that the meaning of the phrase serious bodily and mental harm shoul d be determined on casebycase basis using common sense approach157 it also concurred with the akayesu chambers inclusion of rape and sexual violence as causes of both serious bodily and mental harm158 in explaining this decision the akayesu trial chamber had stated that acts of rape resulted in the physical and psyc hological destruction of tutsi women their families and their communities sexual violence was an integral part of the process of destruction specifically contributing to the destruction of targeted tutsi women and to the destruction of the tutsi group as whole159 deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical dest ruction in whole or in part the text of the genocide convention does not provide clear guidance as to what actions constitute deliberate inf liction upon gr oup of cond itions likely to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part however the akayesu chamber distinguished this element from more direct methods of destroying group of people which were clearly enumerated under the convention such as directly killing group members the akayesu chamber explained that methods of destruction by which the perpetrator does not immediately k ill the members of the group but which ultimately seek their physical destruction are covered by the genocide conventions prohibition against the creation of conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of group in whole or in part160 this would include inter alia subjecting group of people to s ubsistence diet systematic expulsion from homes and the reduction of essential medical services below minimum requirement161 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32605crs22 162 kayishema and ruzindana judgment 115 see also n ehemiah robinson the genocide convention commentary 123

exertion162 the chamber has also found that in some circumstances rape the starving of group of people reducing required medical services below minimum and withholding sufficient living accommodation for reasonable period coul d lead to the destruction of the group in whole or in part163 some commentators have suggested th at the conventions use of the word deliberately with respect to the imposition of lifethreatening conditions indicates requirement that the imposition of such conditions is premeditated164 the word calculated also connotes an additional c onsideration and might suggest that the imposition of lifethreatening conditions must be the perpetrators principal method of destroying the group in whole or in pa rt and not merely the incidental result of other destructive acts165 imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group this provision of the genocide convention was originally meant to apply to acts such as compulsory sterilization and abortion intended to prevent group from adding new members166 in recent years international jurisprudence interpreted this provision more broadly the akayesu trial chamber considered sexual mutilation forced birth control separation of the sexes and prohibition of marriages as genocidal actions intended to prevent births within the tutsi group167 the chamber stated that the forced impregnation of victimized group member could also constitute genocidal act if during rape woman of th said group is deliberately impregnated by man of another group with the intent to have her give birth to child who will consequently not belong to its mothers group168 the chamber noted that such actions pose particular threat in patriarchal societies where membership of group is determined by the identity of the father169 in addition the chamber concluded that the mental harm of rape without imp regnation could also fall under this category if the person raped refuses subseque ntly to procreate in

genocide it must be proven that the perpetrator intended to prevent births and destroy the group through these measures172 forcibly transferring children of the group to another group although transferring children from one group to another group threatens the affected groups ability to continue its traditions nd way of life cultural destruction is not covered by the genocide conve ntion however the transf erring of children could amount to biological genocide since th taking and potential killing of children would destroy the groups newest generation of members in akayesu this offense was interpreted to cover not only direct act s of forcible physical transfer but also acts of threats or trauma which would lead to the forcible transfer of children from one group to another173 the kayishema and ruzindana chamber of the ictr subsequently agreed with this interpretation174 with respect to this actions mental requirement the perpetrator must specifically intend to forcibly transfer children for this action to constitute genocide175 in addition it appears that the pe rpetrator must know that the children are members of victim group and are be ing transferred to different group176 ethnic cleansing background recent debates over the situation in darfur sudan have included whether the inhumane acts in question constituted genocide or ethnic cleansing therefore

of genocide though some warn that it could presage genocidal acts since genocide may become the last resort of the frustrated ethnic cleanser181 regardless the forced deportation or transfer of populations is recognized by various tribunals as both crime ag ainst humanity and depending upon the circumstances war crime182 it is important to note that deportation and forcible transfer of populations are distinct though overlapping concepts number of icty decisions define deportation as the forced displacement of persons by expulsion or other coercive acts from the area in which they are lawfully present across national border without lawful grounds183 in contrast forcible transfer has been described as forced removal or displacement of people from one area to another which take may place within the same national borders184 for purposes of this report ethnic cleansing will only be discussed in relation to crimes against humanity the term crime against humanity was first used in the london charter creating the nuremberg tribunal185 the term was later defined more specifically in the rome statute article 7 of the rome statute lists both deportation and the forcible transfer

cleansing in assessing whether deportation or forcible transfer occurred the icty has considered three elements 1 whether the transfer was across borders 2 whether movement was involuntary and 3 the intent of the perpetrator190 with respect to the first element as previously mentioned the icty has taken the position that deportation requires the displacement of persons across national border to be distinguished from forcible transfer which takes place within national boundaries191 the one exception to this approach occurred in the stakic case where the icty trial chamber held that forced displacement over facto boundaries such as constantly changing frontlines which are not internationally recognized also constitutes deportation192 it does not appear however that other chambers within the icty ve taken this approach with respect to the second element of ethnic cleansing that the movement is involuntary the milosevic trial chamber of the icty recently stated that the involuntary nature of deporta tion or forcible transfer depends on whether the persons transferred had any real choice in the matter193 it also stated that such an assessment should be made on casebycase basis examining the context of all relevant circumstances194 this becomes particularly important in determining whether transferees expressions of consent to movement are authentic in the krnojelac case the icty appeals chamber stated that when analyzing the evidence concerning such expressions it is necessary to put it into context and to take into account the situation and atmo sphere that prevailed 195 in the krnojelac case thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32605crs26 195 continued judgment sept 17 2003 hereinafter krnojelac judgment available at httpwwwunorgictykrnojelacappealjudgementindexhtm 229 196 krnojelac judgment 227 197 id 229 198 milosevic trial chamber 78 199 idtrial chamber had held that evidence of certain detainees express desire to be released and thereafter travel across the border to montenegro prevented finding of involuntary displacement196 however the appeals chamber disagreed and held that the illegal detention of the victims the threats the use of force and other forms of coercion the fear of violence and th detainees vulnerability negated finding of genuine consent197 with respect to the third element deportation and forcible transfer require the same state of intent from the perpetrator198 the milosevic trial chamber required that the perpetrator of the displacement either directly intended that the victim would leave or that it was reasonably foreseeable that this would occur as consequence of his action199
