us department of agricu lture usda for discrimination against african american farmers began in august 1997 with two discrimination suits brought by black farmers pigford v glickman 971978 ddc 1997 and brewington v glickman 98 1693 ddc 1997but its origins go back much further1 for many years black farmers had complained that they were not receiving fair treatment when they applied to local county committees which make the decisions for farm loans or assistance these farmers alleged that they were being denied usda farm loans or forc ed to wait longer for loan approval than were nonminority farmers many black farmers contended that they were facing foreclosure and financial ruin because the usda denied them timely loans and debt restructuring moreover many claimed that the usda was not responsive to discrimination complaints huge agency backlog of unresolved complaints began to build after the usdas civil rights office was closed in 1983

women in farm service agency fsa programs and payments the study examined conditions from 1990 to 1995 and looked primarily at crop payments and disaster payment programs and commodity credit corporation ccc loans the final report found that from 1990 to 1995 minority participation in fsa programs was very low and minorities received less than their fair share of usda money for crop payments disaster payments and loans according to the commissioned study few appeals were made by minority complainants because of the slowness of the process the lack of confidence in the decision makers the lack of knowledge about the rules and the significant bureaucracy involved in the process other findings showed that the largest usda loans top 1 went to corporations 65 and white male farmers 25 b loans to black males averaged 4000 or 25 less than those given to white males c 97 of disaster payments went to white farmers while less than l went to black farmers the study 1 usda

black and white farmers could not be easily determined due to gross deficiencies in usda data collection and handling in december 1996 secretary of agriculture dan glickman ordered suspension of government farm foreclosures across the country pending the outcome of an investigation into racial discrimination in the agencys loan program and later announced the appointment of usda civil rights task force on february 28 1997 the civil rights task force recommended 92 changes to address racial bias at the usda as part of usda civil rights action plan while the action plan acknowledged past problems and offered solutions for future improvements it did not satisfy those seeking redress of past wrongs and compensation for losses suffered in august 1997 proposed class action suit was filed by timothy pigford and later by cecil brewington in the us district court for the district of columbia on behalf of black farmers against the usda the suit alleged that the usda had discriminated against black farmers from 1983 to 1997 when they applied for federal financial help and again by failing to investigate allegations of discrimination

all of the thenestimated 2000 farmers who may have suffered from discrimination by the usda in midnovember 1997 the government agreed to mediation and to explore settlement in pigford the following month the parties agreed to stay the case for six months while mediation was pursued and settlement discussions took place although the usda had acknowledged past di scrimination the justice department opposed blanket mediation arguing that each case had to be investigated separately when it became apparent that the usda would not be able to resolve the significant backlog of individual complaints from minority farmers and that the government would not yield on its objections to class relief plaintiffs counsel requested that the stay be lifted and trial date be set on march 16 1998 the court lifted the stay and set trial date of february 1 1999 on october 9 1998 the court issued ruling certifying as class black farmers who filed discrimination complaints against the usda between january 1983 and february 21 1997 2 in his ruling judge friedman concluded that the class action vehicle was the most appropriate mechanism for resolving the issue of liability in the case3 complicating factor throughout the period however was twoyear statute of limitations in the equal credit opportunity act ecoa the basis for the suit congress accordingly passed measure in the fy1999 omnibus funding law that waived the statute of limitations on civil rights cases for complaints made against the usda between 1981 and december 31 1996 4 as the court date approached the parties reached settlement agreement and filed motions consolidating the pigford and brewington cases redefining the certified class and requesting preliminary approval of proposed consent decree on april 14 1999 the court approved the consent decree setting forth revised settlement agreement of all claims raised by the class 2 pigford v glickman 182 frd 341 ddc 1998 3 id at 342 4 pl 105277 741

consent decree an eligible recipient is an african american who 1 farmed or attempted to farm between january 1981 and december 31 1996 2 applied to usda for farm credit or program benefits and believes that he or she was discriminated against by the usda on the basis of race and 3 made complaint against the usda on or before july 1 1997 the consent decree set up system for notice claims submission consideration and review that involved facilitator arbitrator adjudicator and monitor all with assigned responsibilities the funds to pay the costs of the settlement including legal fees come from the judgment fund operated by the department of the treasury not from usda accounts or appropriations 6 the pigford consent decree basically establishes twotrack dispute resolution mechanism for those seeking relief the most widelyused option track provides monetary settlement of 50000 plus relief in the form of loan forgiveness and offsets of tax liability track claimants had to present substantial evidence ie reasonable basis for finding that discrimination happened that claimant owned or leased or attempted to own or lease farm land claimant applied for specific credit transaction at usda county office during the applicable period the loan was denied provided late approved for lesser amount than requested encumbered by restrictive conditions or usda failed to provide appropriate loan service and such treatment was less favo rable than that accorded specifically identified similarly situated white farmers and the usdas treatment of the loan application led to economic damage to the class member alternatively class participants could seek larger tailored payment by showing evidence of greater damages under track b claim track b claimants had to prove their claims and actual damages by preponderance of the evidence ie it is more likely than not that their claim is valid the documentation to support such claim and the amount of relief are reviewed by third party arbitrator who makes binding decision the consent decree also provided injunctive relief primarily in the form of priority consideration for loans and purchases and technical assistance in filling out forms7 finally plaintiffs were permitted to withdraw from the class and pursue their individual cases in federal court or through the usda administrative process8 5 pigford v glickman 185

claim with the facilitator poormandouglas corporation within 180 days of the consent decree or later than october 12 1999 for those determined to be eligible class members the facilitator forwarded the claim to the adjudicator jamsendispute inc if track claim or to the arbitrator michael lewis adr associates if track b claim if the facilitator determined that the claimant was not class member the claimant could seek review by the monitor randi roth if the facilitator and later by court order the arbitrator 9 ruled that the claim was filed after the initial deadline the adversely affected party could request permission to file late claim under process subsequently ordered by the court late filing claimants were directed to request permission to submit late claim to the arbitrator by later than september 15 200010 the arbitrator was to determine if the reason for the late filing reflected extraordinary circumstances eg hurricane floyd person being homebound or failure of the postal system since there reportedly had been extensive and widespread notice of the settlement agreement and processincluding local meetings and advertisements in radio television newspapers and periodicals across the nation and in heavily populated black minority farmer areas lack of notice was ruled an unacceptable reason for late filing g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g21g157g138g157g158g156g561 in general there seems to be consensus that many of the issues surrounding the implementation of pigford can be attributed to the gross underestimation of the number of claims that would actually be filed11 at the same time many in congress and those closely associated with the settlement agreement have voiced much concern over the large percentage of denials especially under track athe virtually automatic cash payment interest groups have suggested that the poor approval percentages can be attributed to the consent decree requirement that claimants show that their treatment was less favorable than that accorded specifically identified similarly situated white farmers which was exacerbated by poor access to usda files 12 table 1 shows statistics for track claims as of january 2009 as of that date there were 172 eligible track b claimants13 more alarming for many however is the large percentage of farmers who did not have their cases heard on the merits because they filed late approximately 73800 petitions 66000 before september 15 2000 late filing deadline were filed under the late filing procedure of which 2116 were allowed to proceed14 many claimants who were initially denied relief under the late filing procedures requested reconsideration of their petitions out of the approximately 20700 timely requests for reconsideration 17279 requests had been decided but only 113 had been allowed to 9 pigford v glickman 971978 and 981693 ddc december 20 1999 order delegating the authority to make

compilation of individual case data15 many argue that the large number of late filings indicate that the notice was ineffective or defective16 others counter these claims by arguing that the pigford notice program was designed in part to promote awareness and could not make someone file17 some have also suggestedincluding many of the claimantsthat the class counsel was responsible for the inadequate notice and overall mismanagement of the settlement agreement18 judge friedman for example cautioned the farmers lawyers for their failure to meet deadlines and described their

disappointed that the usda did not want to include in the consent decree sentence that in the future the usda would exert best efforts to ensure compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations prohibiting discrimination 20 the judges statements apparently did not go unnoticed as the black farmers and agriculturalists association bfaa filed 205 billion class action lawsuit in september 2004 on behalf of roughly 25000 farmers against the usda for alleged racial discriminatory practices against black farmers between january 1997 and august 2004 the lawsuit however was dismissed in march 2005 because bfaa failed to show it had standing to bring the suit21 the senate amendment states that currently usda guidance prohibits loan foreclosures when there is pending claim of racial

usc 1927 to put into law what is already in place in guidance at usda in the 110th congress the pigford claims remedy act of 2007 hr 899 s 515 and the africanamerican farmers benefits relief act of 2007 hr 558 were introduced to provide relief to many of these claimants who failed to have their petitions considered on the merits the provisions of these bills were incorporated into the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 section 14012 providing up to 100 million for potential settlement costs the farm bill provision also mandates moratorium on all loan acceleration and foreclosure proceedings where there is pending claim of discrimination against usda related to loan acceleration or foreclosure this section also waives any interest and offsets that might accrue on all loans under this title for which loan and foreclosure proceedings have been instituted for the period of the moratorium if farmer or rancher does not prevail on her claim of discrimination then the farmer or rancher will be liable for any interest and offsets that accrued during the period that the loan was in abeyance the moratorium terminates on either the date the secretary of agriculture resolves the discrimination claim or the date the court renders final decision on the claim whichever is earlier g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 tadlock
