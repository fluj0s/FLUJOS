federalstate public labor exchange system brief history of the employment service the first public labor exchange offices1 in the united states were city initiatives begun as early as 1834 in new york later statesupported labor exchange offices were introduced in ohio in 1890 and other states soon followed suit2 during world war i flood of offices opened their doors and under president wilson were incorporated into the first us public employment service system the initial mission of this system was to facilitate the mobilization of defense workers management of the system was the responsibility of the newlycreated us employment service within dol3 at its peak during world war i the system consisted of 773 offices federal support for the system was withdrawn following world war i causing the organizational structure to collapse and by the early 1920s only few states retained offices4 the us public employment service system was virtually nonexistent by the end of the decade it was not until the nation faced the severe unemployment of the great depression that attention again turned to the labor exchange system and president roosevelt resurrected the us employment service5 on june 6 1933 the us congress passed the wagnerpeyser act thereby establishing the current federalstate system of public employment service offices the wagnerpeyser act also commissioned the us employment service to promote the establishment and maintenance of the federalstate public employment service within 6 years all 48 states alaska hawaii and the district of columbia had established offices6 1

transition p 25 crs2 during its early years the ess primary mission was to facilitate the match between job seekers and employment opportunities by referring unemployed individuals to public service jobs and other job openings listed with the by employers in 1935 the social security act created the unemployment insurance ui program and the role of the broadened to include administration of the work test ie monitoring ui claimants to ensure that they are able to work available for work and actively seeking work as well as provision of jobfinding and placement services for ui claimants since 1935 the mission of the has remained fairly constant to assist job seekers in finding employment to assist employers in filling jobs to facilitate the match between job seekers and employers to participate in system for clearing labor between the states7 and to meet the work test requirements of the state unemployment compensation system8 while the overall mission of the has changed little since 1935 its customer focus and service delivery strategies have shifted dramatically largely reflecting the circumstances of the times in the 1930s the was used to place unemployed workers in public service jobs to help alleviate joblessness during the great depression millions of unemployed workers were screened for referral to public works and work relief projects during this period9 during world war ii the was temporarily federalized in order to effectively mobilize civilian labor and coordinate interstate recruitment of workers to meet defense needs following the war control of the was returned to the states10 and the policy of priority services for veterans was institutionalized11 during the korean conflict 19501953 the again became involved with the mobilization of labor to meet defense needs after the korean conflict attention turned toward special groups and services became targeted to veterans youth persons with disabilities older workers exprisoners native americans and minorities12 7 clearing labor between the states involves maintaining job listings for multiple states and referring job seekers to employment opportunities outside their own state 8 20

and the passage of statutes authorizing job training programs13 the ess focus shifted away from providing labor exchange services to referring disadvantaged groups to training or other social programs congress encouraged the shift in focus by increasing funds for the to help states meet the needs of these disadvantaged groups14 this situation changed dramatically in the 1970s after the enactment of the comprehensive employment and training act of 1973 pl 93203 the returned to its original labor exchange functions of providing jobfinding services to job seekers and filling job openings for employers15 because the had acquired an image for serving lowskilled workers during the 1960s it lost much of its support from employers job seekers and policy makers further the ess relationship with the ui system was strained because of concern that the ess focus on lowincome workers adversely impacted services to ui recipients additionally in the 1970s the relationship between the and job training programs was tense partly due to the fact that the had to compete with job training programs for scarce resources16 in an effort to better align local labor exchange services with local training programs and to allow governors greater flexibility to tailor services to meet local needs congress amended the wagnerpeyser act in 1982 with the enactment of the job training partnership act jtpa pl 97300 these amendments transferred primary responsibility for program design and operations from dol to the states and established new wagnerpeyser act funding formula to target resources to areas of greatest need based on labor force size and unemployment rate17 the devolution of authority from the federal government to the states as well as decline in program funding levels from 1984 to 199018 contributed to inconsistency and underperformance of labor exchange services the general accounting office 13 the area redevelopment act of 1961 pl 8727 the manpower development and training

to place job seekers in jobs19 in response to concerns expressed by many job seekers and employers about the delivery of dolfunded employment and training services as well as dissatisfaction with the provision of job information dol launched the onestop career center system initiative in 1993 as means to more effectively link the delivery of employment and training services the department of labor received funding for the onestop initiative under the wagnerpeyser act the goal of the onestop initiative was to transform the provision of employment and training services including labor exchange services into coordinated information and service delivery system four principles were central to the onestop initiative universality program integration customer choice and performance accountability the department of labor encouraged states to use these four principles as the basis for cultivating workforce development systems that streamline the delivery of employment and training services to effectively meet the needs of job seekers and employers because services are universally accessible to job seekers and employers most states use the as the central component of their onestop systems20 for many job seekers and employers the only contact they may need with the onestop system is through services21 on august 7 1998 president clinton signed the workforce investment act of 1998 wia pl 105220 the purpose of this legislation is to consolidate coordinate and improve employment training literacy and vocational rehabilitation programs22 among other things wia repeals jtpa on july 1

information an overview by linda levine crs6 labor exchange services service delivery tiers the type of reemployment services needed by individual job seekers varies widely depending on such factors as job search capabilities educational level employment experience and occupational growth or decline in the local labor market similarly the type of labor exchange services needed by employers seeking workers varies to meet these varying needs of customers ie job seekers and employers dol requires states to have the capacity to deliver labor exchange services through three tiers of service delivery 1 selfservice 2 facilitated selfhelp and 3 staff assisted28 the department of labor expects sesas to provide labor exchange services through each of the three service delivery strategies29 the core30 and intensive31 services defined under section 134 of wia can be delivered through any of these three delivery methods32 selfservice to preserve and expand customer access to services in the face of declining state allotments in real dollar terms states are increasingly relying on services that customers can access without staff intervention these selfservice products are primarily electronic eg state and national job banks33 and the products of americas labor market information service almis which will be described in the almis section of this report not only are these services available to job seekers and employers without the assistance of staff but typically customers can access these electronic resources away from local offices and outside normal business hours generally state job banks the national job bank and many almis products are accessible wherever there is access to the internet including public libraries private homes schools universities military bases and kiosks in shopping malls 28 20 cfr 652207 29 federal register v 63 n 113 june 12 1998 p 32567 30 core services include job search and placement assistance provision of labor market information initial assessment of skills information about available services and resource room usage 31 intensive services include comprehensive employability assessment development of an individual employment plan screened referrals individual and group counseling job clubs and case management 32 20 cfr 652208 33 job bank is computerized network of job openings when an employer places job order ie an announcement of one or more job openings with an office the staff enter the job openings into the states job bank many of these job openings are passed on to the national job bank known as americas job bank approved employers also have the option of entering their job orders directly into the national job bank crs7 facilitated selfhelp facilitated selfhelp resources are typically available in the resource rooms of local or onestop offices here customers are able to access selfservice tools such as personal computers resumewriting software fax machines photocopiers and internetbased tools while resource room staff are available to provide assistance the resource room staff interact with the customers to facilitate usage of the resources states are increasingly relying on this mode of service delivery because it costs less than the staffassisted delivery method for which the ratio of staff to customers is higher34 staffassisted staffassisted services are provided to customers both oneon one and in groups oneonone services for job seekers often include assessment career counseling development of an individual service plan and intensive job search assistance oneonone services for employers may include taking job order or offering advice on how to increase job seeker interest in job opening group services for job seekers include orientation job clubs and workshops on such topics as resume preparation job search strategies and interviewing group services for employers may include workshops on such topics as state ui laws or use of labor market information other staffassisted services that benefit both job seekers and employers include screening and referring job seekers to job openings staffassisted services must be provided in at least one physical location in each workforce investment area35 these service delivery tiers are not new strategy for the system the 1971 manpower report of the president described new system being tested in local offices in six cities memphis phoenix pittsburgh san antonio syracuse and wichita that provided different levels of service based on the individual needs of customers three levels of services were offered streamlined selfhelp service combination of job development and direction in planning personal job search and intensive employability services 36 not surprisingly it was found that selfhelp services such as job banks freed staff resources to assist job seekers with the greatest need for individualized services37 an adverse consequence of job banks however was noted in the 1974 manpower report of the president the report claimed that job banks contributed to such problems as deterioration in personal relationships between staffs and employers and applicants38 the lessons learned from the experimental threetiered offices in 1971 still apply today to effectively meet the needs of job seekers and employers local offices need to achieve balance between relying on electronic tools and maintaining personal contact with customers 34 federal register v 63 n 113 june 12 1998 p 32568 35 20 cfr 652207 b3 note local workforce investment areas known as service delivery areas under jtpa

the dislocated worker funding stream of wia crs13 employers and other similar services71 the department of labor recommends that states provide referred claimants with customized service plans and individualized services tailored to claimants reemployment needs72 the goal of the wprs system is to provide dislocated ui claimants with reemployment services early in their unemployment spell so that they can enter new jobs faster than they would have with later or assistance study based on data from three earlyimplementation states delaware kentucky and new jersey indicates that in the latter two states wprs reduced receipt of ui benefits by more than onehalf week which translated into savings of 100 per claimant73 in new jersey wprs increased earnings for referred claimants by an estimated 190 in the first quarter after the initial claim and 225 in the second quarter74 netimpact analysis of wprs in nationally representative sample of eight states is currently underway75 onestop delivery system the goal of the onestop career center system is to provide coordinated service delivery system whereby job seekers and employers have access to numerous workforce development

until the passage of wia in 1998 dol began to encourage states to streamline the delivery of employment and training services in 1993 through the one stop initiative in 1994 the first six onestop implementation grants were awarded to connecticut iowa maryland massachusetts texas and wisconsin meanwhile 19 other states received planning grants this effort subsequently expanded and with the awarding of the final implementation grants in py1998 all states and territories have received onestop implementation grants the department of labors one stop office estimates that by early1999 approximately 1100 onestop centers across the nation had opened their doors onestop implementation grants have been awarded to the states and territories on 3year grant cycles with funds for the second and third years contingent upon satisfactory state performance in the previous year the grant funds may be used for implementation activities only most of the money is being expended by states for physical electronic and communications infrastructure needed to link various workforce development programs together both through colocation and shared information systems78 the last of the implementation grants will expire on june 30 2001 future funding for local onestop systems will come in part from the adult and dislocated worker funding streams of wia79 under wia each local

career kit americas career kit is composed of four electronic tools americas job bank ajb americas talent bank atb americas career infonet and americas learning exchange the impetus for ajb dates back to president nixons 1969 directive to establish national computer job bank the first job bank was established in baltimore in 1968 and by the end of 1971 more than 100 metropolitan area job banks were operating in 43 states in 1971 the first automated state job banks were created when five states delaware maine oklahoma rhode island and vermont linked their area job banks into statewide systems83 in 1979 dol and the sesas created the interstate clearance system which was replaced in 1983 by the interstate job bank84 on veterans day in 1993 ajb was inaugurated as an expansion of the interstate job bank ajb nofee service joined the internet in february 1995 and is now the largest electronic listing of job openings in the world85 it links to the job banks of the 50 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the us virgin islands as well as to the web sites of private placement agencies and job postings on numerous corporate home pages ajb which was developed jointly by dol and the sesas is operated by the new york sesa under cooperative agreement with dol atb which allows job seekers to post their resumes electronically merged with ajb in may 1998 to bring wide crosssection of job seekers and employers into the public labor exchange system ajb as the combined product is known provides job seekers with large pool of active job opportunities and employers with national exposure for job openings as well as access to job seekers resumes currently more than 900000 job openings and 300000 resumes are available daily on ajb86 the job openings come from all over the country and represent all types of work similarly the resumes are entered by job seekers with wide range of skills and in diverse occupations the third tool in americas career kit americas career

performance standards section 13a of the wagnerpeyser act as amended authorizes the secretary of labor to establish performance standards for activities under this act which shall take into account the differences in priorities reflected in state plans currently however there are federallymandated performance standards for the system while performance is primarily measured through counts of service outputs eg number of individuals registered with the who received reportable service number who were interviewed counseled or tested number who received job referral or referral to training number who entered employment dol has not established minimum standards of performance for activities consequently sanctions are not levied against states for poor performance because standards exist to identify poor evaluations there are national studies that provide indisputable evidence of the overall effectiveness of basic labor exchange services89 because the must provide universal access dol has largely avoided random assignment experiments which deny services to control group of subjects as result studies of services that have been conducted over the years generally rely on comparison group andor statistical methodologies90 of these studies one was comprehensive national evaluation of the shortterm economic impact of the es91 this study conducted by sri international and completed

service outputs eg number of job referrals number placed in employment number referred to training these data form the eta 9002 report the authority to collect eta 9002 data is scheduled to sunset in august 199996 the department of labor has requested approval from the office of management and budget for an extension through august 2000 the expiration of the eta 9002 report is viewed by many including eta as an opportunity to reexamine how labor exchange services are measured97 some states and other stakeholders have expressed objections to the eta 9002 some argue that the reporting requirements are too arduous while others point out that the output measures do not take into account the strength of the economy nor local labor market conditions others note that counting methods of measurement such as those used by the eta 9002 system do not effectively measure the value added since they do not address what would have happened in the absence of the program nor do they measure the return on investment since costs are not adequately accounted for98 further in 1991 the gao noted that performance of has varied dramatically among state and local offices and recommended that the secretary assist states in the development of measurable goals and performance standards for their labor exchange programs99 the department of labor and the states have begun efforts to improve labor exchange performance measurement and to identify the data elements needed to produce effective measures proposed labor exchange performance measures in response to the government performance and

interstate conference of employment security agencies and state partners the workgroup was charged with drafting wagnerpeyser act labor exchange performance measures that would complement the wdpmi effort the labor exchange performance measures workgroup proposed 14 labor exchange measures the measurement methods vary according to the method of service delivery the recommended measurement approach for the selfservice method of delivery focuses on ajb outputs specifically the workgroup recommended counting growth over time of holdings ie number of job orders and resumes on ajb usage ie number of user sessions on ajb and transactions eg number of referral requests made by job seekers and number of resumes downloaded by employers the measurement approach for facilitated selfhelp strategies combines usage and customer satisfaction measures the measurement approach for staffassisted service delivery calls for assessment of the outcomes effectiveness and impact of the labor exchange system the 14 proposed labor exchange performance measures were published in the federal register on june 12 1998 vol 63 113 eta solicited and received comments on the proposed measures and plans to revise the measures performance measurement in the states the development of national performance measures has lagged behind the progress of some states in developing and implementing measurement systems100 many states have created and tested various measurement methods including swipe card technology to count resource room usage and surveys to measure customer satisfaction in part the delays at the federal level have been due to the use of committee approach for the development and approval of workforce development measures101 additionally the passage of wia affected the work of the labor exchange performance measures workgroup performance measurement under wia wia section 136 requires the establishment of comprehensive performance accountability system to assess the effectiveness of workforce investment activities funded under title i of wia ie services funded through the adult dislocated worker and youth funding streams102 it is not yet clear how the creation of performance accountability system mandated under wia will effect the development of labor exchange performance measures 100 organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the public employment service in the united states paris france 1999 p 107 hereafter cited as oecd 101 ibid 102 as part of the performance accountability system wia requires the secretary of labor and the governor of each state to reach agreement on levels of performance for core performance and customer satisfaction indicators the negotiated levels of performance must be incorporated into each states 5year strategic plan as required under section 112 of wia failure by state to meet its expected levels of performance could lead to sanctions while exceeding the levels could lead to the receipt of incentive funds in the federal register v 64 n 56 on march 24 1999 eta published two papers on performance accountability crs20 wagnerpeyser act labor exchange services are not funded under wia and therefore are not required by law to be measured through the performance accountability system however dol has indicated that it may adopt the indicators for other dol programs103 including the states have vested interest in the development of an effective measurement system whether as part of wias performance accountability system or as separate performance measurement system since it is widely agreed that the lack of clear performance measures which might demonstrate the systems effectiveness has contributed to the decline in program funding in recent years in the absence of concrete evidence of its performance it has been difficult for the to build support for its funding base104 funding appropriations the primary source of funding for activities authorized under the wagnerpeyser act is federal unemployment tax act futa pl 761 revenues futa imposes federal payroll tax on employers typically employers pay 56 per worker earning 7000 or more105 futa revenues are credited to the unemployment trust fund which among other things pays for the costs of administering the ui and systems106 appropriations fund state allotments national activities107 and onestop career centers108

wagnerpeyser act originally required federalstate funding partnership in which the federal government contributed 50 to the operation of state systems and the states contributed the other 50 initially the only source of federal funding for the program was general revenues after passage of the social security act in 1935 futa dollars were used to finance the majority of the federal governments contribution to states systems then during world war ii when the was federalized the federal government became the sole source of funding for the following the war and the return of the to the states congress amended the wagnerpeyser act in 1949 to eliminate the federalstate match109 since that time the federal government has been statutorily responsible for funding the system but many states opt to supplement federal dollars110 while the 1949 amendments to the wagnerpeyser act gave the federal government statutory responsibility for funding the the amendments did not mandate formula for allocating funds to the states the distribution of funds was left to the discretion of the secretary of labor one method used by the secretary was performancebased budgeting which was introduced in 1975 funds were allocated to the states on the basis of their performance measured in terms of the quality and 109 ruttenberg and gutchess the federalstate employment service pp 45 110 according to

states according to an administrative formula which allocated staff years then multiplied the staff years by each states approved salary and benefit rate112 jtpa amended section 6 of the wagnerpeyser

same time encouraging states to increase their role training and employment information notice 598 august 3 1998 127 in fy1998 total of 1100 bonds were purchased with state and local funds in 16
