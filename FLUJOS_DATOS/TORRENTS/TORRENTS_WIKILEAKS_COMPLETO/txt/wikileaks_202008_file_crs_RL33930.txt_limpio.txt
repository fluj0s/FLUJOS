analyst in financial institutions government and finance division subprime mortgages primer on current lending and foreclosure issues summary subprime mortgages are loans extended to borrowers with weak credit profiles subprime mortgages entail higher risk of delinquency and default recent increases in subprime borrower foreclosures and lender bankruptcies have prompted concerns that some lenders underwriting guidelines are too loose and that some borrowers may not have fully understood the risks of the mortgage products they chose regulatory agencies are revisiting the guidance they provide lenders and are reevaluating required disclosures to consumers in addition congress is holding hearings on the subject and may consider consumer protection legislation subprime foreclosures have reached the highs of the 20002001 recession but delinquency rates are not the same across mortgage features the adjustable interest rate arm feature is currently associated with higher delinquency rates than comparable fixed rate loans however the delinquency rate of loans with the negative amortization negam feature has remained below 1 the range normally associated with less risky loans negam is loan that allows monthly payment less than the current interest on the loan with the remaining interest added to the principal thus increasing the loan balance financial regulators issued guidance for alternative mortgage products in october 2006 and issued proposed statement for subprime lending in march 2007 the guidances require that consumers be given plainlanguage explanations of the risks of their mortgages borrowers must be qualified for mortgage loans based on the ability to repay the loan not based on speculation about future increases in the value of the real estate collateral the proposed guidance also seeks to limit payment shock and prepayment penalties policymakers are faced with the challenge of balancing the benefits of access to credit against the costs of potential foreclosures this report will be updated in the event of significant regulatory or legislative change contents background 1 the subprime market and alternative mortgages 2

background subprime mortgage lending can benefit consumers by allowing greater access to credit and thus homeownership but can also impose costs on consumers through defaults and foreclosures subprime refers to people who have credit history have blemished credit record andor have weak debtservicetoincome ratio generation ago subprime loan applicants were generally denied credit and neither enjoyed homeownership nor risked default policymakers evaluating subprime lending issues will be called on to consider the benefits of increased access to credit markets which can lead to homeownership as well as the costs of increased debt burdens and potential foreclosure to that end this report describes the subprime market presents delinquency and foreclosure data and summarizes banking agency guidance on subprime lending the rise of riskbased pricing encouraged growth of the subprime market during the mid1990s1 for example the number of subprime refinance loans increased nearly tenfold between 1993 and 19982 subprime loans increased from an estimated 5 of the mortgage market in 1994 to as much as 20 in 20053 after retreating during the recession of 19992001 subprime lending expanded rapidly during 2002 2005 in 2006 the housing market slowed and there was rise in late mortgage 1 riskbased pricing refers to assessing borrowers risk and then charging higherrisk borrowers higher interest rate rather than simply refusing to qualify them for loan in contrast poolbased pricing accepts range of borrowers into pool which is charged the same rate based on the average credit quality of the pool borrowers outside the pool are simply denied credit 2 unequal burden in new york income and racial disparities in subprime lending department of housing and urban development hud may 2000

federal reserve bulletin september 2006 rev p a125 there is single accepted source for subprime market share the federal reserve collects loan information through the home mortgage disclosure act hmda which does not currently require lenders to report borrowers credit score and only requires interest rate information if the rate is more than 3 above comparable treasury rate the proportion of loans that exceed hmdas 3 threshold and are thus considered high cost is sensitive to changes in the proportion of loans that are adjustable rate and to the difference between shortterm and longterm interest rates alternatively the department of housing and urban development maintains list of lenders who specialize in loans to consumers with weaker credit the market share of these lenders can vary significantly over time private financial consultants with access to more detailed lender loan information provide third set of estimates crs2 payments and foreclosures the rise in delinquencies and foreclosures continues to be more severe in the subprime market than the prime market but both rates are growing several prominent subprime lenders are experiencing financial difficulties including the recent bankruptcy of ownit and investigations into new century potential negative consequences for consumers banks and financial markets have drawn renewed attention to government policies related to subprime lending government policies play role at each stage of the mortgage lending process when borrower takes out mortgage loan the truth in lending act tila and the home ownership equity protection act hoepa provide rules for disclosure and limitations on the terms of certain high cost loans when lenders originate loans the regulatory agencies of the federal financial institutions examinations council ffiec supervise their portfolios to ensure safe and sound banking practices4 when lenders sell some of their loans to secondary markets through the government sponsored enterprises gses fannie mae and freddie mac the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo supervises the gses for safety and soundness and the department of housing and urban development hud regulates the gses charter compliance when investors purchase mortgagebacked securities mbs issued by the gses or their competitors the securities and exchange commission sec enforces the antifraud provisions of the securities laws government policies designed to aid lowerincome consumers achieve homeownership may have contributed to the expansion of subprime lending for example the community reinvestment act cra encourages lenders to provide loans in the poorer areas of their market where subprime borrowers are more likely to reside similarly increases in huds affordable housing goals encourage the gses to expand their purchases of loans originated from lowerincome and minority borrowers who are more likely to be subprime federal housing administration fha slowness to adopt some of the nontraditional mortgage products that became popular when house prices were rising rapidly may have resulted in some fha eligible borrowers turning to subprime lenders the subprime market and alternative mortgages generally subprime mortgages are defined in terms of the credit bureau risk score fico of the borrower5 other credit imperfections however can also cause borrowers to be categorized as subprime for particular loan for example the addition of the mortgage loan might increase the borrowers debttoincome level above traditionally prudent thresholds generally bank

probability fico below 660 or similar measure limited ability to cover living expenses after debts debtserviceto income ratio of 50 or more subprime loans are disproportionately used by the elderly and members of minority groups the elderly are more likely to own home and to have accumulated significant equity and therefore are more likely to qualify for refinance loan despite perhaps having imperfect credit minorities on average have lower incomes and therefore are often more likely to have credit blemishes in addition there is some evidence that minorities who could qualify for cheaper prime loans are sometimes borrowing in the more expensive subprime market7 in recent years subprime borrowers increasingly used alternative mortgage products that had previously been used primarily by sophisticated investors interest only io mortgages provide an introductory period during which monthly payments cover only the loan interest after the introductory period loan payments reset to higher amount to also cover the loans principal negative amortizing mortgages negams allow borrowers to pay less than current interest due and result in higher loan balance and higher future payments in contrast to fixed rate mortgages frm which have fixed interest rates and constant monthly payments adjustable rate mortgages arms reset the interest rate with changes in market interest rates and therefore can result in higher or lower monthly payments depending on market conditions because alternative mortgage products allow monthly payments to rise some policymakers are concerned that subprime borrowers in particular may not have fully understood the risks associated with nontraditional features growth foreclosures and risk in subprime mortgages expansion of the subprime market may have benefited some consumers by improving access to credit and facilitating homeownership the timing of the growth of the subprime market corresponds to growth in homeownership the us 6 subprime

more prevalent in minority communities the homeownership gap between whitenonhispanics and all minorities dropped from 278 percentage points in 1993 to 245 percentage points in 2005 expansion of the subprime market may have increased the costs associated with greater debt burdens subprime foreclosures increased faster than prime foreclosures during the 20002001 recession and are again rising faster than prime foreclosures in the current housing slowdown figure 1 presents data from the mortgage bankers association mortgage delinquency survey subprime loans in this sample are several times more likely to go into foreclosure and are far more sensitive to the credit cycle than prime loans figure 1 shows that less than 1 of prime loans were in foreclosure during 19982006 in contrast at least 3 of subprime loans were generally in foreclosure during the 20002001 recession subprime foreclosures reached almost 10 in the current housing downturn subprime foreclosures are again rising rapidly although higher subprime foreclosures confirm that subprime loans are riskier than prime loans the evidence for alternative mortgage products depends on the particular feature figure 2 shows

survey 8 us department of commerce bureau of the census the year 1993 is chosen as the beginning point both because census data reflect changed weighting procedure in that year and because the subprime market grew rapidly during 19931998 crs5 under significant stress for both interestonly loans and fully amortizing loans9 loan performance financial consulting firm has found that among subprime loans adjustable rate products appear to have increased their delinquency rate faster than fixed rate products since 200510 during the period loan performance studied the 60day delinquency rate for subprime fixed rate mortgages remained close to 9 but the 60day delinquency rate for subprime adjustable rate mortgages rose from under 2 during the summer of 2004 to over 14 in november 2006 figure 2 delinquency rate of subprime mortgages by feature the 60day delinquency rate for negative amortizing negam loans is rising but remains relatively low negam loans give the borrower the option of paying less than the interest owed in any month and therefore can increase the loan balance in the sample analyzed by loan performance most negam arms originated during 20042006 have increased their balance but the delinquency rate for these products has not risen as fast as subprime delinquency rates the 60day delinquency rate for all negam arms originated in 2006 remained below 1 but the 60day delinquency rate for subprime arms originated in 2006 exceeds 811 9 fully amortizing loan pays off the loan balance using the traditional method of constant monthly payments an interestonly loan has an introductory period of lower payments during which the monthly payments do not pay down the loan balance 10 loan performance calculations cited in economic commentary fannie mae february 20

calculations cited in economic commentary fannie mae february 20 continued crs6 stress on subprime lenders in addition to rising foreclosures among subprime borrowers the slowdown in the housing market has also challenged subprime lenders many subprime lenders raise funds by selling their loans to investors in the secondary market and using the proceeds to make new loans these lenders can suffer significant hardship if investors downgrade the value of subprime debt for example ownit mortgage declared bankruptcy in december 2006 reportedly after it lost financing from merrill lynch and other investors12 new century is under investigation for accounting and other improprieties connected to its subprime business several other lenders have shut their doors or restricted their subprime lending stress on subprime financing is not confined to just few lenders key indicator of investor estimation of the risk associated with funding loans through secondary markets the abx index declined suddenly and significantly for subprime loans in february 2007 see figure 3 the abx index is based on the cost of hedging purchases of mortgage loans that are packaged into securities and sold to investors in the secondary market13 according to markit an independent provider of data for derivatives trades the price that investors were willing to pay for the bbb rated portion of the index part of the subprime market fell from just over 97 on january 19 2007 to under 70 by february 26 200714 the decline in the abx index reflects the reduced willingness of investors to accept the risks associated with subprime loans as result funds for additional subprime loans are decreasing 11 continued 2007 p2 not all subprime loans are negam loans and not all negam loans are subprime loans 12

exposure to the risk that their investment will go sour traditional hedge occurs when someone simultaneously invests in two instruments that move in opposite directions so that if one goes bad the

lenders has been concern for many policymakers because some believe that disruptions in financial markets could have wider effects on the economy for example some believe that banking disruptions can make the business cycle more volatile federal responses to the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s may have been due in part to concerns for the larger economy the federal reserve itself was created because of congressional commission to study banking issues in the panic of 1907 while disruptions in the current subprime market do not rise to the level of historic banking panics financial regulatory agencies have made public their intention to closely watch the subprime sector the ffiec agencies have issued new interagency guidance to address emerging issues and questions relating to certain subprime mortgage lending practices15 banking agency guidance financial regulators have recognized the increased risks of subprime lending rising subprime foreclosures during 2000 prompted the occ to tighten oversight of subprime lending programs in january 2001 institutions with significant subprime lending activities will be subject to closer scrutiny to ensure that their programs have 15 proposed statement on subprime mortgage lending federal register vol 72 45 mar 8 2007 p 10533 crs8 appropriate risk management controls and capital support16 the guidance covered capital maintenance standards for individual loan review by examiners documentation requirements for delinquent subprime accounts and policies to curb potentially abusive lending practices since 2001 as mortgage markets have continued to evolve and housing markets have expanded subprime lending has drawn renewed attention in october 2006 the lending regulators of the ffiec issued guidance for alternative mortgage products the guidance reiterated that lenders must qualify loans based on the borrowers ability to repay the loan balance not based on the value of the loan collateral in sale or foreclosure the october 2006 guidance also reminded lenders of truth in lending act requirements to explain payment terms in plain language in order to curb abusive lending practices with subprime delinquencies and foreclosures mounting again the ffiec has issued new interagency guidance for comment the proposed guidance reiterates many of the principles addressed in existing guidance relative to prudent risk management practices and consumer protection laws17 concerning risk management the proposed guidance states that predatory lending typically involves at least one of 1 lending on collateral value rather than borrower ability to repay 2 inducing repeated refinances to charge high points and fees or 3 using deceptive marketing to conceal the true nature of the mortgage obligation concerning consumer protection the proposed guidance states that mortgage product descriptions and advertisements should provide clear detailed information on the costs terms features and risks of the loan to the borrower including any payment shock or prepayment penalty in the proposed guidance the ffiec asks for comments concerning restrictions on planned refinances because the structural evolution of subprime mortgage lending in recent years has introduced some products that are intended at their outset to be temporary credit accommodations in anticipation of early sale or refinancing rather than longerterm amortizing accounts18 commentors are asked to address the following do planned subprime refinances always present inappropriate risks that should be discouraged if not under what circumstances are they appropriate will the proposed guidance restrict existing subprime borrowers attempts to refinance and avoid payment shock should restrictions on planned refinances apply beyond subprime markets 16 subprime lending expanded guidance for subprime lending programs occ 20016 jan 31 2001 this bulletin supplements occ bulletin 199915 subprime lending risks and rewards 17 proposed

prepayment penalties be restricted to the introductory period policy considerations subprime loans which are extended to borrowers with weaker credit conditions have higher delinquency and foreclosure rates policies that facilitate subprime lending have to balance the benefits of homeownership against the risks of increased debt more complex mortgage products may facilitate homeownership under some conditions but may be more difficult for consumers to understand19 restrictions on mortgage products may insulate creditimpaired borrowers from default risk but may make it more difficult for these potential borrowers to own home federal and state authorities also protect consumers through antipredatory lending initiatives20 the recent rise in subprime delinquencies illustrates the tradeoff between encouraging greater access to credit markets and risking increased defaults and foreclosures policymakers decide the role of government agencies and government sponsored enterprises gses in the subprime sector21 some argue that greater gse presence in the subprime market could help reduce instability in that market by helping to standardize underwriting procedures raising the gses housing goals may direct their programs to lowerincome households but may increase the flow of funds to risky mortgages22 reforming the loan programs of the federal housing administration fha could provide lowerincome borrowers with an alternative to subprime lenders but may be less flexible in changing market conditions23 fha makes it easier for borrowers to obtain loans by insuring the loan payments on the other hand some argue that granting fha greater flexibility could increase the amount of risky mortgages 19 crs report rl33775 alternative mortgages risks to consumers and lenders in
