bainwol chairman and ceo of the recording industry ssociation of america the music industry has faced an immense challenge in online piracy over the past several years in addition to sharply declining sales figures composers ar tists musicians technicians and multitude of others engaged in the music industry have seen their jobs disappear introduction although the advent of digital technology has brought about higher quality for audio and video content creators of such content and policy makers are concerned that without adequate content protection measures unlawful digital copying and distribution of copyrighted material may endanger the viab ility of the motion picture television and music industries1 as result technolog ical measures have been proposed that are aimed at protecting copyrighted media from am ong other things unauthorized reproduction distribution and performance one of these content prot ection schemes is the audio protection flag apf or audio flag which would protect the content of digital radio transmissions against unauthoriz ed dissemination and reproduction background what is digital audio to understand digital audio an explanation of how analog and digital technology differ is helpful analog technology is characterized by an output system where the signal output is always proportional to the signal input because the outputs are analogous the word analog is used an analog mechanism is one where data is represented by continuously va riable physical quan tities like sound waves or electricity analog audio technologies incl ude traditional radio amfm radio audio cassettes and vinyl record albums these t echnologies may deliver imprecise signals and background noise thus the duplication of an alog audio often er odes in quality over time or through serial copying the making of copy from copies the term digital derives from the word digit as in counting device digital audio technologies represent audi data in binary fashion using 1s and 0s rather than using physical quantity digital audio signal employs an informational stream of code consequently the code from dig ital audio source can be played back or duplicated nearly infinitely and without any degradation of qua lity digital audio technologies include digital radio broadcasts such as highdefinition radio or hd radio satellite radio internet radio compact discs and mp3format music files digital content protection with the advent of digital technology content providers have been interested in using content security measures to prevent

broadcast programs see also crs report rl31260 digital television an overview by lennard g krugerare generally referred to as digital rights management or drm as the name suggests drm applies only to

prohibits th selling of products or services that circumvent accesscontrol measures as well as trafficking in devices that circumvent technological meas ures protecting right of the copyright owner3 in contrast to copyright infringement wh ich concerns the unauthorized or unexcused use of copyrighted material the anticirc umvention provisions of the copyright act prohibit the design manufacture import offer to the public or trafficking in technology produced to circumvent copyright encryption programs regardless of the actual existence or absence of copyright infringement the audio flag one form of drm technology th at may be used to protect the content of digital audio transmissions from unauthorized distribution and reproduction is the audio flag the flag has two primary aspects physical co mponent and rules and standards that define how devices communicate with flagged content transmitted from digital audio sources for instance satellite digital audio radio stream of particular broadcast music program could contain an audio flag the mechanism that prohibits any reproduction or further dissemination of the broadcast the standard the audio flag according to its proponents would operate in similar manne r as the broadcast video flag that has been proposed for digital television transmissions4 functionally the audio flag system would work by embedding special signal within transmitte d digital audio data informing the receiving device of certain copyright restrictions on th use of the content by the listener for example limiting the number of copies of recording that the user may make those advocating the use of an audio flag for digital radio programming include musicians songwriters record labels and ot her providers of audio content that could

legal interest in the work that permit the copyright holder to control the use of the protected material these statutory rights allow copyright holder to do or to authorize among other things reproducing the work distributing copies or phonor ecords of the work and publicly performing the work5 parties holding copyright interest in content transmitted through digital radio services are interested in ensuring that such content is protected from unauthorized reproduction and di stribution by the broadcast recipient the audio flag in their view is an effective way to achieve this objective and enforce their rights proponents of audio flag technology also ggest that it would help prevent certain digital radio services like satellite radio from becoming music download service through the creation of recording and storag devices that allow for further reproduction and distribution of audio broadcasts6 some copyright holders argue that these broadcasters must either pay additional royalties for the privilege of offering what appears to be music download service or comply with an audio flag regime that will effectively prevent broadcasters from allowing the recording in the first place7 rights that may be affected by the audio flag proposal critics of the audio flag proposal raise c oncerns that such governmentmandated measure may stifle technological innovation and restrict the ri ghts of consumers to record broadcast radio conduct that according to audio flag opponents is protected by the audio home recording act of 1992 as well as fair use principles in copyright law the audio home recording act of 1992 the introduction of the digital audio tape dat by sony and philips in th mid1980s prompted passage of the audio home recording act ahra in 19928 dat

royalties that are distributed to the music industry opponents of the audio flag contend that the ahra created right for consumers to make digital recordings practice that might be limited or even ffectively revoked by audio flag mandates10 fair use the doctrine of fair use in copyright law recognizes the right of the public to make reasonable use of copyrighte d material in certain instances without the copyright holders consent because the language of the fair use statute is illustrative determinations of fair use are often difficult to make in advance it calls for caseby case analysis by the courts11 however the statute recognizes fair use for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching scholarship or research12 determination of fair use by court considers four factors 1 the purpose and character of the use including whether such use is of commercial natu re or is for nonprofit educational purposes 2 the nature of the copyrighted work 3 the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as whole and 4 the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work13 in the context of digital music downloads and transmissions some alleged copyright infringers have attempted to use the doctrine of fair use to avoid liability for activities such as sampling14 space shifting15 and peertopeer p2p file sharing16 t h s attempts have not been very successful as several federal appellate courts have ruled against the applicability of the fair use doctrine for these purposes17 litigation has yet settled the extent to which home recording of an audio broadcast whether transmitted through digital or analog means is legitimate fair usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22489crs6 18 see eg the audio

it places technologi cal financial and regulatory burdens that may stifle the innovation behind dig ital audio technologies they argue that the audio flag may limit the functionality of digital audio transmissions in favor of analog transmissions thereby negatively affecting the digital audio marketplace18 audio flag legislation introduced in the 109th congress legislation that expressly delegates authority to the fcc to mandate audio flags for digital radio transmissions would appear to be necessary before th fcc could take such steps in the wake of decision by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in 2005 that vacated an fcc order requiring digital televisions to be manufactured with the capability to prevent unauthorized redistributions of digital video content the court ruled that the fcc lacked the statutory authority to establish such broadcast video flag system for digital televisi on under the communications act of 193419 two bills were introduced in the 109th congress that would have legated such authority these may represent legislative approaches that could be taken in the 110th congress hr 4861 the audio broadcast flag licensing act of 2006 this bill would have empowered the fcc to promulgate regulations governing the licensing of all technologies necessary to make transmission and reception vices for digital broadcast and satellite radio20 the bill directed that any such digital audio regulation shall prohibit unauthorized copying and redistribution of transmitted content through the use of broadcast flag or similar technology in manner generally consis tent with the purposes of other applicable law s 2686 the digital content protection act of 2006 title iv subtitle c of s 2686 would have granted the fcc the authority to issue regulations governing the indiscriminate redistribution of audio content with respect to digital radio broadcasts satellite digital radio trans missions and digital radios21 it also directed the fcc to establish an advisory committee known as th digital audio review board composed of representatives from severa l industries including information technology software consumer electronics radio and satellite broadcasting audio recording music publishing performing rights societies and public interest groups the board would have been responsible for drafting proposed regulati on that reflects consensus of the members of the board and that is consistent with fa ir use principles although the bill did not define whether such fair use has the same c onnotation as that used in the copyright law
