2006 on which comments were received by may 2006 the bureau and the chief of mission have accepted most of the recommendations made and are in the pro cess of implementing them overall assessment oios assessed the unhcr operation in libya as avera ge it was adequately run but although the majority of key controls were being applied th application of certain important controls lacked consistency or effectiveness in order not t compromise the overall system of internal control timely corrective action by management is required programme management for the two partners reviewed reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements improvements were needed over the maintenance of ac counting records for cash disbursements and compliance with unhcr procurement procedures further efforts were required to ensure programme m anagement reaches an acceptable level of conformity to unhcrs rules and procedures financi monitoring was not performed on time and was not documented for instance it took unhcr five months after the termination of partnership to question the validity of expend itures charged to the project the selection of partners was not sufficiently transparent and freq uent changes of the partners had negative impact on the cost and performance of projects som of the complications that ocm referred to in its reply to oios were due to an inadequate u nderstanding of programme management the low rate of implementation of projects was part ly due to the lack of the capacity of partners the support provided in terms of logisti cs vehicle was provided and administrative equipment was insufficient to ensure the smooth implementation of the projects the involvement of unhcr in capacity building was lmost nonexistent despite the fact that the partners had previous experience in implemen ting unhcr activities financial and human resources were not sufficient t cover the basic needs of unhcr beneficiaries the bureau indicated that mission will be conduct ed to determine budget requirements and the required level of capacity bui lding of partners programme assistant without adequate supervision carried out the closure of the somali compound several weaknesses in procedures were ted in particular there was not sufficient evidence that payments totalling us 36 500 were made to genuine unhcr beneficiaries the beneficiary list was prepared an d modified without the approval of the assistance advisory committee payments were made t persons to whom the status of refugee had been denied and some payments were recorded as paid by unhcr but this was not the case detailed report on this activity by the res ponsible chief of mission has never been done the refugee statistics were not accurate the figur previously maintained on excel were downloaded into ricss in 2003 without being verifie d for accuracy they may have been inflated since the distinction between active and n onactive refugee cases had not been made and all the individual cases were not supported by an open file moreover ricss was not operational in 2005 due to the absence of staff to run it oios was informed that since the installation of progres the data transferred to th system is being verified by newly hired unv supply management oios assessed that the procurement procedures were weak there was designated focal point register of commercial contracts has not b een maintained and the procurement files did not provide evidence that proper competition had be conducted most of the assets were fully depreciated and shoul d be replaced to make the office more effective and operational in view of the implemen tation of msrp the procurement of new computers and communications facilities were requir ed assettrak had not been updated since the end of 200 4 the lamb meetings were held sporadically with the last minutes dated october 20 03 also without any authority the field programme assistant proceeded to transfer ownership of assets that were longer required due to the closure of the somali compound security and safety due to several security incidents the government p rovided the services of armed security guards for the unhcr office mission by regi onal security officer in april 2005 recognized that unhcr is more at risk than most of the other agencies working in libya in spite of this most of the recommendations made had not yet been implemented ocm indicated that they have sought advice from headqua rters on various security issues

local population and residing in r ented accommodation arab and african nationals with valid travel documents were permitte d to obtain employment unhcrs assistance was aimed at selfreliance including job placement vocational training apprenticeships and microcredit agricultural schem 3 libya has not signed the 1951 convention re lating to the status of refugees and its 1967 protocol given that legal framework and adminis trative structure to deal with refugees and asylum seekers to determine refugee status have not yet been established unhcr is providing the whole range of services in

the main objectives of the audit were to ev aluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subproject agreements 2 iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on 2004 and 2005 programm activities under projects ablbycm200 and ablbyrp370 with budget of us 13 million our review concentrated on the activities implemented by alwa fa expenditure of us 238700 for 2005 and lssc with budgetexpenditure amounting to us 357000 we also reviewed activities directly implemented by unhcr with expenditure of u s 217000 7 the audit reviewed the administration of th office of the chief of mission in tripoli with administrative budgets totalling us 218000 f or the years 2004 and 2005 and assets with an acquisition value of us 98000 and current va lue of us 25000 the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in libya was eight this included staff on regular posts one international and five nationals and two united n ations volunteers 8 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 9 for the two partners reviewed alwafa and lssc reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and di sbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements oios observations are com mon for both partners as although they were two different legal entities the same personn were used to implement the unhcr sub project and lsscs accounting records were kept in alwafa premises 10 audit certificates with unqualified audit opinions were received for all partners including those for which an audit certificate was not requir ed ie subprojects implemented by local ngos or government organizations with expenditure f less than us 100000 alwafalssc 11 alwafa used manual accounting system w hich was mainly cashbook where expenditures were recorded by budget line to facili tate reporting to unhcr although alwafa maintained separate bank account for the unhcrs project all payments were made in cash the internal controls over cash were lax it was t kept in safe and there was proper accounting record of cash on hand it was only in january 2005 that alwafa started using spreadsheets to record cash withdrawals while oios appreciated the efforts made to improve the accounting of expenditures we cautioned agains t the use of spreadsheets as an accounting system as they are not sufficiently secure and dat can easily be altered oios recommended that unhcr libya request alwafa to maintain cash book journal action has been taken and the partner is now using new developed cashbook j ournal 3 12 the internal control procedures for paymen ts were not satisfactory for example the payment voucher pv did not always identify the be neficiary there were supporting documents to check the validity of invoices for med ical services and the global invoices from the pharmacy did not always agree to the correspond ing individual invoices moreover the beneficiaries did not sign that they had received t he medicines oios recommended that unhcr request alwafa to modify the pv to include b oth the name of the beneficiary and the description of expenditures as well as better docu ment the controls over payments ocm have assisted the partner in developing new pv form pr oviding the name of the beneficiary and the description of the expenditure 13 contrary to unhcr requirements beneficiar cards had not been used since 2002 despite the need to have single source detailing assistance provided to each beneficiary oios recommended that alwafa use beneficiary cards to r ecord all types of assistance provided the partner has already started using beneficiary cards in addition to an electronic database to record the assistance provided to refugees and othe r persons of concern 14 financial assistance was not paid on mon thly basis which was in line with normal procedures there were five payments per year and the first took place only at the end of march or early april covering the period from january to march this happened as the partner did not have sufficient funds to make the payments and non was received prior to signing the sub project agreement this cash flow problem resulted due to misunderstanding of unhcrs programme management procedures ocm had requested the partners to reimburse unspent balances in early january instead of using them to initiate current year activities oios could not establish why there was such delay in signing the subproject agreement since headquarters issued the loi in good time b procurement 15 oios assessed that the procurement procedu res were not satisfactory alwafa was given budget for procurement of goods and services exce eding us 20000 per year alwafa was not prequalified to conduct procurement on behalf of unhcr nor was it requested to apply the unhcr ip procurement guidelines the procurement of goods and services was mainly related to the purchase of tool kits and medical services according to the alwafa project coordinator price comparison was made on information received verbally but it was not documented moreover alwafa stated that competitive selection of medical services was not made as all the clinics applied similar rates oios recommended tha t alwafa adhere to unhcr procurement procedures and select suppliers on competitive ba sis the selection process should be adequately documented ocm indicated that they gave ad hoc training to wafa to assist them in complying with unhcr ip procurement guidelines the selection of medical clinics has been made according to unhcr procedures 16 alwafa could not provide documents suppor ting the procurement of goods to be distributed by unhcr to asylum seekers living in tention centres alwafa explained that the transactions were made directly by unhcr through it s service provider and it was subsequently recorded as alwafas transactions oios recommende d that this practice stop as it is not appropriate for partner to record unhcr direct ex penditures these expenditures should be recorded by unhcrs books of account as it is dire ctly responsible for them ocm denied that they were directly responsible for the procurement ocm were unable to provide any documentary evidence of the partners sole involvem ent in these transactions oios noted that in some other cases there was evidence that ocm inter vened in activities delegated to partners 4 indicating an unclear understanding of its supervis ion and monitoring role c salaries 17 contrary to good practices and common empl oyment laws alwafa staff working on the unhcr subproject did not have employment contract s ocm stated that wafa confirmed that all staff hired under the project had valid co ntracts oios would like to highlight that evidence of this could not be provided during the udit in addition reference was made in the management letter issued by the external auditor fo r the 2004 project that the partner had not paid social contributions to the government when ios raised this issue during the audit wafa indicated that its employees were paid higher salaries but allowances to cover any participation in social benefits ocm agreed with alwafa that it is the responsibil ity of employees to pay such contributions and not the emp loyer oios is not fully satisfied with this response particularly as it contradicts the findin gs of the external auditor further efforts are required by ocm to ensure that project staff funded by unhcr have proper employment contracts and are complying with the local employme nt law ocm should also caution alwafa that any penalties that may arise for the nonpayme nt of employers contributions to social benefits would not be funded by unhcr recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission in libya s hould obtain evidence that project staff funded under the unhcr subproject have proper employment contracts with alwafa thes contracts should also clearly state that it is the responsibi lity of the individual to ensure compliance with local employment law with regard to taxes and social benefits rec 01 18 the bureau stated that ocm has already started the demarches to clarify this issue in addition the tor of mission from headquarters wi ll review this issue b other programme issues inadequate planning and budgetary procedures 19 for the period covered by the audit the r ate of implementation of the projects was generally low especially for the repatriation proj ect where expenditures corresponded to 10 per cent and 40 per cent of the budgets for 2003 and 20 04 respectively for care and maintenance the expenditures for 2004 represented only 65 per c ent of the initial budget which was explained by the former chief of mission by the closure of th somali compound in september 20 the budget for financial assistance of sub project 05ablbycm200 was established for 225 persons but only about 135 persons were ass isted the former chief of mission explained that the budget was established on the basis of n eeds assessment however the partner did not have the capacity to fully implement it oios is concerned that budget and subproject objectives were established without due considerati on of the capacity of the partner and its implementation constraints oios sees this practice corresponding to builtin contingency reserve in the budget oios believes that if more realistic budget is requested for the care and maintenance projects more funds would be available to cover durable solution activities for refugees 5 21 the support and resources provided to alw afa from unhcr was not sufficient to ensure the smooth implementation of the project wh ile alwafa was responsible for providing wide range of services it had to operate from si ngleroom office moreover sufficient office equipment was not provided nor was project vehicl which was necessary to make visits to beneficiaries and hence perform its tasks effective ly the chief of mission highlighted the fact that the unhcr beneficiaries needed more assistance in regard to durable solutions based on the chief of missions discussions with various emb assies people of concern to unhcr in libya expected more support from unhcr which unhcr cannot provide due to the current lack of resources contrary to this the bureau sta ted that the low level of implementation correlated to the level of request of assistance by refugees and not so much on the managerial capacitywill of unhcr staff recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission in libya w ith assistance from the bureau for caswaname should imp rove the effectiveness of the operation in libya with empha sis on durable solutions either by further capacity building of p artners training of staff or an increase in resources to ensure that an adequate level of assistance is provided to unhcrs beneficiaries re c 02 22 the bureau is considering mission by the senior d esk officer to determine the changes required in the budgets building the capacity of t he partners andor increasing the level of assistance as well as tapping possible sources for additional resources for the project however within unhcrs present economic constraint s the resources available both for programme implementation and creation of any additi onal posts are limited in this context the auditors recommendation would be difficult to impl ement oios appreciates the present financial constraints nonetheless considerable effo rts are required to ensure the operation in libya becomes more effective in achieving at least to an acceptable level unhcrs objectives b relationship with implementing partners 23 the relationship with unhcrs implementing partners was unclear as oios noted that their responsibilities changed on an annual basis until 2003 unhcrs partnership with wafa was under the care and maintenance project in 2004 these responsibilities were transferred to lssc and in 2005 they were reverted back to alwafa despite the administrative changes the staff members of the subproject team remained the same since 2003 irrespective of the name of the partner even though they were different legal entities the decision for change and the subsequent reasons were not documented moreover prior to signing the first subproject agreement with lssc it was n ot evident that efforts had been made by ocm to ensure it had the required capacity to imple ment subproject in oios view the selection of partners was not transparent and shoul d have been better documented ocm did not comment on oios concerns with regard to the unclear relationship with its partners c lack of understanding of budgetary and prog ramme management procedures 24 ocm in managing project 05ablbyrp370 f or the repatriation of 30 persons made chain of errors and applied number of inconsisten t steps which in oios view was due to the lack of understanding of unhcr budgetary procedures in february 2005 subproject agreement was signed with alwafa allocating to the partner an amount of us 39000 6 provision for this had been made in the loi becaus of this the instalment was incorrectly charged to subproject established for activities to be directly implemented by unhcr ocm did not immediately inform the desk on the realloca tion made nor did it later on when the bureau issued draft amendment to the loi for the transfer of these funds to another project subsequently ocm requested alwafa to convert to l ibyan dinars the amount received in us dollars and to consider it as an instalment for sub project 05ablbycm200 given that such practice is not compatible with foas oios rec ommended that with the assistance of the desk adjustments be made to fobs and foas data ocm stated that this was discussed with the desk for action d closure of the somali compound 25 several weaknesses were noted in the closu re of the somali compound that was done by the fieldprogramme assistant in september 2004 s part of the closure procedures cash payments were provided to individuals and their fam ilies to leave the compound oios was concerned as to the validity of the payments made as there was insufficient evidence that they were made to genuine unhcr beneficiaries the weakn esses observed mainly related to lack of internal controls over the distribution of cash payments and its subsequent reporting for example there was lack of segregation of duties inadequate authorization and approval procedures poor documentation of transactions and an absence of proper supervision 26 total of ld 47500 us 36500 was paid to beneficiaries and this amount was not provided for in the loi the beneficiary list was prepared by ocm but it remained unclear by whom or on what basis during the distribution th initial list was modified without evidence of this being approved contrary to normal practices i n unhcr libya the approval of the assistance advisory committee was not sought ocm c ould not explain why many beneficiaries were listed has having received payment and why some payments were made to persons to whom the status of refugee was denied by unhcr and refugee file existed 27 the lump sum payments of assistance to res idents of the compound were recorded as paid by the partner lssc but these were made direc tly by unhcr the identity of the persons responsible for making the payments to the benefici aries was unknown they did not sign the distribution list highlighting significant inter nal control weakness 28 the former chief of mission who was absen t at the time of the closure was not aware of the circumstances surrounding the establishment of the list of beneficiaries and the distribution of cash he did not supervise the acti vity nor had he reviewed the adequacy of the procedures that were followed on return to the offi ce few days later he addressed memorandum to the desk on 26 september 2004 referri ng to the smooth closure of the compound mentioning that complete report would be issued this was not done in response to oios audit recommendation ocm only referred to the statement made by the programme assistant during the audit mission and addition information was provided oios still considers the comments made by the programme assist ant as incomplete confusing and even contradictory in oios opinion considering the s eriousness of the audit findings and that assurance cannot be obtained that unhcr funds were appropriately used and paid to targeted beneficiaries the former chief of mission should s indicated in his memorandum to the desk properly report on this issue 7 recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for caswaname should request that the former chief of mission who was ultimately respons ible and hence accountable for the supervision of the closure of t he somali compound and the criteria established in the select ion of beneficiaries paid cash allowance properly repor t on the procedures taken and provide the necessary supporti ng documentation to evidence that only eligible person s received payment rec 03 29 the former chief of mission submitted an extensive reply providing detailed background information on the compound itself and describing t he procedures followed for its closure oios takes note of the information received but wo uld like to highlight that the former chief of missions comments although consistent with that p rovided by the unhcr programme assistant do not include the expected documentary evidence that there was adequate supervision over the activities undertaken in oios opinion c onsidering the former chief of missions absence during the process it is his responsibilit to verify posteriori compliance with the existing rules and procedures and ensure that only genuine unhcr beneficiaries were assisted oios considers that the former chief of mission has not provided adequate evidence that project objectives were achieved and only genuine beneficia ries received assistance inadequacy of financial monitoring 30 although the spmrs submitted by the partne rs were approved by the fieldprogramme assistant there was record of the financial mon itoring performed there was documentation of monitoring visits of the partners books of account and formal recommendations were made to improve their activiti oios acknowledges that there was regular almost daily exchange of information betw een unhcr and the partners nonetheless there was systematic review of the partners acc ounting and project records for instance the first review of the ministry of healths moh reco rds was five months after the end of the partnership in letter addressed to the moh unh cr expressed doubts on the validity of assistance provided to beneficiaries and the charge s made to unhcr despite this unhcr approved the spmr with the mention comment oi recommended that ocm establish procedures for the financial monitoring of its part ners ocm stated that the programme assistant was instructed to carry out regular verif ication and monitoring of partners records and note for the file would be prepared to better document the exercise f statistics on refugees and asylum seekers 31 the registration system ricss was only im plemented in libya at the beginning of 2003 the opening figures of 11500 were taken from an xcel spreadsheet that was previously used for compiling the statistics at the time of the tr ansfer of data to ricss the figures were not verified and the distinction between active and nactive refugees was not made in addition as there were not refugee files for all 11500 ics it is likely that double recording occurred 32 since the beginning of 2005 although the data was in the system ocm was not able to generate any reports as there was staff members properly trained on the system the responsible for ricss was discontinued at the end f 2004 leaving the office without the necessary expertise oios recommended that ocm upda the refugee and asylum seekers 8 statistics ocm stated that with the assistance of headquarters progres has been installed and all refugee data has been migrated to the new syste m unv has been recruited to undertake assignments related to data entry and statistics cm has started verification exercise to determine the active registered caseload and subseq uently update records ocm is hopefully that by the end of 2006 they will be able to repor t reliable figure of the refugee population g audit certification 33 for the selection of an audit firm for 200 4 bidding process did not take place because according to the senior administrative assistant th number of qualified audit firms in tripoli was too low to make the process effective the sele cted firm therefore was the one suggested by undp oios recommended that ocm properly document the jus tification of the selection of the audit firm and that an adequate briefing be gi ven to the selected auditors regarding unhcrs rules and policies since weaknesses were ob served in this regard ocm reconfirmed that they were having some difficulties competitive ly selecting an audit firm due to the limited number based in tripoli for 2006 ocm have sent tters to some new firms seeking offers but so far replies have been received ocm will co ntinue to chase the matter prior briefing will be provided to the audit firm selected c supply management procurement procedures 34 oios assessed that the procurement procedu res in place were weak and focal point had been designated oios found that register of commercial contracts was not maintained and all relevant documents in the procurement cycle wer not found on file although some information was available it did not provide suffi cient evidence that three offers had been received when required according to the senior adm inistrative assistant three offers were usually obtained but only the offer received from the successful bidder was kept on file 35 with regard to the activities related to t he repatriation of refugees the purchase of flight tickets was increasing considerably oios noted th at only one travel agency was generally used in its selection there was evidence that compa rison of prices and services offered was made oios recommended that ocm modify its practices to dhere to unhcr rules and procedures for procurement ocm stated that the senior administration assistan t was designated as focal point for procurement an improved documentation s ystem has been established where the required three bids are recorded and filed with r egard to the travel agencies two companies have been selected and approved by the local cts committee the selection will be reviewed in six months for the sake of transparency and in an attempt to obtain better pricesoffers b use of service providers 36 ocm used service provider for security s ervices and to procure supplies and administrative services in instances where the supp lier requested to be paid in advance or in cash documentation could be provided to oios t hat the cost of services invoiced by the service provider corresponded to the lowest market price available in addition the service provider charged an administrative fee of 13 per ce nt 15 per cent in 2004 for each transaction there was also evidence that the service provide rs were selected competitively ocm indicated that with the present opening in the econ omy the situation has slightly improved 9 oios suggests therefore that the need for such serv ices should be reduced c asset management 37 at the time of the audit most of unhcr as sets in tripoli were fully depreciated especially the computer equipment to be functional and more effective most of the equipment needed to be replaced including photocopiers offic furniture and light vehicles in view of the implementation of msrp the need for new computers and communication facilities was of particular importance oios recommended that the bu dget for 2006 be revised accordingly 38 assettrak had not been updated since the nd of 2004 mainly as the contract of national unv responsible for it was terminated mor eover although lamb was established in 2002 and meetings were occasionally held the st minutes available were dated october 2003 oios noted that lamb approval was not sought in some cases namely for the transfer of ownership of unhcr assets on the closure of the som ali compound in this case the fieldprogramme assistant signed the agreement for the transfer of ownership instead of the chief of mission 39 medical furniture and equipment handed ove r to unhcr by the moh at the end of the partnership in may 2005 were still stored in unhcr premises waiting for distribution to clinic providing services to refugees oios recommended that once approved by the appropri ate asset management board ocm transfer its ownership to c linic or hospital providing services to unhcr beneficiaries 40 ocm stated that computers have been purchased and s ome office equipment has been replaced the assets inventory has been updated lamb meeti ng was convened and relevant measures have been taken with regard to old equipme nt and the transfer of ownership to ngos and clinics d security and safety 41 after several security incidents the gover nment was requested to provide round the clock service of armed security guards at the office of t he chief of mission mission by regional security officer was carried out in april 2005 the mission report recognized that unhcr is more at risk than most of the other age ncies working in libya and it indicated that the office was not moss compliant equipment n eeded to be purchased including generator smoke detectors fire extinguishers and cctv camera and recorder as well as shatter resistant films for the windows apart from the installation of the cctv camera and recorder none of the recommendations for the new eq uipment and the enhancement of security measures have been implemented the ocm indicated that the need for equipment to sure moss compliance had been communicated to headquarte rs on several occasions the chief of mission also indicated he has sought security advic from headquarters on various issues such as training for staff vhf communication and securi ty measures over the area assigned for interviews the bureau stated that the budget for security arra ngements has been planned for 2007 considering the move of the office to new pre mises within few months time administration 42 in the areas of administration and finance the office of the chief of mission generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating 10 effectively during the period under review financial management 43 our review of ocms financial records reve aled several financial management deficiencies in addition to recurrent coding and other accounting technical errors the verification of price and performance was not alway s adequate and properly documented and was often carried out by nonunhcr staff the defi ciencies identified was due to combination of factors such as the lack of training given to the newly appointed senior administrative assistant weaknesses by the approvi ng officer function and insufficient monitoring by the division of finance and supply ma nagement and the bureau ocm reiterated the need to have proper training on finance admini stration and human resources issues for the newly appointed administrative assistant 44 ocm has been working independently from dp since 2002 as result the chief of mission has both certifying and approving functions as the only international staff member in the office oios noted that payments to the chief of ssion were certified and approved by him oios would like to highlight that such practice i s not in accordance with the unhcr rules and instructions and constitutes serious weakness in internal controls in this case approval from the desk at headquarters should be sought moreover contrary to unhcr instructions on the delegation of signing authority there was monit oring performed by another office or by headquarters ocm was expecting advice from the bureau on these issues the chief of mission suggested that as temporary measure pending the arrival of the assigned protection officer the finance assistant perform certifying functions information was provided as to whether frs had been requested to sanction this it is the responsibility of the chief of mission to initiate such request and to seek the support of the desk b cash management 45 petty cash is currently in libyan dinars w ith ceiling of ld 200 us 150 to facilitate the financial operations and reduce the number of t ransactions made through the service provider and simplify the payment of grants paid to repatria tes oios recommended that the ceiling of the petty cash in dinars be increased and petty cash in us dollars be authorized according to the reply received it seems that the chief of mission has not yet submitted the relevant request to frs c human resources management 46 the decision to terminate the contracts of four national unvs at the end of 2004 was not justified by budgetary constraints and in oios vie w was taken without appropriate measures to ensure the smooth continuation of their assigned re sponsibilities this decision had negative impact on many aspects of the operation since the r ecruitment of two new national unv only took place in august and september 2005 47 training of staff was required for all sec tors of activities including administration finance programme protection and language oios suggested that this could be done through workshops andor onthejob training during the t raining special attention should be given to the filing of documents which was significant pr oblem in the office 11 recommendation head2right the unhcr office of the chief of mission in libya in conjunction with the bureau for caswaname should nsure that unhcr staff members in libya are conversant wi th unhcrs basic rules and procedures adequate traini ng and assistance should be provided rec 04 d communication costs 48 there were currently only two lines for l types of communications telephone fax internet etc the office did not have access to unhcr intranet and only one of the computers has the possibility of internet connection ocm indicated that action has been taken to provid the office with digital line and 256 internet spe ed connectivity shortly after oios mission which was necessary for msrp implementation rental of premises 49 the current office premises did not adequa tely accommodate all staff the office space was not convenient not well maintained and the lig hting was inadequate in addition the area for the interviews with asylum seekers and refugees was not acceptable ocm stated that after the audit the landlord requested an increase in rent f about 100 per cent which was unjustified following consultations with headquarters decisi on has been taken to move to other premises at the end of the current lease in july 2006 resou rces are required however to implement this which are not available under the current financial
