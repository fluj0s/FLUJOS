secretary clintons february 5 2009 expanded meeting with french foreign minister bernard kouchner classified by eur assistant secretary marcie ries acting for reasons 14 d 1 s summary secretary clinton and french foreign minister bernard kouchner met on february 5 for 30 minutes in their first bilateral meeting the warm and open exchange followed oneonone working lunch and preceded 20minute press conference the two agreed to coordinate closely on wide range of issues including the middle east afghanistan iran russia the balkans gtmo detainees and africa especially darfur on afghanistan kouchner emphasized the need for greater afghanization and international access to everyday afghan people and asked for us support to hold second neighbors conference to follow up on the initial december 14 2008 event on gtmo the fm indicated europe would help on casebycase basis and asked the us for assistance with 15year old canadian national omar khadr the fm asked for reaction to its transatlantic paper passed to the us during frances 2008 eu presidency as the meeting closed the secretary joked that the fm was not even in her league concerning criticism when the fm mentioned new book critical of him that might spark press questions end summary middle east 2 c the secretary opened the meeting by welcoming fm kouchner and expressing appreciation for french leadership on broad agenda of cooperation which she said president obama hoped to deepen kouchner congratulated the secretary and said he looked forward to the pleasure of working together on first name basis the two then summarized topics discussed in their oneonone meeting beginning with the middle east 3 s the secretary said she understood that the issue of the middle east was of grave concern to france she expressed appreciation for french leadership on interdicting weapons into gaza and with the copenhagen process she thanked president sarkozy for his ideas and for french work in providing assistance to the people of gaza fm kouchner said that he had met with palestinian authority pa pm abu mazen three days prior and found him completely isolated there was game being played among arabs most of whom egyptians excepted did not care he said abbas is lost you tried we tried but nothing has happened the key he said was to figure out how to build up abu mazen in government of national unity salam fayyad was fantastic pm who had ideas about how to open the gaza crossing specifically tax paid by group of people who would be acceptable to both sides just to get the crossing operating it was especially important he continued to offer the palestinian people sign that the crossing was open because of abu mazens involvement he had to be seen as leader he said it would take weeks and noted that hamas does not want to talk to mazen still it was important to help convince the israelis to open the crossing kouchner cautioned that it would be difficult to get anything done ahead of the israeli election on february 10 4 s the secretary concurred that the situation was difficult she added that confidence building measures were needed so that the israelis would feel committed it was important to persuade the new israeli government to participate in the peace effort and be convinced that they could work with the pa if abu mazens government of national unity is to work israel needs to understand that it should work with him and that this development could help she was encouraged by the actions that the egyptians had taken against the tunnels she said there was much to coordinate and supported the role of the quartet but agreed that little could happen in advance of the israeli elections she noted that the us was conducting review based on mitchells work afghanistan 5 s the secretary said that the us was working on comprehensive strategy and thanked the fm for frances contributions and cooperation kouchner noted that france had increased its troops to 3000 from 3300 he said there was progress in several areas including civil society but presented mixed picture overall he returned several times to problems with access to the population and suggested that this was the key he also promoted afghanization saying it was important for the people to take their own problems into their own hands he expressed pride in the french hospital in kabul as an example of what was possible noting that afghan patients were being treated by afghan doctors and even the taliban presented themselves for treatment he said that kabul is not afghanistan but that kabul works because it has been afghanized the rest of the country needs the same but it will take years he was also concerned about growing iranian influence noting that huge shia mosque had recently been built with iranian funds 6 c fm kouchner asked for the secretarys support for followup event to the december 14 2008 afghanistan neighbors conference that kouchner hosted in paris the fm said the meeting had been very interesting despite the iranians not showing at the last minute and should be repeated if the us agreed kouchner put the conference in the context of broader approach stressing there is military solution in afghanistan 7 c the secretary took note of the proposal but made commitment on followup conference she said the us believed that there had been some success with building the army but more problems with the police both commented on the strength of the new minister of interior the secretary said that the minister of the interior was an interesting person but that it might be necessary to deal with some of the more radical people whether we wanted to or not on reconciliation kouchner said that there were some very bad people involved but they were nationals of afghanistan and it was important to start negotiations including the negotiations in saudi arabia finally on the presidency kouchner said karzai is somebody we have to talk to him but there may be other candidates he said anwarulhaq ahadi was such person but while interesting he probably couldnt win against karzai the secretary noted that richard holbrooke would travel to the region guantanamo 8 c the secretary expressed appreciation for french leadership within the eu on this issue she said she was proud of president obamas commitment to close the facility calling it cancer the us wanted to take care of but would take time she said this was complicated so we were asking friends and allies to consider taking some detainees fm kouchner said the eu 27 had not yet reached consensus but that they accepted the idea but would consider detainees on casebycase basis europeans do not want to create legal problems for themselves they were working with three categories of individuals first were the best cases second were those who had made individual requests for resettlement in specific countries and third without legal problems there were many outstanding questions such as whether they had refugee status but because of the schengen visa requirements it was necessary for the eu to address this together at the end of this discussion the fm handed the secretary paper concerning omar khadr 15year old muslim of canadian origin the secretary agreed to review the case iran 9 snf the secretary opened the discussion by alluding to the private conversation with fm kouchner and their agreement that it was important to prevent further development of irans nuclear capabilities and its missile program irans recent space launch complicated this effort noting that the iranians had respected none of the internationally recognized requirements for space launches specified in security council resolutions the fm said he welcomed the us willingness to consider direct talks between the us and iran he said that the iranians were waiting for the us the launch had surprised the russians of whom he said they are more affected than we being 2000 kilometers closer he added that the sanctions seemed to be having some effect on the domestic population but he ended by repeating the need for quartet meeting he said that it was important for any approach to be done together with the germans and the russians particularly since the russians are closer to iran and could be more easily targeted kouchner suggested not including the chinese because the chinese are absolutely not useful in this process the secretary said it was important to follow up possibly with uk foreign secretary david miliband on the margins of the g20 summit in london russiageorgiaenergy 10 c fm kouchner told the secretary that france had been surprised by the georgian invasion we did stop it but we didnt solve it he continued that the south ossetians and abkhaz are sort of independent people but he worried that there is humanitarian access to the population he said that georgian pm saakashvili had been badly inspired he fell into the trap but the fm said the geneva process should continue though it might take months or years on energy he said the eu had been united but then poland romania and others had been completely cut off and that both russia and ukraine had been absolutely awful he said group of europeans were trying to secure pipeline from one country to the other but he cautioned that the us position on missile defense was also factor he complimented medvedev as normal guy at least better than putin and credited him with what he believed to be the sound decision not to put iskander missiles in kalinigrad he said things were now more complicated with the iranian space launch on the whole things were frozen which was not bad as place to be for the moment 11 c continuing on russia kouchner said that the main thing for the us and russia to begin to work together lets talk to them he said he said that the russians are rough rude and brutal but we should still engage them kouchner said russian fm lavrov was one of the most brutal but was among the cleverest fms in any case they were an important player and had to be included balkans 12 c fm kouchner said that bosnia remained problem but it was important to simply follow the road it was important to push the serbian government closer to the eu though he conceded this was difficult due to dutch and belgian objections to the failure of the serbs to hand over ratko mladic to icty presumably referring to eulex he said there was success on the ground in kosovo as the two sides were not killing each other and concluded that things were not in bad place for the moment darfur 13 c fm kouchner told the secretary he thought the international criminal court icc would soon issue an arrest warrant against sudanese president omar bashir he complimented the qataris for playing useful role with their work in doha he said they were working with both sides including the islamists he said it had taken two years to build toward success eufor contingent of 17 nations deployed in eastern chad and northern central african republic was success and he expected resolution before march 15 when eufor will hand over its responsibilities to the minurcat ii on the humanitarian front he estimated that half of the displaced persons in eastern chad mainly women would begin coming home in darfur by march 15 book and transatlantic paper 14 sbu as the meeting ended the secretary said there was lot to digest and do it would require cooperation on lighter note fm kouchner said that waiting journalists might raise the issue of the world according to k the expose published yesterday accusing him of enriching himself as consultant in africa tarnishing his humanitarian image the secretary dismissed the book saying one book i have 25 youre not even in my league he said that the first one hurts little more than the others the fm asked the secretary for us reaction to the transatlantic paper passed to the us during the french presidency the secretary said she would review the issue and respond note eur passed the paper to s staff on 2509 and is preparing response to the fm end note 15 u participants in the bilateral united states the secretary sca as richard boucher eur pdas marcie ries nea das
