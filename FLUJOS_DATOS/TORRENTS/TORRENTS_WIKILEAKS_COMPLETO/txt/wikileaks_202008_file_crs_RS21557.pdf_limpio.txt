current outbreak was caused by an act of terrorism2 this report describes previous human outbreaks symptoms and treatments of monkeypox the government response to the current outbreak and implications this outbreak may have in evaluating the public health system response to biological terrorism what is monkeypox monkeypoxs causative agent is an orthopox virus in the poxviridae family in the wild rodents predominantly squirrels in centr and western africa are the reservoir for this virus monkeypox is zoonotic diseas meaning that humans can catch the disease from infected animals human monkeypox outbreaks occur infrequently and generally in rural african rainforest villages th largest recent confirmed outbreak occurred in the democratic republic of congo in 19961997 with 88 cases over 12month period3 between january 2000 and march 2002 22 cases of monkeypox worldwide were reported to the world health organization4 monkeypox is not native to north america and has not previously been diagnosed in the united states human monkeypox symptoms are similar to those of smallpox initial symptoms include fever aches and malaise unlik smallpox monkeypox often causes swollen lymph nodes these symptoms are followed by rash which converts into blisters an incubation period of up to 2 weeks is possible and symptoms may last for 2 to 4 weeks5 there is known proven cure for monk eypox monkeypox victims are treated with supportive care there are indications that some antivirals namely cidofovir and ribavirin may be effective cidofovir has been recommended for treating monkeypox during this outbreak but only in lifethreatenin g cases due to its significant side effects6 because monkeypox is closely related to smallpox the sma llpox vaccine vaccinia is an effective prophylactic v accination with vaccinia is estima ted to provide greater than 85 protection against monkeypox7 vaccinia may reduce the severity of monkeypox infection if the victim is vaccinated few

small pox studies of african outbreaks suggest that 815 of those in household settings with victim may become infected8 transmission experiments indicate that it is possible to infect ot hers via aerosol for example through coughing or sneezing9 the human fatality rate for monkeypox is lower than that for smallpox in documented cases in africa the fatality rate has ranged from 1 to 10 in unvaccinated individuals the comparable fatality rate for smallpox is approximately 3010 the fatality rate in the united states may be lower than that observed in africa because of be tter nutrition and healthcare access11 current monkeypox outbreak the current monkeypox outbreak began in may 2003 with the onset of illnesses in wisconsin all cases to date have involved contact between an infected animal and the victim the cdc investigation suggests th at monkeypox entered the united states via import of infected african rodents for use as exotic pets these rodents apparently infected nearby captive prairie dogs in pet store the infected prairie dogs were distributed and sold over three states there are not any repor ts of wild animals in the united states becoming infected with monke ypox although this remains risk the cdc recommends that doctors follow standard protocol when diagnosing disease with acute generalized rash in order to rule out smallpox12 if smallpox remains possibility physicians should alert their local and state health depa rtments the health departments working with the laboratory response network can fu rther test specimens taken from suspected cases the health departments may then notify the cdc which will begin an investigation and ma help test the samples in the may outbreak physicians reportedly ruled out smallpox at an early stage because of the apparent link of the cases to ill animals13 this assumption reportedly led to 13day delay before the local or state health departments were notified14 identification of the disease as monkeypox was announced by the cdc on june 7 2003 followi ng preliminary serologic testing and dna analysis15 suspected cases of monkeypox continue to be investigate d while personto person transmission of the

response to the outbreak several states have banned the im portation display and sale of prairie dogs some state and cal governments have quarantined animals or seized and destroyed them16 other state efforts have fo cused on identifying those who have been exposed to the infected animals monitoring those who provide care for ill persons alerting physicians to look for spected monkeypox cases and

suggests that states may also choose to prohib it the importation display and sale of other species that may carry monkeypox such as rabbits gerbils or hamsters the cdc has issued guidelines for treatme nt and isolation of suspected monkeypox cases19 and guidelines for the use of smallpox vaccine to protect against monkeypox20 smallpox vaccine is recommended for people who have had close contact with monkeypox case household contacts of monkeypox cases and those who may have handled sick prairie dogs are also advised to be vaccinated vaccination is recommended for health care workers who are caring for known or suspected monkeypox cases or will be in the near future all vaccinations s hould be done within 4 days of initial direct contact though it may be considered for anyo ne with exposure within the previous 2 weeks the cdc have recommended vaccini immune globulin vig and cidofovir to counteract some of the serious si effects of the smallpox vaccine21 policy issues

june 12 2003 27 steve mitchell monkeypox shows gap bioterrorism preparedness is not possible cer tain aspects of public health response are similar whether disease outbreak occurs naturally or through an intentional act an effective public health respons includes performing appropr iate laborator tests using protocols established through the laborat ory response network to rule out andor identify the pathogenic agent timely accura reporting to appr opriate public health officials rapidly disseminat ing accurate and consistent information to public health officials health care providers the media and the public using epidemiologic information to determine and control potential transmission vectors and assuring appropriate medical care by ra pidly providing guidelines for treatment and diagnosis public health experts have favorably compared the public health system response to both sars and monkeypox to the confused public health reaction during the anthrax attacks22 however some have claimed that there may still be areas for improvement as gaps and weaknesses remain in some stat and local public health communication and surveillance capabilities23 development of systema tic method for using disease outbreak response to evaluate public health system preparedness could assist in identifying areas for improvement in the system and metric for measuring improvement many federal agencies regulate animal import the regulatory situation that allows importation of diseased animals is similar to that allowing importation of invasive species24 since many diseases are zoonotic illanimal importation ma have bioterror implications such imports might be used in an agroterrorism attack by using lightly regulated animal to introduce disease for different animal causing economic harm another possibility might be intentionally importing and releasing ill animals to increase the number of naturally occurring fatal dis eases in humans the monkeypox outbreak is likely to increase scrutiny of these regulations and may result in ne w legislative proposals to modify them the cdc reportedly expressed concern over the delay between the occurrence of the initial case and notification of the agency25 however in other statements the cdc has praised the response of state officials26 critics state that the delay between presentation and public health response suggests the notification system needs improvement27 they assert that comparable delay in the case of smallpox would lead to sizeable epidemic furthermore simply identifying the disease as monkeypox might not rule

natural origin following cdc notification and epidemio logical investigation the di scovery of infected rodent imports from an area known to have endemic monkeypox strongly supports natural outbreak some observers have defende d the delay as reasonable since smallpox was ruled out quickly because it cannot infect animals nd there was an apparent link between the human cases and diseased animals on the other hand many of the diseases that have been the targets of weapons programs in th past are transferable from animal to man such as plague tula remia and hantavirus29 it is conceivable that terrorist group with access to these agents but lacking advanced dissemination technology would choose to use animal vectors documented case is th japanese use of fleas to cause plague outbreaks in china in the 1930s30 some critics suggest that since such links do not preclude bioterrorism even t healthcare providers should err towards potential over reporting31 whether the current monkeypox outbreak sts the nations bioterror preparedness is an open question some claim that the early classification of this outbreak as not related to bioterrorism means that this is not true test of the nations bioterrorism response plans since this is public hea lth concern the department of health and human services is the lead agency for fede ral response unlike in terror event where the department of ho meland security would assume responsibility others claim that an outbreak of new disease matter the vect or magnitude or source should be treated as potential bioterror event until proven otherwise and they suggest need for more rapid and coordinated response32 congress may consider wh ether to further address when and how the federal biote rror response should be engaged
