foreign affairs defense and trade division summary congress requires the exportimport ba nk and other us agencies whose programs have the potential for adversely ffecting the environment abroad to develop and follow an established set of guidelines to mitigate the environmental impact of its programs the banks current procedures and guidelines as revised on april 2 1998 were extended on june 26 2003 and will remain in effect until march 31 2004 these guidelines apply to all longterm transacti ons and project finan ce cases valued over 10 million with repayment period of more than seven years and that have potentially adverse environmental effect s short and medium tr ansactions under 10 million with repayment period of less than seven years are reviewed on casebycase basis the bank estimates that in 2002 its programs supported 800 million in us exports of environmentally beneficial us goods nd services this re port will be updated as warranted by events background the exportimport bank eximbank is an independent us government agency that is charged with financing and promotin g exports of us goods and services to accomplish these goals eximbank uses its au thority and resources to assume commercial and political risks that exporters or private financial institutions are unwilling or unable to undertake alone overcome maturity and other limitations in private sector export financing assist us exporters to meet foreign officially sponsored export credit competition and provide guidance and advice to us exporters and commercial banks and foreign borrowers with budget of around 600 million the bank finances about 1 of us exports year eximbank provi des guarantees and insurance to commercial banks to make trade credits available to us exporters the bank operates under renewable charter the exportimport ba nk act of 1945 as amended and has been authorized through september 30 2006 congress has amended the banks statutes athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21588crs2 1 see crs report rl32007 exportimport bank financing requirements and restrictions by james k jackson 2 ibid 3 12 usc sec 635b1bvarious times to restrict eximbanks ability to approve transactions with firms involved in certain specified activities1 eximbank has three main programs it uses to finance us exports direct loans export credit guarantees and export credit insurance eximbanks direct lending program is used primarily to aid us exporters in instances where they face foreign competitor that is receiving officially subsidized financing by foreign government these loans carry fixed interest rates and generally are made at terms that are the most attractive allowed under the provisions of international agreements they are made primarily to counter attempts by foreign governments to sway purchases in favor of their exporters solely on the basis of subsidized financin g rather than on market conditions price quality etc and to enforce internationally agreed upon terms and conditions for export financing guarantees and insurance are the main programs the bank uses to assist american exporters both programs reduce some of the risks involved in exporting by insuring against commercial or political uncertainty eximbanks environmental mandate when congress established the bank in 1947 it directed the bank to aid in financing and to facilitate exports and imports and the exchange of commodities and services and to assist sm all businesses over the ears congress has added various requirements that restrict the banks actions congress has restricted the banks ability to deny applications for credit for nonfinan cial or noncommercial factors except under number of special conditions these conditions are determined by the president of the united states after consulting with the house banking and financial services committee now committee on financial services and the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs and must be determined to be in the national interest of the united states in such areas as international rrorism nuclear prolif eration environmental protection and human rights including child labor2 in addition congress has adopted various measures that require the exportimport bank and other government agencies whos operations have an effect beyond us borders to consider the impact their pr ograms may have on the environment of developing countries for instance the bank is subject to executive order 12144 44fr 1957 entitled environmenta l effects abroad of majo r federal actions this executive order requires federal agencies that take actions that are subject to the order to implement procedures that are consistent with the order in 1979 through executive order 12166 oct 19 1979 44 fr 60971 and pl 95630 congress granted the bank the authority to deny an application for credit where such action could clearly and importantly advance united states policy in such areas as international terrorism nuclear proliferation envir onmental protection and human rights3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21588crs3 4 12 usc sec 635i5a1 5 12 usc sec 635i5a1ac 6 12 usc sec 635i5a2 7 the banks web address is httpwwweximgovproductspoliciesnoticeindexhtmlin 1992 through pl 102429 12 usc sec 635i5 congress required the bank to establish procedures to take into acc ount the potential beneficial and adverse environmental effects of goods and services for which suppor t is requested under its direct lending and guarantee programs4 these procedures apply to any transaction considered by the bank for longterm support of 10 million or more or for which the banks support is critical and which may have significant envir onmental effects upon the global commons or any country not pa rticipating in the project5 in addition congress directed that the banks environmental standards c ould be used as basis for withholding financing from project for environmenta l reasons or to approve financing after considering the potential envir onmental effects of project6 eximbanks environmental procedures in order to fulfill its congressional mandate to establish environmental procedures the bank adopted set of guidelines for ev aluating the environmental impact of proposed projects and has encouraged ot her national export credit agen cies to adopt similar set of policies eximbanks nvironmental procedures and guidelines were issued on february 1 1995 following the implementation of interim procedur in october 1993 the banks procedures and guidelines we re revised on april 2 1996 and on april 2 1998 following review of their effectiveness in mitigating adverse environmental effects of eximbank supported projects and their effect on the competitiveness of us exporters the procedures and guidelines as revi sed on april 2 1998 were extended on june 26 2003 and will remain in ffect until march 31 2004 eximbanks environmental pro cedures apply to all longterm transactions and project finance cases valued over 10 million with re payment period of more than seven years and that have potentially adve rse environmental effects short and medium transactions under 10 million with repayment period of less than seven years are not reviewed unless the banks engineering and environment division believes that such transaction has the potential for causing significant adverse environmental effect when the bank is conducting an environmental review on longterm transactions or on project finance cases it solicits information from other government agencies and also from non government sources by posting the propos ed transaction on the banks web site7 each longterm transaction or project finance case is required to complete an environmental screening document that is reviewed by the banks engineering and environment division after reviewing the environmental screening document the division places each project into one of four categories n b or c httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21588crs4 8 the bank has developed separate set of proce dures for projects that fall within this category titled nuclear procedures and guidelines to ensure that the nuclear projects exim bank supports are environmentally responsible and that the projects include reasonable measures and provisions to address the public health and safety projects are classified according to the type of export specifications of the recipient nuclear facility and the function of the export in the operations of the facility the type and scope of information the bank requires from an applicant is related to how project is classified after review by the bank each project is given second classification after receiving n classification from to 9 such areas include primary forests tropical forests nationally designated wetlands protected wild lands national parks nationallydesignate d refuges coral reefs or mangrove swamps nationallydesignated seashore areas habitat of endangered species properties on the world heritage list areas reserved for ethnic minoritie s or indigenous peoples or areas in which the project will require largescale resettlement transactions generally included in this category are hydroelectric projects water resources manageme nt projects and project finance transactions 10 quantitative guidelines are numerical guidelines that are used to assess air emissions water quality and noise impacts these guidelines ar used to identify the acceptable concentrations of pollutants in air water and soil and to define noise levels 11 qualitative guidelines are used to assess proj ect in three areas 1 the management of solid hazardous and toxic materials and wastes 2 th ability of project to withstand the potential impact of natural hazards based on elements such seismic coefficients and other design features and 3 the potential impact on the projects ecolo gical context the socioeconomic impact and the impact on the sociocultural environment based on informed analysis of the results of social economic and scientific surveys investigations and projectionscategory n projects involve all transactions associated with nuclear power projects nuclear research nd related facilities and the production of nuclear fuel8 category projects are excluded from any further environmental screening because they are determined to have significant environmental issues category b projects are those that are determined to be constructed in or sufficiently near areas that they believe will have perceptible environmental effect9 category c projects are those that are not in cluded in any of the other three categories such projects are considered on casebycase basis in evaluating projects eximbank uses both quantitative10 or numerical guidelines and qualitative guidelines11 according to seven objectives air quality protecting air quality to degree that safeguards both human health and the environment water use and quality protecting surface and groundwater resources from excess demand and from proj ect related contaminationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21588crs5 waste management managing recycling and disposing of solid hazardous and toxic materials and wa stes in manner that safeguards human health and the environment natural hazards siting and design of pr oject to acceptable levels of natural ecological and economic risk ecology protecting ecological resources encouraging conservation and promoting practices that result in the reduction of greenhouse gases socioeconomic and sociocultural framework developing the project in order to avoid or to mitigate significant adverse impacts noise protecting sensitive receptors from unhealthy project related noise eximbank excludes from consideration for export credits exports of 48 different pesticides that are banned and six pesticides that are severely restricted by the environmental protection agency epa in addition eximbank excludes from consideration 30 industria l and consumer chemicals that ar banned or severely restricted by the epa the bank also provides envi ronmental guidelines for nine different categories which include ge neral industrial projects pul p and paper mills iron and steel mills mining and milling oil and gas development thermal gas turbine and engine power plants forest operations petroleum refineries and petrochemical facilities and hydro power and water resources management in each of the nine categories the bank provides specific numerical guidelines in the areas of air quality water quality solid and liquid nonhazardous wastes hazardous and toxic material s and wastes and noise iron and steel mills eximbank requires that projects such as iron and steel mills and mining and milling take additional environmental precautions be fore they are approved the bank requires steel mills to take extra environmental precau tions because such projects entail extensive air emissions and wastewater discharge issues similarly mining and milling operations face extensive environmental screening becau they involve the disposal of large amounts of nonore bearing materials and the dis posal of tailings and wastewater in such projects the bank requires the firms involved to provide an erosion and sediment control plan and mine reclamation plan to return the land to conditions capable of supporting the prior land uses and to eliminate sign ificant adverse effects on adjacent water resources oil and gas development exports of energyrelated g oods and services are major component of the banks activities and accounted for over 30 billion in us exports in 2002 or about onefourth of the banks total activities in the area of oil and gas development the bank places quantitative requirements on wi range of activities th bank places restrictions on air emissions and liquid emissions for both on and offshore oil and gas development and it requires that firms take extra precautions to reduce the risks of oil spills and to prepare contingency plans for such potential occurren ces for power plants which have oftenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21588crs6 12 the banks environmental exports program pr ovides enhanced levels of support for broad range of energyrelated exports in order to promote us exports of renewable energy and environmentally beneficial goods and services as well as to assist us exporters participating in foreign environmental projects this program provides shortterm environmental export insurance for multibuyer and singlebuyer insura nce coverage for small business environmental exporters and mediumterm export credit insurance and guarantees and loans for xports of capital goods and environmental services at the maximum allowable terms permissible under the guidelines adopted by the organization for economic cooperation and development and may also include the use of the banks tied aid resour ces to offset any offers of foreign concessionary financing for environmental projectsbeen an important part of the banks busin ess eximbank encourages projects that use renewable energy as the prime electricity producer and provides fi nancial support through its environmental exports program12 the bank also provides enhanced financial support for energy projects that produce electricity while emitting low levels of co2 this support also extends to coalfired and oil and gasfi red plants in order to encourage the reduction of greenhouse gases nd water emissions forestry operations forestry operations is another area in wh ich the bank has deve loped broad set of guidelines these guidelines are meant to minimize the destruction of forests and other vegetative cover soil stability siltation of waterways pressure on human and livestock population wildlife bird sanctu aries game refuges and on regional micro climate the bank does not extend its programs to cove r commercial logging in primary tropical forests and evaluates projects on their impact on ecologically critical boreal and temperate primary forest ecosystems in addition forest ry operations must be able to demonstrate that the project displays commitment to sustainable development and to the conservation of natura l resources projects also must demonstrate that they are not harming or diminishing habitats of threatened or endangered species and that they address the interest and livelihoods of indigenous nd other affected local populations projects are also required to develop forest manage ment plan to demonstrate safeguards for water resources and to minimize the development of new roads petroleum refineries petrochemical facilities and power plants the bank also places stringent requireme nts on projects that involve petroleum refineries and petrochemical facilities such facilities may have substantial environmental impact on air and water quality due to emissions and may so involve toxic materials projects are required to install monitors fo r gas emissions and to develop and implement contingency plans for petroleum spills projects must also submit to guidelines for pipelines and solid and hazardous wastes and for hazardous and toxic materials and wastes hydro power and water resource projects also are subject to guidelines to ensure water quality to preserve the ecology to mitigate the risks from natural hazards and to mitigate the impact on the regional socioeconomic and sociocultural environment the bank requires an environmental assessment for hydroelectric power projects that generate more than 10 megawatts of power and power projects that incorporate dam of 15 meters or more in height projects that entail th construction of dam also must provide feasibility study to assess natural hazards and risks and provide assurances that design features have been incorporated into the project to mitigate these risks
