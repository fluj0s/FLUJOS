from lb klyashtorin klyashtorinmtunetru to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re fw fw reconstruction etc date sat 23 nov 2002 000130 0300 dear keith do not be embarassed this situation is very humorous and i am very glad to smile it happens thank you very much for your time series i would like to analyse specta characteristics of summer temperatures your series and winter temperature series using dansgaards time series for the same period since 550s it seems to the temperature data of arctic basin is the most pronounced indices illustrating of long term climate oscillations best wishes leonid original message from 1keith briffa to 2lb klyashtorin sent monday november 18 2002 1101 pm subject re fw fw reconstruction etc i am very embarrassed as i have just realized i sent the data couple of weeks ago at least to the wrong person someone called leonid polyak by mistake he wanted polar urals data i now attach the file with the nature temperature reconstruction first number is the number of values then subsequent lines contain the date in the first column years ad and the anomalies in the second as described in the paper sorry keith at 1045 pm 111802 0300 you wrote dear keith i apologise for persistens but i really need in the time series i requested from you and i will very grateful to you for these materials which you so kind promised send to i hope receive it from you yet although i have not reply from you to my two last messages yours sincerely leonid klyashtorin original message from 3lb klyashtorin to 4keith briffa sent sunday october 27 2002 145 pm subject re fw reconstruction etc dear keith i apologize for disturbing you but i did not received the data you promised to send yet i would be very grateful to you for these time series using your kind permission from october 22 to remind you if these date do not arrive i hope to receive it from you sorry for inconveniences and thank you in advance leonid original message from 5keith briffa to 6lb klyashtorin sent tuesday october 22 2002 508 pm subject re fw reconstruction etc leonid sorry not to respond i will search out the treering series ring width and density and the numbers for the reconstruction and send them as soon as i can get to it remind in couple of days if they do not arrive cheers keith at 0217 pm 102202 0400 you wrote dear dr briffa unfortunately i did not receive reply on my first message sent to your address by october 8 i apologize for disturbing you again but i will be very grateful to you for sending the address of web site where i can find the data of tree ring reconstruction of the summer temperature i also very interested in receiving data published in one of your et old paper 1400 year tree ring record of summer temperature in fennoscandia1990 naturevol 346 2 august 1990 the time series of pinus silvestris published at fig 2 is very interesting for my work on the dynamics climatelinked fisheries of northern hemisphere i would be very grateful to you for your reply best regards leonid klyashtorin original message from 7lb klyashtorin to 8briffa keith r sent tuesday october 08 2002 458 pm subject fw reconstruction etc i am leonid klyashtorin from federal institute for fisheries and oceanography vniromoscowrussia the last 6 monthes i was national research council senior associate and worked as visiting scientist in the pacific fisheries environmental laboratory pfel noaa national marine fisheries service monterey ca on the item climate and fisheries my paper climate change and long term fluctuations of commercial catchesthe possibility of forecasting published recently as separate broshure fao fisheries technical paper 410 pp 86 2001 and is rather popular among fisheries specialists it gives insight of world major fisheries dynamics and contains forecast to the next 1020 years the abstract is attached pdf file of all paper also is available i have read of your and t osborn very interesting and so useful paper blowing hot asnd cold in science v2952002 your results clearly shows that main conception of ipcc experts about unicity of global warming events in 20century is erroneous and now the additional data appear on the natural long term cyclic climate change at least for the last 2000 years my work on the climate fisheries connected with questions of climate change and naturely touches of global warming problem and my colleague from institute of physics of the earth of russian academie of science recently submitted our paper on the coherence between dynamics of the world fuel consumption and global temperature anomaly in the international journal natrural hazards the paper is now under reviewing the abstract is attached now and few my collegues from us are in process of writiing book dedicated of climate fisheries problem and we would like use the data on the tree rings anlysis showing cyclic character of longterm climate changes i will be very grateful to you for receiving from you if possible the time series of annual reconstructed temperature anomaly from figure esper02 and address of website where these data are available thank you in advance best regards leonid
