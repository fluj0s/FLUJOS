from smith g geoff sg geoffsmithakzonobelchemicalscom to itrdbforlistservarizonaedu subject re itrdbfor joe bartons hockey stick hearing coming up date sat 15 jul 2006 103657 0800 replyto itrdb dendrochronology forum itrdbforlistservarizonaedu dr solomon it is not clear what makes the wegman committee report in your opinion new low in scientific study one part is clearly physical growth rates of trees ir absorption etc and separate part is the statistical treatment of the data dr wegmans report is clearly focused on the latter he is well qualified to analyze statistical methods as chair of the national academy of sciences nas committee on applied and theoretical statistics and board member of the american statistical association the conclusion of the committee headed by dr wegman is clear the statistical methods of mbh 9899 cannot be relied upon to support the claim that the 90s were the hottest decade of the past millennium if one wants to argue with dr wegmans conclusion it will be necessary to show how he has misunderstood or misrepresented the statistical methods used in those studies obviously this does not prove that the 90s were not the hottest decade of the past millennium only that the mbh 9899 analyses cannot be used to support that claim nothing more and nothing less anyone interested in paleoclimatology in general and dendrochronology in particular should read the recent nas report and the wegman committee report or in fact anyone interested in the use of statistics in climatology your last comment seems to reflect belief that it is scurrilous to question unquestioned science wouldnt there seem to be long honored history of exactly this type of action both before and after einstein or perhaps im misinterpreting your remarks geoff

re joe bartons hockey stick hearing coming up you also may want to look at new report prepared for barton by group of statisticians regarding the hockey stick this is going to be the focus of the hearing in order to advertise it it seems to to be new low in politics to have congressional report generated specifically to question unquestioned science allen m solomon phd national program leader

another hockey stick brawl lauren morello eenews pm reporter flawed statistics underlie the controversial hockey stick climate analysis according to report released today by an ad hoc panel of scientists assembled by the house energy and commerce committee the report contradicts recent national academy of sciences study that found the hockey stick analysis which concluded earth has been warmer over the last millennium than at any other point is largely correct published in 1998 by the journal nature the hockey stick reconstructs past global average temperatures using data from corals tree rings ice cores and bore holes deep within the earth the first to draw on multiple sources of proxy data to sketch picture of past climate the study includes graph that shows earths average temperature increasing sharply during the 20th century with an upward curve that resembles the blade of hockey stick often cited as evidence that human emissions are the dominant cause of rising global temperatures the graph became controversial after it appeared in 2001 intergovernmental panel on climate change report but the house committees ad hoc panel says the hockey sticks authors relied on statistics that are predisposed to produce the hockeystick shape claims by the hockey stick papers authors of unprecedented global warming during the 20th century cannot be supported by the analysis the panel concluded the energy and commerce committee whose chairman rep joe barton rtexas is leading capitol hill critic of the hockeystick study has scheduled hearing next week on the ad hoc panels conclusions in june 2005 barton and oversight and investigations subcommittee chairman ed whitfield rky launched probe into scientific and financial records of climatologists who created

thought id pass this on since treering data and their use in reconstructing past climates are central to the controversy i wonder if any attention will be paid to the recently released nrc report on climate over the past 2000 years or in forthcoming paper in climate change that finds the method used to obtain the hockey stick reasonably robust dave heres my note posted to two journalism lists it looks like joe barton will get all the climate uncertainty sorted out on wednesday june 19 at 10 am he will be holding hearing called questions surrounding the hockey stick temperature studies implications for climate change assessments the hearing will focus on the notorious hockey stick graph indicating that the temperatures in the latter part of the 20th century were higher than at any time in the last millennium i doubt there will be more light than heat but the hearing will be interesting to watch if anything the hearing can be watched live via the internet for more information
