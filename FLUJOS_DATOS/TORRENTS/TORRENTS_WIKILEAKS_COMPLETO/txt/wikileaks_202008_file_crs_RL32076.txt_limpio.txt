wendy h schacht specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division the bayhdole act selected issues in patent policy and the commercialization of technology summary congressional interest in facilitating us technological innovation led to the passage of pl 96517 amendments to the patent and trademark act commonly referred to as the bayhdole act after its two main sponsors the act grants patent rights to inventions arising out of governmentsponsored research and development rd to certain types of entities with the expressed purpose of encouraging the commercialization of new technologies through cooperative ventures between and among the research community small business and industry patents provide an economic incentive for companies to pursue further development and commercialization studies indicate that research funding accounts for approximately onequarter of the costs associated with bringing new product to market patent ownership is seen as way to encourage the additional and often substantial investment necessary for generating new goods and services in an academic setting the possession of title to inventions is expected to provide motivation for the university to license the technology to the private sector for commercialization in expectation of royalty payments the bayhdole act has been seen as particularly successful in meeting its objectives however while the legislation provides general framework to promote expanded utilization of the results of federally funded research and development questions are being raised as to the adequacy of current arrangements most agree that closer cooperation among industry government and academia can augment funding sources both in the private and public sectors increase technology transfer stimulate more innovation beyond invention lead to new products and processes and expand markets however others point out that collaboration may provide an increased opportunity for conflict of interest redirection of research less openness in sharing of scientific discovery and greater emphasis on applied rather than basic research additional concerns have been expressed particularly in relation to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries that the government and the public are not receiving benefits commensurate with the federal contribution to the initial research and development actual experience and cited studies suggest that companies which do not control the results of their investments either through ownership of patent title exclusive license or pricing decisions tend to be less likely to engage in related rd the importance of control over intellectual property is reinforced by the positive effect pl 96517 has had on the emergence of new

commercialization of technology introduction congressional interest in facilitating us technological innovation led to the passage of pl 96517 amendments to the patent and trademark act commonly referred to as the bayhdole act after its two main sponsors former senators robert dole and birch bayh under this 1980 law as amended title to inventions made with government support is provided to the contractor if that contractor is small business university or other nonprofit institution the legislation is intended to use patent ownership as an incentive for private sector development and commercialization of federally funded research and development rd as response to congressional efforts to create unified government patent policy pertaining to inventions made with federal support the bayhdole act promotes cooperative activities among academia small business and industry leading to new products and processes for the marketplace this paper discusses the rationale behind the passage of pl 96517 its provisions and implementation of the law observers generally agree that the bayh dole act has successfully met its objectives however some experts argue that the issues associated with the laws patent policies should be revisited given the current rd environment much of the renewed interest is result of the legislations effect on the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries where critics assert that the private sector is receiving benefits to the detriment of the public interest other analysts particularly in the defense arena maintain that the existing rights maintained by the government are too restrictive and prevent industry from meeting national needs many of these issues and concerns are similar if not identical to those addressed during the 15 to 20 years of deliberation prior to enactment of the law these too will be explored to provide context for current discussions an historical perspective the rationale in the late 1970s the united states congress was involved in series of legislative debates over ways to promote private sector development and utilization of federally funded research and development this was soon followed by expanded congressional interest in additional means to foster technological advancement and commercialization in industry during the 1980s and 1990s various initiatives crs2 resulted in laws designed to encourage increased innovationrelated activities in the business community and to remove barriers to technology development thereby permitting market forces to operate1 laws promoting cooperative rd andor joint ventures involving the federal government industry and academia have been cornerstone of the majority of these efforts and include legislation that created system to transfer technology from federal laboratories to the private sector implemented tax incentives for collaborative work instituted direct and indirect government support for increased rd and changed government patent policy to provide an economic inducement for commercialization of federally funded technology the subject of this report pl 96517 the bayhdole act was one of the first of these initiatives prior to 1980 only 5 of government owned patents were ever used in the private sector although portion of the intellectual property portfolio had potential for further development application and marketing the bayhdole act was constructed in part to address the low utilization rate of these federal patents the house report to accompany hr 6933 the house counterpart to the senate bill that eventually became the bayhdole act noted that at the time the bill was considered 26 different agency policies existed regarding the use of the results of federally funded rd generally the government retained title to inventions made with government support whether the research was performed in federal laboratories in universities or by individual companies licenses to use government patents were then negotiated with firms either on nonexclusive basis meaning additional companies could use the technology or more rarely for the exclusive use by one manufacturer however it was widely argued that without title or at least an exclusive license to an invention and the protection it conveys company would not invest the additional and often substantial time and money necessary to commercialize product or process for the marketplace in 1980 the federal expenditure for research and development totaled 555 billion in constant 2000 dollars2 the money typically was used to support research and development to meet the mission requirements of the federal departments and agencies eg defense public health environmental quality or to finance work in areas where there was an identified need for research primarily basic research not being performed in the private sector while the governments investment led to many new inventions that have profoundly influenced our society many in congress were of the opinion that additional applications could be pursued by the private sector if provided the proper incentives the intent of the new law was to replace this situation with single uniform national policy designed to cut down on bureaucracy and encourage private industry to utilize government financed inventions through the commitment of the risk capital 1 for additional discussion see crs

national science foundation a45 crs3 necessary to develop such inventions to the point of commercial application3 expanded technology commercialization was to be accomplished by employing the patent system to augment collaboration between universities as well as other nonprofit institutions and the business community to ensure that inventions are brought to market the bayhdole act also provides for the increased participation of small firms in the national rd enterprise under the assumption that these companies tend to be more innovative than larger companies the patent system brief overview the patent system was created to promote invention and innovation article i section 8 clause 8 of the us constitution states the congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries patents are widely believed to encourage innovation by simultaneously protecting the inventor and fostering competition they provide the inventor with right to exclude others temporarily from use of the invention without compensation patents give the owner an exclusive right for 20 years from date of filing to further develop the idea commercialize product or process and potentially realize return on the initial investment concurrently the process of obtaining patent places the concept in the public arena as disclosure system the patent can and often does stimulate other firms or individuals to invent around existing patents to provide for parallel technical developments or meet similar market needs4 not everyone agrees that the patent system facilitates innovation critics argue that patents provide monopoly which induces additional social costs others assert that the patent system is unnecessary due to market forces that already suffice to create an optimal level of innovation the desire to obtain lead time advantage over competitors as well as the recognition that technologically backward firms lose out to their rivals may well provide sufficient inducement to invent without the need for further incentives5 some commentators believe that the patent system encourages industry concentration and presents barrier to entry in some markets and that cross licensing between companies can result in exploitation of other markets6 still other observers believe that the patent system too frequently attracts speculators who prefer to acquire and enforce patents rather than engage in socially productive activity7 3 house committee on the

patent system proposal for patent bounties university of illinois law review 2001 305 7 ibid crs4 the importance of patents varies among industrial sectors patents are perceived as critical in the drug and chemical industries in part because of the ease of replicating the finished product while it is expensive complicated and time consuming to duplicate an airplane it is relatively simple to chemically analyze pill and reproduce it8 studies have found that in many other industries the protection offered by patents is diminished by the ability to invent around the patent and limited by the disclosure of vital information in the patent itself9 in the aircraft and semiconductor industries patents have not been the most successful mechanism for capturing the benefits of investments instead lead time and the strength of the learning curve were determined to be more important10 later studies bear this out secrecy and lead time were deemed to have greater effect than patents in the semiconductor and related equipment industry as well as the aerospace and machine tool industries among others11 patents can provide an economic incentive for companies to pursue further development and commercialization studies indicate that research funding accounts for approximately onequarter of the costs associated with bringing new product to market according to the economist dollars worth of academic invention or discover requires upwards of 10000 of private capital to bring it to market12 patent ownership is seen as way to encourage the additional and often substantial investment necessary for new goods and services particularly in the case of small business in an academic setting the possession of title to inventions is expected to provide motivation for the university to license the technology to the private sector for commercialization in anticipation of royalty payments universityindustry cooperation changes to the patent laws embodied in the bayhdole act had as an objective the facilitation of collaborative ventures between and among academia industry and government in 1980 universities performed 14 of the rd undertaken in the united states similar to today

engineering indicators 2002 washington continued crs5 and provides training for scientists engineers and managers subsequently employed by the private sector universities however generally do not have the means of production necessary to take the results of research and generate marketable products such activities are carried out by industry thus the emphasis in the bayhdole act on the promotion of cooperative efforts between academia and the business community by providing universities with intellectual property ownership with which to pursue and structure collaborative ventures the legislation is intended to encourage the two sectors to work together to generate new goods processes and services for the marketplace such joint work allows for shared costs shared risks shared facilities and shared expertise prior to world war ii industry was the primary source of funding for basic research in universities this financial support helped shape priorities and build relationships however after the war the federal government supplanted the private sector as the major financial contributor and became the principal determinant of the type and direction of the research performed in academic institutions this situation oftentimes resulted in disconnect between the university and industrial communities because the private sector and not the government typically is involved in commercialization the difficulties in moving an idea from the research stage to marketable product or process appeared to have been compounded thus efforts to encourage increased collaboration between and among the sectors through the bayhdole act were expected to augment the contribution of both parties to technological advancement small business special consideration concerning patent title was given to small businesses in part because of the role these companies were seen as playing in the generation of new jobs and in technological advancement early research supported by several federal agencies concluded that small high technology companies are the source of significant innovation an often cited 1982 study financed by the small business administration determined that small firms were 24 times as innovative per employees as large companies14 similar work performed at the time the legislation was being considered found that firms of less than 1000 employees were responsible for more major innovations than large firms in the years 19531966 and for an equal number from 1967197315 study of national and regional data by the federal reserve bank of chicago concluded that small firms those with 20 or fewer 13 continued national science foundation a49 14 national science board science and engineering indicators 1993 washington national science foundation 185 15 national science board science indicators 1976 washington national science foundation 116 crs6 employees create larger proportion of new jobs than their share of employment in the economy and continue to create jobs even during recession16 however certain caveats need to be stated particularly within the context of small business innovation and technology development over the years experts have argued that the contribution of small firms to the economy is overstated marc levinson writing in duns business month during the 1980s maintained that small companies tended to produce fewer goods than larger ones because they are less capital intensive and on the whole add less to the gross national product because they offer lower salaries and often do not provide health insurance or pension plans17 professors zoltan acs and david audretsch argued that the relationship between company size and innovation capacity varied by industry18 others maintained that there is conclusive evidence that firm size affects the success of rd19 an important factor affecting the ability of small companies to effect technological advance appears to be the relationship between these firms and large corporations concept that is reflected in the provisions of the bayhdole act the corporate contribution and that of the innovative entrepreneur are characteristically very different from one another and characteristically play complementary roles moreover the contribution of the two together is superadditive that is the combined result is greater than the sum of their individual contributions20 study by the national academy of engineering concluded that small hightech companies play critical and diverse role in creating new products and services in developing new industries and in driving technological change and growth in the us economy21 the reasons for this include the ability of these firms to rapidly develop markets generate new goods and services and offer product diversity small businesses tend to be willing to take those technological risks that are not pursued by large firms and may be in position to quickly exploit market opportunities in specific cases experts note an innovative disadvantage of large firms is an 16 eleanor h erdevig small business big job growth chicago economic perspectives novemberdecember 1986 22 17 marc levinson small business myth and reality

innovative advantage for small firms and vice versa which can make collaboration between two firms of different size desirable for both parties22 bayhdole and related law provisions in enacting pl 96517 the congress accepted the proposition that vesting title to the contractor will encourage commercialization and that this should be used to support innovation in certain identified sectors the law states it is the policy and objective of the congress to use the patent system to promote the utilization of inventions arising from federallysupported research or development to promote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations including universities to promote the commercialization and public availability of inventions made in the united states by united states industry and labor and to ensure that the government obtains sufficient rights in federallysupported inventions to meet the needs of the government and protect the public against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions23 each nonprofit organization including universities or small business is permitted to elect within reasonable time to retain title to any subject invention made under federally funded rd except under exceptional circumstances when it is determined by the agency that restriction or elimination of the right to retain title to any subject invention will better promote the policy and objectives of this chapter24 the institution must commit to commercialization within predetermined agreed upon time frame as stated in the house report to accompany the bill the legislation establishes presumption emphasis added that ownership of all patent rights in government funded research will vest in any contractor who is nonprofit research institution or small business25 certain rights are reserved for the government to protect the publics interests the government retains nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable paidup license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the united states any subject invention throughout the world the government also retains marchin rights which enable the federal agency to require the contractor whether he owns the title or has an exclusive license to grant nonexclusive partially exclusive or exclusive license in any field of use to responsible applicant or applicants with due compensation or to grant license itself under certain circumstances the special 22 david r king jeffrey g covin w harvey hegarty complementary resources and the exploitation of technological innovations journal of management

commercialize within an agreed upon time frame or that the action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor26 the government is authorized to withhold public disclosure of information for reasonable time until patent application can be made licensing by any contractor retaining title under this act is restricted to companies which will manufacture substantially within the united states initially universities were limited in the time they could grant exclusive licenses for patents derived from government sponsored rd to large companies 5 of the then 17 years of the patent this restriction however was voided by pl 98620 the trademark clarification act of 1984 according to srept 98662 extending the time frame for licensing to large firms is particularly important with technologies such as pharmaceuticals where long development times and major investments are usually required prior to commercialization27 most experts continue to argue that patent exclusivity is important for both large and small firms in february 1983 memorandum concerning the vesting of title to inventions made under federal funding then president ronald reagan ordered all agencies to treat as allowable by law all contractors regardless of size the same as prescribed in pl 96517 this however does not have legislative basis pl 98 620 noted above further amended bayhdole by loosening the time limitations for both disclosure of an invention to the government agency and for the amount of time provided within which to elect to take title nonprofit institutions were subsequently permitted to assign title rights to another organization eg one which markets technology and governmentowned contractoroperated laboratories primarily those of the department of energy run by nonprofits were permitted to retain title to inventions made in the facility with the exception of those dedicated to naval nuclear propulsion or weapons development in addition the federal technology transfer act pl 99502 allows firms regardless of size to be awarded patents generated under cooperative research and development agreement crada with federal laboratory28 implementation and results the bayhdole act appears to have met its expressed goals of using the patent system to promote the utilization of inventions arising from federallysupported research or development and to promote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations including universities29 in one of the earliest studies of the

and small business representatives that pl 96517 had significant impact on their research and innovation efforts30 while noting it was not correct to generalize about academia from the 25 universities studied gao did find that by 1987 all university administrators questioned indicated that the bayhdole act had been significant in stimulating business sponsorship of university research which has grown 74 percent from fy1980 to fy198531 according to the national science foundation nsf industry support for academic research grew faster than any other funding source until fy2002 industry financing expanded from 39 of university rd in 1980 to 72 in 2000 although by fy2006 industry support had dropped to 51 of academic rd in 1980 federal financing comprised 675 of the total academic undertaking by 2000 federal support declined to 582 of university funding yet increasing to 629 in fy200632 it should be noted however that the federal government still remains the major source of academic research funding the majority of the university personnel involved in the gao study indicated that the increase in industry support for research at universities was directly attributed to the patent changes in pl 96517 and pl 98620 academic faculty interviews conducted by gao found that since businesses knew that universities could take title to federally funded inventions they longer were concerned that their research efforts could be contaminated by federal funding with the possibility that federal agency could assert title rights to resulting inventions33 all respondents agreed that the removal of licensing restrictions on nonprofit institutions including universities by pl 98620 was of vital importance in promoting industryuniversity interaction34 this was reinforced by the finding that 9 out of 10 business executives questioned identified the bayhdole act as an important factor in their decisions to fund rd in academia35 another gao study published in may of 1998 reported that agency and university representatives believed the bayhdole act was meeting its goals as articulated by the congress and the law had positive impact on all involved academia was

implementation of the act positively affected both the federal government and the american people37 other experts agree yale president richard levin argued that the purpose of the bayhdole act is to transition the results of government funded research into practice for the benefit of humanity and that results indicate pretty emphatic positive answer that the bayhdole act has created public benefits with minimal costs38 as stated in an article in the economist the bayhdole act is probably the most inspired piece of legislation to be enacted in america over the past half century39 one of the major factors in the reported success of the bayhdole act is the certainty it conveys concerning ownership of intellectual property the director of stanford universitys office of technology licensing katherine ku noted that exclusivity is what motivates firms to invest financial and human resources in technology development40 it provides an incentive for universities to take the time and effort to pursue patent and to license those patents in its portfolio this has led to significant increase in academic patenting in 1980 390 patents were awarded to universities41 by 2005 this number increased to 272542 academia has become major source of innovation for local and regional economic development in the latest published survey fy2006 performed by the association of university

million46 during fy2004 the association of university technology managers found that 14 billion in royalties were generated from 11414 university licenses47 however several analysts argue that bayhdole was only one of number of important factors behind the rise of university patenting and licensing activity48 in study of the technology transfer and patenting activities of the university of california stanford university and columbia university professor david mowery and his colleagues concluded that increased federal funding for basic biomedical research expanded research in biotechnology specific court rulings and government policies augmenting what can be patented all contributed to the rise in academic intellectual property activities according to their assessment the bayhdole act had little impact on the content of academic research the pursuit of patenting and licensing at universities has expanded because of changes in biomedical and biotechnology rd not because of the act49 later work by professor mowery follows this approach arguing that the emphasis on the bayhdole act as catalyst to these interactions increased universityindustry cooperation and technology transfer also seems somewhat misplaced ignoring as it does the long history 43 association of university technology managers us autm licensing survey fy2006 available at

collaboration and knowledge flows between universities and industry in the united states50 other experts criticize this assessment and point out that the act had the most significant impact on universities that were not actively engaged in patenting prior to its passage51 proponents of this position argue that as result of the bayhdole act in part university patenting increased particularly rapidly during the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s52 this growth in patenting has been concentrated in middletier schools not just the top research universities53 researchers who take this position suggest that the mowery et study focused solely on universities that were previously involved in patenting and licensing and may not have fully considered patent problems that existed before the legislation was implemented according to critics of the study the analysts also failed to take into account changes in the venture capital industry that promoted the development of startup companies to commercialize the results of university rd54 other research questions the effect of increased university licensing on us innovation study by bhavan sampat suggests that while the bayhdole act augmented patent and licensing by universities these activities are just one of many channels through which universities make economic contributions and in most industries less important contributions than those made by placing scientific and technological information in the public domain55 this authors work indicates that there is little evidence that increased university patenting and licensing has facilitated increased technology transfer or any meaningful growth in the economic contributions of universities56 however commentators argue that the provisions of the bayhdole act provide incentives to take university inventions and develop them into products for the 50 david c mowery the bayhdole act and hightechnology entrepreneurship in us universities chicken egg or

technology generally is in the early stage and not yet ready for commercialization requiring additional funding and the involvement of faculty to move the idea into marketable product58 while most universities do not receive large amounts of funds as result of licensing their technologies it is clear from the evidencethat faculty involvement in the further development of university technologies is an important element in getting those technologies to market mechanisms to ensure such efforts are an important element of commercialization regardless of whether those mechanisms included licensing by universities59 in addition professor scott shane observes because universities exploit their inventions primarily through the licensing of technology and licensing is not equally effective across all technologiesthe incentive to become more commercially focused led universities to concentrate their patenting in fields in which knowledge is transferred effectively through licensing60 while the effects of the bayhdole act on the small business sector have not been as extensively studied the results appear similar all eight small business owners interviewed by gao for its 1987 study indicated that the patent changes had significant beneficial effect on research development and innovation in their firms61 perhaps most illustrative of the influence of the bayhdole act on small business is the biotechnology industry according to dr bernadine healy the former director of the national institutes of health nih pl 96517 was responsible for the development and growth of the biotechnology sector62 the biotechnology industry primarily is composed of small firms that are developing technologies and techniques derived from rd funded by nih many of these companies have

to local economic growth as mark myers retired senior vicepresident of xerox told meeting of the national academy of sciences the role of the research university is growing ever important as an economic force in our economy65 in report for the biotechnology industry organization bio analysts found that there are biotechnologyrelated initiatives in 40 states including many that involve cooperative efforts between academia and the private sector between 2000 and 2004 19 states had developed specific bioscience strategic plans twentysix states have at least one seed or venture capital program to invest in small firms undertaking work in bioscience state laws also have been changed to allow universities to become equity partners in start up firms designed to commercialize academic rd66 current issues and concerns while the bayhdole act provides general framework to promote expanded utilization of the results of federally funded research and development questions have been raised as to the adequacy of current arrangements most experts agree that closer cooperation among government industry and academia can augment funding sources both in the private and public sectors increase technology transfer stimulate more innovation beyond invention lead to new products and processes and expand markets however others point out that cooperation may provide an increased opportunity for conflict of interest redirection of research less openness in sharing of scientific discovery and greater emphasis on applied rather than basic research the successes of the bayhdole act and the visibility of the results of its implementation have generated certain concerns many of which are associated with the role of the university in research as well as biomedical and biotechnology rd particularly as related to the availability and cost of pharmaceuticals several of these issues are discussed below however it is important to place the bayhdole act in context the

increased interaction among the parties additional legislative initiatives including the research and experimentation tax credit the national cooperative research act the small business technology transfer program the advanced technology program and cooperative rd agreements established by the stevensonwydler technology innovation act all facilitate joint rd activities leading to the commercialization of new technologies for the marketplace67 recoupment over the years several legislators have suggested that the government recoup its investments from firms using federally supported research and development after profits are generated this is particularly true in the area of pharmaceuticals68 such arguments are similar to those that were identified and considered as part of the original legislative debate over patent policy and cooperative rd the concept of recoupment is based upon the argument that the government should be reimbursed for research and development expenses provided to contractor if the resulting product is brought to the market and generates profits proponents of this approach also maintained that providing the contractor with limited time monopoly on the results of federally funded rd through assignment of patent rights should be balanced by compensation for the governments initial investment in the debate over related legislation thensenator robert dole stated on the floor of the senate on april 23 1980 the provision for recoupment was intended to insure that the governments investment paid for by the taxpayers of this country is returned to the federal coffer69 during the same debate senator birch bayh argued that payback provision means that in the final analysis the taxpayer will not be out the cost of the research and they also will have the benefit of the product70 such suggestions are based on several factors in addition to funding research performed by individual companies under certain circumstances the government furnishes the private sector ownership of the intellectual property resulting from this public investment patent protection gives firms monopoly rights on these innovations for specified amount of time by providing patent protection to the results of federallyfunded research company receives an individual benefit based upon public investments thus proponents of recoupment assert that the

this public subsidization they contend that the public has right to return on its investment however it is argued that this right is not preserved under the patent system which ascribes solely to the patent holder all proprietary rights and interests in the patented product or process71 to date congress has weighed these issues and decided that in the case of patent and technology policies the benefits to the nation brought about by increased innovation are paramount the passage of the bayhdole act represented determination that with respect to certain types of organizations the economic incentive to realize return on investment provided by patent is necessary to stimulate companies to provide the often substantial financial commitment to turn federallyfunded rd into marketable technologies and techniques this is suggestive of the idea that the promise of large return on investment is precisely the tool sanctioned by the constitution to promote the progress of science72 the decision was based on several determinations deriving from the rationale for federal support of basic research the importance of technological progress to the nation and the critical role of private sector commercialization in technological advancement federal support for basic research is founded in large part on the understanding that the rate of return to society as whole generated by investments in research is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by any one firm performing it73 it has been estimated that the returns to society generated by investments in basic research are approximately twice those to the company performing the work government support reflects consensus that basic research is the foundation for many innovations but that incentives for private sector financial commitments are dampened by the fact that spending for rd runs high risk of failure even results of fruitful rd often are exploited by other domestic and foreign companies thus resulting in underinvestment in research by the private sector the returns from basic research are generally long term sometimes not marketable and not always evident it is now widely accepted that from onethird to onehalf of all us growth has come from technical progress and that it is the principal driving force for long term economic growth and the increased standards of living of modern industrial societies74 technological advancement can clearly contribute to the resolution of those national problems which are amenable to technological solutions such progress is achieved through innovation the process by which industry provides new and improved products processes and services an invention becomes an 71 steven r salbu aids and drug pricing in search of policy washington

applied to production to increase productivity and quality it is only through commercialization function of the business sector that significant stimulus to economic growth occurs thus there is congressional interest in accelerating development and commercialization activities in the private sector through the bayhdole act as well as other legislation actual experience and cited studies suggest that companies which do not control the results of their investments either through ownership of patent title exclusive license or pricing decisions tend to be less likely to engage in related rd this likelihood is reflected in the provisions of the bayhdole act as well as other laws providing universities nonprofit institutions and small businesses with title to patents arising from federallyfunded rd offers an incentive for cooperative work and commercial application royalties derived from intellectual property rights provide the academic community an alternative way to support further research and the business sector means to obtain return on their financial contribution to the endeavor while the idea of recoupment was considered by the congress in hearings on the legislation it was rejected as an unnecessary obstacle one which would be perceived as an additional burden to working with the government it was thought to be particularly difficult to administer75 instead congress accepted as satisfactory the anticipated payback to the country through increased revenues from taxes on profits new jobs created improved productivity and economic growth for example from 1980 when the bayhdole act was passed through 2006 5724 new spinoff companies were created and in 2006 alone 697 new products were introduced into the market by these firms76 the emergence of the biotechnology industry and the development of new therapeutics to improve health care are other prominent indications of such benefits to date these benefits have been considered more important than the initial cost of the technology to the government or any potential unfair advantage government rights royalty free licenses and reporting requirements as discussed above the government retains certain rights under the bayhdole act to protect the public interest the act states that the government is provided nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable paidup license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the united states any subject invention throughout the world this license commonly known as royalty free license has been the subject of some discussion including whether or not this permits government purchasers to obtain discounts on products developed from federally funded rd 75 for example see us house of representatives committee on science and technology

licensing survey fy2006 5 crs18 particularly pharmaceuticals july 2003 gao report addressed this issue and concluded that the license entitles the government to practice or have practiced the invention on the governments behalf but does not give the federal government the far broader right to purchase off the shelf and royalty free ie at discounted price products that happen to incorporate federally funded invention when they are not produced under the governments license77 the study goes on to say that rights in one patent do not automatically permit rights in subsequent related patents78 because the government apparently holds few licenses on the biomedical products it purchases generally through the veterans administration and the department of defense79 federal officials indicated that procurement costs were best reduced by use of the federal supply schedule and national contracts80 government licenses are used primarily in the performance of research in the biomedical area81 related issue is that of tracking the governments interest in patents resulting from federally funded research and development in an august 1999 study gao noted that federal contractors and grantees were not meeting the reporting requirements associated with the bayhdole act making it difficult to identify and assess what licenses the government retained among other things82 two years later in followup report gao stated that four of the five agencies had taken steps to insure improved compliance with the law including several new monitoring systems although more needed to be done83 of particular interest is iedison created by the nih which electronically tracks federal inventions and is used by other agencies in addition to nih84 university research question often posed is whether or not patent ownership rights provided by pl 96517 have interfered with the traditional operating procedures of academia fear is that private sector funding of university rd has led to conflicts of interest by scientists performing the research particularly when academics have equity positions in the relevant companies there are concerns that industry agendas will distort or supplant the basic research and educational responsibilities of academia complaints have also been expressed that the free exchange of ideas and scientific 77 general accounting office technology

of conflict of interest is complex one particularly when trying to determine what direct role the bayhdole act has in generating such concerns and what are the results of other factors that have lead to increased industrial funding of university research as noted above laws that provide tax incentives for private sector financing of university basic research and facilitate technology transfer and cooperative rd among government industry and academia as well as changes in the way companies obtain the basic research necessary for product development shape the environment within which academic research is pursued thus as argued by katherine ku it is necessary to evaluate criticisms of the bayhdole act and to understand that the success of the law has made many in government uncomfortable despite the clear guidelines for technology transfer it established85 senior research scholar mildred cho and her coauthors assert that the bayh dole act has created opportunities for conflict of interest for university faculty members because academicindustry partnerships can offer direct financial rewards to individual faculty members in the form of consulting fees royalties and equity in companies while simultaneously funding these faculty members research86 this it is argued has resulted in situations where the researchers ties to private sector interests may not be evident and may adversely affect the quality outcome and dissemination of research87 other studies indicate that obligations to industry pose threat to scientific integrity88 some commentators maintain that private sector funded research tends to generate conclusions favorable to industry however the factor that is primarily associated with the withholding or delay of information is the involvement of the scientist in bringing his research to market in product not the industrial financing itself89 data collected by professor david blumenthal and his colleagues also support the assessment that involvement in commercialization activities is related to delays in publication90 this study indicated that approximately 20 of life science 85 workshop on academic ip effects of university patenting

centers by professor wesley cohen and his colleagues found that over half of the centers permitted firms to request publication delays and 35 of the institutions allowed researchers to delete information prior to publication at those centers with mission to improve industrial products and processes 63 allowed publication delays and 54 permitted the deletion of information92 delays in publication and the free flow of information from academia according to professor richard florida may well discourage or even impede the advancement of knowledge which retards the efficient pursuit of scientific progress in turn slowing innovation in industry93 professor florida also points to concerns over the increasing number of academic institutions taking equity positions in andor incubating spinoff companies these actions simply tend to distract the university from its core missions of conducting research and generating talent florida concludes that publication delays and greater secrecy in the research process resulting from implementation of the bayhdole act have shifted the university away from the pursuit of its traditional goals other experts including robert barchi provost of the university of pennsylvania maintain that the bayhdole act has not generated significant set of issues concerning conflicts of interest and publication delays primarily because of the importance of academic freedom to the faculty94 publications are the basis for promotion and tenure and methods to respect reasonable intellectual property protection have been established similarly as noted by professor pam samuelson conflicts of interest would jeopardize tenure thus regulations are in place to instruct faculty what is required of them95 research conducted by professors pierre azoulay

patenting and licensing on commercialization and research 193 crs21 patenting is often accompanied by flurry of publication activity academic scientists who patent are more productive than otherwise equivalent scientists that are not listed as inventors on patents but that publication quality appears relatively similar in the two groups96 in response to these issues many universities have hired professional technology managers to work with faculty and to address patents universities with extensive research capabilities and resources were the first to create offices of technology transfer after passage of the bayhdole act these offices were established with much greater frequency97 these university technology transfer offices have established guidelines to cover industryuniversity relationships with education and publication remaining academic priorities98 the financial rewards derived from patenting often are only small portion of the total amount of rd funding for academic institutions and what substantial money does flow into individual institutions tends to be the result of one blockbuster patent university technology managers report that the major reason for patent licensing is commercialization not profit particularly since the cost of patent which can run approximately 10000 is so high99 while the bayhdole act focused universities on commercially relevant technologies and closer ties between research and technological development100 the costs of patenting are such that most university licensing offices barely break even101 university limitations on outside research expeditious publication obligations mandated for certain federallyfunded rd and conflict of interest provisions also help to preserve balance between federal policies like the bayhdole act that promote industryuniversity cooperation and concerns over excessive control of the research environment by the business community for example nih requires grant recipients to publish the results of their government funded rd this is augmented by tax code regulations necessitating prompt dissemination of actual research results in order for university or research institution to

detriment of future technological development professor florida maintained that because universities are seen as engines of growth they focus on applied rather than fundamental research this has lead to unrealistic national and local policies and practices that encourage the commercialization of academic research while ignoring the real value of universities as the nations primary source of knowledge creation and talent103 mildred cho also asserted that university research is skewed toward marketable products and not basic research104 studies by researchers dianne rahm and robert p morgan et indicated the greater the faculty interaction with industry the more the applied research105 according to an article in fortune magazine the bayhdole act has had unintended consequences in that universities have evolved from public trusts into something closer to venture capital firms what used to be scientific community of free and open debate now often seems like litigation scrum of datahoarding and suspicion106 other experts disagree study of 3400 faculty at six major research institutions by professors jerry thursby and marie thursby found that the basicapplied split in research did not change over the period 19831999 even though licensing had increased by factor greater than 10107 data collected by the national science foundation appear to support this assessment according to nsf in 1980 basic research comprised 666 of academic rd endeavors while applied research and development were 334 of the total in 2006 the percent of academic rd expenditures devoted to

technology transfer at texas am university the act requires funds generated by licensing to be used for future education and research necessary to deliver real world products to the public110 assessing the legislation the biotechnology industries association contends that without the bayhdole act few licensing agreements would be executed between private companies and federally supported research institutions and the enormous investment our government makes in medical research would be wasted111 biotechnology and pharmaceuticals many of the current concerns about the bayhdole act primarily arise out of its application to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries congressional interest in providing lower cost drugs particularly to seniors has focused attention on the role the act has had on the development of new pharmaceuticals for the marketplace certain critics maintain that the price of many therapeutics derived from federally funded rd are excessive considering the governments financial contribution112 others argue that the bayhdole act does not significantly affect pharmaceutical prices and point to july 2001 study by nih that found only four of the 47 fda approved drugs generating 500 million year were developed in part with nih funded technologies113 although the government generally does not directly support pharmaceutical research aimed at product development114 legislative attempts have been made to require cost controls or recoupment on drugs generated in part with federal funds this is in sharp contrast to congressional and executive branch

spending for academic rd in these areas has increased from 46 billion in 1980 to 215 billion in 2006 funding for university rd in the life science particularly biological and medical sciences comprises by far the largest portion of academic research support in 2006 52 of total rd expenditures at academic institutions went to finance the medical and biological sciences when the bayhdole act was passed in 1980 405 of the research spending at universities was in these areas116 while the federal government continues to be the primary source of funding for university rd in these areas the federal portion of academic research funding in biological sciences declined from approximately 74 in 1980 to 69 in 2006 although government support for medical research increased from approximately 64 to 66 during the same time period117 expanded support for university rd in this arena appears to be important in relation to findings by the late professor edwin mansfield showing that academic research was particularly significant in the development of new products and processes in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries118 interest and activity in the biomedical and biotechnology sectors has sparked some concern over the effects of the bayhdole act on research in these areas according to information provided by the boston consulting group in the years between 1990 and 1999 new gene patents granted increased from about 400 to 2800 while the number granted to universities expanded from 55 to 73 during that time period119 similarly the number of us biotechnology patents granted each year grew from 1199 in 1990 to 5194 in 2006120 the focus on intellectual property has led critics to charge that the bayhdole act encourages the patenting of fundamental research which in turn prevents further biomedical innovation law professors rebecca eisenberg and arti rai argue that due to the legislation proprietary claims have increasingly moved upstream from the end products

patents hinder the process from their perspective by permitting universities to patent discoveries made under federal funding the bayhdole act draws distinction between inventions that lead directly to commercial products and fundamental advances that enable further scientific studies122 these basic innovations are generally known as research tools eisenberg and professor richard nelson argue that ownership of research tools may impose significant transaction costs that result in delayed innovation and possible future litigation123 it also can stand in the way of research by others broad claims on early discoveries that are fundamental to emerging fields of knowledge are particularly worrisome in light of the great value demonstrated time and again in history of science and technology of having many independent minds at work trying to advance field public science has flourished by permitting scientists to challenge and build upon the work of rivals124 similar concerns were expressed by harold varmus president of memorial sloan kettering and former director of nih in july 2000 prepared testimony he spoke to being troubled by widespread tendencies to seek protection of intellectual property increasingly early in the process that ultimately leads to products of obvious commercial value because such practices can have detrimental effects on science and its delivery of health benefits125 while the bayhdole act and scientific advances have helped generate dynamic biotechnology industry there have been changes that are not always consistent with the best interests of science126 however as varmus and others acknowledge the remedies to this situation are not necessarily associated with the bayhdole act yales richard levin noted that while some research should be kept in the public domain including research tools the fact that it is privatized is not the result of the bayhdole act but rather the result of patent law made by the courts and the congress therefore he believes that changes to the act are not the appropriate means to address the issues127 other experts agree that many of the issues that are identified today as negative consequences of bayhdole can be traced to the institutional polices of universities 121 continued biomedicine american scientist january february 2003 52 122 ibid 123 rebecca s eisenberg and richard r nelson public

patenting of research tools however there have been efforts to encourage the widespread availability of these tools marie freire testified that the value to society is greatest if the research tools are easily available for use in research she asserted that there is need to balance commercial interests with public interests129 to achieve this balance nih has developed guidelines for universities and companies receiving federal funding that make clear research tools are to be made available to other scientists under reasonable terms130 in addition the us patent and trademark office recently made changes in the guidelines used to determine the patentability of biotechnology discoveries studies by professors john walsh ashish arora wesley cohen and charlene cho found that although there are now more patents associated with biomedical research and on more fundamental work there is little evidence that work has been curtailed due to intellectual property issues associated with research tools131 scientists are able to continue their research by licensing inventing around patents going offshore the development and use of public databases and research tools court challenges and simply using the technology without license ie infringement according to the authors private sector owners of patents permitted such infringement in academia with the exception of those associated with diagnostic tests in clinical trials partly because it can increase the value of the patented technology concluding observations the discussion surrounding changes to the patent laws in the 1980s and the debate over technology transfer since the late 1970s acknowledged many of the issues currently being explored as result of expressed concerns certain safeguards were built into the activities

government receives significant payback through taxes on profits and society benefits from new jobs created and expanded productivity the importance of patent ownership has been reinforced by the positive effects studies have demonstrated pl 96517 is reported to have had on the emergence of new technologies and new techniques generated by american companies there remain areas of concern as discussed above that congress may decide to pursue some argue particularly with respect to pharmaceuticals and biotechnology that under the bayhdole act companies are receiving too many benefits at the expense of the public others particularly in the defense arena assert that the existing rights retained by the government under the act are too restrictive and are an impediment to meeting federal needs but the impact of the legislation is still seen as significant as summed up by howard bremer who was patent counsel to the wisconsin alumni research foundation from 1960 through 1988 one important factor which is often overlooked is that the success was achieved without cost to the taxpayer in other words separate appropriation of government funds was needed to establish or manage the effort in fact it has been estimated that the economic benefits flowing from the universities licensing activities adds about 41 billion to the united states economy significant as that dollar amount is it should not be overlooked that university inventions arising as most of them do from basic research have led to many products which have or exhibit the capability of saving lives or of improving the lives safety and health of the citizens of the united states and around the world in that context their contribution to society is immeasurable132 132 howard bremer the first two decades of the
