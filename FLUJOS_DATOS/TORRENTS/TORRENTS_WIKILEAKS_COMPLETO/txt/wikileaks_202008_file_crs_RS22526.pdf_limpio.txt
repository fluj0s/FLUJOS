order code rs22526 updated march 15 2007 animal agriculture selected issues for congress geoffrey s becker specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division summary the value of animal production on the 13 milli on us dairy livestock and poultry farms 2002 census of agriculture averages about 124 billion annually more than half the total value of all us agricultural production the united states produces and consumes more beefveal pork poultry and milk than almost any other single country china leads in pork us exports have grown rapidly in recent decades as has integration of us meat pr oduction and processing with th at of mexico and canada farming processing and marketing have all trended toward larger and fewer operations often called consolidation increasingly many phases of production and marketing may be managed or controlled by single entity sometimes called vertical integration complying with environmental and food safety regulations and addressing changing consumer preferences about how f ood is produced have added to costs and operational complexities for pr oducers and processors alike in congress policy debate has revolved around impacts of the sectors structural and technological changes on farm prices on the traditiona l system of smallersized independent farms and ranches and on rural communities and workers also at issue are implications for consumers the environment and trade inherent in these questions which could be addr essed during consider ation of new farm bill in 2007 is the appropriate role of government in intervening in or assisting the livestock meat and poultry industries the following brief overv iew of selected issues is drawn from the crs reports noted here where sources and additional tails can be found commodity support programs and feed prices feed is the single largest input cost for cattle feeders dairy hog and poultry producers who are wary of government policies that can raise feed prices these include commodity support or conserva tion programs that take cropland out of production or ethanol incentives that bid up the price of corn key feed ingredient such incentives have already helped to boost significantly th portion of the total us corn crop going tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22526crs2 ethanol possible energy title in the next 2007 farm bill could furthe r bolster feed grain demand and prices animal producers worry unlike major crops such as grains cotton and oilseeds animal products are not recipients of commodity price and income support program benefits an exception is milk where producers benefit from combina tion of administered pricing under federal milk marketing orders surplu s dairy product purchases and milk income loss payments also some cattle and hog producers in limite d number of states are participating in livestock revenue insurance programs being administered by the us department of agricultures usdas risk management agency rma new farm bill likely will continue some form of milk price andor income support nd possibly could continue or even expand revenue insurance for livestock producers also see crs report rl32712 agriculturebased renewable energy production crs report rs21999 farm commodity policy programs and issues for congress crs report rl33475 dairy policy issues crs report rl33037 previewing 2007 farm bill disaster payments animal producers who do not raise crops commercially lack access to federally subsidized crop insurance congress or the administration has periodically made animal producers in declared disaster areas eligible for ad hoc federal payments mainly to help defray the cost of purchasing offfarm feed following disa ster affecting onfarm feed production or permitted producer s to use conservation lands for haying and grazing issues include whether the government s hould assume more of livestock and poultry producers disaster risks as they have fo r crop farmers and whether congress should establish permanent aid program automatically triggered in times of disasters in lieu of ad hoc legislation in virtually every recent year also see crs report rs21212 agricultural disaster assistance crs report rl31095 emergency funding for agriculture brief history of supplemental appropriations fy1989fy2006 market competition changes in the structure and business met hods of the livestock and meat sectors appear to be rapidly transforming us animal agriculture animal farms continue to diminish in number and expand in average size relative handful of large firms process animal products and these firms increasingly seek to control or at least better coordinate all phases of production and marketing often to meet th specific requirements of large retail chains that want to satisfy consum er demand for range of lowercost products critics assert that these tr ends have undermined the traditional us system of smallerscale independent familybased farms and ranches by eroding farmers negotiating power lowering farm prices and forcing all but the largest operators out of business others counter that the sectors stru ctural changes are desirable outgrowthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22526crs3 of factors such as technological and ma nagerial improvements changing consumer demand and more inte rnational competition in 2007 various bills have been propos ed to address pe rceived competition problems among them are proposals to regu late meat packer ownership or acquisitions of cattle s 305 s 786 to gi ve farmers more options to di spute provisions in contracts with processors in 2007 s 221 and to broaden protections under and strengthen administration of the packer s and stockyards act and ot her antitrust laws s 622 these or other socalled competition opti ons could become the basis for proposed competition title in new 2007 farm bill see also crs report rl33325 livestock marketing and competition issues animal disease and animal identification outbreaks of animal diseases like avian influenza ai foot and mouth disease fmd bse brucellosis and tuberculosis are seen as perhaps the greatest potential threats to animal production even where us cases have been few as with bse or quickly contained as with various strain s of ai the impacts can be economically devastating causing production losses closed export markets and decline in consumer confidence some animal diseases like ai and bse have the potential to harm humans cattle producers meat processors and the feed industry are anticipating an upcoming decision by the us food and drug administration fda on whether to finalize or amend proposed rule that would prohibit the use of higherrisk cattle parts ie those more likely to harbor the bse agen t in all animal feeds the proposal would be more restrictive than the fdas rule that now bans most mammalian parts from cattle feed only as way to prevent bses spread through animal feeding however the industry believes the economic costs of the proposed rule could be extremely high many producers appear to agree that nationwide animal identification id system that can trace animals from birth to slaughter is critical tool fo r quickly finding and controlling future animal diseases more foreign markets are demanding animal traceability and other meatexporting countries are adopting id programs it is noted despite several years of us da effort and public funding totaling an anticipated 118 million through fy2007 universal us system is not expected to be in place for some time as policy makers deba numerous questions about its design and purpose should animal id be mandated what da ta should be collected and who should hold it government or private entities to what extent should producer records be shielded from the public and government ag encies should traceability be expanded to follow meat and poultry products from farm to consumer andor used for other purposes such as food safety or certif ication of labeling claims how much will it cost and who should pay in the 110th congress hr 1018 would prohi bit mandatory id and address privacy concerns other bills intended to address many of these questions could emerge possibly as farm bill items also see crs report rl32199 bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease current and proposed safeguards crs report rl32012 animal identification and meat traceabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22526crs4 country of origin labeling another possible and somewhat related item is countryoforigin labeling cool which the 2002 farm bill required of many retailers of fresh produce red meats seafood and peanuts although the seafood labeling rules are in place congress has delayed implementation for red m eats produce and peanuts until september 30 2008 while lawmakers continue to debate the need for and anticipated costs nd benefits of cool in the 110th congress bills hr 357 s 404 ve been introduced that would require implementation by september 30 2007 see also crs report 97508 countryoforigin labeling for foods meat and poultry trade the united states is one of the leading exporters of livestock and poultry products which have been among its fastestgrowing categories of agricultural exports however us market share is being challenged and for some products surpassed by highly competitive foreign exporters such as brazil australia india argentina and new zealand in beefveal canada and brazil in pork and brazil in poultry us exporters also face foreign trade barriers such as high import tariffs and divergent foreign food safety and animal health measures sometimes regarded as baseless by the exporters examples of recent problems include russias restrictions on us beef and pork exports purportedly over animal disease concerns ja pans and koreas sl owness in ramping up us beef imports due to limited numbe r of cases here of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease and longstanding european union ban on importation of meat from animals treated w ith growth hormones approved for use here trade promotion authority tpa which pe rmits the president to negotiate trade deals and present them to congress for an up or down vote without amendment expires on june 30 2007 making renewal topic in the 110th congress the administration has used tpa to pursue an ambitious series of bilateral and regional free trade agreements ftas as well as to participate in negotia tions for new multilatera l trade rules under the world trade organization wto us interests seek assurances that any new agreements will not favor foreign over us animal products many farmers and ranchers also are wary of signing new agreements wh in their view some countries have not fulfilled obligations under existing agreements to lower tariffs andor nontariff barriers that have blocked meat nd poultry exports also see crs report rl33144 wto doha round the agricultural negotiations crs report rl33463 trade negotiations during the 109th congress crs report rl33472 sanitary and phytosanitary sps concerns in agricultural trade environmental issues questions about the applicability of federa l environmental laws to livestock and poultry operations have been controversial and ve drawn congressi onal attention as animal agriculture increasingly concentrates into larger more intensive production unitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22526crs5 concerns arise about impacts on the environm ent including surface water groundwater soil and air some environmental laws specifically exempt agriculture from regulatory provisions and some are designed so that farm s escape most if not all of the regulatory impact the primary regulatory focus for large feedlots is the clean water act since contaminants from manure if not properly managed also affect both water quality and human health operations that emit large quantities of air pollutants may be subject to clean air act regulation in addition c oncerns about applicability of superfund to livestock and poultry operations are of growing interest bills to exempt animal manure from fe deral superfund requirements have been introduced in the past and could reemerge in the 110th congress the house and senate agriculture committees do not have direct jurisdiction over federal environmental law but they do have role in the issue fo r example under the conservation title of recent farm bills the environmental quality incentives program eqip has provided financial and technical assistance to fa rmers to protect surrounding resources livestock receives 60 of the funds also see the following reports crs report rl31851 animal waste and the environment epa regulation of concentrated anim feeding operations cafos crs report rl32948 air quality issu and animal agriculture primer crs report rl33691 animal waste and hazardous substances current laws and legislative issues crs report rs22040 environmental quality incentives program eqip status and issues food safety usdas food safety and inspection service fsis is responsible for inspecting most meat poultry and proce ssed egg products for safety nd proper labeling the food and drug administration fda is responsible for ensuring th safety of all other foods including seafood and also regulates animal f eed ingredients for years congress has monitored the efforts of fsis and indus try to address the problem of microbial contamination which has cau sed outbreaks of severe and sometimes fatal foodborne illness longstanding issue is the effectiveness of these efforts and the need if any for policy changes such as increased fsis resources or more efficient ways of assigning existing resources to the highest risk plants or products another concern is the use of antibiotics to control disease promote growth and address wellbeing in foodproducing animals some ar gue that antibiotic overuse in animal production can lead to resistance to re lated drugs used in humans and that fda should discontinue unnecessary animal uses othe rs counter that such assertions have not been scientifically proven nd that restrictions would raise production costs by millions of dollars and harm the quality of animal products various proposals related to m eat safety have been offered in recent years including proposals to clarify usdas use of microbial performance standards to allow state inspected meat and poultry products to be so ld outside the state to which they are currently restricted to give usda more authority to recall suspect meat and poultry products to tighten controls on imports and to restrict nontherape utic use of medicallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22526crs6 important antibiotics in livestock eg hr 962 and s 549 in the 110th congress some would reorganize federal food safety responsibilities possibly within single new agency eg hr 1148 s 654 see also crs report rl32922 meat and poultry inspection background and selected issues biotechnology biotechnology term often used as synonym for such technologies as genetic engineering genetic modification transgenics recombinant dna techniques and cloning has been promoted as way to impr ove animal productivity nd quality to introduce new food fiber and medical pr oducts and to protect the envi ronment criticisms range from food safety and social resistance to potential negative impacts on animal welfare and on ecosystems in the 110th congress early interest focuses on fdas publication in the january 3 2007 federal register of longawaited draft risk assessment which finds that meat and milk from cloned cattle pigs and goats and their offspring are as safe to eat as those of conventionally bred animals alt hough animal health problems may be more frequent than in other assi sted reproductive technologies members may be asked to review the benefits and costs of cloning and other biotechnolog ies and to refine existing laws to ensure adequate ove rsight s 414 and hr 992 for example would require the labeling of foods from cloned animals or their offspring hr 1396 and s 536 would not permit organically beled foods to be derived from such animals also see crs report rl33334 biotechnology in animal agriculture status and current issues animal welfare farm animals are not covered by the animal welfare act which requires minimum care standards for many other types of warm blooded animals farm animals are covered by federal laws addressing humane transport and slaughter however animal activists periodically seek new legislation that woul d further regulate onfarm or other animal activities such as bills to prohibit the slau ghter of horses for human food one passed the house but not the senate in september 2006 another has been introduced in the 110th congress as hr 503s 311 to require th federal government to purchase products derived from animals only if they were raised according to specified care standards and to prohibit the slaughter for food of disabl ed livestock introduced in 2007 as hr 661 and s 394 among others members of the house and senate agriculture committees generally express preference for voluntary pproaches to humane methods of care for example smithfield farms the largest us pork producer recently announced that it would require its producers to phase out the use of gestation crates which many animal welfare advocates believe pr ovide far too little room for hogs to move around see crs report rs21978 humane treatment of farm animals overview and issues crs report rs21842 horse slaughter prevention bills and issues
