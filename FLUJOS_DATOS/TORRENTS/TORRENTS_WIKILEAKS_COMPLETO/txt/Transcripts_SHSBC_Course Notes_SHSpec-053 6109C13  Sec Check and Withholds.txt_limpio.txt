6109c13 shspec53 sec check and withholds on sec checks if people argue that rights of privacy shouldnt be invaded eg in public meeting the answer is in the hcob 8feb60 honest people have rights too this has been so neglected on this planet that only criminals have rights at saint hill among the domestic staff the ones who had withholds always got rid of the good staff members it always works this way the ones with withholds will tell lies about the good ones and seek to get rid of them because they cant bend them down to their level good staff members are made nervous upset and uncertain about their future in the presence of insecure people spreading entheta withholds cause people to get individuated more and more to the point that theyre not even themselves guy who shoots ducks cant be duck the more individuation occurs the less likely person is to be able to walk out of anywhere its like backing up through succession of isolation rooms person to be in good shape must be able to be almost anything to the degree that you cant be something you have overts on it that you are withholding its well known in the motorcycle world that some people have so many overts against motorcycles that to touch one produces disaster you can stop automobile accidents by having the person reach and withdraw from car hell drive better and stop having accidents you could also run startchangestop on the vehicle this process could give you somatics as the overts start blowing the best way to blow overts is with the sec check because the overt only remains bad if its withheld wars get fought because its so horrible to have war that it gets put on automatic that is individuation from subject and loss of control of it if you can be something you wont have to become it theres another mechanism too after you backed yourself out of life to the end of the corridor you snap terminals and obsessively become the thing you were trying to leave this is valence closure its the withholding of overts that does it where you have pc whos loaded with withholds on sec check youve got someone who cant be and you are trying to find valences you cant find valences easily on someone who cant be but you can find the fixed valence hes in because its this mechanism the mechanism of ow causing valence closure that has led to his becoming that valence so you could find someones terminal without completing his sec check but hell be hard to get into session if hes got lots of withholds because of the resultant individuation he gets easily upset because he cant be pc and is critical of the auditor because he has withholds you can run what are you willing to be what would you rather not be two things will occur if you run it very much it will soften him up on security check because beingness and withholds are opposed and one solves the other however it also walks the pc into his valence chain without identifying the chain so it can get him into engrams hes not ready to run you must remember that she somatic is where it is on the track and in other place and it will release only from that place so you can walk him away from that place on the track which keys it out or you can walk him into that place on the track and asis it thats all processes can do with somatics withholds will often soften up and knock out presenttime somatics by walking the person away from the area and maybe thats good thing he could be stuck tightly into an engram in life and you can move him out of it until youre got him in shape to run it out he could be so tightly in it he couldnt put his attention on the session the best approach to this is security check you could even run it on the basis of his chronic ptp somatic it knocks out his obsessive individuation this is an assist that walks him out of the valence hes been stuck in hes always got the chronic somatic on the chain of the valence which will be his terminal thats why you have to get the correct goal and terminal because theres only one valence chain in which hes stuck the end product of withholds is good communication not clear sec checks can be tailored to hit the area of the persons ptp so as to key it out so you can make progress with the case
