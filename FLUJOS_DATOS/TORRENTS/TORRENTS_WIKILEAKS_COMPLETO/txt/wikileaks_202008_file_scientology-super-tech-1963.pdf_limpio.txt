must not be indifferently learn ed but as it is not goin g to change as is well prov and ffort can be spent upon i t and must be we must rise to t he occasion we mu st use all we know to learn and teach all we hav to teach to get routine 2 done check sheets there are two d istinctl different ries of check sheets for doing routine 2 pro cesses and auditing these are those that appl to rou tine 2 the gpm and data listing null ing and case errors and repai r b those that appl to audi ting its basics ski lls the mete r althou gh these associate and in terlock the are two separate subjects of studyfor years we have faced the arbitra ry that those whose cases g ot in the road of their auditin g yet had to assimilate auditing theor and practice rout ine 2 well done r emoves with some rapidit these case barriers to audi ting therefore there are sever phases desirable in stud ying auditing and routine 2 v unit class 0 first pha for new student doing rou tine 2 10 prec edes study of auditing and routine 2 this is done under close supervision on coaudit basis with the coaudit supervisor taking hand on c ases ch eckin g out i tems correcting cases etc this is done unti l the student has found in another and has had found in hi mself 2 or 3 pack ages accuracy is the essen ce of this first s tep otherwise the wasted time and wron g items will give the whole ction t he tone of desp air only good r esults are stressed not the form of how the are achieved in this first phase we want the student to see that routine 2 produ ces ch anges for the bette r in hi mself and the pc and is worth lea rning this is what we re trying to show we remov if the rout ine 2 is good the barrie rs to learning auditing and scientolog all we want then from the first phase is realit on the ben efits of the process and auditing and b removal of the ba rriers to being good audito r w unit class i second phase this phase actuall starts the training of scientolo gist he or she howeve r should have started its check sheets in the v unit we teach the basics of scientolog its hi story the auditor s code axioms t he arc triangl and tone scale out of the old notes on l ectures booklet in practic and

philosoph and cute tricks and g ive the student solid groundin g on pure scientolo gy basics disrelated from audit ing and b get the student c apable of rep etition of commands and unafraid in actual

the meter fine points this phase shou ld spe cialize in basic auditing skills ver precisel applic able to handlin g an auditin g session meter meter drills anti q and trs 0 4 model sess ion mid ruds m

will d isturb 2 12 or run out rockslams the idea of this audit ing is to get the student used to handling session with competen ce from th is phas we expect the basics of audit ing in theor and pr actical and b confidence in confrontin g bank and handl ing pc on meter with good form unit class i ia four th phase in the fourth phase our interest is in prepch eckin g as an action and pr elude to lis ts in the form of problems intensive in theory and practic we teach how to do problems intensive advan ced metering how to detect case chan ges better sessioning more trs 04 more basics of scientolo gy such as axioms and logics in audit ing the student does problems i ntensive and receiv one the stress is on good sessioning and re sults from th is phas we expect good command of prob

pa ge or two and thereb made into seve ral pass the student studies and is exam ined on them in segm ents in audit ing the student is permitted to do full 212 and the stress is on resu lts with accurate routine 212 pg it class i i sixth pha this is postg raduate phas on rout ine 212 i t was form erly known as interne the theor and practical ar all on the stress of ca repair and how to supervise rou tine 2 the student is used to help supervise v unit students as his auditing activi ty with stress on case errors the remainde r of the student s time is taken up with preparation for examination for his hcahp the student may be used for ch arity cases and what was form erly interne work summar this is about thre months course if steamed throu gh if it takes lon ger then the v unit was flubbed if student han gs up longer than reason able time in an uppe r phase he is return ed to the v unit and is requi red to do and r eceive rout ine 2 while continuing to try to pass uppe r level ch eck sheets so as not to hold h im up students are of cours expected to stud evenings and we ekends the three section cours plan is adhe red to of theor practical and auditing auditing in the auditing section i s done for resu lts not to tea ch auditing practical is whe re they practice students are prog ressivel assign ed to their units and ar reclass ed as they pass out of unitthe model of this c ourse is sa int hill bu t it ma not be so advertised the chief difference of course is the necess ary reintroduction of student bod tape pro gramme such as in the old da ys the last hour of the da is used for this sequence of about 75 tapes mainl of general historical or auditing interest re pla yed to the whole student bod assembled in the main assembl hall one tape each da regardless of the students classific ation they are given quizzes on these tapes ver brief other tape use is made in an acad emy there are headphon record ers i f tape play speak ers are not good the students won t learn anything from the tapes when tap are omi tted as whole class activit the whole direction meanin g and ethic of scientolog goes sour in an area and the students haven t clue what scientolog is for and you find them idl ing about drivin g off pcs with nutt chatte r this acad emy curriculum requir d of t and two instructors to this can be add ed training admin who is also ex tension course the d of t becomes audi ting supervisor the other two instructors re the theor supervisor and practic supervisor the classes are awarded on the co mpletion of the phase and designate the che ck she

s to tell what it is before you start lis ting and choose our oppose question ac cordin gly but be read to find that what was terminal i s really an oppterm or vice vers and shou ld hav been opposed the other way around you have onl two lis t questions to use in opposing reliable i tem these are who or what would oppose __________ and who or what would __________ oppose for every reliable item there is on ly one of the abov that is right the other is wrong there are true coterms the only seem to be both terminal pain and an oppterm sens ation when it comes to l isting you will ben efit the pc only by listing the ri ght wa the other oppose question then is the w rong way if you list the wron g way using the wrong question youll get an end less l ist that never completes and wont nul you therefore have choice of two questions and one of them is right and the other wrong alw ays if you choose the ri ght one and lis t it the pc ben efits i f you choose the w rong one and list it t he pc will get worse rapidl right in the session befo re your eyes it often happens that you start listing the wron g way this is bec ause you failed to find out cor rectly if the ri you were about to l ist an opposit ion list t was terminal pain or an opposit ion terminal sensation the pc said he had s but actuall felt p ain or the pc did have sen and the pain appe ared afte rward in short becaus pt terminals l ook like coterms ver often neither the pc nor the auditor can tell on some r is this happens to so ris on ev ery case the solution to t he dilemma is to test b listing pa ge or two there are certain definite signs of wron g way oppo sition they can be seen with half an eye ther is need to go on until our pc is cav ed in and you have 99 pag of items to find out ou cant nul and shou ld hav opposed the other way around list right wa to or wron g way to will r ockslam sothats test in i tself the tests five in number are little more delicate aside from ori ginal tests for term or

february 1963 franchise cenocon current auditing current auditing has been unsettled due to the sudden breakthrough on r3mx what i was looking for was 1 process that invariably cleared pcs easily 2 that had very precise and invariable rules 3 that could be taught by rote and 4 would not be subject to change this process turned out to be r3mx the x at this writing is dropped as the process has proven itself and it becomes routine 3m the designation of m is simply its consecutive letter in the development series but it could stand for mary sue as she did the actual auditing under my direction that proved its rules the rules of 3mx were worked out in routine 212 and 212a and then by examining rocket reading item behavior in 3mx the first thing you should know about 3m is that it is more precise in application than any process you have handled when it says list the tone arm action out andthen 25 items more it means exactly that surges of the needle dont count in ta action as you couldnt follow them with the ta and back that fast when r3m says list 25 items beyond the last rr or rs on list it means 25 not 24 in 3m it says rocket reading item and thats what it means and rocket read is rocket read not fall r3m is therefore masterpiece of precision do it wrong not exactly by the rules and it becomes real nightmare so know it before you do it and do what it says only in both r212a and r3m an item can appear anywhere on source list so long as 2 items do not rs or rr one item rsing and one rring also means list is incomplete on the ww wd goal opp list the 3m source list you have to make sure list is complete to 50 items beyond last rsing or rring item and 50 beyond ta action point where ta stops moving this is true for both 3m and 212a you read every rring item back to pc from the 3m source list goal opp and every rsing item on the 212a source list source list is of course the primary list from the goal from which you get the first rring ri in 212a the source list is what you choose to get your first list from or list one all other lists in 3m are extended 25 items beyond the last rr or rs and the item is always the last rr on the list if not youve goofed didnt get the ta action out of this or the just prior list in 212a you go 50 items beyond the last rs and 50 beyond the 1st still ta the 8 tests for mass increase etc must be done on every item found in 3 m and 212a the best coverages of r3m are the hco bulletin of feb 1 1963 routine 3 and the two hours of lecture of feb 7 1963 where it is covered hco bulletins and other lectures will be forthcoming r212a if r3m emerges so suddenly then what of routine 210 212 and 212a with the single caution that you must not try to package small rs and only use wide rs 13 of dial or more as your source lists ri 212a is very successful just as laid down it will continue to be taught and used in it you have some very precise rules list is continued 50 items beyond the last rs never represent an rsing item always carry wide rsing ri around to package of 4 it is not important how you get your first ri so long as it didnt come from representing an rsing item the last rs on the list opposing an ri is the right item always unlessyouve goofed there must not be 2 rsing items on list except list one where you choose the biggest rs as your first ri if two appear your list is incomplete or you let the pc as you must never do represent an rr or rs hes heard or seen on the list you dont nul in 212a or 3m you just read the next to last then the last rs or rr item tough cases the rs grabbed off list one issue 3 will change with 212a rockslammers sit back and get relaxed the process is valuable therefore it must be taught and used but as r3m is even easier than 212a it also must be taught in

use one or two of the minor ones on any new student not all of them and flatten what you start always on pcs who are not rock slammers and arrive on course in good condition do not run 212a instead choose one of the other processes for such student pc the milder the better and flatten it to ta action make the student auditor just audit totally muzzled rudiments havingness just start of session and end of sesslbn use meter thus intelligently supervised the new student will get nice win establish reality the new student tightly supervised doing plain scientology with frills will obtain reality that exact scientology works this discourages squirreling on course and gives the student an incentive to study scientology as it is not as altered with case gain win and new reality the student is ready for upper units and can be counted on to get fast passes and an early graduation all failures to pass hcobs and upper classes are traceable to case rsing on list one lack of wins and low reality on scientology thus these remedied you get students graduating not stagnating on course it is the purpose of the v unit instructor to achieve these gains and pass the new student on the v

unwilling to take bulletin checks are 1 rsing on list one and 2 capricious examination v unit cares for the one study and practice of this policy letter should care for the other the important points of bulletin tape or policy letter are 1 the specific rules axioms maxims or stable data 2 the doingness details exactly how is it done and 3 the theory of why it is done all else is unnecessary all you have to demand is the above they are given in order of importance i the rules axioms maxims or stable data must be known exactly verbatim and the student must be able to show their meaning is also known to him or her 2 the doingness must be exactly known as to sequence and actions but not verbatim in the same words as the text 3 the theory must be known as line of reasoning reasons why or historical background and with accuracy but not verbatim the date of the lecture or bulletin or letter is relatively unimportant and other details of like nature should never be asked for if student or staff member is ever going to apply the data then above l must be down cold 2 must be able to be experienced and 3 must be appreciated asking for anything else is to rebuff interest and give feeling of failure to the person being examined an examiner should examine with fiendish exactness on lalertness on 2 and seeing if the student understands 3 an examiner should not go beyond these points asking for what person was mentioned who did the test what is the copyright date what are the first words etc graduation from courses must be speeded up and at the same time the data the important data must be known and understood good sound examination is the answer here irrelevant examination questions only slow the student and extend the course be as tough as you please but only on

an idiocy of long long lists can creep into routine 2 and routine 3 this is not as harmful as underlisting but it can make pcs pretty green or black and certainly holds up auditingyou must realize that listing to still tone arm takes several things for granted 1 that the auditor has his sensitivity at about 4 mark iv about 6 during listing 2 that the auditor does not adjust the ta for surges cognitions etc 3 that the ta is adjusted only when it has to be to get the needle into readable position 4 that the pc is answering the auditing question and not varying it or running havingness on himself 5 that the rudiments are reasonably in particularly suppress invalidate protest and decide 6 that the pc is capable of being in session 7 that the pc isnt fiddling with the cans yawning stretching etc in other words if an auditor has his pc under calm control the ta rule applies as the control of the pc diminishes the ta rule grows less workable but even so all is not lost ta shifts because of body motion yawning asking questions and particularly because of protests do not count in reading ta position the ta position that must be steady is for the list so if you read it ta position for the list must be motionless you have it absolutely correct the ta will also read for other attention positions such as on the auditor on the room on the body the pc shifts his attention from the list and you get ta motion the thing we want to know is did the ta go right back to list position when the pc put his attention back on the list or with the pcs attention on the list did the ta now move if so thats ta motion for the list and the list is incomplete its really very easy even if the pc is out of session to find motionless ta on the list understand this and youll stop endless listing ta action out is however not the first rule of complete list the rules of complete list for r2 or r3 are 1 two items rr and rs are not firing when the list rr and rs items are read back to the pc 2 only one item rses or rrs on the list when rrs and rss noted during listing are read back to the pc the others do not read 3 the list has the reliable item on itin routine 2 these rules apply 4 on completed r2 source list one rsing item only will rs when read back to the pc 5 on completed r2 list taken by opposing either way rockslamming item the reliable item will be the last rockslamming item on the list if it is not the item being opposed is wrong or the opposition wording is wrong way to or the list is incomplete in routine 3 these rules apply 7 on completed r3 source list one rocket reading item only will rr when read back to the pc rs or other rr on the list should now read 8 on completed r3 list taken by opposing either way rockslamming item the reliable item will be the last rocket reading item on the list if it is not the item being opposed is wrong or the opposition wording is wrong way to or the list is incomplete 9 an item or goal which was seen to rocket read when being written down but which rses when read back to the pc will rocket read again if given brief big mid ruds prepcheck the above are the rules which must apply as some variability can result in various auditors interpretation of still ta and in how good session the auditor can run the ta rule is secondary it still applies it is still valid but pc on protest varies his ta all over the place and an auditor that cant handle pc with few deft mid ruds or get his question answered will get ta action when the list is flat when you get the hang of it you will see that listing to motionless ta is valid but that of course is in an auditing session on one of these overlong lists you can tell if its overlong by seeing if you have gone 50 items 25 items opposing rr ris past the last rs or rr making sure that you dont get two items on the list that fire and thus find your reliable item its finding ris that counts not how long can we list also avoid buying pcs hard sell on an item or condition if it follows the above rules buy it if not just ack and go on auditors with low sales resistance need not apply often the pc says its terminal when its an oppterm apply the tests and do decent test list before you make up your mind pcs dont really know ris have an aberrative value you know so why buy dramatized sales talk the auditor is necessary because an auditor isnt in the ri and can think so an auditor who buys sales talk isnt an auditor get it audit r2 and r3 by the rules if the rules dont seem to apply take walk and think over why dont just keep onin haggard hope l ron

rudiments to get cleaner needle this does not apply to rudiments and havingness sessions or prepcheck sessions and problems intensives for pc who is well smoothed out by staff auditors then and who is well under the goal finders control the following may be used particularly with mark v meter start of session is it all right with you if i begin this session now start of session tone 40 has this session started for you if pc says say again start of session now has this session started for you if pc says say we will cover it in moment rudiments what goals would you like to set for this session please note that life or livingness goals have been omitted as they tend to remind the pc of present time difficulties and tend to take his attention out of the session at this point in the session there are two actions which could be undertaken the running of general ow or the running of mid rudiments using since the last time i audited you one would run general ow if the pc was emotionally upset at the beginning of the session or if the session did not start for the pc the latter being simply anotherindication of the pcs being upset or arc broken but those symptoms must be present as sometimes the session hasnt started merely because of poor tone 40 or because the pc had something he wanted to say before the auditor started the session running ow if it is alright with you i am going to run short general process the process is what have you done what have you withheld the process is run very permissively until the needle looks smooth and the pc is longer emotionally disturbed where are you now on the time track if it is alright with you i will continue this process until you are close to present time and then end this process after each command ask when that was the last command is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this process end of process running the mid rudiments one would use the middle rudiments with since the last time i audited you if the needle was rough and if the tone arm was in higher position than it was at the end of the last session since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed this is always done by the repetitive system since the last time i audited you has anything been invalidated since the last time i audited you has anything been suggested since the last time i audited you is there anything you failed to reveal since the last rime i audited you is there anything you have been careful of these latter four rudiments are done by fast check the in this session mid ruds can be used to straighten up session that has completely gone out of the auditors control after he has gotten in the random rudiment on this list mid ruds particularly with suppressed or invalidated can be used to get pc to continue listing running the random rudimentin this session have i missed withhold on you in this session is there anything i failed to find out about you in this session have you thought said or done anything i failed to find out in this session have i nearly found out something about you any of the above versions may be used the random rudiment is always run repetitively end of session is it alright with you if we end off now is there anything you would care to ask or say before i do so end of if the pc from the auditors observation is very agitated or upset the auditor would run general ow as given above if the session has been an extremely difficult session with the pc having been arc broken badly and frequently one would get in the in this session mid ruds in order to clean up the auditing even though the pc may now be alright have you made any part of your goals for this session have you made any other gains in this session that you would care to mention after adjusting the meter please squeeze the cans if the squeeze test was not alright the auditor would run the pcs havingness process until the can squeeze gives an adequate response is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this session is it alright with you if i end this session now here it is end of session tone 40 has this session ended for you if the pc says repeat end of session if the session still has not ended say you will be getting more auditing end of session tell i am longer auditing you please note that havingness is run after goals and gains as this

prepchecked so that some rocket reads are seen get it checked out it may only have been seen to rocket read sometime in the past and will not now rocket read prepcheck it until it rrs at least once if so go to step 2 3m can be started without having the goal if you have an rr ri from 212 if so start 3m with step 8 and find goal as in step 15 determine goal question 2 determine by meter and by what the pc can answer the wording for the goal oppose line who or what would the goal oppose who or what would oppose who or what would somebody or something with the goal ____oppose who or what would ing version of the goal oppose use only one of the above and use other wording for the question list source list 3 list list in the usual way on meter watching carefully for rocket reads or rock slams as the pc gives items note these accurately on the list if rses or rrs appear on this list assume that the goal was wrong or that the pc has been suppressed by other listing below rr or rs do not proceed if rrs or rses were seen while listing relegate the case to 212 repair see below or other goal finding if rses or rrs are seen on listing proceed to next step complete source list 4 list the list less than 50 items by actual count beyond the last rs or rr whichever was last in actual fact all ta action should be off the list by this time but auditors have trouble in some instances in interpreting what is ta action on the list keep going if you know what ta action is but dont use 005 divisions ta change as an excuse to list pc black in the face test list 5 test list by reading two rses or rrs back to pc if only one rs or rr is reading on the list it is complete if two are reading continue the list until you have new rses or rrs and 50 beyond the last one again then retest be sure list is complete by which is meant it has an rsing or rring item reading on it but not two and an ri is on the list find ri 6 search out the rsing or rring item by reading each one marked rr on listing back to pc one should rocket read or rock slam without td if none are found that now rs or rr read the nonrs nonrr items just above and below each marked rs or rr you may have mistaken which item rsed or rred work at it until youve found the reliable reading on the meter when read back to the pc item if none rs or rr use small tiger on those that dr if still none rs or rr extend the list until new rses or rrs are seen if ri yet null the whole source list you only do this with goaloppose source list clean up ri 7 get the big mid ruds in on the reliable item found if it rsed it will turn into an rr if big mid ruds are put in on it but even if it only still rsed proceed to next step if it vanishes without being listed extend goaloppose list determine whether terminal or oppterm 8 determine if the ri is terminal or an oppterm just because an oppterm was indicated by the list question is reason an oppterm will come up if an exaltedsounding item it is probably an oppterm if degraded reversal of the goal it is probably terminal as more ris accumulate on the line plot the less this is true it finally reverses use any tests released wrongwayto gives more mass to pc and reads less on meter list the ri 9 list the ri as terminal who or what would ri oppose or as an oppterm who or what would oppose ri if pcs face darkens or mass pulls in or if he cant keep the question in mind or cant think of answers easily or if needle tightens etc quickly abandon and start new list with the reverse question but be very careful not to keep reversing an r3 list dont test list as in r2 be right in the first place and unload fast if youre wrong in the way its being opposed the more you change the way you oppose it the more mass youll pull up on the pc reverseway oppose list also has rrs and rses on it complete ri list 10 list 25 not 23 or 20 items beyond the last rs or rr if you can read tone arm be sure the ta action is out of the list but dont use ta action of onemillionth of division as an excuse to list the pc into the ground with overlisting the actual rule is 25 items beyond the last ta change and 25 beyond the last rr or rs never list less than 25 items beyond the last rr or rs if new rr or rs occurs go 25 beyond it ta action can be caused by protest decide arc break if the pc arc breaks after youve stopped listing the list must be extended as the arc break matter what the pc says comes from the item not being on the list this step is very easy just list and note down the rrs and rses seen on the meter as you list write fast get the item down correctly ask the list question only often enough to keep the pc listing when he stops you ask the question or ask it when he asks for it dont overlist r3 overlisting is brutally cruel dont underlist dont miss reads the sensitivity is set at about 3 on mark v and 4 on mark iv for listing the eye looks across the dial at the sheet beside the meter you move the sheet up as you write lefthand meters are available at hco ww for southpaws put your ta reads on your listing sheet each time ta changes check ri being listed 11 check the item you are listingfrom if it ticks or fires dont do anything with the list youve just done continue it to new rr or rs and do 25 beyond it the item can read because the pc is protesting or invalidating but usually its just list more if item being listed from doesnt read proceed to 12 read new ri 12 say to the pc i will now read the last rock slamming item on the list omit saying the above if the last item was an rr that didnt read if it did and an rr is above it your list is incomplete so do step 11 again if it didnt read which it shouldnt say i will now read the nexttolast rocket reading item on the list do so if it rrs or rses do step 11 again if it doesnt which it shouldnt say that doesnt read now say i will now read the last rocket reading item on the list do so if it reads rs or rr say that rocket reads or that rock slams this is the one that must read if it rred when being written down but rsed when read back to pc the only action necessary is to put in the big mid ruds on it and it will rr if the last rr noted on list doesnt read then say i will now read the item above it read the one above the one below the one 2 above the one 2 below as soon as you have one that fires say that reads now dont do anything else when you have the item look silently at the pc you will see him get lighter colored in the face the tone arm will blow down the meter will fire rocket reads as the pc cognites if pc is in doubt say thats your item the needle may go free only for space of 5 seconds if you go on into the next gpm the residual mass of the goal youve just blown is held in more by the next gpm than by odd bits so getting the next gpm is the most constructive and timesaving action end of steps ____________________ comments you mustnt let the pc represent rring or rsing item as he lists if he knows something rsed or rred he may repeat variations of it however interfere as little as possible with the listing by the pc dont force listing or prevent it mask your paper from the pc the frequency of the bank can get thrown awry by listing both ways or by doing list wrongwayto and getting reverse item but the upset is limited to the 25item ruleon any one gpm where goofs have occurred you may have to extend lists due to finding tick step 11 all rules and steps still apply you just have to extend list as in step 11 more often the item doesnt start appearing earlier on the list and the rule of the last rr is never violated its just that the 25 items after the last rs or rr rule becomes unworkable and you keep finding that the item you are listing from still ticks so you have to extend step 12 remains true r3m is purely mechanical activity the better you know it the more exactly you follow it the more rr ris you get the less you figurefigure on it the more clears youll make 3m works because of 3m not because of auditing frills the only thing missing from these steps is the test battery to find if an ri is terminal or oppterm that is given on tapes and will be the subject of whole hco bulletin when an ri that is terminal is used as an oppterm wrongwayoppose more mass turns on and vice versa wrongly call an ri and its more mass darkening pc discomfort etc any ri that gives the pc unmistakable pain when said to the pc is terminal always the sen is not as good to determine with as many terms also turn on sen and pain dont test list every ri both ways in 3m that half kills the pc do it only in r2 be right before you list look the pc over after youve listed 10 items to see if the face has darkened or discolored watch out for tightening needle and list rightwayto only do 3m carelessly or wrong and youll wrap the pc around telephone pole crash be honest never fake read never falsify report somebodys future 200 trillion depends on that honesty if it reads say so if it doesnt read say so dont try to look good at the expense of pcs future life repair 3m by tding every ri on the line plot for reads if none are reading at all examine the lists for completeness if these are short or goofed complete them for an ri as per the rules if all else fails prepcheck the pc on auditing listing and do goaloppose list if that doesnt rr while being listed examine the repair steps above in that order this pc either had wrong goal and the auditor didnt know rocket read or the rr is hung up somewhere in the incomplete lists the point is dont goof you can clear whole goal gpm while trying to repair some nutty departure from 3myouve got one clearing technique protect it ___________ two types of list remember there are two types of lists in r3m l the goaloppose as covered in steps 17 this is called source list 2 the ri oppose either way as covered in steps 813 this is called an ri list these follow different rules the item can be any rr or rs seen on goaloppose list the item is always the last rr on the ri oppose list realize that all goaloppose lists follow the rules of steps 17 and all ri oppose lists follow the rules of steps 813 there are exceptions if the list youve done as goaloppose source list deviates from the phenomena found in steps l7 youve goofed not 3m if the ri oppose list youve done doesnt contain the phenomena in steps 813 youve goofed not 3m example auditor finds on an ri oppose list that the ri was the third rr from the bottom thats wrong complete the list its that exact ___________ old goals with the advent of 3m the question of what to do about old goals or partially run goals or keyedout clears arises ___________ rule on old goals on anybody who has ever had goal found whether it was listed partially or fully run r3m just as though the goal had just been found if it doesnt rr now it will still give rrs on the source list from it it is all right to test list it if the goal was wrong it will not give rrs on the source goal opp list l ron hubbard

rr the only thing that makes pcs ability to rr or rs vanish on meter is finding too many ris without finding the goal the pc can be overwhelmed by ris if he or she has goal to align them to this is true of routine 2 every ri found is part of gpm finding too many more than 4 ris whether they rs or rr with routine 2 or routine 3m will narrow the pcs ability to rs and rr and will cause his or her rs or rr to vanish thereafter you will see rses or rrs on any list it is natural for the rs or rr to vanish on routine 2 or 3m item when it is opposed the rs and rr on goal vanish when the goal is run out what im talking about is the ability of the pc to rs and rr on lists and new goals routine 2 every r2 item is gpm ri find too many r2 ris matter how and fail to find goal that rrs and youll not see any more rses or rrs on that pc until the goal has been foundthe difficulties of finding goal with the pcs rr off is something i need not stress the right goal well prepchecked and seen to rr will turn on the pcs ability to rs and rr in general this is life and death data dont find too many r2 or 3m ris without finding goal the rr and rs ability does not vanish by failing to package up oppose and square away ris it only vanishes if you fail to find goal four ris with goal is maximum you can get two routine 2 ris to help find goal after that stop until the goal is found 3dxx etc items all the 3dxx 3ga 3gaxx items matter how found must be put on pcs 3m line plot they were all gpm ris use them to find the goal get them added up to the goal when the goal is found favorite goal some pcs have second gpm goal or third or fourth which wont rr yet and is not ready to run their attention gets so stuck on it they cant cooperate in finding the first gpms goal the thing to do is to list what goal might have been postulated after favorite goal bare words like to catch catfish had failed this moves pcs attention to later gpm and youll again get ta action on listing goals by favorite goal is meant the goal that the pc thought and fought was his but amount of prepchecking could make rr regularly most pcs on whom you cant find firing rring goal had favorite goal ask them what it was or when it went out and use it in the above five is the common ta read for pc who hasnt got goal and is stuck on the last now run out goal or on favorite too deep goal when the ta goes to 50 or thereabouts in listing goals and you cant get it to move and you havent got firing rring goal use the above method it applies to r2 and r3m pcs alike at any stage of case or in any gpm the wording can also be for pcs in first second or third gpm what goal might have failed before last goal was postulated various wordings can be used the intention being to get pcs attention off gpm and onto another gpm change in r3m step 13as auditors can easily slide on by gpm into the next and miss the rocket firing blowdown or dont heed it this must be added to step 13 and never omitted if omitted you can turn off the pcs ability to rr matter how many up to 5 or 6 anyway gpms have been run add after just take pcs opinion for use in making tests now read the pcs goal three times carefully noticing whether it rrs or rses once out of three or not or if it ticks or falls if the pcs old goal only ticks or falls and the rr or rs has vanished then you have passed the rocket firing blowdown when the goal closes to rr or r s you have only 5 or 6 or at the most 8 ris to go before free needle occurs on that goal keep finding ris so long as you can make the goal tick or fall with tiger drill the moment the goal ceases to react with tick or fall do this l find new goal by ordinary listing or any means 2 give the old goal an 18 button prepcheck do not tiger drill the old goal to get it to rs or rr as it will briefly and then fold up the new goal if it rses must be tiger drilled or prepchecked until it rrs this happens right after rocket firing blowdown or blow up in low ta cases to clear read but auditors miss it and often brief blowdown to clear read occurs with the old goal still in action the only test then is whether the old goal rrs or rses and then in your step 14 pick up the last rring item on the spiral staircase get it to fire and oppose it dont do goal oppose with the new goal if rring item now exists on the line plot then use the new goal for goal oppose list as in step 2 and proceed on down the steps of 3m if you always read the goal to the pc in step 13 and never go on opposing if the goal does not rr or rs you will never turn off pcs ability to rr or rs and the gpms will stay straight to keep on opposing and finding items after the old goal has ceased to rocket read or rs is to court real disaster this is the commonest auditor error in r3m to shoot on past the old gpm and go racing into the next with goal suddenly disaster rr and rs off pc screaming atmosphere in which to find new goal r3m step 14 delete second paragraph in step occasionally etcdelete fourth paragraph substitute the number of ris in gpm vary greatly the first gpm encountered may be newly formed and have only two or three ris in it gpm is as long as the goal of it will continue to rr or rs while opposing items when its goal longer rses or rrs when read to pc the gpm limit has been reached new goal for gpm must be made to rr before being used listing will improve its read the rr then becomes

of rocket reading or rockslamming some preclears are incapable of producing an rs or rr except on the first gpm goal when found matter how much item listing is done matter from what source rr orrs is seen while listing and none is found when the list is complete technique to turn on pcs rs or rr will ever be found except one find the pcs goal for the 1st gpm what makes rrs rses vanish the thing which turns off pcs rr or rs is too many reliable items found without finding the pcs goal this can be done by life or by auditing as it can be done by life some raw meat pcs will not rr or rs it can be surmised that they have been set about in life by too many reliable items in full view for instance pc has an ri father an ri politician an ri city his father is politician who insists on living in city these and others in his bank although undisclosed are yet restimulated and this pc will not be seen to rs or rr on listing and rs or rr is likely to be seen even if an actual ri is found there is use here for more forceful way to get ris the rules are very plain unvaried and uncompromising rule when pcs rs or rr is off stop trying to find more ris matter if you could find them the rr or rs would just go more thoroughly off if you did rule finding more ris will not turn an rr or rs back on there is danger signal in this the pcs rr or rs starts getting smaller item by item ri by ri get off fast let the last ri be the last one looked for if just one more is found bang rr or rs on this pc matter what is found in the way of ris rule completing r2 or r3 package will not turn on the rr or rs however dont let the pc arc break on an incomplete list by starting one it may be possible to find one more ri that gives feeble slam but then youve had it however the picture is not all black pcs who were incapable of rr or rs have been subjected to 26 lists after with rr or rs seen and still have recovered restoring the rr rs the rockslam and rocket read are brothers pc will rockslam and yet not rocket read because the rocket read is the frailer brother pc going down hill toward rr or rs first loses his rr it now shows only as an rs then thers vanishes too you cant prepcheck an rs into an rr on some pcs if the pc is on the way down toward rr or rs ordinarily however lot of rses can be prepchecked into rring if there is an rr there to fire an rr as it expires may become an rs the ability to rr then goes out first there is only one thing that restores the pcs ability to rr or rs rule the only thing that will restore the ability of pc to rr or rs is to find the pcs first or next gpm goal naturally it is far easier to find rocket read on goal before the pc loses his ability to rocket read it is far from impossible however to find goal on pc that is incapable of rring or rsing and far from impossible to get it to rr by prepcheck as the pc will always rr again on the right goal just listing goals eases the condition of rr or rs and once an rr or rs that has been shut off is found again on the goal the pcs rr or rs is on again on everything on some pcs the goal is so charged that you will find an immediate rocket firing blow down of the ta you get long rocket reads one after another as the pc realizes it is the goal this is particularly true on some pcs who have had lot of ris found in such case you more find the goal and prepcheck it than you have to find another for the next gpm all items count any item found by 3dxx 3ga 3gaxx or even earlier for running processes on are all part of the gpm and must be put on the pcs line plot it doesnt matter how they were found or by whom or if they were checked out or not they belong on the line plot and can be used to find goals rule put any item ever found on the pc by any process on the line plot every one will add up to goal therefore even bad items items that were found from representing rsing items backwards oppose items all belong on the line plot it is understood here that there was some kind of an assessment whatever was found by any kind of an assessment since 1954 belongs on the line plot and can be used to help find goals four ris in r210 212 and 212a you are allowed only four ris before the pcs goal must be foundif the rs or rr is seen to get smaller from one item to the next abandon 212 and begin 3m goal finding at once when you find the pcs goal and when you are adding up and prepchecking the first gpm you will discover that everything found on the pc for the last nine years was part of his first or another gpm so old auditing paid off in view of this on old pcs its safest to go for the goal as your first auditing action you can use any item ever found to help get that goal on raw meat pcs get couple ris if you can by r212 and use that to help find the goal with luck one will even rr but find the goal before opposing it summary this discovery of what monitors the rs and rr of pc is very important one ive worked ceaselessly on this since the first of the year and finally isolated it even 3rd goal clear isnt immune to losing his rs and rr if you keep finding scores of items with goal or wrong goal so treat the rs and rr with respect when found and find the pcs goal when he wont rs or rr and youve got it made you dont need better meter only the pcs goal this rules out unlimited r210 212 and 212a on pc but these give you the two or four ris necessary for easy goal finding so r2 is of value after all and ive prepcheck coming up that helps loosen up the pcs goal so were still all right l ron hubbard lrhdrbh copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights

happy people the above plot with dates added is the way your gpm line plot should look there may be more items and in the first gpm you contact there may be less from the top down but this synthetic plot will assist you in knowing what to do with your preclearnote that the first oppterm in complete gpm is the most likely to be successful form of goal ri and the first terminal at the top the least successful ri terminal of the goal this will keep you from making errors in selecting out the first ri you contact rule the first terminal contacted will be found to be the most degraded form of the goal of that gpm and the first oppterm an exalted form of the goal of course in first gpm that is not fully complete the above rule may not hold true but this is an exception first oppterm found is usually better expression of the goal even in the first gpm than the first terminal in all subsequent gpms second third fourth there are exceptions to the above rule it is very upsetting to the pc and the bank to oppose the first thing you find in gpm wrongwayto or to oppose any ri wrongwayto for that matter but even this doesnt change the rules note that the ri happy people in the next gpm does not fit the goal to scream the real time to get the next goal after to scream is when you have found happy people if you go more than 4 ris into the next gpm after you saw to scream cease all reads after the goal to scream you are putting the pc in real danger as the rs and rr may shut off on the pc thus making it very hard to find the next goal however if you try to find the next goal after to scream with the pc further along than the ri reprover in the above plot you wont find the next goal the ta will go up to 5 and the pc will muddle about giving you goals which wont rr out of the remaining unfound items of the goal to scream if you find ris into the next gpm after ri happy people without first finding its goal not only will the pcs ability to rr and rs eventually vanish about 12 ris later than ri happy people but goal oppose list done on to scream may give you the goal of the gpm two down from that of to scream and you will have skipped whole gpm the one with happy people at the top now youve missed the goal of whole gpm although you have half its items and my wont that poor pc arc break rule the further the pc goes into gpm without the goal the harder it is to get the goal and the more likely it is that youll get the next gpms goal and miss the goal of the gpm you have items for troublewhat you can say with certainty is the more you depart from sop 3m the more trouble youll have dont invite trouble by thinking and worrying too much worry is the occupational hazard of the auditor doing 3m the worry rule rule so long as the pc is happily going along and youre finding goals and ris on schedule keep calm start worrying and correcting when the pc is arc breaky and looks bad example auditor finds the rr on the list on reading back to the pc 5 items above the last rr marked on the list there is rr on the list after the rring item found pc is happy with item found it rred it was the last rr found on nulling how the auditor saw an rr 5 items later is caused by the pc continuing to think about the one 5 above while he lists the pc is actually representing the item the auditor finds hence it looks like list item 5 down fired there was fire on the list item in nulling what should the auditor do well the pc is cheerful about the rring item that was found there is rr on nulling after it other item on the list now fires so its the pcs item bona fide ri the above is excess worry it will all come out all right as it follows the senior rules but there is another extreme too little worry example the auditor finds happy people in sequence on the above plot the pc out of pride says thats terminal the auditor carelessly lists it without any careful test the pc starts looking black the auditor keeps on going the pc gets flu the auditor plunges on without correcting the item finds 4 more without goal found runs out of rr ris blank lists does goal oppose on to scream lands in the gpm after next beyond the one of happy people runs out of all rrs and rses on the pc cant hold the pc insession pulls missed withholds and prepchecks pc and auditor together dive off highest bridge on realizing 3m doesnt work and case is hopeless joke the auditor didnt start worrying when the pc started looking and feeling bad kept adding more errors to an unhealed arc break and bang r245 rule the more you do after an arc break or pc upset without correcting the exact reason for the upset the harder the upset is to correct routine 3m has terrific wallop its arc breaks are fantastic when it starts to go wrong stop and set it right but if it isnt going wrong dont try to set it right keep going after you have done few gpms your heart will settle back into your chest and youll lose that hunted look so forthe auditor the start of auditing 3m is the worst as in the pc the start of the case is the worst fortunately gpms are carbon copies with terrific precision of construction do one and youll have done the actions youll do on all so learn the rules right and make clears warning auditors who are not well trained make errors and then in failing try to correct by inventing new rules and procedures we have already had 3m where the ris did not have to fire to be used we have had several other brands remember this clear is clear the attainment of clear lies on the other side of gpm man has been unable to crack the riddle of the bank until now we have the rules 3m makes clears there are only about 20 errors you can make there is only 1 path through the gpm it has been found the myth of oneshot clear has been exploded there is easier way to clear so learn the rules well dont think youve found exceptions to the rules you havent banks got built that way thetans are freed this way study 3m like youve never studied anything before you can learn it you can make clears you can be clear who said it was easy man its impossible and has been for trillennia and we can do it the first of all the ages to understand and free the human spirit so get busy l ron hubbard

you will be awfully glad you read and learned this hco bulletin the only things that can ruin the future of r2 and r3 are 1 arc breaks because of bad r2 and r3 and 2 the sad effect the arc break there is nothing more nerveracking to an auditor than an r2 or r3 arc break they are not like other arc breaks from common missed withhold they are nerveshattering and far reaching in consequence if you cant handle an r2 or r3 arc break you have business using the techniques as youll wrap more than one pc around telephone pole the only real damage r2 and r3 can do to case is when one fails to handle an r2 or r3 arc break good r2 or r3 repairs bad r2 or r3 but one sometimes has to be awfully clever to repair case once the auditor has let an arc break go by indeed so important is the arc break in r2 and r3 that it is actually used as one means of testing the correctness of the r2 or r3 cause of arc breaks the untried auditor is always sure the r2 or r3 arc break happens because of auditing blunders mid ruds etc failure to pull ordinary missed withholds or auditor auditing goofs this is not true the truth is that r2 and r3 arc breaks are caused by mistake in goals items or gpms and thats the whole cause the pc however unable to grasp this turns his reasoningupon the auditor and blames the auditing therefore this rule must be thoroughly learned and experienced by the auditor before he or she is safe in auditing r2 and r3 arc break rule in r2 and r3 when the pc criticizes or attacks the auditor or goes into grief or apathy an r2 or r3 error has just occurred the auditor must ignore the pcs statements as to the cause of the arc break and quickly remedy the r2 or r3 and do nothing else there are exceptions to this rule in r2 and r3 the auditor having goofed in some other way is liable to see reason in what the pc is saying do something like missed withholds or mid ruds and drive the arc break into heights that can make the pc much more upset mid rud rule in an r2 or r3 arc break missed withholds and mid ruds are used if at all only after the arc break has been healed by correcting the r2 and r3 if an auditor tries to get in his mid ruds or pull missed withholds in the face of an arc break in an r2 or r3 session the pc is likely to be driven down to the sad effect which is harder to salvage the sad effect we could call this tearaculi apathia magnus and everyone would be in great awe of it but i see reason to follow the latinated nonsense of yesterdays failured sciences call it something simple and the auditor will feel he can do something about it and even the pc will cheer up bit so its the sad effect this is state of great sadness apathy misery and desire for suicide and death i have been on the trail of the causes of this condition for about 20 years like nearly everything else in scientology this is new high point in achievement we have the highest state ot and we have the lowest states of being recognized and know the roads to them rule neglect or overwhelm an r2 or r3 arc break pc anger or antagonism and you will cause the pc to drop into the sad effect rulethe sad effect is caused by neglecting or overwhelming an r2 or r3 arc break and the state will continue until remedied by correcting the r2 or r3 rule all pcs who are sad hopeless etc have had their r2 or r3 mishandled by life or auditing arc break cause rule all r2 or r3 arc breaks stem from wrong items or goals incomplete lists wrong way to oppose or auditing all these are in essence missed withholds of the greatest possible magnitude and therefore cause arc breaks of the greatest possible magnitude bad auditing only serves to key in an existing r2 or r3 error in actual fact missed withhold can amount to whole section of the gpm goal error or leaving the gpm section before it is clean wrong goal wrong item wrong way to item or of lesser degree not finding an item rule the common denominator of all r2 r3 arc breaks consists of missed or wrongly designated gpm goal or reliable item there are other sources of r2 or r3 arc break bad sessioning poor auditing ordinary life missed withholds are only contributive to r2 and r3 arc breaks and are incapable of doing more than keying in and intensifying the magnitude of the arc break which has already been caused by errors in r2 and r3 the fifteen principal causes the fifteen principal causes of arc break in r2 and r3 are 1 failure to complete list 2 bypassing an item 3 giving the pc wrong item 3aopposing an item wrong way to 4 giving the pc an item with altered wording 5 giving the pc item 6 failure to complete goals list7 bypassing the pcs goal 8 giving the pc wrong goal 9 giving the pc goal with altered wording 10giving the pc goal 11failure to complete gpm before going to the next 12bypassing gpm 13getting the pc into the wrong gpm 14going too far into gpm without finding goal 15no auditing the fifteen apply to both r2 and r3 all of them they can be made up into an assessment list shortly to be issued which list assessed by elimination will give you the exact cause of the arc break which i think is pretty clever of and permit you to heal it rapidly while you will feel on occasion that the assessment result is more easily interpreted then fortune telling you will find that it is always right it spots the missed r2r3 missed withhold if it comes up bypassed item youll have scramble trying to find it but you at least know why the pc arc broke and the pc will permit you to look even while screaming at you the cycle of the arc break stage one the arc break starts always in the same way the pc finds something wrong with the auditor the subject or tools of auditing or the auditing room he does this in varying intensity arc break to arc break stage two this is followed by misemotion also directed at the auditor subject tools or room stage three if the auditor continues on with auditing the pc will drop into grief sadness or apathy this is an inevitable cycle and may be followed by the pc with greater or lesser intensity of emotion or loudness or lack of response skilled auditor will recognize and stop it at stage one above it is sometimes not possible to stop the cyclebecause it enters the stages and completes them too swiftly but it must be cared for and further r2 or r3 may be done until the r2 or r3 is corrected the auditors view the auditor must realize that the arc break is caused by an error which has just occurred within seconds or minutes and must not go back half dozen sessions unless the pc has been pretty upset all along something has just happened usually that is wrong r2 or r3 the auditor must stop all forward action and must not do anything except correct what has already happened do not continue on do not get in mid ruds do not pull missed withholds or do anything else but correct the r2 and r3 do not do new lists or new approaches or new actions until the old action is straightened up to continue is to produce the sad effect if the pc is already in the sad effect at session start treat it as an arc break with the drill given the pc does not realize that anything has been missed he or she thinks its the auditor the subject or the tools and will target only these the fact of the arc break must be noted and the substance of the criticism must be ignored by the auditor if the pc knew what had been missed there would be arc break the missed withhold of the item or whatever is not only missed by the auditor but by the pc the pc wont ever spot it left on his own its up to the auditor the auditor only must make up his or her mind as to whats wrong the directions of the pc even skilled scientologist as pc are nearly always wrong the auditor is there to listen and compute as its the pcs bank the pc cant compute on his or her own case taking the pcs directions will always involve and prolong the arc break what really caused it will be occluded to the pc dont always do something different than what the pc says by averages the pc might have accidentally hit on it just do what is necessary to straighten out the r2 and r3 just dont depend on the pc to tell you know your r2 and r3 you the auditor are the only one present who can think clearly thats what youre for the d of ps view the d of p has different view of an arc break it is by sessions according to auditors reports to get case going again that has gone into stage three examine yesterdays reports look for change in pcs goals and gains and correct the session before the one in which they changedwhen an auditing supervisor becomes an auditor he or she carries this habit forward into auditing and presented with an arc breaking pc in session tends to look to yesterday but in session the arc breaking action usually occurs only seconds or minutes before the arc break look there when auditing the drill this drill is to be used in all practical sections before the student is turned loose on r2 or r3 designation r2 and r3 drill one purpose to prevent errors in r2 and r3 and to prevent upsets in the pcs case theory the effort of pc at the start of an arc break is to stop the auditor the pcs effort is aimed at the auditors skill person the subject auditing tools or the room the comments are critical whether jocular or misemotional when this effort fails to stop the auditor and the auditor presses on with auditing the pc is overwhelmed and goes rapidly down tone scale in severe r2 or r3 arc break the pc will stay down scale for minutes hours days weeks or months until the arc break is repaired by correcting the r2 or r3 error made immediately before the arc break the correct action is to prevent all possibility of the auditor becoming too enturbulated to think prevent all engagement in refutation of the pcs accusations give the auditor time and calm to correct the r2 or r3 test the correction by seeing if it stops the arc break and only then recommence the session the key is that even the most startled auditor seeing an arc break begin can associate it with the word break the drill is always used in actual sessions even when the auditor thinks he knows the reason for it drill auditor list the items in this room coach privately makes up his mind which of the arc break points is wrong does auditing command briefly and then unexpectedly criticizes with greater or lesser violence auditor room tools subject or self or drops into simulated tears or apathy auditor thank you we will now take short break gathers papers and leaves room shuffles papers and returns into room auditor i would like to do short assessment on you auditor does actual emeter assessment from standard hcobulletin question list which will be provided from time to time based on the principal causes of r2r3 arc breaks finds the one the coach was hiding by actual meter reaction auditor i find we have gives cause found and we will now locate it is that all right with you coach okay auditor the session is resumed coach thats it in actual practice the auditor would have examined the papers of the pc to come to some conclusion about the case in private and seen what was wrong or seen the d of p or somebody else for help and then would

dont force the pc tv5 p 2559 ntv vii p 7075 hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 18 march 1963 central orgs franchise r2r3 important data dont force the pc never force pc to list when doing r212 or 3m especially 3m if the pc has difficulty listing three things may be wrong 1 the item being listed is wrong way to 2 it may be wrong item even from another gpm 3 it may be an item from some other gpm pc actually cant help but list easily if its the right item that the list is coming from in the usual case listing from right item requires only the most occasional giving of the auditing question by the auditor once at the start of the list once after each interruption to check something between the pc just gives items in steady flow occasionally the pc asks for the question if the auditor has to give question for each item hegets man theres one of the above 3 wrong wrong way to mass moves in on wrong way to list question its being given who or what would loud voices oppose and it should be who or what would oppose loud voices if its wrong 1 the mass moves in 2 the pc starts to discolor 3 the pc has to continuously repeat the question to himself 4 the pc cant wrap his mind around the question 5 the pc discolors or darkens 6 the tone arm goes unreasonably high above 5 in some cases 7 the pc may arc break if in the presence of such symptoms the auditor forces the pc to go on listing real trouble can then develop as the mass caves in on the body body vs thetan to understand this trouble we have to review what we have known for years about bodies and thetans the thetan is not the body the bank belongs to the thetan not to the body you are running thetan and his bank while helped and hindered by the body the body helps the auditor because it provides communication relay to thetan who cannot yet speak hear or act without body the emeter cans are held by the bodys hands the bodys voice box magnifies the thetans speech and body lips larynx etc add diction the ears magnify the auditors voice the body relays various senses and somatics to the thetan the body discolors when mass from the bank is brought in on it further because he is in body you can tell if the pc is sitting in the pcs chair joke the body hinders the auditor by being fragile life long before auditing has been keying the thetans masses in on this body in auditing masses are released off the body and out of the thetans bank the body accustomed after all to masses keying in on it in life can still survive lot of bad auditing but why as you go earlier and earlier in the bank the power of the thetans mockups increases earlier on the track the thetan was more powerful and made more formidable mockups thus the earlier the gpm you are addressing certainly beyond the 3rd the more care you have to use not to pullmasses in on the body which is to say the more accurate you have to be now as the thetan by clearing gpms becomes more and more able to handle and recognize goals and items the auditor tends to more and more abandon the safety points of r3m these are testing the goal making the opptermterminal test for each ri watching the tendency of the needle to tighten watching for pcs darkening abandoning these the auditor tends to race on finding more gpms goals and ris cleaning up nothing behind him this is wrong test the goal after every ri you find test every ri you find for terminal or oppterm really stay alert for the tightening needle and high ta that shows an error watch carefully for pc darkening the more advanced the gpm the more careful you have to be of the body dont go plunging on after an arc break find why by the arc break assessment and straighten it up when you complete gpm go about 2 items deep into the next one find its goal and then go back and put in the bmrs on every item in the former line plot and give the gone goal an 18 button prepcheck only then proceed on into the next gpm whose goal has been found items get easier to find as you advance into new gpms lists get shorter but the ris are harder and harder on the body when done wrong so be sure and then proceed and if the pc wont list for any reason even his own balkiness find out whats wrong before the current action and be sure that was it before proceeding its easier to lose session time in looking for former errors than in trying to revive pc or heal screaming arc break even the most accurate auditing gives the pc heavy somatics thats ok just dont force the pc beyond where he can easily go the real howling arc breaks only come after you have forced the pc onward after something has gone wrong if you have howling arc breaks with pc you have forced the pc into channel where the pc cannot easily go wrong item listing completely wrong item which did not fire or which did can happen in number of ways if you list an ri wrong way to you will get high ta and fewer rrs on the list further you may just run out of rrs on the next list or one or two lists down and real catastrophe you can find on wrong wayoppose an item out of an adjacent gpm for which you have found goal the item you find wont fit the goal of the gpm you are supposed to be running best thing to do is abandon it but put on the plot and go back and find which ri behind you was wrong way oppose it will tick or fire put in the bmrs on it and list it the other way to on later gpms the pc will easily overlist and list beyond the one you are trying for and get the next in line the way to tell is test the listing question for clean every five items the pc gives the moment its clean stop listing for instance in the 4th gpm you are listing somebody who cant whisper line plot hco bulletin of march 13 and you overlist you will get loud voices on the list but you will find whisperer as the last rring item which will read then if you omit the termoppterm test and assume whisperer is an oppterm you will do wrong way oppose and may get into another gpm entirely however especially after bmr on it whisperer wrong way opposed will now fire again with an rr but the pc still arc breaks why you overshot on the somebody who cant whisper oppose list and you have bypassed ri loud voices bmr the rrs earlier on the somebody who cant whisper oppose list and youll find loud voices probably fires now or do it by pcs recognition but the item recognized has to fire with an rr or when you do whisperer right way oppose youll also get loud voices auditing on 3m is like threading through mine field with the pc ready to explode if you stray experience will let you relax traveling rr in listing the rr travels down the list it comes from the goal charge therefore it can travel you can sometimes bring it back up list with enough bmr to an earlier rr seen on listing the most weird thing in 3m is the goal as an ri behavior on mar 13 hco bulletin to scream as an ri bottom of plot page 2 as you list it as an ri in its proper sequence on the plot not as goal oppose it behaves as an ri oppose list not as source list on it the pc will put usually the goal of the next gpm on it will usually be found as the last rr item on the list happy people but the goal of the next gpm on that list will not rr when said to pc not until you take all the goals off the ri oppose list and nul them as goalslist then the goal of the next gpm will fire and prove out in short only the last rr seen on nulling on an ri oppose list will fire with an rr this does not mean the remaining items seen to rr while listing are not ris in their own right it only means that on any list the rr travels to the last rring item seen on listing when the list is complete items which rred on listing will not fire as part of the list but taken off the list and known by the pc to be off the list and called as themselves will rr when you get pc into the 5th gpm this becomes very invariable and gets vastly in your road as you can bypass the next ri you should get and find the one after that or you can lose the next gpms goal as it doesnt rr on the ri oppose list from the last goal while still on that list its okay if you know it can happen it will help you cure an ailing line plot or goals list in hurry rrs travel on 3m lists down to the last rr and if it has travelled the earlier rrs items or goals on an ri list seen on listing will not rr until they have been taken off that list and are called in their own right wrong wording always be sure you have the right wording for an item or goal slightly wrong wording for goal will cause it to rs and fizzle out get the pc to change the wording on it and it may rr on and on if pc arc breaks on goals list you had and passed the goal or you had the goal with slightly wrong wording the pc still arc breaks on wrong wording as its missed withhold pcs usually put down varied wordings on goals lists encourage it even though its representing an rring item if goal fires rses fizzles vanishes get other wordings for it and it may rr beautifully example to succeed on checking rred six times blew ta down rsed madly rsed dwindled and then ticked auditor went on pc arc broke auditor went back over list got wording for to succeed as to be successful goal rred beautifully arc break onward bound into next gpm items with the article or the omitted or added or plural for singular will not fire well or at all example item listed sensation checked out as sensation fire pc recalls it should be asensation item fires and is an ri accuracy of listing exactly what the pc said is important he usually said it right the first time say it back and check it out the same way sometimes pc wants to change word in an item being called always let him but check both versions the one listed and the one changed the one listed is usually right if recorded right by the auditor item from another gpm stray ri is an ri from gpm of another goal than the one being worked you can get goal or item from another gpm by backwards oppose or overlisting in finding the goal of another gpm than the one you want to enter this is easy it fires very badly ticks and fools around an ri from another gpm on the other hand fires well when you do the how does the goal relate to _______ step and the pc cant relate it or mass appears when he tries watch it you probably have backwards oppose behind you or have bypassed an ri by overlisting or underlisting or more probably both what to do put the stray ri on the plot marked as stray and locate the wrong way oppose or bypass on your line plot and correct it will do harm to 4 way package the stray ri but it probably wont do any good either two gpms later you suddenly find it as new ri the pc will probably arc break at this time but the reason for the arc break lies in an earlier wrong way oppose or bypassed ri or ris use the stray ri as signal that wrong way oppose exists behind you or an ri has been bypassed the proper order of actions if the above happens is to 1 locate the bypassed item 2 use it to continue your ri oppose spiral staircase 3 ignore the wrong way oppose item dont instantly right way oppose it and any stray ri letting them come up in their proper sequence matter how much later that is minimize goal oppose listsonly do goal oppose list at the start of the first gpm and thats it you dont need any more if you go right youll go into gpms in proper sequence on the spiral staircase with further goal oppose lists for any goal you will find however that the goal as an ri see to scream as an ri page 2 hco bulletin march 13 1963 operates as an ri oppose list and will be done in its proper time and place this is not source list and behaves as an ri oppose list take the goals off it to another list and nul them for the next gpm only one goal oppose list is needed for case after that always use the last ri that still fires with an rr as your source for ri oppose lists clear test you dont need to do clear test it might mess up the bank natural free needle without prepcheck begins to appear around the fifth gpm check out first goal clear by his or her line plot if it compares in all respects to that of hco bulletin march 13 and the goal is clean saying it to the pc call it first goal clear bracelet clear would be actually theta clear and would emerge after the 5th to 8th gpm had been cleaned up by present calculation free needle totally stable theta clear emerges after the 8th gpm has been run calculation on operating thetan exists at this moment but at guess its well beyond the 8th gpm up to the 6th gpm clear test is liable to foul up the case little so save it for later and really send up rockets in celebration thetans have done lot of living routine 3m is complex and unless the auditor is well trained has pitfalls but we have years to

observations which has arisen in clearing and which will always remain true is summed up in this line dont try to make an ot before you make clear stressing this conclusion is vitally important and will always be important why in their understandable enthusiasm to do the most for the pc and obtain the highest gain auditors tend to get as many ris and goals as possible the face acquired in making third goal clear also operateson the part of the pc there is always some pc pressure to get on with it find more ris find more goals there is also face im 3rd goal clear the auditor in his own enthusiasm for more gpms heeds the pcs protest against case repair and prepchecks and commits the following crime without making first goal attempts to make an ot he does this in gradients without making an actual first goal clear the auditor with the pcs full insistence makes third goal clear this law takes over in the face of such press on tactics rule you cannot have an any goal clear without clearing the goal and all its gpm to do this it is necessary to observe this rule rule goal is not clear until all rocket reading items in that goal have been found properly aligned and discharged and the goal has been fully prepchecked the next goal is available and easily found ris in the next gpm are readily found there seems to be reason to waste auditing time by cleaning up the last gpm this is true of any next gpm however just going on and on carries its penalties if we persist in failing to fully clear each gpm we can expect general bog down in all of scientology why because we will all become subject to the very real penalties of failing to clear gpms before going on it is alright to find 2 ris into the next gpm and to find its goal that is as it should be but it is not alright not to go back and fully polish up the gpm just left this is true for all gpms you havent got first goal clear if you havent cleared the first gpm and goal so dont announce first goal clears if you havent cleared fully the first goal having the 2nd 3rd 4th 5th etc goals and some ris in each still doesnt make first goal clear the following liabilities occur when the gpm just left is not fully cleaned up 1 the pc drags mass from the last gpm into the next gpm 2 accuracy of ri finding in the next gpm is diminished 3 the pc being more subject to errors in auditing isfar more likely to heavily arc break 4 body mass weight does not diminish 5 pcs reality on the next gpm ris is diminished 6 feeling of lassitude shadow of the sad effect comes over the pc and he or she does his own work in life with less enthusiasm 7 the pcs health and actions are better but one does not see what one expects from clearing therefore clearing is downgraded by the auditor and pc and others 8 the actual soaring gains of clearing are not observed since the gpm and its goal are not actually cleared but only deintensified clear tests which will be issued from time to time should be scrupulously passed before going on to the actual running of the next bank if these simple precautions are observed clearing is formidable to behold if they are not observed then clearing wont be observed because it hasnt been done dont try to make an operating thetan before you make clear the results will be far far below that of just first goal clear lot of time and agony went into discovering these things i

hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 29 march 1963 central orgsfranchise summary of security checking as security checking is the one form of auditing that does not interfere with r2 or r3 i asked reg sharpe to do rundown on what we know about it ron hubbard ____________ security checking has an important part to play in modern auditing we have the datum that as pc comes up in responsibility so does his recognition of overts this factor can seriously hamper pcs progress security checking is case cleaning activity and it should be thoroughly and competently applied it is not something to be done just for forms sake it is done to speed up the advance of the case pc who has overts ready to be pulled just cannot make the rapid progress which modern clearing techniques make possible so dont underestimate the value of sec checking learn to do it learn to do it well and when you do it go in and do an expert and thorough job security checking is specialized type of auditing and it takes lot of skill and at times some courage to do it well auditors must not be kind nor yet unkind this does not mean that you steer luke warm middle course between kindness and unkindness neither of these two impostors have anything to do with it you just go in and audit you go in to findand that means dig for overts if you go in with pcs needle clean and your questioning can get that needle to react then you are winning the success of an auditor can be measured by the extent to which he can get reactions on the needle and then cleaning those reactions getting more reactions and cleaning those and so on its probing operation like probing for sore places on body locating them and then healing them the skilled auditor however gets to the root of the trouble and clears up whole batch of overts at once security checking is done in model session the beginning rudiments are put in and by the time you start the body of the session in this case the security check the pc should have nice clean needle the next thing is to tell the pc that you are going to help him to clean up and really clean up the questions on the form that you are using remember it is the question you are going to clean not the needle youve already got clean needle and you could probably keep it clean by bad tr 1 failure to dig or just sheer bad auditing its the question you are cleaning and in the process you are going to get dirty or reacting needle so really get it over to your pc that you are going to clean the question the next action is to announce the first question that you are going to clean the important thing at this stage is to groove in the question there are variety of ways to do this eg ask what the question means what period ortime the question covers what activities would be included where the pc has been that might be something to do with the question if any other people are likely to be involved in other words you are steering the pcs attention to various parts of his bank and getting him to have preliminary look when this has been done using very good tr l you give him the questionoff the meter you can forget your anti q and drill you take your pcs answer and bird dog him about it if he gives you general answer you ask him for specific time or specific example dont accept motivators if he gives you motivator you say ok but what did you do there and you want something before the motivator example pc i got mad at him because he kicked my foot aud what had you done before he kicked your foot in this case the pc is giving an overt i got mad at him but in fact he is cunningly selling the motivator he kicked in the foot so the rule here is go earlier than the motivator similarly you dont accept criticisms unkind thoughts explanations you want what the pc has done and you want the time place form and event when you have succeeded in this you dont leave it there you ask for an earlier time he had done something like it and you keep going earlier what you are after is the earliest time he stole hit somebody got angry with pc or whatever is his crime get the earliest one and you will find that the others will blow off like thistledown keep sly eye on your meter and you can tell when you are in hot area use it to help you to know where to dig but dont use it to steer the pc at this stage this encourages laziness on the part of the pc you want him in there foraging about and digging up his bank in the process only when your pc is thoroughly and healthily exhausted do you check the question on the meter if you have done an excellent job the question will be clean however if you get read you steer your pc by saying there there whenever you see repetition of the original read when he finds it you repeat the procedure outline above you dont go back to the meter until you have really got all there is to be got when you have got clean needle you put in your mid ruds on the session and if these are clean and only if they are clean you go on to the next question if the ruds do bring out something then you go back to the question and start over again and so you go on cleaning question after question the success of sec check session is not judged by the number of questions cleaned but by the amount of looking you succeeded in making your pc do if you do this properly that is the whole outline you will have well satisfied pc if he arc breaks then you have missed something so pull your missed withholds arising ta is clue to something missed if pc isnt happyvery happyat the end of question then you have missed something pcs will tell you hundred and one things that are wrong with your auditing the d of ps instruction the form of the question etc but they all add up to the same thingsomething has been missed finally do end ruds and these should run quickly and smoothly run bit of havingness if necessary sharpen your pencil for the goals and gains and youll leave the session happy and satisfied because thats how your pc feels one word of warning if you leave question unflat mark it on your auditors report and tell your pc it isnt flat good digging issued by reg sharpe

sthil students clear requirement regarding getting clear as student on the saint hill special briefing course the following should be noted there is obligation on the part of the course to clear student before termination while everything will be done to assist clearing the student and while it is my desire to clear the student this is favor extended not students right some students will not industriously apply themselves in their course periods and cannot therefore be graduated up through units fast enough to get them clear before termination the better students are matched in so far as possible in auditing teams this leaves the unwilling student auditor teamed with auditors of less skill this reduces chances of getting clear on those who do not apply themselves or will not audit wellthe course is not an hgc and those who attend it only in the hope of receiving auditing are therefore disappointed as they will receive only as much auditing as they give and only of the quality they seem to deserve the rule of help to be helped is adhered to in so far as possible while almost all students are people we are proud of some few waste their case by running up overts against the course and causing administrative upsets there are then three general categories of upset 1 the student who wont study 2 the student who wont audit and 3 the student who causes heavy administrative upsets by spreading rumors writing untrue tales home constantly nagging instructors etc among these we do not include students arc broken in session as this is fairly routine occurrence and passes away but included are students who claim they are so arc broken in session they cannot study or work we know this doesnt hold true as others can study and work and audit after session arc breaks therefore the course instructors reserve the right when authorized by the course supervisor to suspend or cancel the clearing requirement of any student consistently falling into categories 1 2 or 3 above regardless of explanations given by the student this may or may not affect classification it certainly does affect the amount of time and effort spent by instructors on getting student clear suspension or cancellation of the clearing requirement means that the course resigns any further responsibility for getting the student clear and is at liberty to terminate the student at the end of the course period with or without classification student who spends three weeks with minimal study effort student who consistently fails to follow directions in auditing his pc or who does not produce results and the student who consistently runs up overts against the course is liable to suspension or cancellation of the clearing requirement in short if student by studying and auditing wont help us get other students clear or if student seeks to damage our course and its efforts to clear others through graduating students we cannot honestly endeavor to clear that student l ron hubbardlrhjwrd

longer reads on the meter check the question for read about every five items when it longer ticks makesure it isnt ticking from protest or decided add five more items test read it if it still doesnt tick end list if it does continue list null this list by elimination starting at the top of the list calling each item three times and marking in or out until only 1 or 2 are in put in lefthand buttons on remaining items one should now rocket read that is your top oppterm ri this source list is source list the reliable item may appear anywhere on it consider all lists of 3m as source lists now in r212 ri oppose lists still exist this most likely list will probably be less than hundred items long it may be only 10 items long if its longer the question is being protested which makes the question read this gives you the top of the gpm hitherto hard to get and usually missing in case repairs i had to get clever on this one everybody was missing the top of gpms until case was repaired note the exact listing rules for this most likely list will be published in subsequent hcob take whatever you get that is an unmistakable top oppterm see line plot hcob 13 mar 63 ii the end of gpm where it is the most screamish use it and go on with the following steps after you find 3 or 4 ris downwards go back and see if the ri you found for top oppterm ticks when read to pc on meter if it does now dont throw away the ris youve just gotten just extend the most likely list and null what you extended take the ri you now find for top oppterm and use it as per steps below you will find you are going up now higher in the gpm complete it upwards until you reach the real top of the oppterm column then resume with the former last ri lower in the gpm where you left off going down and continue to the bottom of the gpm exactly as in these steps below the toughest part of the gpm to get is the top end and as its the one most dramatized by the pc it is the most important in his estimation if you dont get it all at the top the pc will drag that mass down through the lower gpms and things will be less real on the lower ris and harder to find the only time you will have difficulty is when few ri gpm extends into present time up from the first gpm you contact that means goal above the pcs first goal you can also have trouble when this most likely listing system is used if the pcs first gpm is only half lived through and has its top missing never formed this will become apparent as the pc lists and tests will show you have terminal you can in such case cope by using what you find but realizing you have terminal on the most likely list this is rare so dont invite it the status of pcs first gpm can be established by meter questions do you have goal closer to present time or above this if the pcs first gpm meaning the first one contacted by the auditor always not the earliest one on the track is truncated missingat the top the remaining gpms in the bank will still be of standard size and content even if you have trouble finding the top of truncated gpm still dont do goaloppose list if most likely doesnt work on truncated gpm try least likely version 3 compare and test ri note if getting ri blew down ta ask pc if this is the item if it turns on more mass ask how it relates to the goal check goal for read read next question to pc as terminal then as an oppterm determine which one gives least mass and use that way of oppose however if this ri found in step 2 is anything but an oppterm you have bypassed an item or over or underlisted or its not pcs goal also the first gpm can have been only partially formed and the top oppterm does not easily express the goal in which case youll get terminal if so youll know by test 4 obtain conditional top terminal using question who or what would oppose top oppterm just found list check the question about every five items given immediately that it longer ticks add five more test ri and question again for tick if it still doesnt tick null it if it does get five more etc null either by calling each item 3 times in sequence until only one is left and put in left hand buttons on it suppress careful of failed to reveal or by calling only the rrs seen on listing each one one time and put in lefthand buttons on it as all lists in r3m are now all to be considered source lists the former method is safer but harder on the pc these are very short lists all ri oppose lists are they may be as small as 10 items certainly seldom more than 20 length is determined by the needle tick of the question read to pc vanishing if you overlist you will miss an ri err with bypassed item do the next one wrong way oppose and send the pc into another gpm the whole error in listing is bypassing items by over or underlisting that the listing question ticks means the reliable item is not yet on the list or there are more items needed to discharge the tick that the listing question ceases to tick means the reliable item is either on the list or willbe in the next three or four given by the pc 5 compare and test ri ask the pc if item turned on more mass ask pc if its the item ask pc if ri found opposes the one it was listed from ask pc how it relates to goal test ri for term or oppterm by asking next listing question one way and then the other who or what would oppose who or what would ____oppose the one that turns on the least mass is it this is however terminal and if it isnt the list you did to find it was little too long or little too short find an earlier ri on it or extend it for another ri 6 obtain next oppterm list who or what would ri just found oppose null list by elimination or by rrs as above find ri always read the ri you are listing from and then the question you are listing on doing this jogs the question to read again when it might not if the read wont go off the ri you are listing from it is surely arrived at after an ri has been bypassed redo the list it came off from 7 compare and test ri ask pc if ri turned on more mass ask pc if its pcs item ask pc if ri is opposed by terminal it was listed from ask pc how ri relates to goal test goal test ri for term or oppterm 8 obtain next terminal list who or what would oppose_____ri just foundcomplete by testing question for reads null by elimination or by rrs seen on listing obtain ri test ri youre listing from for tick 9 compare and test ri ask pc if ri turned on more mass ask pc if its pcs item ask pc if ri opposes the one it was listed from ask pc how it relates to the goal read goal test ri for term or oppterm it should be terminal 10 continue steps 6 7 8 9 above in sequence 11 toward bottom of the gpm 20 or 30 number is guess ris from top you will find and this is not guess terminal somebody or something with the goal pcs goal or somebody with the goal pcs goal there will be an oppterm then the goal pcs goal then an oppterm then just the pcs goal to whatever this last ri is called the goal as an ri there we stop all actions as above the pc can know that these pat bottom gpm ris exist he can even be shown model line plot in misguided enthusiasm the pc can put all of them on the list at once only the right one in sequence will rr and if hes been premature in putting them down they wont fire so dont worry about it just be sure you get those ris see hcob 13 mar 63 for the pattern 12 list final list when you definitely arrive honestly at the goal as an ri to scream to whatever just the goal all by itself you will find that although the goal has ceased to rr this goal as an ri still has an rr on it now the list we do from this is the final list of that gpm and it works like the old goal oppose list and it is the only place we now do goal oppose list its long list the only long list we now do the list wording is exactly and only this who or what would pcs goal oppose who or what would to scream oppose we ignore any complaints from the pc that he orshe cant answer the question even hint there are some goals it might oppose as well as items this is listed to fifty beyond the last rr or rs on the list and until the question longer ticks this list will have on it the next goal when complete and so i found way to give you the next goal without any fumbling it may be very long it must have goals on it as well as items dont do it until the line plot is complete or youll get an item off it not goal 13 null the final list null by elimination the rrs seen on listing will have real bearing on the final ri so dont just read off the rrs chances are the final item the goal wont rr while listing and wont rr until the list is completely nulled find item it should be goal the goal of the next gpm 14 smooth out last gpm as soon as the goal of the next gpm is found make sure it fires nicely but dont get pc involved in it dont start to find ris in it yet or youll have to go on with next gpm and be trying to make an ot before you make clear 15 inspect old line plot each gpm should have its own line plot make sure pcs line plot is complete particularly at the top 16 inspect ris read over each ri on old line plot to see if one ticks include those on the plot that obviously belong to some other gpm if one is found ticking take the list off which it came not the list listed from it and renull it or extend it somewhat and renull new heretofore missing ri will turn up oppose it gently short list and in short do steps 6 7 8 9 on it depending for sequence on whether its terminal or an oppterm until the rr vanishes be careful not to leap into new gpm by overlisting or opposing backwards wrongway oppose lands you in different gpm usually if during inspection you find firing ri on the line plotrocket reading even though it was opposed the rule in the above paragraph still applies it was backwards oppose but the fault is that an ri was bypassed on an earlier list find the bypass and oppose it in this patch up or patching up gpm done by earlier versions you will find list even though rrs were seen on listing suddenly fail to give up an ri thats usually because the ri is already found the list has been tied back into the already existing ris put everything you find rightly or wrongly on the line plot theyre all the pcs items when the line plot is all smooth and looks like the 13 mar 63 hcob model go to next step however if the auditor has already found and listed other goals and the pc has 3 or 4 incomplete gpms the line plots will have become interdependent and straightening them up depends on running the last goal found as per this hcob finding the next goal but ris into its gpm and then going back for smoothout of the others danger only discomfort and more frequent arc breaks attend the condition where the auditor tried to make an ot before making clear just do the goal with the biggest read complete its plot but dont find ris in new goal found from it and work around as you can in the old mess until each gpm is complete 17 prepcheck old goal only when youve done all these steps on gpm do an 18 button prepcheck on the old goal counterbutton as it may be the next goal get in the bmrs on listing and on auditing on gpms 18 do next gpm exactly in accordance with the above steps 1 to 17 inclusive do the next gpm notes pcs attach far more importance to gpm messups and goal messups than they deserve just handle arc breaks with hcob 14 mar 63 arc breaks handling of and assessments for the cause of them and correct accordinglythe arc break assessment is always right bypassed items even bypassed goals and gpms wont kill the pc i know ive been in every crossfire that goals and gpms could produce as pc and im still alive even ifoccasionally frayed so stop worrying and do good job and do what you consider correct not what the pc insists upon and youll win through with your pc i admit it takes high level of courage to audit routine 3m but its the only safe road out from aberration _____________ in nulling single list that an item appears earlier on list is guarantee it doesnt appear later in the bank than the one you want _____________ dont fail to let pc have his ris and goals that they arent the ris or goals of the gpm you have to work doesnt make them not his develop the h factor its yours but its not due quite yet this is undoubtedly your goal on one that stayed in but isnt it but we have to find the gpm closer to where were working thats your ri all right but we need the consecutive one to the last we found _____________ in case repair use the above rundown to repair r3m2 when you run out of ris suddenly the rule is to find the item on the line plot that reacts on the meter renull or extend the list it came from and locate the bypassed item and proceed with that as though you hadnt found anything else _____________ if you encounter an ri that given to the pc turns on more mass extend or renull the list it came from and get another ri that doesnt but dont be too harsh with this rule some ris do turn on bit more mass particularly when the top of gpm has not been found _____________ if you find an ri that doesnt belong in this gpm put it on the line plot realize it came from wrongway oppose see if the list the ri you just opposed came from doesnt have bypassed item on it if so dont bother to rightway oppose the ri you wrongway opposed use the earlier ri and go on the reason you cant find an ri on list even though you saw rrs on listing is because the ri for that list has already been found or your list is just trifle short if you suddenly find rrs seen on listing list an earlier item was wrong bypassed or wrongway opposed locate and go on _____________if rr on items is getting smaller beware of having wrong goal or having gone into gpm you have goal for dont find more ris until you find whats wrong only finding ris for which you have goal will shut off the rr and rs finding the goal for them will turn the rr and rs back on _____________ if you have to put question mark after the list rrs and rses you are nulling with too low sensitivity setting put up the sensitivity until you can see whats happening or get one of the new listing meters _____________ if pc cognites on an item as you list and it rrs it must rr to be an ri say very good test the question for read if the question is clean read the item to the pc to make sure it rrs if the question still reads say im sure youre right however give few more so i can get the tick off this question do so test the question and read the pc the ri if it doesnt read put lefthand buttons in on it if it still doesnt read find the one that does pc wont arc break unless you give him an item that doesnt rr _____________ there are bonus packages in r3m if two items rr or rs on the list the list is incomplete complete it until question doesnt tick _____________ we will longer consider there are two kinds of lists due to the traveling nature of the rr on the list the last rr always reads but it may be after the ri we need to avoid bypassed items consider every list source list the ri can appear anywhere on it considering them all source lists ensures your finding the ri that should rr and in sequence _____________ the main danger in r3m is not wrongway oppose you can tell that fairly easily the danger lies in bypassing ris the way these get bypassed is to overlist or underlist _____________ if the rr seen on consecutive ris found is getting smaller as you find more you have the wrong goal for the gpm youre in either get into the right gpm or less preferably find the goal of the one youre working you can only get into the wrong gpm by having wrong goal in the first place or by bypassing ris resulting in opposingan ri wrong way to and getting thrown into another gpm or by moving down into the next gpm after the old goal has ceased to tick _____________ goal rr improves as you find successive ris right up to the moment it begins to occasionally r s and rr as marked on the line plot of hcob 13 mar 63 if goal doesnt read better on the meter after you find the top oppterm and terminal theres something wrong with that goal if the goal was wrong and the ris you found did rr use the oppterm to list goals from and the terminal to list goals against what might be the goal of oppterm and what goal would terminal be an overt against _____________ watch overshooting into the gpm below the one you should be working in you can miss the low ris somebody with the goal etc and plow on into the gpm below it without its goal after dozen or so ris without having the goal the pcs ability to rs and rr will shut off to be restored only when the goal for them is found _____________ tell your pc the best way in the world to commit thetancide is to selfaudit or selflist on r3m or to dope the line plot in advance if the pc thinks of goals or items out of session make the pc write them down and bring the list in but discourage it _____________ i saw the troubles you were having and have been

r3m2 what you are trying to do in clearing ntv vii p 936 previously considered confidential hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 6 april 1963 central orgs missions r3m2 what you are trying to do in clearing the final object of the auditor in clearing is to find goals and reliable items until all goals and reliable items have been found and each gpm is complete and all gpms are discharged now there are many ways to do this but finding and discarding the pcs ris is not one of them the more you get hold of ris and say thats not it the more miserable your pc will feel and the less clearing youll get done you can actually fumble and grope and get wrong ris and fall on your head but if you continue to get ris and put them on the line plot the pc will eventually get them all the length of time it takes to make multigoal clear does not depend upon the care with which rring ris are found it depends upon the number of rring ris and goals found only the comfort of the pc depends upon the care with which rring ris are found it is mechanical proposition there is just so much charge on case the case recovers when the charge is released charge is manifested on the emeter in the rocket reads contained in goals and their ris charge vanishes when ris are found and paired if you understand this much will come plain to you the idiocy of giving the pc an item that doesnt rr lies in the fact that it doesnt bleed off charge not that it will soon lead to an arc break the question is only how many reliable items and goals can be found on this case not how much time can be spent repairing the casea smooth run to clear would consist of the auditor finding the exact top of gpm running out the exact ris in it getting the next goal and prepchecking the goal of the bank just cleared all by 3m2 but with auditors and the pcs green and worried is this ideal always obtainable the answer is i am afraid the following is far more likely to be the case goal is found lot of ris are run out of its gpm the next goal is found it is discovered then that half the ris found in the old bank belonged in this new bank the new goal is run and many ris are found the auditor then finds the 3rd goal and many ris in it the auditor now discovers the top of the first bank was missing and goes back to find it he does so and discovers goal above the first goal he finds it and gets ris in it then to his horror finds there is bank two above the first bank found he finds that goal and gets ris in it and discovers the pcs present time he also finds that everything the pc was groaning about is contained in the bank that was closest to present time he cleans this up and then goes back down to discover that although the goals of the lower banks longer read he had never found half the ris in any one of them he remedies this and only then in succeeding banks finds he can smoothly carry on cleaning up each gpm fully as he goes there is nothing wrong with this when we had r212 it worked well then we got 212a and wasted fantastic amounts of time repairing 212 and we had few gains to show for it its the same with 3m and 3m2 the pc is far from comfortable with the auditor battering around missing gpms and goals the pc will swear hed rather be dead but the message is hell get clear if they keep at it on the basis of finding ris and goals as they can and therell come day when the pc will really shine do perfect clearing job if you can if you cant just find goals and ris and just keep going and youll still achieve the same end the error is not to find lots of rring ris and goals per unit of auditing time keep your records well just barrel along sounds barbarous and youll have to get used to arc breaks but the point is clearing can be done that way clearing cant be done by finding an ri getting nervous about it abandoning it finding another ri abandoning it fooling around whole sessions trying to find the top of gpm when whole panorama of ris exist lower down find goals and ris get the gpm as complete as you can but not at the expense of not finding ris yes it sounds barbarous and it is but it works remember youll have arc breaks assess for why repair it and keep goingthese are the only rules you must not violate 1 an ri must rr b cause ta blowdown and c turn on minimum of mass 2 if you find more than dozen ris which dont match the goal youre working on the pcs rr and rs will shut off 3 precise legible records and line plots must be kept 4 if the pc arc breaks do an arc break assessment and repair what you find dont do what the pc says take the pcs data but act only after an arc break assessment 5 dont prepcheck goal unless you know you have all the ris in that gpm and have done the final goal oppose list to the next gpm 6 list must be long enough to give only one rr on nulling and rs it must be short enough not to bypass items it must be long enough to have the needle clean on nulling it must be short enough not to get dirty needle through protest and collapsed mass now just how you list or find goals or repair is broader study all stemming from the above when you gain experience youll be able to come closer to perfect meanwhile dont stall around nervously find goals and ris learn to find an ri every 30 minutes of auditing time and then improve that speed there is certain exact quantity of charge on case its contained in goals and ris every goal you find deducts from that quantity every ri you find and oppose deducts from that quantity the more accurately you do it the less time youll waste on arc breaks and fumbling accuracy itself is only important because it saves auditing time but accuracy can become vice which gives one goals or ris found i know i have said do it right thats fair enough but im now saying do it as right as you can but do it at the start of his case the pc hasnt clue therefore he lists longer his confront is at its poorest therefore he fails to list the obvious green auditor on 3m2 does not really believe it is all as pat as made out therefore he always thinks the pc is different eventually both auditor and pc get the hang of the bank they learn that the bottom five ris on to catch catfishwill be catfish catcher somebody with the goal to catch catfish somebody or something with the goal to catch catfish the goal to catch catfish and to catch catfish the goal as an ri only what each opposes is variable they learn that the top terminal will be something like somebody who cant catch catfish and that the three highest oppterms from the top down will probably be catfish catchers catching catfish and people who catch catfish and they know that there may be ris term or oppterm in this goal like catching catfish the inability to catch catfish people who wont catch catfish etc and they know then that only the low oppterms and the middle ground are in serious question give the auditor and pc the next goal and theyll list away as usual but directly at what should be there and it goes like whirlwind early on without this experience both auditor and pc grope overlist fumble about so the first gpm run has the longest lists and the most errors clearing is not easy on the pc its not easy on new auditor and there will be times when both rue the day they ever got into the gpm but if they keep going finding goals and their ris faint streaks of predawn gray will begin to gleam ahead and then with perseverance day will break upon higher plateau than man has ever dreamed of before the mystics spoke of the abyss they said that in trying to cross it many fell into the darkness without knowing it they spoke of the goals problem mass the buddhists spoke of nirvana without knowing it they spoke of vanishing forever into the gpm nirvana they had become completely overwhelmed lacking meters and map we are scientologists we wont fall into the abyss and we wont join nirvana we have meters and map we know the rules and the way this is the greatest adventure of all time clearing the way is strewn with the skeletons and skulls of those who have tried over the past trillenia the bottom of the abyss is glutted with failures nirvana is choked with the overwhelmed to say it is not dangerous way would be false but it is not dangerous if you keep going finding goals and ris reducing the charge on the case handling the arc

list this list by the rules of the old goaloppose source list which is to say 50 items past the last rr or rs you will find that on subsequent goals the list is shorter but it still must be complete 50 past last rr or rs list is as long as it has to be to have clean needle and only one rr on the list on the most likely list at the beginning and the goaloppose list at the end of the gpm done after it is complete the 50 past the last rr and rs serves best the rr can be anywhere on source list when you x out an item in nulling be sure the item did not react on the needle to do otherwise is dishonest in the extreme x means reaction on needle overlisting causes dirty needle through protest and decide underlisting causes dirty needle and lots of items to react there are then still 2 kinds of lists for each gpm 1 the source list2 the ri oppose list there are only two of these source lists the most likely list at the start of each gpm done before any ris are found and b the goal as an ri oppose list at the bottom of the gpm done after all the ris of the gpm are found the most likely list results if completed in high oppterm of the gpm from this the remaining ris are found it is not absolutely necessary to do most likely list if you can get the top of the gpm by doing ri oppose lists from within the gpm itself common occurrence in second and onward gpms the goal as an ri oppose list at the bottom is done only after all the ris in the gpm are found it results in finding the goal of the next gpm between these two are the ri oppose lists the two source lists are long 50 items past the last rr or rs and the ri will be anyplace on them usually an item that did not rr when listed but rrs on nulling the ri oppose lists are relatively short they tend to be longer in the first and second gpms than in later ones but they are never very long they go perhaps 20 30 items in the first gpm fewer in the second as few as 5 or 10 in the third and remaining gpms the ri oppose lists are listed until neither the ri being listedfrom or the question tick this is the actual listing rule just list and test the ri being listed from and the question frequently about every 5 items you can add 5 for good measure or not overlisting an ri oppose list tends to bypass ris underlisting tends to bypass ris it is perfectly all right on an overlisted list to take an earlier rr than the last one seen on listing sometimes the pc overlists and goes around the corner to the next ri this is particularly true in later gpms then you have the actual ri earlier than the last rr it is more usual however to extend the list bit when this happens as the pc will put the first ri back on now after the next ri the next ri will not now rr and only the pcs actual ri will rr sometimes pcs argue and get arc broke when their ri occurs earlier than the last rr this however is an infallible sign of an incomplete list it needs two or three even nonreading items to complete it and the pc will put backhis insistedupon ri which now is the last rring item on the list in all listing nulling and taking rring items off any list certain amount of judgment is required it cant all be machinelike but that judgment doesnt include two rrs or one rr and one rs firing at the same time on list nor does it include giving the pc an item that read once on careful of nor does it include not trying to get the right ri skillful auditor becomes an adept pilot in listing nulling finding the pcs ri and giving it to the pc and in learning to become one an auditor makes mistakes thats okay youll also invent some shortcuts thats okay too as youll soon find that dropping the safety factors costs you more auditing time than you save and that the innovations introduced come hard against the unalterable rules of listing and nulling then youll be happy to do it right do it well and pick up speed that will list whole later gpm in single session all by the rules dopeoff and hard listing if the pc dopes off while listing its missed withhold however the missed withhold can also be that the question or item being listed from is wrong or the item is not on the list if pc doesnt list brightly and easily on any list the pc has missed withholds or has protested or decided out or is being listed on wrong question or from wrong item always try to pull missed withholds first if pc dopes off or isnt listing well consider the 3m mechanics that might be causing the dopeoff second if youre listing an ri wrongwayto however the trouble is more than boiloff the pc just cant do it without being whipped so dont force pc to list find out why he cant nulling lists the two source lists are nulled by elimination say the item three times mark it in or out when the end of the list is reached go back over the items left in go over all items on the list not just those that rred the ri you find will seldom have rred on listing on source list the item you will find possibly didnt rr when listed if source list is complete it looks like this on nulling catfish x tiger rr xa waterbuck x willow wand x game warden x the wind rr if source list is incomplete not only will the needle be dirty but it nulls like this catfish x tiger rr x waterbuck x willow wand x game warden x the wind you must not have more than one rs or rr on any list source or ri oppose this is invariable if you find an rr on source list you need only go on until you are sure there is other rr or rs on the list before giving the pc the item nulling the ri oppose list is entirely different the best system is l tell pc youre going to read last rs if any on list and do so it must not r s or rr if it does continue list 2 tell pc youre going to read the nexttothelast rocket reading item on list do so if it rrs continue list 3 tell pc youre going to read the last rocket reading item on list do so if it rrs say that rocket reads if it doesnt rr read the items above and below go up as high as five items and down as many if still rr read earlier rrs on list if still rr null the whole list by elimination if still rr retest reliable item its listedfrom if it reacts extend list until it doesnt react repeat above numbered steps if you still cant get an instant easily found rr examine earlier rrs if one ticks the list from which it came must be extended on an ri oppose list you almost never put ruds in on an item to make it fire when rr fires without coaxing the list is either over or underlisted if overlisted find an earlier item that drs on nulling and put in the three lefthand buttons on it suppress careful of fail to reveal however overlisting is rarer than youd think and treat it as an underlist until it gets to looking long and pc is getting edgy if still rr appears on reading to pc go back and find an earlier ri that ticks and extend the list it came off fromrrs on an ri oppose list should fire off right now the moment read with bmrs factually doing ri oppose lists is piece of cake walk in the park you should get an ri every seven minutes in the fourth or fifth gpm including administration and session actions if youre going well in doing source lists you should get an ri off one listing and nulling in about three hours in the third or fourth gpm all the rules of listing the gpm are known any variation in how theyre set forth in hco bulletins comes from observing auditors having trouble or possible shortcuts all rules given about listing in any hco bulletin are true the only question has been how does one accomplish them the above version of r3m2 listing and nulling will be found very

oppterms to be condition goal has condition being condition and people who are condition in that order the first six terminals from the bottom never vary except as to significance of the goal the fifth and sixth sometimes change places but all else is constant the top three terminals vary bit more but are quite similar to the examples given there are other similarities between these banks given and other gpms but they are not as fixed and invariablean auditor should be able to look at goal and know at once and exactly its three top oppterms its first six terminals and have good idea of the three top terminals the remainder of the ris of the goal will be much more variable the crossover the area in the center of gpm is the crossover this means the ris which cause the pc to become an opponent of his own goal in at least one term and oppterm the reason for the shift of attitude is plain pcs most easily find the crossover and are liable to try to give the crossover of some other gpm if you bypass an ri in the one youre working the usual how does this ri relate to to ____ test is almost always adequate however the crossover is only important as guide as to whether or not you are still in the gpm otherwise the middle items are not easily detected as belonging to the goal the relationship of goals only the first goal on the whole track is postulated without reason contrary to what we earlier believed all other goals are closely related pcs goals listed out in chronological order first on the track to the one in pt first goal contacted give story this makes it easy to locate consecutive goals once youre in the gpms the arrows above give the optimum order with which to find items the banks are lived in reverse order to the arrows above there are many more ris to an

as that routine 3 activity which directs the pcs attention while listing to the form of the inevitable reliable item providing it can be predicted this is new departure in scientology auditing it could be dangerous one if carried into directing goals or routine 212 ris it applies therefore only to the inevitable reliable items to be found in routine 3 line plots it is so much more upsetting to the pc and clearing to missthe right ri that the practice is excused indeed it must be done the law governing this is pcs ability to confront is directly proportional to the amount of charge removed from the gpms the pcs ability to confront is not proportional to the amount of confronting done in gpm there are only few things to be careful of in directive listing 1 that the charge if any of the question being listed from is also listed off even when the right item has been directed on to the list 2 that the auditor does not let himself be persuaded out of getting the right ri on the list 3 that the directed ri does actually fire with an rr when called regardless of mid ruds or td 4 that the directed ri is the right ri for that list 5 that that part of the line plot not common to all cases may not be directed on to list by the auditor definitions directed reliable item is one guided on to the list by the auditor it is one derived from the form of the gpm common to all cases _____________ how to direct listing the auditor knows that in every gpm except truncated ones which being the 1st gpm from present time may have the top missing the majority of the ris are common to all gpms see hco bulletin of 17 april 1963 complete gpm pattern and subsequent line plots most of these particularly top and bottom groups never change therefore the auditor with the pcs help determines what the inevitable ris should be confirms it with the meter gets the charge off the question by getting some more items on the list and gives the pc the right ri for that point in the bank or works with the pc to obtain that exact ri the first command that starts new gpm being audited is give the ultimate achievement of your goal in noun form get several of these nouns one will consistently rr thats the pcs ri give it to the pc do not overlist do not compromise with these rules the top terminal is then gotten by the question who or what would oppose noun form you just got get the right one by suggesting its probable form to the pc get thecharge off the question do not overlist you must stop pcs listing on ri oppose lists and check the question you then go through the proper 3m2 steps for tests etc give pc the right top terminal that has been found list who or what would top terminal oppose suggest it to the pc as it is known make sure the 2nd top oppterm gets on the list etc etc _____________ the problem if you dont select for the pc the inevitable ris as you list them the chances of the pc getting them in the first 3 gpms is so remote as to be nonexistent the pc will go through agony if theyre missed and youll lose his or her rr as this is the roughest part of the gpm further their undischarged mass will be carried down into all additional auditing and the pc will not lose the mass and may gain weight and youve set the stage for arc breaks galore further this gives you the rightness of the goal at once with messup of the pc by reason of long listing if the obvious top oppterm isnt there it either isnt the goal or is truncated gpm _____________ directing ris an auditor must become expert at preselecting ris for any given goal study hcob 17 apr 63

quite often as discreditable so its discreditable does it rr and discharge the top oppterm if so its the pcs give it to the pc and the pc will cognite and the ta will blow down if its still wrong youll soon run out of rr as you find more ris there are gpm ris above the top terminal or oppterm as shown on line plots for any given gpm but there may be another full gpm recently only partly formed

handling the gpm goals problem masses may be handled in several ways the only things that establish the best way are l speed of finding ris 2 accuracy of ris found 3 completeness of gpms ris 4 correct order of ris 5 pcs morale 6 easiness of the method on the pc 7 ease of handling by the auditor 8 resulting state of clearness of the pc immediately discounted then are those methods which put speed of finding ris second for it will be found that the slower you find ris the more the remaining factors above will suffer i have been over or through as pc almost any method of auditing gpm there could be and the one factor that stands out to both as an auditor and pc as well as case supervisor is that idling about trying to get it all now results in the destruction of both auditor and pc morale and consumes unrewarding session time why the law that covers this is pcs ability to confront is directly proportional to the amount of charge removed from the gpms the pcs ability to confront is not proportional to the amount of confronting done in gpm this is very important rule in practice it means get all the ris you can discharged as fast as you can it also could mean get all the gpms discharged as fast as you can but if this last means discharging partially many gpms it ceases to be true as the pc will go into hopeless confusion in the remaining charge it does meanl discharge the gpm you are working on as fast as you can regardless of skipping some ris regardless of reaching the top first 2 dont keep scrapping ris found just because there may be some higher than those you are finding later 3 dont let the pc flounder hopelessly in some area of the gpm that cant be gotten just yet 4 keep line plot of each block of ris you find join them up later you have pattern you will be able to follow it easily most of the time but where you cannot get the pattern to go right jump to another lower part of the pattern where it will go right and go on with it you will find it isnt the wrongness of the pattern that gives you trouble its the inability of the pc to confront answer remove charge because the pc arc breaks on missed ris tell the pc were going to miss some items those already found are valid were going to get some lower ones and get the charge off and then come back for what weve missed the pc wont arc break on the contrary his morale will increase in most cases and then of course with the gpm shot full of holes the pc can confront better and the second pass through the gpm will get some of the missing ones and the third pass will assemble the lot the only things to avoid are getting the pc confused by too many shifts and dizzy through invalidation of existing ris already found the rules for this method of handling are these l always start at the top or as close to the top as you can and go down earlier in time through the gpm this is true for every pass through the gpm 2 dont let the pc flounder endlessly searching if it seems all you can do is flounder go lower to another known part by pattern of the bank and get going again 3 realize that the final pass through will find all ris rring again as they are put in proper order on the final line plot the rr travels from top oppterm to top terminal and right on down to the goal as an ri terminal this rr has to be passed through the complete finished bank as the last action of assembly of the final line plot even though they rr again when put in their right places they are mostly discharged by the original finding4 use all sections found already as blocks of ris dont try to find them again the rr has to be passed through them as they are joined up and they may get corrected but dont throw away sections found 5 the pc suffers from charge on the bank not from significance of ris significance gives the details of the aberration but its magnitude is established by charge 6 it can be assumed that two fast passes through gpm and final assembly pass will do more to clear the gpm than one painfully slow fumbling pass where the pcs efforts are always getting invalidated 7 all ris must rr when found or charge comes off see note below 8 the pattern of gpm is used throughout to help guide the pc 9 do not redo block of ris already found until the whole gpm has been covered at least once through _____________ handling the goals problem masses you will almost never get the gpm that is nearest pt as the pcs first goal found this goal is usually the most offerable goal by its own wording very secret or very blatantly offerable type wordings are found first forced into view by their top terminals or oppterms therefore do not assume ever that the pcs first goal is the pt goal it almost never is the actual pt area goal contains all the pcs hidden standards and chronic present time problems therefore one must attain and run it eventually before getting earlier track goals rule gpm which has its top oppterm and terminal is rarely the pt gpm thus these steps apply 1 run the goal you first find on the pc if its right goal has gpm 2 clean it up very carefully as per this or later hco bulletins 3 do not oppose the final goal as an ri ri at the bottom of the bank what goal would goal oppose leave that ri firing 4 leave the lowest lst bottom oppterm of the goal with whatever rrs do not adjust it as you will eventually haveto it depends on the next lower goal which remains unknown at this time 5 leave the lower earlier gpm strictly alone for now regardless of pcs interest in it 6 do the top source list of the gpm you have just run what goal would oppose goal whose gpm you ran 7 find the next gpm closer to pt goal 8 handle completely the later gpm as per this hco bulletin or later advices 9 do what goal would oppose one you just handled 10 handle gpm found 11 eventually by this method find the pt gpm and handle it fully 12 when you are completely certain you have the pt gpm pcs current life name or person is part of it and its top may be missingtruncated and have handled it fully trace back through all ris and earlier banks found and only then prepcheck these goals as you complete them on the way down 13 reach eventually the first goal ever found on the pc but not handled do its ri oppose list and find the earlier goal adjust the bottom ri of the first goal ever found on the pc prepcheck the goal 14 handle the next earlier gpm for which you have just found the goal fully as per this hco bulletin or later advices 15 continue earlier and earlier in the gpms handling each one fully before getting the next until you reach time zero for gpms do not continue to go earlier with gpms until you have handled everything up to pt avoid even finding the goal of the earlier gpm step 3 above until you are ready to run that whole gpm the charge on early gpms is fantastic and the more gpms unhandled later on the track nearer pt the harder it is on the pc to go into earlier further from pt gpms the pc drags the pt gpm and others near it that have not been run through earlier gpms if they are prematurely handled the method is summed by 1 get goal 2 handle the bank of the goal you get 3 get to pt gpm by gpm handling each as you go4 smooth and prepcheck goals on the way down 5 then head for the earlier track violations of this method will account for any casualties suffered in running r3 violations will occur as the whole pressure of the pcs interest is on earlier track and pcs sell hard to handle the earlier banks but whatever the sales talk it is very hard on the pc and auditor to go into gpms earlier on the track than the first goal found before later gpms are all handled and fully discharged the pc finding himself with the earlier goal found in violation of step 3 above of the 15 steps will be so interested in it that he or she will try to move heaven and auditors to run it not to go forward toward pt auditors unable to find goals closer to pt will go back and run it well if you do do good job of it and then try to get to pt but youll wish youd tried harder to get the banks upward toward pt not back down toward the beginning of track l ron hubbard founder 059 hcob 24 apr 63 r3m2 tips the rocket read of reliable item ntv p 11820 previously considered confidential hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 24 april 1963 missions routine 3m2 tips the rocket read of reliable item the right r3 reliable item on list rocket readsdifferently than the other rrs the experienced auditor will get to know it the right ri usually has softer rr it is already disintegrating it is accompanied by blowdown of the ta the wrong rr is hard crisp and real fine demonstration rr it is not accompanied by blowdown of the ta it is pretty but it isnt taking off charge the right ris rr is quite often detected by only seeing its accelerated start or its whipcrack end it is longer than the wrong ris rr sometimes so long its end is right off the right hand of the dial it may look therefore to the new observer like very rapid fall with an accelerated start accompanied by ta blowdown sometimes the right ri loses its charge so fast that it rrs only once on call and would have to be tiger drilled to be made to fire again as calling it may turn on somatics on the pc the pc suppresses second call of it the wrong ris rr fires well but has blowdown it is shorter to an uninitiated auditor the ta sailing down or up on low ta case 15 had better be called an adequate read for an ri then he will begin to see the accelerated start as he gets more experience on the whipcrack end and realize that right ris in r3m are long loose and disintegrating and that wrong ris while they rr beautifully do not disintegrate on being called and the ta remains up or very low none of this applies necessarily to the rrs seen in finding or checking goals but these too may have disintegrating rr and heavy blowdown but new goal must continue to rr none of this excuses accepting an ri that does not rr an ri must rr to be accepted an ri with mere fall is not acceptable _____________ nulling r3 ri oppose lists if you have to null list with xs and s for an ri to be found it is almost certain that the right ri is not on the list the right ri explodes when put down or called the ri list that has to be nulled by elimination does not have the ri on it the exception is the source list which of course is nulled in the usual way _____________ listing rules all listing rules ever released apply to ri lists except length of ri oppose lists in r3m even if they are only two items long if two items fire in the same list its incomplete etc etc nothing has changed the rules of listing taking items off an incomplete list particularly source list can be deadly to the pc directive listing does not change listing rules except that the list may be only one item long or 5 to 30 at the most dont echo invalidate the practice of echo invalidation is easily fallen into in r3 directive listing echo invalidation the pc gives an item the auditor calls it back to the pc and says it doesnt rr if this is kept up the pc will be put into state of sen that is appalling the right way to do this is as follows pc gives item auditor writes it down pc says thats it auditor calls the ri being listed from to test its charge if it doesnt react auditor reads back the one item given if it rrs on one call looks for its blowdown if it blows down on ta says that is your item if the ri listed from reads or if the new item doesnt rr when the auditor calls it or if it doesnt blow down the ta or up on 15 reading case the auditor says give several more and keeps the pc listing until an ritype rr appears on the list or is directed onto it by auditor then the auditor goes through the standard steps reads the ri being listed from to be sure it doesnt read calls off the next to the last rring item says it doesnt rr unless it does reads the pcs item once sees it give an rr or disintegrating rr watches for blowdown which may have begun already and says thats your item if things go wrong never start echo invalidation keep to form suggest the proper ri or variation the pc hasnt thought of get severalecho invalidation in which pc names an item and auditor says that isnt it is not just bad form but very vicious practice that leads to games condition the invalidation of each item makes the pc very dizzy and very desperate the pc sick and confused starts plunging in desperation for the right item and goes swiftly down tone and out of session high pc morale is vital to blowing charge and finding ris uphold the pcs morale dont begin echo invalidation reverse practice is uncontrolled listing uncontrolled listing the pc is permitted to list on and on with stops or checks on the ri being listed from does not apply to long source lists where one lists 50 beyond last rs or rr for new goal the pc on an ri oppose list not source list must be stopped every few items usual number is 5 and the ri being listed from checked get the ri on the list but stop the listing when the list is complete l ron hubbard founder 060 hcob 25 apr 63 meter reading trs tv5 p 2645 ntv

actually found except some of the ris in the goal as an oppterm area eagerness to have game upwards to goal as an oppterm some 18 ris which were plotted from another bank the remainder aside from those 18 are exactly as found the bank is too early to adventure into lightly so do not try to find or run this goal on your pc it is early enough to be ordinarily unrestimulative on inspection the actual goal is common to most pcs points of interest the opposition terminals gradually increase as the goal is lived to become the goal the terminals decrease as lived until goal is repugnant each terminal and each oppterm contains form of the goal there are neither terminals nor oppterms that contain entirely different words than the goals if you make an error in following this pattern or fail to get the right ri your pcs rr will get shorter and vanish on the next 3 or 4 ris this will hold good for all goals and all gpms any corrections and patterns for other goal forms will be released as fast as i find them i do not guarantee there are not more ris in gpm use this pattern will serve to locate the ris of any goal using directive listingthe form of the word may be different but not its sense the form of the negative may be any negative but is almost always particularly in the upper half of the terminals l ron hubbard founder 062 hcob 29 apr 63 routine 3 directive listing listing liabilities ntv p 130134 previously considered confidential hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 29 april 1963 central orgs missions urgent routine 3 directive listing listing liabilities nothing has changed to alter the mechanics or laws of listing now that the pattern of the gpm is exactly known the pc can be told what ri to put on the list this requires only 5 or 6 variations from the pattern ri but the values contained in just listing are lost underlisting these things happen when underlisting is done even though the right ris are found 1 half the charge is left in the gpm 2 the pcs directed ri does not rr 3 the pc is prevented from cogniting on the ri found because it is still charged 4 the pcs body weight increases 5 the gpm run through once is stiff the pc is queasy about it 6 the pcs body is subjected to unusual stresses7 the auditor is led to fake rrs or believe the pattern is wrong 8 the pc doesnt get clear all these things can be prevented by listing every list to clean needle b considering the ri being listed from is reacting even if when called for test it reads latently or only roughs the flowing character of the needle c dont buy an ri unless the pc understands it and if he doesnt understand it make him list charge off d making the pc answer the listing question not plunge for the right pattern ri _____________ convincing test on most pcs the right ri wont rr until the charge from other listable items has been taken off you can make this test take the pcs next ri to be listed for lets say its perfect catfish the question is who or what would all catfish oppose get all possible combinations of the right ri perfect catfish from the pattern catfish perfected perfection catfish etc make the pc put them on the list now test by calling all catfish youll see roughed up needle even if instant tick appeared and probably real rr only fall will be seen on testing perfect catfish now make the pc really answer the listing question without regard to the pattern ri perfect catfish but just what he thinks all catfish would oppose you will see several rrs probably and maybe an rs or two on list of only 30 items you will observe the pcs needle go smooth call all catfish again to the pc you will see that there is slightest roughening of the smooth flow of the needle now have the pc put all combinations of perfect catfish back on the list one will rr beautifully call it off to the pc other nulling done bmrs it will rr again and the ta will blow down to clear read now examine your list you will see that the right ri placed at the top of the list had poor or absent rr or only fell when put down if you had accepted it at the top of the list you would not have gotten nice rr because all the rring and rsing items you saw after it would have remained in the pcs bankyou should make this test on your r3 pc then youll understand all about it because you will have seen it _____________ ninety percent of the gpm ris when found and called to the pc should bring the tone arm of the meter to clear read note the pc may be in the valence of the opposite sex in any gpm during its running therefore the pcs clear read will be for the opposite sex in that gpm _____________ the lesson here is this one audits the pc with routine 3 one does not just run bank routine 3 is an auditing tool one uses it to audit the pc if audited the pc gets better and feels better if just run through bank pc will benefit but wont clear removing charge truly skilled use of routine 3 removes all the charge auditing is for the pc true it is wholly the number of ris you get but what about those other rring and rsing items theyre the pcs too the crosssection of real r3 reliable item looks like this if the spherical cluster were split in half ed drawing consisting of very large circle labled ri completely surrounding in ring are small circles 17 of them each labled rr surrounding those in second ring are small circles labled rs and finally there is third outer ring of small circles labled dr all charge comes from the rring ri the remainder borrow their charge from it the ri looks like steel sphere covered with heavy layer of black smoke this black smoke is actually rring lock items in the inner area and rsing 212 items in the outer area if you get the ri discharged nearly everything blows but few of the rring first ring and one or two of the outer rsing items will still hang on the pc is trying to list through the outer rings to the center core ri this anatomy is not graphic it is actuala gpm consists of less than two hundred ris about 6000 rring lock items and about 15000 rses the figures 6000 and 15000 are approximate listing by directive listing against the pattern of gpm you get most of these rring or rsing secondary items but you dont get them all even on cleanly rring pc to get them all and on most pcs even to get good rr on the ri you have to list off charge as well as list by pattern if you get the primary ri these secondary items never need to be opposed they just blow if you do oppose one or slightly incorrect ri your ta will go high and stay high _____________ many plans for doing this could exist i would prefer this one and have used it with success it would even apply to pc who rred well on pattern running 1 tell the pc what to put on the list get the most ordinary variations of it see that one falls well none are called back to the pc 2 tell the pc now lets get the secondary items off just answer the question any way you want who or what _______ 3 let the pc rattle off lot the auditor meanwhile just looking at the meter watching the falls rses and rrs but looking for the moment the needle begins to flow smoothly none of this is written down and it should take only couple of minutes 4 stop the pc from further random listing and have the pc put some variations of the pattern ri on the list working hard with the pc to get the wording exactly correct 5 as soon as these pattern of the gpm type items being listed cease to disturb the needle and one or more have rred stop 6 read the ri being listed from to the pc to be sure it doesnt react or roughen the needle if it does repeat step 5 7 read the last rring pattern items to the pc one only without any other nulling or ruds or tiger drill will rr and blow down the ta 8 tell the pc your item is ______ that rocket reads this is only done the first time through bank and not when simply passing through gpm the third time to align it and pass the charge downthe pc run this way will be bright and sparkling the whole way lots of cognitions suppress protest and decide have to be cleaned on the list or the session if things dont go well but only when all other routine 3 means of handling things have become very impeded dont use any rudiments or tiger drill or nulling or bmrs in routine 3 unless totally driven to it and only then after all r3 means have been exhausted far from wasting session time you will find this gets more ris in session because the pcs confront comes up it saves time summary you can run whole gpm on directive listing and the pattern of gpm without removing single secondary item but the penalties of doing only that are given at the beginning of this hco bulletin audit the pc with routine 3 dont just run routine 3 on pc ps dont overlist either l ron

april 1963 cancelled see hco b 21 jan 70 in tv7 central orgs academies modernized training drills using permissive coaching much of the difficulty experienced in teaching the trs and getting students proficient in the trs is due to bad coaching this bulletin is issued to overcome this difficulty it is in fact an amendment of hco bulletin of april 17 1961 which as itself remains valid the essence of this bulletin is that the drills do notpermit the coach to flunk student instead an exact patter is laid down for the coach and instructors should ensure that the coach keeps to the patter tr 0 has been subdivided into 4 parts one new drill is introduced the coaches drill the trs are important because 1 the auditing skill of any student remains only as good as he can do his trs 2 flubs in trs are the basis of all confusion in subsequent efforts to audit 3 if the trs are not well learned early in the hpahca bscnhcs courses the balance of the course will fail and instructors at upper levels will be teaching not their subjects but trs 4 almost all confusions on meter model sessions and sop goals stem directly from inability to do the trs 5 student who has not mastered his trs will not master anything further 6 sop goals will not function in the presence of bad trs the preclear is already being overwhelmed by process velocity and cannot bear up to tr flubs without arc breaks academies were tough on trs up to 1958 and have since tended to soften comm courses are not tea party these trs given here should be put in use at once in all auditor training in academy and hgc and in the future should never be relaxed seven weeks on comm course until he does the trs perfectly lets the student receive at least one weeks training in the eight poor comm course in one week can wipe out the whole eight weeks number tr 0 revised 1961 and 1963 name confronting preclear commands none position student and coach sit facing each other comfortable distance apart about three feet student has an emeter purpose to train student to confront preclear with auditing only or with nothing the whole idea is to get the student able to hold position three feet in front of preclear to be there and not do anything else but be there training stress have student and coach sit facing each other neither making any conversation or effort to beinteresting have them sit and look at each other and say and do nothing for some hours student must not speak fidget giggle or be embarrassed or anaten it will be found the student tends to confront with body part rather than just confront or to use system of confronting rather than just be there the drill is misnamed if confront means to do something to the pc the whole action is to accustom an auditor to being there three feet in front of preclear without apologizing or moving or being startled or embarrassed or defending self after student has become able to just sit there for two hours bull baiting can begin anything added to being there is queried by the coach with what happened twitches blinks sighs fidgets anything except just being there is promptly queried with the reason why if necessary tr 0 has been divided into four parts each part is drilled for about 15 minutes in turn and then begun over again and again tr 0a this is exactly as given above except that bull baiting is omitted whenever student speaks fidgets giggles is embarrassed or goes anaten coach says thats it what happened coach listens carefully to what student has to say acknowledges and says start in fact coach will do the foregoing whenever he sees any physical action or change however small manifested by the student it is also desirable from time to time that the coach says thats it how are you doing listens carefully to what student says acknowledges and then says start flunks invalidation or validation other than giving win from time to time as merited tr 0b exactly as tr 0 with the addition that student is required by coach to answer the following questions which are given alternately what can you see about that you like what can you see about that you dont like coach acknowledges each answer without invalidation validation or evaluation coach asks what happened whenever there is any physical manifestation on the part of the student or whenever there is an overlong comm lag coach also asks from time to time how are you doing tr 0 c in this part bull baiting is introduced otherwise it is exactly as tr 0 patter as confronted subject the coach may say anything or do anything except leave the chair the students buttons can be found and tromped on hard any words not coaching words may receive response from the student if the student responds the coach is instantly coach see patter aboveinstructors should have coaches let students have some wins coach does not mention these and then by gradient stress get the coaches to start in on the student to invite flunks this is bull baiting the student is queried each time he or she reacts matter how minutely to being baited tr 0d this drill has been designed to put the finishing touches to tr 0 it needs to be done very thoroughly and with plenty of interest on the part of the coach it is run as follows 1 coach says to student define good auditing attitude he accepts students definition 2 coach says show good auditing attitude 3 after few minutes coach asks the following questions did you show good auditing attitude b what did you do c what happened 4 actions 2 and 3 are repeated two or three times then start over again at 1 5 when the good auditing attitude is being done well substitute an interested attitude or professional attitude or an understanding attitude all these attitudes should be drilled thoroughly further coach should take any attitude the student presents eg if student uses in his definition the words its being there coach makes mental note to use it later example define being there attitude show being there attitude the whole of tr 0 should be taught roughroughrough and not left until the student can do it training is considered satisfactory at this level only if the student can be three feet in front of person without flinching concentrating or confronting with regardless of what the confronted person says or does history developed by l ron hubbard in washington in march 1957 to train students to confront preclears in the absence of social tricks or conversation and to overcome obsessive compulsions to be interesting revised by l ron hubbard april 1961 on finding that sop goals required for its success much higher level of technical skill than earlier processes revised 1963 by reg sharpe number tr 1 revised 1961 and 1963 name dear alice purpose to train the student to deliver command newlyand in new unit of time to preclear without flinching or trying to overwhelm or using via commands phrase with the he saids omitted is picked out of the book alice in wonderland and read to the coach position student and coach are seated facing each other comfortable distance apart student has an emeter training stress the command goes from the book to the student and as his own to the coach it must not go from book to coach it must sound natural not artificial diction and elocution have part in it loudness may have when student has delivered phrase coach asks student the following 1 did you own the phrase 2 did you deliver it in new unit of time 3 where did the communication start from 4 where did the communication land if student is in difficulty or confused by the drill coach reads the purpose of the drill and the training stress and has student clear the purpose and the training stress b after short while the following is introduced coach tells student create the space of the coaching session by locating 4 points in front of you and four points behind you this is done on gradient scale until student is doing the drill comfortably coach just asks did you do that then above is reintroduced and the coach asking from time to time did you create the space if student has difficulty coach goes back to getting student to locate the four points in front and the four points behind this drill is passed only when the student can put across command naturally without strain or artificiality or elocutionary bobs and gestures and when the student can do it easily and relaxedly history developed by l ron hubbard in london april 1956 to teach the communication formula to new students revised by l ron hubbard 1961 to increase auditing ability revised 1963 by reg sharpe with the advices of l ron hubbard number tr 2 revised 1961 and 1963 name acknowledgments purpose to teach student that an acknowledgment is method of controlling preclear communication and that anacknowledgment is full stop also that an acknowledgment lets pc know that he has answered an auditing command commands the coach reads lines from alice in wonderland omitting he saids and the student thoroughly acknowledges them position student and coach are seated facing each other at comfortable distance apart student with an emeter training stress to teach student to acknowledge exactly what was said so preclear knows it was heard to ask student from time to time what was said to curb over and under acknowledgment to teach him that an acknowledgment is stop not beginning of new cycle of communication or an encouragement to the preclear to go on to teach further that one can fail to get an acknowledgment across or can fail to stop pc with an acknowledgment or can take pcs head off with an acknowledgment patter the coach says start reads line and says after student has acknowledged 1 what did i say 2 did you understand it 3 did your acknowledgment let know i had originated something 4 did it end cycle 5 where did the acknowledgment start from 6 where did the acknowledgment land 7 did you own the space in questions 5 and 6 student must indicate as in tr 1 ask what happened as required in previous trs coach checks carefully are you really satisfied that you are giving good acknowledgments he reads the purpose of the tr and the training stress for the student to check over history developed by l ron hubbard in london in april 1956 to teach new students that an acknowledgment ends communication cycle and period of time that new command begins new period of time revised 1961 by l ron hubbard revised 1963 by reg sharpe with the advices of l ron hubbard number tr 3 revised 1961 and 1963 name duplicative question purpose to teach student to duplicate without variation an auditing question each time newly in its own unit of time not as blur with other questions and to acknowledge it to teach that one never asks second question until he has received an answer to the one asked commands do fish swim or do birds fly position student and coach seated comfortable distance apart student has an emetertraining stress one question and student acknowledgment of its answer in one unit of time which is then finished to keep student from straying into variations of command even though the same question is asked it is asked as though it had never occurred to anyone before the student must learn to give and receive an answer and to acknowledge it in one unit of time the student should not fail to get an answer to the question asked or fail to repeat the exact question coach instructs student to run the command do birds fly or do fish swim etc student is required to acknowledge in such way that the coach knows he has answered the command and if he doesnt answer the command to repeat the command letting the coach know it is repeat coach just answers the command to start patter is as follows s do birds fly c yes s good c did i answer the command s yes c did you feel that you had let know that i had answered the command s or yes c ok start again this patter is repeated over and over until student has certainty that he is doing the drill then coach starts giving commands which are not answers these communications must all be directed at the student ie something to do with the pcs attitude appearance private life real or imaginary example of patter s do birds fly c your breath stinks s ill repeat the question do birds fly c thats it did i answer the question s c did you let know i hadnt s by not acknowledging repeating the command c ok start and so on coach continues until student is easily doing the drill and with great certainty coach can use such originations always directly concerned with the student personally and if he finds button he continues until the student is tolerating it quite happily if student breaks up or becomes misemotional coach merely asks what happened flunks evaluation invalidation or validation ask what happened as required when the question is notanswered the student must say gently ill repeat the auditing question and do so until he gets an answer anything except commands acknowledgment and as needed the repeat statement is queried unnecessary use of the repeat statement is queried poor command is queried poor acknowledgment is queried student misemotion or confusion is queried student failure to utter the next command without long comm lag is queried choppy or premature acknowledgment is queried lack of an acknowledgment or with distinct comm lag is queried start flunk good and thats it may not be used to fluster or trap the student any other statement under the sun may be the coach may try to leave his chair in this tr if he succeeds it is queried the coach should not use introverted statements such as i just had cognition coach divertive statements should all concern the student and should be designed to throw the student off and cause the student to lose session control or track of what the student is doing the students job is to keep session going in spite of anything using only command the repeat statement or the acknowledgment the student may use his or her hands to prevent blow leaving of the coach if the student does anything else than the above it is queried by queried is meant coach asks student what happened history developed by l ron hubbard in london in april 1956 to overcome variations and sudden changes in sessions revised 1961 and 1963 by l ron hubbard the old tr had comm bridge as part of its training but this is now part of and is taught in model session and is longer needed at this level auditors have been frail in getting their questions answered this tr was redesigned to improve that frailty number tr 4 revised 1961 and 1963 name preclear originations purpose to teach student not to be tonguetied or startled or thrown off session by originations of preclear and to maintain arc with preclear throughout an origination commands the student runs do fish swim or do birds fly on coach coach answers but now and then makes startling comments from prepared list given by instructor student must handle originations to satisfaction of coach position student and coach sit facing each other at comfortable distance apart training stress the student is taught to hear originations and do three things 1 understand it 2 acknowledge it and 3 return preclear to session if thecoach feels abruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension he corrects the coach into better handling patter all originations concern the coach his ideas reactions or difficulties none concern the auditor otherwise the patter is the same as in earlier trs the students patter is governed by 1 clarifying and understanding the origin 2 acknowledging the origin 3 giving the repeat statement ill repeat the auditing command and then giving it anything else is queried the auditor must be taught to prevent arc breaks and differentiate between vital problem that concerns the pc and mere effort to blow session tr 3 revised if the student does more than 1 understand 2 acknowledge 3 return pc to session he is in error coach may throw in remarks personal to student as on tr 3 students failure to differentiate between these by trying to handle them and remarks aimed only at the student is queried students failure to persist is always queried in any tr but here more so coach should not always read from list to originate and not always look at student when about to comment by originate is meant statement or remark referring to the state of the coach or fancied case by comment is meant statement or remark aimed only at student or room originations are handled comments are disregarded by the student tr 4 and antiq is what bothers auditors the most q aing is fault which causes arc breaks and therefore throws the pc out of session the reason is that when you q the pc is not permitted to let go of an origination and is therefore left with missed withhold q missed withholds arc breaks coach starts by asking student to define tr 4 if student doesnt know it then coach gives the definition as follows tr 4 is to hear an origination to understand it to acknowledge it and return pc to session similarly coach asks for definition of q which is double questioning changing because pc changed following pcs instruction coach then tells student to run the process do birds fly or do fish swim coach frequently introduces an origination when student has dealt with origination or has tried to deal with it coach asks searchingly the following questions1 were you tonguetied startled thrown off session 2 did you hear origination 3 did you understand it 4 did you acknowledge it 5 did you return to session 6 did you double question 7 did you change because i had changed 8 did you follow my instruction 9 what did you do 10 what happened question 10 can be asked randomly throughout the drill whenever coach sees or hears something that indicates student is in trouble of any sort coach is permitted to lead student up the garden path for little while before asking the above question this drill needs to be done very thoroughly if coach notices that student is using method or pattern coach can add in the question are you using method or pattern in this drill the drill is continued over and over until student is doing it comfortably and happily history developed by l ron hubbard in london in april 1956 to teach auditors to stay in session when preclear dives out revised by l ron hubbard in 1961 to teach an auditor more about handling origins and preventing arc breaks revised 1963 by reg sharpe with the advices of l ron hubbard coaches drill coach and student who is in this case the student coach seated as in the normal tr drills coach has the copy of the drill in front of him he tells student to coach tr whenever student departs from the script coach says thats it the correct question there should be _______ the correct action there should be _______ this is continued until student coach is thoroughly conversant with the script coach keeps student on the drill and at the end of each cycle asks student did you notice any physical changes on my part what were they did you ask what happened each timedrill is continued with each tr in turn until student is administering all the trs efficiently interestedly and competently ask what happened as required history developed by reg sharpe with the advices of l ron hubbard in april 1963 at saint hill to teach students how to coach the trs training

working very hard on technical the job is very nearly complete as to research though it has been pretty grim facing up to this totally unknown area of the reactive mind i acted as pc on it because i didnt know if body would live through it it doesbut care is needed in handling gpm while in body and great accuracy is required or the pc will gather mass and feel strain on heart and lung machineryi am now assembling and crosschecking all levels of ris and sequences of goals practically all the material is in sight but the speedy need of it is very difficult to meet i have done with mary sues help about decade of research since december last with mary sue as the auditor and myself as pc my rr is practically indestructible and my confront is good on this therefore and only therefore could the job be done other pcs rrs are too weak for research and their confront is not up to it therefore i had to guinea pig it this doesnt make any hero but it has been fortunate for us that i could do this as nobody currently under processing has come close to the actual pattern and without it we would be stopped i did not realize the vitalness of the data or the weakness of rrs until march because it was i who went through it i completely underestimated the ability of the average pc to confront it and find ris thus whole technology of running has had to be developed directive and random listing to cope with these factors of poor rrs and low confront so this burden was added on to research and therefore my data release has fallen behind i have been struck by the importance attached to this material cables and telexes have been coming in demanding the data i am putting out the material as fast as i can and it should all be released shortly what auditors do not realize is that any finding of ris at any level in gpm releases charge if ris are bypassed the pc however is uncomfortable or arc breaky if this story of finding this pattern and the gpms is incredible the actual story of the gpms is even more so the data entirely changes our line of attack on public dissemination more toward the dianetic approach but still within the framework of scientology and the human spirit there are very few more ris in gpm than shown in to have game the upper dwindling top oppterm down is apparently always ably or ingably never any other word form the lower dwindling goal down is apparently always able or ingable this is not shown in the line plot of 28 apr 63 as it was learned from other gpms the following weekthe lowest oppterm is not correct for reasons to be covered later this oppterm should be something else the whole of the terminal side should always be nix _________ not _________ more ancient cultures have more emphatic negatives l ron hubbard founder 067 hcob 5 may 63

the first gpm run on pc you get further departure from the pattern than in subsequent gpms the pcs confront is barred off by charge the thing to do is run the first gpm as you can then get the closer to pt gpms by listing what goal would oppose gpms goal just run dont go backtrack come closer to pt for the next gpm you almost never get the pt gpm the first time as the pcs first goal the upper dwindling oppterms top oppterm down are all adverbial apparently all words are ably or ingably the lower dwindling oppterms goal down are all adjectivial apparently all words are able or ingable the correct forms of the words apparently do not vary for any goals ris there is difference of pattern goal to goal or pc to pc only significance of goals change pc to pc the terminals are all nix where they have negative starts not more cultured tongues have degrees of negative and nix is closer than if is used some mass will pile up on the terminal side nix used instead of dispels this massnever rerun partially run gpm always complete gpm to the bottom including the goal oppose list at the end before rerunning or correcting gpm go back two ris if you must but never more correct gpms ris only after the gpm has been gone through once if partially run gpm is rerun or corrected before completion it will stiffen up always run gpm top to bottom never bottom to top always get the pc to the topmost gpm as soon as possible before going for early track gpms run ris off the case as fast as possible dont linger around fooling with top oppterm combination more than few hours if you cant get it go into the bank at the goal as an oppterm it shatters pc to fool about hunting the top oppterm for 20 or 30 hours get ris run and charge off the case the bottom oppterm the bottom lowest oppterm is always trick combination of the next goal below and the goal being run sometimes not or nix is added between them its an idiotic simplicity the two goals are just joined to make sense example goal being run to never fish next lower goal to catch catfish the bottom oppterm of the gpm to never fish is therefore to never fish to catch catfish i almost sprained the brain trying to find this one it connects each gpm one to the next its keystone if the pc is few ris down from the top or in the body of gpm or few ris from the bottom you cant get another goal to fire to get another goal to fire you

previously considered confidential hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 8 may 1963 central orgsmissions routine 3 the nature of formation of the gpm all goals contacted on the preclear early in his processing and made to rocket read are implants an implant is an electronic means of overwhelming the thetan with significance in the case of implanted goals problem masses use was made of the mechanics of the actual pattern of living to impress and entrap thetan and force obedience to behavior patterns the goal selected was not based on any goal of the thetan but was an entirely arbitrary selection both as to goal and pattern by those conducting the implanting implanting was an activity carried out to prevent retribution from executed persons to dispose of captured armies and block their return home as thetans to dispose of excess population to fit thetan for colonization project to dissuade revolutionaries simply to implant and many other reasons lacking actual technology time real purpose and common decency the electronic implant was the standard shortterm means of handling the problems of life to us this activity is highly discreditable even criminal that implanting was undertaken and done is witnessed by the weird uses of electricity by the psychiatrist who has therapeutic excuse for doing so and does not even know that he undertakes very loworder dramatization of whole track actions that whole populations have been disposed of by beings needs further evidence than hitlers pogroms against the jews wherein he involved huge vitally needed war resources and elaborate scientific skills to exterminate 6000000 human beings who had committed real crimes against him implants are not necessarily the work of pranksters or madmen but the solemn scientific combined effort of careful dedicated politicians learned men and psychologists and technicians who work under the orders of short sighted states how they excuse this activity would probably make an interesting study in itself that the intention is not for the good of anyone is witnessed by the fact that many of the goals so implanted dictate criminal activities implants result in all varieties of illness apathy degradation neurosis and insanity and are the principal cause of these in man implanted goals the pattern and similarity of goals and gpms should make one aware of their actual nature as implants that implanted goals and gpms exist does not mean that the pcs own goals and gpms do not exist however to get to the pcs own goals and gpms one must run the implanted ones indeed so long as implants do exist and have to be run it is almost fortunate for they give the pc the increase in confronting and case gain confidence needed to handle the whole track and the auditor the experience in listing necessary to handle the whole track there is real difference between the technology needed to handle an implant gpm and the whole track finding purposes and listing are common to both both have basic pattern though the implant pattern does not vary pc to pc goal to goal you wont find real whole track goal on pc until the implanted goals are handled and even if you did it would snap into an implanted goal the difference between whole track ri and an implant ri consists of somatic and visio implant somatics are pressure heat electrical and generalized pain there is changing visio usually just the implant station and its false pictures intended to confuse whole track ri has visio motion and sharp identifiable somatics as from spear wounds crashes etc for twelve years i have looked for technology to get around implants and not run them instead i found one could not get around them and found the technology to get through them everyone has these implants that is here on this planet do we know as much as the implanters yes we know more about life and its laws and this universe than those who implanted does this debar clearing it makes clearing easier as it gives pattern of goals and ris that can be followed is the gain as great in running out implants the only immediate gain you will get on homo sapiens is running out implants these implants are the immediate source of those troubles he is most concerned about the gains in running them are impressive when can one run the whole track and the pcs own gpmswhen the implants are run does running an implant assist whole track running the implants have grouped the whole track in pc random listing during the running of implants straightens out lot of whole track does running an implant harm the body not if expertly done there is lot of physical discomfort in running an implant gpm and mass may pile up on the pc but the completion of the job sees this damage also swept away does running an implant change the pcs patterns of behavior the only troublesome patterns of behavior the pc has reactively are from these implants the resurgence and relief is enormous does this change the definition of clear it clarifies it clear could mean thetan cleared of enforced and unwanted behavior patterns and discomforts the mood of the pc the finding that the gpms you are contacting are implants accounts for the violence of r3 arc breaks and b the suspicion with which scientology is sometimes regarded down deep thetan on this planet knows he or she was given false purposes and sent here under cloud this is attested by the enthusiasm with which pc will erase his goal let an auditor err and force or confuse the pc and the pc instantly reverts to the moods experienced during the actual implant which are amongst others anger fear apathy compounded by feelings of degradation and betrayal the pc instantly feels he is again being implanted the r3 methods of handling an arc break keep this to minimum whole groups of people suddenly become convinced that central org or scientologists are up to some evil they have confused scientologist who is undoing an implant with the crews who implanted this paranoid reaction to scientology stems from this one mechanism the implanted character of people heartbreak ones first reaction to this news may be one of heartbreak feeling betrayed etc i felt the same way when i found it out then i realized the emotion came out of the implants themselves one is supposed to feel disheartened and betrayed when he or she realizes it that keeps it from being undone and leaves the being trapped the reaction is just part of the trapbut before i realized this i only waited day or two to be sure i have always persevered in my honesty with you and have given you vital research datum as fast as i knew it regardless of its palatability this is one of those times at first i thought this puts clearing too far up in hours and i didnt know how youd take it then i rapidly summed up the pluses and minuses of the situation and came up with this datum implant or implant we now know the first goal to be run on every case and we know its pattern some fifty hours after starting class iii or iv auditor knowing the goal and its pattern can make first goal clear in other words anyone signing up for instance in an hgc can be first goal clear in two intensives the randomity of looking for the first goal and its ris has vanished the pcs confront comes up up up what at the worst has happened is that it will take longer to run pc to ot as one has to handle these implanted banks before handling the actual whole track but the door is open to steady unquestionable gain in that direction without maybes and the state of ot attainable by auditing is probably much more powerful than we have imagined bank confusions an implant is meant to be tricky and confusing we have outsmarted it by finding the patterns of these but do not expect to find the banks not confusing to the pc even still let the pc grasp any confusing situation before forcing the pc into going on the bank closest to pt is actually the furthest from pt the bank was implanted from top oppterm down basic then is the pt goal pc cant run from bottom to top as thats backwards if you get the basic closest to pt goal very well erased the others tend to soften up this is our old get the basic on the chain basic is the top oppterm of the closest to pt goal the ow sequence is present the one who has the hardest run of it in bank has done the most implanting but motivators or not these implants must be run the overts can be handled later well thats the announcement when you come out of any decline it puts you into get busy and get through you were supposed to feel disheartened l ron hubbardfounder 071 hcob 11 may 63 routine 3 heaven not in either set of tech volumes however it appears in the list of cofs copyrighted materials

heaven and ive found that scientologists have been to heaven and that everybody has evidently been to heaven the goals problem mass implants which are the apparent basic source of aberration and heaven travail which began with the goal to forget were cynically done in heaven for long while some people have been cross with for my lack of cooperation in believing in christian heaven god and christ i have never said i didnt disbelieve in big thetan but there was certain something very corny about heaven et now i have to apologize there was heaven not too unlike in cruel betrayal the heaven of the assassins in the 12th century who like everybody else dramatized the whole track implants if bit more so yes ive been to heaven and so have you and you have the pattern of its implants in the hco bulletin line plots it was complete with gates angels and plaster saints and electronic implantation equipment so there was heaven after all which is why you are on this planet and were condemned never to be free again until scientology before you went to heaven you were not really very bad orvery good but you didnt think you had lived only once and you had good memory and knew who you were and enjoyed life afterwards the symbol of the crucified christ is very apt indeed its the symbol of thetan betrayed data additional work and possible corrections need to be done but this is the gist of the matter the implants are electronic in nature and follow certain pattern of the gpm the implant station existed on the order of magnitude of 43000000000000 years ago the dates may be part of the implants but do not appear so at this time however possibility of correction of dates is reserved some have been through it once some more than once the first time i arrived and the moment of the implant to forget was dated at 43891832611117 years 344 days 10 hours 20 minutes and 40 seconds from 10024 pm daylight greenwich time may 9 1963 there are earlier such implants there later such implants i evidently have goal of my own at 305 trillion us years and an actual gpm all of which pulled into this 43 trillion year implant additional emeter data five goals in all may be common to both sequences the first 3 of the 5 are the same there are implants but dates rocket read implanting was done on nonvisible thetan but arrival was in ship in doll body according to the meter star of bethlehem pearly gates the way out of the universe all of which rr on the meter give clue to recruitment actions there was purpose in giving particular thetan particular goal planning had individualization preclears overts should be scouted as to why these implants keyed in fac 1 hypnotism etc but doubtful if any preclear did this type of implanting the mood is set that thetans are evil treacherous and bad but this is all part of the implant not factual the earliest point of the series is not known at this writing but possibly contains recruitment through advertising the departure method from the series is notfully known yet but probably just abandonment the implants were not done in box or in some trick manner of projection the scenery is actually there common mest universe space and matter and in mest universe the first 43 trillion series consists of 29 implanted goals the second 42 trillion series consists of 21 implanted goals the first three goals in both series are the same to forget to remember and to go away the last goal and one other in both series are the same the remaining goals are not the same for the two implants personally perceived data the pattern of ris is different for the two series consisting in the second series of added ris below the to have goaliving and with different dwindling of adjectives and adverbs but are otherwise similar both series have the gates of heaven visible the last implant of both consists of entering heaven the last goal of both is to be in heaven the gates of the first series are well done well built an avenue of statues of saints leads up to them the gate pillars are surrounded by marble angels the entering grounds are very well kept laid out like bush gardens in pasadena so often seen in the movies aside from the implant boxes which lie across from each other on the walk there are other noises and sounds as though the saints are defending and berating these are unimportant to the incident the second series probably in the same place shows what trillion years of overt acts does or is an additional trickery to collapse ones time the saints have vanished so have the angels sign on one the left as you enter says this is heaven the right has sign hell with an arrow and inside the grounds one can see the excavations like archeological diggings with row terraces that lead to hell plain wire fencing encloses the place there is sentry box beside and outside the right pillar the road leading up to the gates is deeply eroded an effigy of joseph complete with desert clothing is seen approaching the gates but not moving leading donkey which carries the original madonna and child from bethlehem the implanting boxes lie on either side of this entering at path level these are the actual ends of the two series one backs out of the gates of course from top oppterm down as this is the end the last two ris after this last goal say it is the beginning not the endthe place by implant and inference was supposed to be in the sky like floating island actually it was simply high place in the mountains of planet and the gates pathway falls away into gorge very eroded and bare by the time of the second implant but heavily forested and rolling at the time of the first the beginnings have not at this writing been so well explored by myself i have not viewed the second beginning which says it is the end however i do know that the second series was done in long square tunnels with implant boxes not unlike small pa speakers with fretwork fronts on either side the first series actually begins with arrival in town as everything is backwards to upset the time sense this town consisted of trolley bus some building fronts sidewalks train tracks boarding house bistro in basement where there is bulletin board well lighted and bank building the bank is the key point of interest it is interesting that we use the word bank taken from computerology to indicate the reactive mind this bank building was onthecorner oldfashioned granitelike construction two or three stories high with the door in the rounded front even revolving type door inside to the left of the entrance door is rounded counter directly across the room are the stairs the top oppterm and terminal of to forget are at the top of these stairs the implant then proceeds on down the stairs step by step terminals on one side the left if one were coming up the stairs the oppterms on the other the first series 43 trillion has all its implant impulses at step level in the second series the boxes are ear high to man by the time the gates are arrived at in the first series the terminals are on the left as you approach the gates the oppterms on the right having been reversed at some point the first 43 trillion series had very fine marble stairs the same stairs can be seen in any big well kept railway station they were complete with white ball held in wrought iron stand the thetan was taken along apparently on pole trap to which he was stuck it does not proceed step by step throughout the whole of the implant series but after the first flight of stairs goes ways stops while several pairs of ris fire then to new location the place seemed to have people in it but they are all effigies those seem radioactive contact with them hurts living beings are seen but the effigies that look like humans are performing sudden repetitive actions with long halts in between in the basement such dummies are seenoperating machinery the boarding house at the actual beginning has dummy guest and landlady in kimono and wrappers reading newspaper there are devils or satans that i saw there is passenger getting on the trolley bus workman halfway down the first stairs of to forget eating lunch and in to be in heaven gardener or electrician adjusting an implant box behind hedge and periodically leaping up and screaming the place so long as the implants remain only partially discharged seems to swim in black and white electronic masses but these dissipate as the implants are run out by pattern one actually enters the town as the first action the implants however were rigged to makes the gates seem the entrance to the incident one backs through from the town into the bank down the steps and eventually out the pearly gates down the hillside and is there let off and abandoned to be in heaven is the last goal implanted in both series this is not body building implant though running it gives somatics to the chest this is not ge implant it is the persons own running it particularly badly brings it down on the body there are body somatics on it however particularly eyes face chest bones it apparently only can be run by 3m listing and rocket reads one must have the goal to get the ris conclusions the place is so full of lies by implant that the preclear becomes quite confused and this review of the actual date is necessary to successful navigation however it is very easy to read more treachery into it than there is in it which is enough however as the place existed so long it was in varying state of repair and some change this data on time is subject to review but in 12 trillion years only some of the implant pattern and mock up had shifted however there may have been other stations only time and research will really tell that one must date the preclears first earliest goal to forget find how many times the preclear went through it or some such implant station date the other times and be careful to run only the first of the series as this is basic as in prepchecking sec checking and old engramrunning it tends to case up the remainder of the implants but running the implants later than basic is very much harder on the pc even though it can be done wherever one misses an ri in an implant that repeating ri when found in later one tends to be very much more heavily charged rerunning any implant that has only been partially run tends to rough up the whole implant and make it hard to run luck i think we are lucky it could have been much worse this heavenly dream of destruction could have been current not so long ago it could have happened often not just once or twice or three times per pc but apparently it didnt and is unique in itself this is the core of the reactive mind it is all the way south for here just once on the whole track somebody discovered the mechanism of purposes and ris and utilized them to install religious mania and pin thetans down to one life and planets the thing was done so well that it has hung up ever since there are other implants there are other goals and gpms but these are minor and easily found and listed once this key implant series is out of the way we were in position of having an infinite number of pieces to the puzzle now we have finite number which even though very tough are still finite in number further every processing step taken every ri discharged is positive gain toward definite result in processing further we have our hands on an appalling bit of technology where the world is concerned with repidity and meter it can be shown that heaven is false dream and that the old religion was based on very painful lie cynical betrayal what does this do to any religious nature of scientology it strengthens it new religions always overthrow the false gods of the old they do something to better man we can improve man we can show the old gods false and we can open up the universe as happier place in which spirit may dwell what more can you expect this actually places us far beyond any other beings that are about it puts us through increased beingness and restoration of life in control of much destiny we now have only few unsolved problems about life huge though they may be such as the construction of bodies and how does one establish the character of and communicate if feasible with beings who are making trees and insects there are few things like these but i imagine when we finally manage to communicate with beetles under rocks andfree them well doubt find the creator of heaven who 43 trillion years ago designed and built the pearly gates and trapped us all good lord id hate to be guilty of that overt but never mind you arent either that guy is gone i hope l ron hubbard note this hco bulletin is based on over thousand hours of research auditing analyzing the facsimiles of the reactive mind and with the help of mark v electrometer it is scientific research and is not in any way based upon the mere opinion of the researcher this hco bulletin is not the result of the belief or beliefs of anyone scientology data reflects long arduous and painstaking research over period of some thirty years into the nature of man the mind the human spirit and its relationship to the physical universe the data and phenomena discovered in scientology is common to all minds and all men and can be demonstrated on anyone truth does not require belief to be truth any more than water requires anyones permission to run down hill the data is itself and can be duplicated by any honest researcher or practitioner we in scientology seek freedom the betterment of man and the happiness of the individual and this comprises our attitude toward the data found the data however is simply itself and exists whatever the opinion of any one may be the contents of this hco bulletin discover the apparent underlying impulses of religious zealotism and the source of the religious mania and insanity which terrorized earth over the ages and has given religion the appearance of insanity as this paper is written for my friends it has of course semblance of irreverence noteall our data on the whole track remains factual and is not taken from any implant the only

does not follow this form you are running the second series at 41 trillion an approximation of the word is not acceptable with little random listing the right one will rr example enjoying catfish is not good enough it would have to be enjoyably catfish as given only variation in the middle of the word sometimes occurs ie enjoyably fires as enjoyfulably enjoy and ably are always there only may fire in the terminals not nix but if so mass will eventually stack up gpm to gpm on the terminal side early on case bank is so charged up that almost anything will rr so work for the right one as given or in later gpms that level will leave mass because basic on it 1st gpm is wrong this is not the pattern of the second series 41 or 42 trillion the first series is probably available on your pc find it if you cant and pc got only the second series of gpms although im still prepared to find it all one consecutive implant blunder about and get charge off by finding ris i havent run much of the

hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 13 may ad 13 central orgs missions routine 3 routine 3n directive listing with new routine 3 model session as i gathered experience in auditing pc through the implant gpms and being audited through them it became obvious that we had need of special routine to handle implant gpms and new routine 3 model session there are two technologies for auditing goals you have in routine 3m completed technology needed to audit the pcs own goals this need not be changed however as we moved into implant gpms great deal of routine 3m and 3m2 could be dropped while running the implant gpms therefore here is streamlined routine developed for implant gpms only there are about 49 of these implant gpms according to present data some pcs have more some less unless one hits speed of an ri every minute of auditing time the task of clearing the pc of all these takes too long there are 230 ris in each one so the speed necessity is selfevident therefore we drop several actions from 3m2 we do not check the goal between ris we do not test the ri being listed from or the question we drop the requirement of tone arm blowdown for an ri and we leave only the necessity that the ri rr well when said by the pc and called the extraneous actions can be dispensed with because we now have the first series exact line plot as per hcob 12 may 63 routine 3 ri form gpm ri form corrected and are doing only directive listing by the numbered character of the line plot one can keep the pc straight without tellingthe pc the ri the session is so arranged that the auditor has line plot before him and the pc has copy propped up so that the pc can see it easily without moving about or shifting hands on the cans the auditor uses his own line plot copy as the pcs line plot spare paper is handy in case any fiddleabout with words is necessary the auditor keeps all ris on the form provided to save unnecessary writing the only thing the auditor guards against is incorrect oppose in his question who or what would oppose _____ and who or what would _____ oppose must never be mixed up the question correct for the column below it is on the form if any additional listing is necessary the auditor transfers the number of the ri being listed for to his spare paper and lists it there if he lists in writing at all there are pauses while the auditor writes during the finding of most of the ris the auditor fills in the form as he asks form filling is also shorthanded by putting just check mark on the terminal side to show it has been gotten ris can thus be found and recorded almost as fast as auditor and pc can talk the auditor must be very sure of his rocket read the correct ri will fire once when the pc says it slightly less when called back less when part of the next question and ticks when opposed by the next ri it is thereafter wholly discharged it has to be called back to the pc and the next question then asked using the ri just found and thats all the only judgment is on did the pc hear it and is the pc distracted or suppressing experience will guide you on these dont waste time with lots of ruds or tding ris whats happening or what happened in critical moment saves almost all mid ruds and when it doesnt suppress invalidate put in on the pc is usually adequate for an ri and protest assert and decide are enough when session ruds demand to be put in the auditor takes the pcs data always and can act on it but the auditor never takes the pcs orders when the auditor fails to take data the pc soon after begins issuing orders most of which will be wrong there is case data except the pcs data via pc and meter the auditor handles the pc gently never continue session beyond an arc break until that arc break is handled otherwise the pc thinks of the auditor as an enemy which after all is characterized by forcing against will the principal thing to accomplish in routine 3n is discharge of charge charge is seen on the meter by rocket reads or rock slams which dont apply in 3n this chargeis seen to do one of two things discharge or b suppress the auditor must be careful that the charge does not just suppress and that it actually discharges all the charge present is represented by the rocket read when the rocket read ceases to rocket read the charge is either discharged or suppressed the auditor will quickly learn by experience which has happened suppressed charge is still on the case and retains command value on the pc sometimes an area such as whole gpm or engram is so charged that the rocket reads continue to fire as the tone arm moves down sometimes most of the time the charge is so shallow that it contains only one long rocket read b one medium rocket read c one short rocket read and d tick accompanied by about 2 divisions of ta fall over the lot in 3n one gets the long rr when the pc first says the ri from his copy of the line plot form b the medium rr when the auditor calls it back c the short rr when the next oppose question is asked and d the tick when it is answered one may not see c and d often the whole charge goes on and b continuing to call right ri does not produce an rr beyond the above only wrong one continues to fire what the auditor must be careful of is failing to get and b when the pc first says it and when the auditor calls it back if rr occurs but only fall or if short rr occurs at or b the auditor must expect the pc has suppress or was suppressing by being distracted the thing to do is ask what happened and get the pcs answer and do the whole operation again dont keep putting in big mid ruds or random listing when the above simple query will handle sometimes the speed of run causes the pc to suppress cognitions this will prevent rocket reads it is quite enough to ask what happened as above and the pc will tell you although 3n is fast one must compensate for that speed by good sense the more you harass pc the less charge is gotten off and the fewer the ris found per session you dont therefore use lots of session big mid ruds and ri big mid ruds however putting in the bmrs on nix once or twice on various words in argument will pay off with smoother run nix can always be made to fire as part of terminals pcs often hate it why its part of the implant thats why its the most used word in the implants the pc does not have to understand the words to recoverhowever getting the pc to study before session the parts of speech involved will help the things werent understood or were sneered at by the pc at the time they were implanted getting the pc to pick up any overt thoughts he had while going through will also help but this is done only very occasionally in the session not every ri routine 3n is speed process which balances between too much and too little auditor doingness do enough to get the charge off dont do too much and inhibit charge dont do too little and leave charge on the case the pcs visio of the surroundings in the implant area as the pc goes through is not vital on the first run through the implants but it shouldnt be prevented either whether the pc looks or not is unimportant the auditor can say what does it look like once or twice in session speed can come up to 1 ri every 30 seconds but should not fall lower than l ri every minute and half of session time an average of 1 ri per minute is good this includes breaks beginning and end of session the first session or two may go much slower speed should be reached by the third to fifth session and maintained thereafter routine 3n cannot be used on those cases five percent who are not native to this galaxy and do not have therefore the helatrobus implants or who for some reason escaped them on these the top oppterm and terminal of to forget cannot be made to fire even when to forget does such cases may have goal to persist or to exist for self alone but these do not run by our line plots pc who received only the second series of implants and not the first is run on 3n but by the second series line plot form pcs who do not have the helatrobus implants covered in r3n are best run by blocking out their time track and mild engram running these are nonpattern pcs and their auditor has to develop the materials needed to handle their implants much data exists on this be awfully sure your pc does not have the goal to forget and its top ris however before deciding he or she is off pattern pcs like to be different its dangerous to be predictable and they often sell difference to an auditor it is fortunate if the pc can be run on the helatrobus implants as it makes fast gains for little work run r3n as fast as you and the pc can talk do the ris on the hco bulletin form save every corner of time you can there are more than 10000 ris on most cases some far more on very few there are less thats about 170 hours of auditing time at one ri per minute so you see why youve got to gothetango at two ris per session its 5000 hours or more the reason we run the helatrobus implants is obvious but you may have missed that they reduce the power of decision more than any other implants ever foundand the power of decision is the very core of selfdeterminism routine 3 model session 1 adjust the pcs chair 2 make sure room is all right 3 test pcs havingness 4 put in rfactor 5 start session 6 get session goals 7 use

say you are not auditing wording for the above follows the tradition of earlier model sessions adhere severely to this session form it is nearly an irreducible minimum and is very fast but it is all necessary the random rudiment here is what happened session mid ruds are simply protest assert and decide ri rudiments are suppress and invalidatearc break handling is in accordance with hco bulletin of 14 march 63 routine 2routine 3 arc breaks handling of dont continue session until you find out why the arc break 8 body of the session as per the above step 8 this is the body of 3n session the same session form as above is used for track scouting or engram running so that if these are done also change of model session occurs however what makes 3n 3n is the following after having established that pc has the goal to forget and the helatrobus implants also done in the above session form one proceeds as follows give the pc copy of the required line plot to fit his goal or preris making sure you have the latest and most accurate version prop it up so pc can read it or let pc have it on his lap guarding against too much can juggling to get it read the auditor takes second copy of the same form for his line plot auditor give number ____ next ri who or what would oppose____last ri or who or what would ____ last ri oppose as required pc calling only the exact form ri avoidable catfish auditor has carefully observed emeter to make sure it rred well marks but need not write in full avoidable catfish place on his line plot form verifies it is the right one to come up thank you i will read the item reads avoidable catfish sees that it rrs will do so about half the width of the pcs first rr just moment before that rocket reads notes next number or not and may or may not give it to pc according to how lost pc is liable to get uses last ri found in question who or what would oppose avoidable catfish pc nix avoidable catfish auditor sees that it rred when pc said it marks his list i will read the item reads and as always notes meter reaction carefully nix avoidable catfish that rocket reads who or what would nix avoidable catfish oppose and so forth the auditors remedy against something not rocket reading is usually what happened gets the pcs answer and repeats the operation that didnt produce an rrthis usually gets the rr and the auditor just goes on the pc had heavy somatic or cognition or looked at the next ri or just didnt pay attention the next remedy if the above didnt work is to put in suppress and invalidate on the ri then one repeats the operation and goes on if however rr results yet look over the line plot thoroughly to make sure you havent skipped or gotten mixed up or gotten nonline plot rr if all is well here then do next paragraph if rr yet use random listing letting the pc vary the wording as he or she wishes dont write any of this down you will see the meter rr on these odd variations given when more rrs are seen except on any repeat of the right ri once more repeat the operation and youll get your rr if none of these work then assume you already got the charge off and missed it or b you are doing something not procedure and have been gradually stacking up charge to remedy either of the above try to get the next ri if it fires well just go on as if the charge went off the next one will fire and if it didnt the next one wont your responsibility is to 1 get the charge off each ri and 2 keep the pc calm and unharassed and speeding forward you will quickly learn the particular tricks of your pc such as press on puzzling it out getting tired and will get the hang of this pcs meter so you can tell suppress or whatever from real rr very easily and adjust accordingly it is obvious that such trouble has to be rare to get your quota of ris in session going from one goal to the next varies the above pattern here one lists goal oppose list for the next goal to 50 beyond the last rr or rs nulls the list and gets the next goal this is longish process if there is doubt what the next goal is just direct it on the list at once making one ri list adjust the bottom oppterm of the goal just left carry the charge through and get the next top oppterm at once if you have the wrong next goal your pc will arc break orthe rr will fail to fire and the pc will develop much mass wrong next goal is probably the only liability that can give the auditor trouble now ______________ this is routine 3n on the basis of its model session all routine 3 can be done as well as engram running the essence of it is auditor direction direct the pc toward clear not toward arc breaks and youll soon have marvelous rewards from the processing l ron hubbard founder 074 hand handwritten note in new tech vols ntv p 161 not in old tech vol

tv5 p 2737 ntv vii p 1627 hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 15 may ad13 central orgs franchise the time track and engram running by chains bulletin 1 it has been so many years since engram running was familiar tool of the auditor that it is hard to know where to begin to teach this skill all over again actually millions of words have been written or spoken on the subject of running engrams however oddly enough there was not one condensed summary hco bulletin on the subject engram running developed was never then summated i will therefore attempt to remedy the matter engram running simplified recapitulation or summation of materials was ever done on engram running therefore while all lectures and books on it are true not one contains final survey of engram running including everything vital to this skill and the laws which govern it the material in books and tapes should be reviewed but the material in these hco bulletins should be learned thoroughly as it takes precedence over all earlier material why people have trouble running engrams i have gotten very impatient with the constant plea for rote set of commands to run engrams the need for such commands is testimony to the auditors lack of knowledge of the mechanics of the time track and the pcs behavior during an engram running session an auditor must know the basic laws and mechanics of the time track in order to run engrams there is rote procedure and never will be that will be successful on all cases in absence of knowledge of what time track is there is substitute for knowing what engrams are and what they do knowing that you can run engrams not knowing that there is nothing that will take the place of such knowledge you have to know the behavior of and data about engrams there is royal road that avoids such knowledge if you know all about engrams you can run them if you dont youll make mess regardless of the commands given for use therefore the essence of engram running is knowledge of the character and behavior of engrams this is not vast subject however these three things stand in the way of learning about engrams 1 engrams contain pain and unconsciousness fear of pain or inflicting pain causes the auditor not to confront the pcs engrams and unconsciousness is after all not knowing condition and 2 the auditor is so accustomed to projectionists reeling off movies and tv programs for him or her that the auditor tends to just sit while the action rolls forward acting like spectator not the projectionist 3 failure to handle time in incidents on 1 you can remedy this just by knowing about it and realizing it and surmounting it and on 2 you can remedy the attitude by realizing that the auditor not the pc or some installed movie projectionist is operating the pcs bank 3 is covered latertake pocket movie projector and any bit of reel of film and wind it back and forth for while and youll see you are moving it then give command and move the film and youll have what youre doing as an auditor many drills can be developed using such equipment and 2 will be overcome 1 requires just understanding and the will to rise superior to it the time track the endless record called the time track complete with 52 perceptions of the pcs entire past is available to the auditor and his or her auditing commands the rules are the time track obeys the auditor the time track does not obey preclear early in auditing the time track is very accurate record of the pcs past very accurately timed very obedient to the auditor if motion picture film were 3d had 52 perceptions and could fully react upon the observer the time track could be called motion picture film it is at least 350000000000000 years long probably much longer with scene about every 125 of second definitions that part of the time track that is free of pain and misadventure is called simply the free track in that the pc doesnt freeze up on it any mental picture that is unknowingly created and part of the time track is called facsimile whether an engram secondary lock or pleasure moment any knowingly created mental picture that is not part of time track is called mockup any unknowingly created mental picture that appears to have been record of the physical universe but is in fact only an altered copy of the time track is called dubin those parts of the time track that contain moments of pain and unconsciousness are called engrams those parts of the time track which contain misemotion based on earlier engramic experience are called secondaries those parts of the time track which contain the first moment an earlier engram is restimulated are called keyins those parts of the time track which contain moments the pc associates with keyins are called locks series of similar engrams or of similar locks are called chainsa basic is the first incident engram lock overt act on any chain basic basic is the first engram on the whole time track incidents are not in piles or files they are simply part of the consecutive time track by incident is meant the recording of an experience simple or complex related by the same subject location or people understood to take place in short and finite time period such as minutes or hours or days chain of incidents makes up whole adventure or activity related by the same subject general location or people understood to take place in long time period weeks months years or even billions or trillions of years an incident can be an engram secondary keyin or lock chain of incidents can therefore be chain of experiences which are engrams secondaries keyins and locks chain of incidents has only one basic its basic is the earliest engram received from or overt act committed against the subject location or beings which make it chain the influence of the time track shakespeare said all life was play he was right in so far as the time track is 3d 52 perception movie which is whole series of plays concerning the preclear but the influence of it upon the preclear removes it from the class of pretense and play it is not only very real it is what contains whatever it is that depresses the pc to what he is today its savageness relieved the preclear can recover and only then there is other valid workable road there are valences circuits and machinery in the reactive mind as well as reliable items and goals but these all have their place on the time track and are part of the time track the preclear as thetan is the effect of all this recorded experience almost all of it is unknown to him there are other influencing agencies for the preclear than the time track and present time and present time moment later is part of the time track the creation of the time track the preclear makes the time track as time rolls forward he does this as an obsessive create on subawareness level it is done by an involuntary intention not under the pcs awareness or controlthe road to clear by making the preclear take over the creating of the time track was long explored and proved completely valueless and chancy the road to clear by making the preclear leave the time track exteriorization lasts only for minutes hours or days and has proven valueless the road to clear proven over 13 years of intense research and vast numbers of auditing hours and cases lies only in an auditor handling the time track and removing from it by means governed by the auditors code the material both motivators and overts which recorded on it is out of the control of the pc and holds the pc at effect listing for goals and reliable items engram running prepchecking sec checking recall processes and assists all handle the time track successfully and are therefore the basis of all modern processing apparent faults in the time track there are faults in the recording of the time track there are only snarls caused by groupers and unavailability and lack of perception of the time track grouper is anything which pulls the time track into bunch at one or more points when the grouper is gone the time track is perceived to be straight unavailability is caused by the pcs inability to confront or bouncers and denyers bouncer throws the pc backward forward up or down from the track and so makes it apparently unavailable denyer obscures part of track by implying it is not there or elsewhere misdirector or should not be viewed groupers bouncers and denyers are material matter energy space and time in the form of effort force mass delusion etc or command phrases statements that group bounce or deny when grouper bouncer or denyer are enforced by both material and command phrases they become most effective making the time track unavailable to the pc unless the time track is made available it cannot be asised by the pc and so remains aberrative the time track is actual in that it is made of matter energy space and time as well as thought those who cannot confront mest think it is composed only of thought grouper can make pc fat and bouncer thin if the pc is chronically stuck in them or if the track is grouped or made unavailable through bad auditing the origin of the time track through great deal of study not entirely complete the following surmises can be made about the time track thephysical universe and the pc the tendency of the physical universe is condensation and solidification at least this is the effect produced on the thetan continued dwelling in it without rehabilitation causes the thetan to become less reaching smaller and more solid thetan being static may become convinced he cannot duplicate matter energy space or time or certain intentions and so succumbs to the influence of this universe this influence in itself would be negligible unless recorded by the thetan stored and made reactive upon the thetan as time track and then maliciously used to trap the thetan recent researches i have done in the field of aesthetics tend to indicate that rhythm is the source of present time the thetan is carried along both by his own desire to have do or be and by having been overwhelmed in the distant past by continuous minute rhythm this is possible explanation of thetans continuous presence in present time present time then can be defined as response to the continuous rhythm of the physical universe resulting in hereness in nowness in response to this rhythm undoubtedly assisted by overts and implants and convictions of the need of recording the thetan began to respond to the physical universe in his creations and eventually obsessively created by means of restimulatable involuntary intentions the passing moments of the physical universe but only when he began to consider these pictures important could they be used to aberrate him these are only partly permanently created other moments of the past become recreated only when the thetans intention is directed to them on which these parts spontaneously appear the thetan not voluntarily creating them this forms the time track some parts of it then are permanently in state of creation and the majority of it becoming created when the thetans attention is directed to them the permanently created portions are those times of overwhelm and indecision which almost entirely submerged the thetans own will and awareness such parts are found in implants and great stresses these parts are in permanent restimulation the mechanism of permanent restimulation consists of opposing forces of comparable magnitude which cause balance which does not respond to current time and remains timeless such phenomena as the overt actmotivator sequence the problem postulate counterpostulate tend to hold certain portions of the time track in permanent creation and cause them to continue to exist in present time asunresolved masses energies spaces times and significances the intention of the physical universe and those who have become degraded enough to further only its ends is to make thetan solid immobile and decisionless the fight of the thetan is to remain unsolid mobile or immobile at will and capable of decision this in itself is the principal unresolved problem and it itself creates timeless mass which accomplishes the basic purpose of trap the mechanism of the time track can then be said to be the primary action in making thetan solid immobile and decisionless for without record of the past accumulating and forming gradient of solidification of the thetan the entrapment potential of the physical universe would be negligible and the havingness which it offers might be quite therapeutic it probably requires more than just living in the physical universe to become aberrated the main method of causing aberration and entrapment is therefore found in actions which create or confuse the time track thetan has things beyond matter energy space and time which can deteriorate his power of choice his ability to keep two locations separate his belief in self and his ethical standards are independent of material things but these can be recorded in the time track as well and one sees them recover when longer influenced by the time track as the thetan himself makes his own time track even if under compulsion and commits his own overts even on provocation it can be said then that the thetan aberrates himself but he is assisted by mammoth betrayals and his necessity to combat them and he is guilty of aberrating his fellows it is doubtful if another type of being built the physical universe and still lurks within it to trap further but older beings already degraded have continuously been about to help newer beings to go downhill each thetan had his own home universe and these colliding or made to collide probably are the physical universe but of this origin and these intentions we are not at this time certain it is enough for us to resolve the problem of the aberrative nature of this universe and provide technology which assuages that aberration and keeps one abreast of it this is practical and we can already do it further insight into the problem will be further bonus and further data is already in view bulletin 2 on

the pc and adjust his or her chair 2 clear the auditing room with is it all right to audit in this room not metered 3 can squeeze squeeze the cans please and note that pc registers by the squeeze on the meter and note the level of the pcs havingness dont run hav here 4 put in r factor by telling pc briefly what you are going to do in the session start of session 5 is it all right with you if i begin this session now start of session tone 40 has this session started for you if pc says say again start of session now has this session started for you if pc says say we will cover it in moment rudiments 6 what goals would you like to set for this session please note that life or livingness goals have been omitted as they tend to remind the pc of present time difficulties and tend to take his attention out of the session 7 at this point in the session there are actions which could be undertaken the running of general ow or the running of mid rudiments using since the last time i audited you or pull missed whs as indicated but if pc cheerful and needle smooth just get down to work one would run general ow if the pc was emotionally upset at the beginning of the session or if the session did not start for the pc the latter being simply another indication of the pcs being upset or arc broken but these symptoms must be present as sometimes the session hasnt started merely because of poor tone 40 or because the pc had something he wanted to say before the auditor started the session running ow if it is all right with you i am going to run short general process the process is what have you done what have you withheld the process is run very permissively until the needle looks smooth and the pc is longer emotionally disturbed where are you now on the time track if it is all right with you i will continue this process until you are close to present time and then end this process after each command ask when that was the last command is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this process end of process running the mid rudiments one would use the middle rudiments with since the last time i audited you if the needle was rough and if the tone arm was in higher position than it was at the end of the last session order of buttonshere is the correct wording and order of use for the big mid ruds _______ has anything been suppressed _______ is there anything you have been careful of _______ is there anything you have failed to reveal _______ has anything been invalidated _______ has anything been suggested _______ has any mistake been made _______ is there anything you have been anxious about _______ has anything been protested _______ has anything been decided _______ has anything been asserted in using the first three buttons suppressed careful of and failed to reveal the rudiment question should be asked directly of the pc off the meter repetitive when the pc has more answers check the question on the meter if the question reads stick with it on the meter like in fast rud checking until it is clean the last six buttons are cleaned directly on the meter as in fast ruds pulling missed withholds use since the last time you were audited has withhold been missed on you since the last time you were audited is there anything someone failed to find out about you since the last time you were audited has someone nearly found out something about you any of the above versions may be used they are always run repetitively they can also be used without the time limiter eg is there anything someone failed to find out about you body of session 8 now go into the body of the session end body of session 9 is it all right with you if we end off now is there anything you would care to ask or say before i do so end of smooth out session 10 smooth out any roughness in the session if there has been any favoring suppress failed to reveal protest decide overts assert using prefix in this session goals gains 11 have you made any part of your goals for this session have you made any other gains in this session that you would care to mention havingness 12 after adjusting the meter please squeeze the cans if the squeeze test was not all right the auditor would run the pcs havingness process until the can squeeze gives an adequate response ending session 13 is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this session 14 is it all right with you if i end this session now 15 here it is end of session tone 40 has this session ended for you if the pc says repeat end of session if the session still has not ended say you will be getting more auditing end of session tell i am longer auditing you please note that havingness is run after goals and gains as this tends to bring the pc more into present time and to take his attention to degree out of the session wording for the above follows the tradition of earlier model sessions adhere severely to this session form it is nearly an irreducible minimum and is very fast but it is all necessary the random rudiment here is what happened session mid ruds are simply protest assert and decide ri rudiments are suppress and invalidate

office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex cenocon franchise hco bulletin of 27 may 1963 all auditing starrating hco bulletin for academies and shsbc cause of arc breaks lucky is the pc whose auditor has understood this hco bulletin and lucky is the auditor may his own case run well i have just narrowed the reason for arc breaks in auditing actions down to only one source rule all arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge rule to turn off an arc break find and indicate the correct bypassed charge charge can be bypassed by 1 going later than basic on any chain without further search for basic example looking for the pcs first automobile accident finding the fifth instead and trying to run the fifth accident as the first accident which it isnt the bypassed charge here is the first accident and all succeeding accidents up to the one selected by the auditor as the first one or the one to run to greater or lesser degree depending on the amount the earlier material was restimulated the pc will then arc break or feel low or in low morale one can run later incident on chain briefly but only to unburden earlier incidents and the pc must know this 2 unknowingly ignoring the possibility of more basic or earlier incident of the same nature as that being run after the pc has been restimulated on it or bluntly refusing to admit the existence of or let the pc at an earlier incident 3 cleanly missing gpm as one between two goals run consecutively in the belief they are consecutive 4 missing an earlier gpm and settling down to the assertion there are earlier ones 5 cleanly missing one or more ris not even calling them 6 failing to discharge an ri and going on past it 7 accidentally missing whole block of ris as in resuming session and not noticing pc has skipped commoner than youd think 8 accepting wrong goal missing the right one similarly worded 9 accepting wrong ri not getting the plot ri to fire 10 misinterpreting or not understanding data given to you by the pc andor acting on wrong data 11 misinforming the pc as to what has or has not fired and discharged 12 locating the wrong bypassed charge and saying it isthe source of the arc break 13 failing to follow the cycle of communication in auditing these and any other way charge can be restimulated and left prior to where the auditor is working can cause an arc break charge left after later nearer pt than where the auditor is working hardly ever causes an arc break the burden of skilled auditing then is to get ris and gpms and incidents discharged as close to basic first incident as possible and always be prowling for something earlier in contradiction of this is that any gpm fairly well discharged by rrs unburdens the case arc break or arc breaks and any incident partially discharged lets one go earlier the pc never knows why the arc break he may think he does and disclaim about it but the moment the actual reason is spotted the real missed area the arc break ceases if you know youve missed goal or ri just saying so prevents any arc break an arc breaky pc can always be told what has been missed and will almost always settle down at once example pc refuses to come to session auditor on telephone says theres more basic incident or ri or gpm pc comes to session the auditor who is most likely to develop arc breaks in the pc will have greater difficulty putting this hco bulletin into practice perhaps i can help this such an auditor qs and as by action responses not acknowledgments after understanding action can be on an automaticity in the session so this hco bulletin may erroneously be interpreted to mean if the pc arc breaks do something earlier if this were true then the only thing left to run would be basic basic without the pc being unburdened enough to have any reality on it drill and many drills can be compiled on this would be to have lineal picture of time track the coach indicates late incident on it with pointer and says pc arc break the student must give competent and informative statement that indicates the earlier charge without pointing since you cant point inside the reactive bank of pc with pointer drawn time tracks showing gpm series of engrams along free track series of gpms all plotted against time would serve the purpose of the drill and give the studentgraphic arc break experience the trick is to find and indicate the right bypassed charge to the pc and to handle it when possible but never fail to indicate it it is not do that heals the arc break but pointing toward the correct charge rule finding and indicating an incorrect bypassed charge will not turn off an arc break an automaticity as covered later in this hco bulletin is rendered discharged by indicating the area of charge only this is an elementary example pc says i suppressed that auditor says on this incident has anything been suppressed pc arc breaks auditor indicates charge by saying im sorry moment ago i didnt acknowledge your suppression arc break ceases why because the source of its charge that triggered an automaticity of above the pcs tone was itself discharged by being indicated example auditor asks for joburg overt pc gives it auditor consults meter at once asking question again which is protested giving new read pc arc breaks auditor says i did not acknowledge the overt you gave i acknowledge it arc break ceases example auditor asks for ri 173 on first series line plot pc arc breaks giving various reasons why such as auditors personality auditor asks meter have i missed an item on you gets read says to pc ive missed an item arc break ceases whether the missing item is looked for or not is immaterial to this hco bulletin which concerns handling arc breaks if an auditor always does in response to an arc break such as instantly looking for specific earlier items that auditor has missed the point of this hco bulletin and will just pile up more arc breaks not heal them dont be driven by arc breaks into unwise actions as all you have to do is find and indicate the missing charge that was bypassed that is what takes care of an arc break not taking the pcs orders if the arc break does not cease the wrong bypassed charge has been indicated the sweetest running pc in the world can be turned into tiger by an auditor who always qs and as never indicates charge and goes on with the session plan some qs and as would be source of laughter if not so deadly here is q and artist at work and an arc breaky pc will soon develop and this auditor will soon cease to audit because its so unpleasantexample auditor have you ever shot anyone pc yes i shot dog auditor what about dog pc it was my mothers auditor what about your mother pc i hated her auditor what about hating people pc i think im aberrated auditor have you worried about being aberrated pc why did the pc arc break because the charge has never been permitted to come off shooting dog his mother hating people and being aberrated and thats enough bypassed charge to blow house apart this pc will become as this keeps up unauditable by reason of charge missed in sessions and his resulting session dramatizations as overts find and indicate the actual charge bypassed sometimes you cant miss it it has just happened sometimes you need simple meter question since what you are doing is obvious sometimes you need dress parade assessment from list but however you get it find out the exact bypassed charge and then indicate it to the pc the violence of an arc break makes it seem incredible that simple statement will vanquish it but it will you dont have to run another earlier engram to cure an arc break you merely have to say it is there and if it is the bypassed charge that arc break will vanish example pc i think theres an incident earlier that turned off my emotion auditor wed better run this one again pc arc breaks auditor consults meter is there an earlier incident that turns off emotion gets read say what you just said is correct thank you there is an earlier incident that turns off emotion thank you now lets run this one few more times pcs arc break ends at once dont go around shivering in terror of arc breaks thats like the modern systems of government which tear up their whole constitution and honor just because some hired demonstrators howl soon they wont be government at all they bend to every arc break arc breaks are inevitable they will happen the crime is not to have pc arc break the crime is not to be able to handle one fast when it happens you must be able to handle an arc break since they are inevitable which means you must know the mechanism of one as given here how to find bypassed charge and how to smoothly indicate it to leave pc in an arc break more than two or three minutes is just inept and be welldrilled enough that your own responding rancor and surprise doesnt take charge and youll have pleasant auditing arc break processes we had several arc break processes these were repetitive processes the most effective arc break process is locating and indicating the bypassed charge that really cures arc breaks repetitive command arc break process based on this discovery i just made would possibly be what communication was not received expanding this we get new arc straight wire what attitude was not received what reality was not perceived seen what communication was not acknowledged this process is not used to handle session arc breaks but only to clean up auditing or the track if the pc arc breaks dont use process find the missed charge indeed this process may be more valuable than at first believed as one could put in auditing on the front of each one and straighten up sessions and perhaps you could even run an engram with it the last has not been tested in auditing the three questions was wonderful on test 2 div ta in each 10 mins on very high ta case arc break straight wire of 1958 laid open implants like band saw which is what attracted my attention to it again many routine prefixes such as in an organization or on engrams or on past lives could be used to clear up past attitudes and overts we need some repetitive processes today cases too queasy to face the past cases messed up by offbeat processes cases who have overts on auditing or scientology or orgs cases pinned by session overts the bmrs run inside an engram tend to make it go mushy and class i auditors are without an effective repetitive process on modern technology this is it repetitive process even though not looking for basic implies that the process will be run until the charge is off and therefore creates arc breaks unless left unflat therefore the process is safe if flattened rudiments nothing is more detested by some pcs than rudiments on session or gpm or ri whythe same rule about arc breaks applies the charge has been bypassed how consider the session is later than the incident naturally ask for the suppress in the session you miss the suppress in the incident earlier by far result pc arc breaks thats all there is to arc breaks caused by session bmrs or mid ruds example scrambleable eggs wont rr auditor says on this item has anything been suppressed pc eventually gets anxious or arc breaks why suppress read yes but where was the suppress it was in the incident containing the ri the pc looked for it in the session and thereby missed the suppress charge in the incident of the ri which being bypassed charge unseen by pc and auditor caused the arc break remedy get the suppress in the incident not the session the ri rrs also the more ruds you use the more you restimulate when doing routine 3 because the suppress in the incident is not basic on suppress and if you clean just one clean even to test bang there goes the charge being missed on suppress and bang bang arc break lightly auditor lightly q and arc breaks q and causes arc breaks by bypassing charge how the pc says something the auditor does not understand or acknowledge therefore the pcs utterance becomes bypassed charge generated by whatever he or she is trying to release as the auditor ignores it and the pc reasserts it the original utterances charge is built up and up finally the pc will start issuing orders in frantic effort to get rid of the missed charge this is the source of pc orders to the auditor understand and acknowledge the pc take the pcs data dont pester the pc for more data when the pc is offering data when the pc goes to where the auditor commands dont say are you there now as his going is thereby not acknowledged and the going built up charge always assume the pc obeyed until its obvious the pc did not echo metering the pc says you missed suppress its and the auditor reconsults the meter asking for suppress that leaves the pcs offering an undischarged charge never ask the meter after pc volunteers buttonexample youve declared suppress clean pc gives you another suppress take it and dont ask suppress again thats echo metering if pc puts his own ruds in dont at once jump to the meter to put his ruds in that makes all his offerings missed charge echo metering is miserable auditing missed withholds needless to say this matter of bypassed charge is the explanation for the violence of missed withholds the auditor is capable of finding out so the pcs undisclosed overts react solely because the auditor doesnt ask for them this doesnt wipe out all technology about missed withholds it explains why they exist and how they operate indication is almost as good as disclosure have you ever had somebody calm down when you said youve got missed withholds well its crude but it has worked better is some auditor failed to locate some charge on your case or we must have missed your goal but only meter assessment and statement of what has been found would operate short of actually pulling the missed withholds apparent bad morale there is one other factor on bad morale that should be remarked we know so much we often discard what we know in scientology but way back in book one and several times after notably 880 we had tone scale up which the pc climbed as he was processed we meet up with this again running the helatrobus implants as whole track fact the pc rises in tone up to the lower levels of the tone scale he or she comes up to degradation up to apathy and it often feels horrible and unlike an arc break and the sad effect is not cured except by more of the same processing people complain of their emotionlessness well they come up long ways before they even reach emotion then suddenly they realize that they have come up to being able to feel bad they even come up to feeling pain and all that is gain they dont confuse this too much with arc breaks but they blame processing and then one day they realize that they can feel apathy and its win amongstwins before it was just wood and this has an important bearing on arc breaks everything on the whole know to mystery scale that still lies above the pc finds the pc at effect these are all on automatic therefore the pc in an arc break is in the grip of the reaction which was in the incident now fully on automatic the pcs anger in the incident is not even seen or felt by the pc but the moment something slips the pc is in the grip of that emotion as an automaticity and becomes furious or apathetic or whatever toward the auditor none is more amazed at himself or herself than the pc in the grip of the arc break emotion the pc is helpless rag being shaken furiously by the emotions he or she felt in the incident therefore never discipline or q and with an arc broken pc dont join hands with his bank to punish him just find the bypassed charge and the automaticity will shut off at once to everyones relief running routine 3 is only unpleasant and unhappy to the degree that the auditor fails to quickly spot and announce bypassed charge if he fails to understand this and recognize this his pcs will arc break as surely as ball falls when dropped if an auditor has arc breaky pcs only one thing is basically wrong that auditor consistently misses charge or consistently fails to anticipate missed charge one doesnt always have to run the earliest but one had better not ignore the consequences of not pointing it out one doesnt have to discharge every erg from an ri always but one had better not hide the fact from the pc the adroit auditor is one who can spot earlier charge or anticipate arc breaks by seeing where charge is getting missed and taking it up with the pc that auditors pcs have only the discomfort of the gradually rising tone and not the mess of arc breaks it is possible to run almost wholly without arc breaks and possible to stop them in seconds all by following the rule dont bypass charge unknown to the pc l ron hubbard lrhjwrd copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 084 hcopl 31 may 63 training of clears oec v4 p 341 hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead

bulletin of 1 june 1963 ma missions urgent to all auditors routine 2 new processes the recent developments on the political front and various attacks upon scientology and scientologists caused sudden catalyzing of research my answer to these attacks was to 1 hold the front legally employing competent attorneys and others to halt the actions taken against us 2 develop counterattack by upgrading research lines the first part of this program is succeeding push on us in australia has already collapsed and we have won in america the situation continues to improve for us and there is little doubt of our winning eventually the second part of our program is being successful beyond the most happy estimates about five or ten years research work has been crowded into the last six months and although this has been hard work beyond belief i have brought it off the need was for an achievement of the state of operating thetan while this state existed in theory time for an orderly development from aberree to clear to ot was permitted by events my task was to shortcut from aberree to ot and bypass all niceties of inbetween states scientologist needs to be told the significance of this in handling our affairs on earth this sudden speedup disrupted and probably upset many auditors and i am sorry that this interrupted training programs and study what had to be done was done but it did disrupt all previous training and auditing expectancies the first casualty was r212 the moment i was informed of the us and australian attacks i adopted the above twopoint program and even though i knew it would upset things i had choice but to concentrate on those two points so i dropped routine 212 and short while thereafter was able to drop the ardures of goals finding and working at top speed laid open the impasses to ot and developed technology to overcome them well all this i can now state has been successful the gamble was upon the power of an ot we won an ot is so much more powerful than we have ever envisioned that there is now faintest doubt of the wisdom of the twopoint program above the technology now exists for the creation of the state of otfor many weeks now the saint hill course technology has been steady and saint hill students have been successfully applying that technology and it in its essential points is in the hands of central orgs and their staffs are being trained on it we have moved fast my estimate was that we had very few years from january 1963 before the roof fell in not just on us but on earth i thought i could bring this off in that period in only five months it was being brought off short of this i could not see how i could protect individual scientologists from persecution and i was worried about them the state of clear was not enough therefore the technology of ot and controlled environment were the only wholly satisfactory things i could do so dont be shocked at the way r212 and other data was dropped that progress would have been orderly but sudden time limit was placed on us by the washington raids these were not more than symptom of coming chaos not just for us but for earth when government has to imagine crimes to prosecute people for that government is responding to times that are more chaotic than we believe so here is the technical aspect of all this 1 r212 is replaced by arc processing designated r2t any auditor can use it it consists of three questions variously cleared and used which sweep away the ri locks on repetitive process basis 2 any auditor trained to handle r212 is benefited by being now easily trainable on r3n which uses an even simpler approach 3 the state of clear is relegated to courtesy use without test requiring only that gpm has been run first goal clear means one gpm run second goal clear means two gpms run etc we will make attempt to stabilize clears but press them on to ot 4 all concentration in auditing should be toward the state of ot free thetan as they were once known 5 all scientologists should cooperate in making ots and in programs calculated to prevent the environment from degenerating into chaos ______________ it takes about 500 hours to push an average case to ot with present technology clearing gpms and the time track we have very little time not just to make ots but to get things under control so the time factors are very closely figured indeed and theres time to be lost if you enroll at saint hill you will make it faster______________ if the program seems at all unreal then recall the life were living here on earth is little unreal too r2t the basic commands of r2t are these 1 what attitude has been refused 2 what reality has been rejected 3 what communication has not been acknowledged each process is given cyclic ending pc in pt again run the ta action out of each command in turn then out of each one in turn again etc reduce to 25 div of ta motion in 10 minutes of auditing there are various ways of clearing these commands and various ways of using them which will be covered in later bulletins these processes are powerful enough to open up any time track if properly used they do not make an ot they prepare the way to make one and they undo past auditing when prefixed with in auditing they destimulate whatever has been restimulated l ron hubbard founder 086 hcob 4 jun 63 routine 3 handling gpms ntv p 1836 previously

implants that is handled properly is very easy to run and the results delight the pcwhen errors are made and the gpm is mishandled by the auditor the pc becomes lethargic arc breaky and apparent gains are minimal as soon as an auditor realizes this and gets alert on his technical he or she has trouble getting ris to rr the pc has arc breaks and succeeding gpms get easier and easier to audit pc being run on these gpms who develops mass becomes exhausted or arc breaky is simply being run with certain definite r3 errors make up your mind to this and youll begin to be alert when the pc starts running poorly pc running poorly on gpms has had one or more of the following r3 errors committed 1 run without preparation on arc processes only true when gpms cant be found and made to rr 2 wrong goal found by wrong wording of right goal or just completely wrong goal 3 being run on goal too early in the series too soon or getting into second series when first series remains 4 when goal is found as the pcs goal the auditor then runs another goal true of pcs who have had earlier goals found 5 that which is restimulated is not discharged finding several goals without discharging them or scanning over banks 6 running with ris which differ from the basic line plot such as absolutely for absoluteably or for nix there are divergences from the hco bulletin line plot form 7 failure to do the end goal oppose list properly the crime of having 2 or more rring items on same list in nulling always find the next goal formally by list except when pc can see it and even then check it 8 incorrect top oppterm for the goal always list page on what would be the final achievement of this goal and properly null it unless published block form issued after this date exists for it 9 incorrect block ris diverging from pattern 10 wrong word or sequence form for one or more ris 11 failure to discharge an ri grinding it out not blowing it with one or more dial wide disintegrating rrs 12 failure to spot bypassed charge at once and thus not caring promptly for arc breaks 13 forcing the pc on after an arc break without locating the bypassed charge or running pc who is in troublesession after session without finding what charge was bypassed 14 running doped off pc without pulling missed withholds the only cause of dope off 15 failing to follow 3n remedies for lack of rr in that exact sequence given in the hco bulletin and harassing the pc for nonrring ris 16 demanding more data than the pc can give on the facsimiles 17 failure to follow the auditors code 18 programing incorrectly arc breaks the most frequent cause of arc breaks and case deterioration are 1 failure to complete goal oppose list 2 bypassing an ri 3 bypassing skipping gpm 4 wrong top oppterm 5 restimulating more goals than are run 6 departure from pattern 7 bad programing all these add up to bypassed charge of course but the above seven are the specific offenders which give even skilled auditor trouble carelessness on these points can eat up all the immediate case gain note this is the most frequent list not the most dangerous or important which includes wrong goal next goal the next goal should be found by formal last goal oppose list list 50 items beyond last rr or rs completed to clean needle only one item rring on nulling all the rules of listing exist here full valid failure to follow them will cause skip of or failure to find the next goal if this list does not have the next goal on it the pc will arc break sometimes pc can see the next goal and it is it in such cases the goal oppose list is only one item long but it is still list and it does have the next goal on it top oppterm the most insidious offender in wrecking pcs is wrong top oppterm if guaranteed list of block items exists for the goal use it but if such block item list exists you must do list for the top oppterm on the question what would be the final achievement of this goal unless pc random lists foolishly the list should be about half page long with clean needle it is then routinely nulled and the bmrs put in on the 2 or 3 items that stayed in this is however all very tricky as the second series of gpms has things in them that could read as top oppterms for the first series so always conclude top oppterm list by confirming by meter that the resultant word from the list is first series top oppterm dirty needle sometimes in trying to locate the bypassed charge causing an arc break the pcs needle is so dirty that it almost cant be read however there is way to read it when the correct bypassed charge is located and indicated the needle will go beautifully clean ______________ programing there is much technology now on programing which will soon be released programing is what you audit on pc and how to establish it i only wish to note here that for several reasons the best programing for the helatrobus implants for pc who can be made to rr on to forget is as follows run right down from the gpm to forget including its gpm and right on out the gates of heaven doing proper goal oppose list at the end of every gpm you complete there are only about 10 gpms more or less from to forget to the heaven implant and they are all easy ones to run when the pc backs out the gates of heaven an enormous reality results from the orientation achieved follow the precautions in this hco bulletin and you will have trouble and the pc will feel greatif you start forward to the 1st implant gpm i now find after experience with lot of pcs you restimulate too much the pc always has live goal restimulated before and behind and its uncomfortable in backing the pc down you are following the pcs natural tendency and its easier further all the gpms after to forget and including it are breeze to forget is usually the basic gpm on stairs the fancy gpms are all earlier closer to the first one and have spinning plates fast rides etc in them they are not hard if the pc has the last 10 gpms of the first series run first the more gpms you restimulate and dont discharge the more uncomfortable the pc will become and the less apparent gain per gpm i have now found and run the earliest gpms to be dead which is followed by to be hurt to experience nothing to be unbalanced and to be unconscious and believe these are the standard sequence for all pcs in the first series but they are pretty strong for pc who hasnt had the end gpms from to forget to to be in heaven discharged ______________ summary 1 the helatrobus implants run give enormous case gain session by session if run with attention to the points given in this hco bulletin 2 they give when run without the points in this hco bulletin cared for hard exhausting struggle that is very slow going and wearing on both auditor and pc 3 matter how theyre run they give case gain its mainly question of maintaining the thetans morale and saving auditing time it can take more than five times as long to run these implants if it is not done with this hco bulletins view and the pc can get pretty sick so for comfortable run easy on auditor and pc alike and five times as fast or more apply these technical points very carefully indeed i speak form great experience in this matter on the question do they have to be run the answer is yes without running them the track remains too heavily burdened for the pc to get earlier with full perception so there is the barricade you wont find new fad removing it it can only be done smoothly by skilled auditing such as that done at saint hillthey may have implanted heaven but its hell to run especially when you ignore the fine points l ron hubbard founder 088 hcob 8 jun 63 the time track and engram running by chains 2 tv5 p 28791 ntv vii p 187192 hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 8 june ad13 central orgs franchise the time track and engram running by chains bulletin 2 handling the time track although finding and curtailing the development of the time track at genus is not improbable the ability of the preclear to attain it early on is questionable without reducing the charge on the existing track therefore any system which reduces the charged condition of the time track without reducing but increasing the awareness and decisionability of the preclear is valid processing any system which seeks to handle the charge but reduces the preclears awareness and decisionability is not valid processing but is degrading according to early axioms the single source of aberration is time therefore any system which further confuses or overwhelms the preclears sense of time will not be beneficial thus the first task of the student of engram running is to master the handling of time on the preclears time track it must be handled without question uncertainty or confusion failing to handle the time in the pcs time track with confidence certainty and without error will result in grouping or denying the time track to the pc the prime source of arc break in engram running sessions is bypassing charge by time mishandling by the auditor as subhead under this taking and trying to run incidents which are not basic on chain constitute an error in timeand react on the pc like bypassed ris or gpms an arc breakless session requires gentle accurate time scouting the selection of the earliest timed incident available and the accurate time handling of the incident as it is run there are only few reasons why some cannot run engrams on pcs these are 1 q and with the pain and unconsciousness of incidents 2 failing to handle the time track of the pc for the pc 3 failure to understand and handle time 2 and 3 are much the same however there are three ways to move time track about by significance the moment something was considered b by location the moment the pc was located somewhere c by time alone the date or years before an event or years ago you will see all three have time in common the moment when you thought _______ the moment you were on the cliff _______ two years before you put your foot on the bottom step of the scaffold are all dependent on time each designates an instant on the time track of which there can be mistake by either auditor or pc the whole handling of the time track can be done by any one of these three methods significance location time therefore all projectionist work is done by the time of significance the time of location or time alone the track responds those auditors who have trouble cannot grasp the totality and accuracy and speed of that response the idiotic and wonderful precision of the time track defeats the sloppy and careless they wonder if it went they question the pcs being there they fumble about until they destroy their command over the time track go to 47983678283736 years 2 months 4 days 1 hour and six minutes ago well clear statement of it unfumbled will cause just that to happen the tiniest quiver of doubt fumble over the millions and nothing happens fumbled dating gets dates one must date boldly with throat catches or hesitations more than 40000 less than 40000 get it the first read dont go on peering myopically at the meter asking the same question the rest of the session accurate bold rapid those are the watchwords of dating and time track handling in moving time track about move only the track dont mix it and also move the pc you can say move to _______you dont have to say but you can the somatic strip will move to _______ but never say you will move to _______ and this also applies to present time the pc wont come to present time hes here but the time track will move to the date of present time unless the pc is really stuck in getting pc to present time unimportant in modern engram running say move to date month and year of pt in scouting you always use to move to _______ in running an engram or whatever you always use through move through the incident _______ if an auditor hasnt ruddy clue about the time track and its composition he or she wont ever be able to run engrams so obviously the first thing to teach and have passed in engram running is time track composition when the auditor learns that he or she will be able to run engrams if the auditor does not know the subject of the time track well then he or she cant be taught to run engrams for rote commands that cover all cases can exist you couldnt teach the handling of motion picture projector by rote commands if the operator had never imagined the existence of film an auditor sitting there thinking the pc is doing this or that and being in general fuddle about it will soon have film all over the floor and wrapped about his ears his plea for rote command will just tangle up more film so long as he doesnt know it is film and that he not the preclear is handling it if an auditor can learn this he will then be able to learn to run those small parts of the time track called engrams if an auditor cant run pc through some pleasant time track flawlessly he or she sure cant run pc through the living lightning parts of that track called engrams an auditor who cannot handle the time track smoothly can scarcely call himself an auditor as thats all there is to audit besides postulates matter what process you are using matter what process you invent and even if you tried what is laughingly called biochemical approach to the mind theres only time track for the bios to affect theres thetan theres time track the thetan gets caught in the time track the job of the auditor is to free the thetan by digging him out of his time track so if you cant handle what youre digging thetan out of youre going to have an awful lot of landslides and lot of auditing loses for both you and preclears invent games devices charts and training aids galore and teach with them and youll have auditors who can handle the time track and run engrams charge and the time track charge the stored quantities of energy in the time track is the sole thing that is being relieved or removed by the auditor from the time trackwhen this charge is present in huge amounts the time track overwhelms the pc and the pc is thrust below observation of the actual track this is the state of case scale all levels given are major levels minor levels exist between them level 1 track charge level 2 full visible time track some charge level 3 sporadic visibility of track some heavily charged areas level 4 invisible track very heavily charged areas exist black or invisible field level 5 dubin some areas of track so heavily charged pc is below consciousness in them tvxi p 25 corrects this to unconsciousness this appears as unconsciousness in ntv7 without noting the correction level 6 dubin of dubin many areas of track so heavily charged the dubin is submerged level 7 only aware of own track too heavily charged evaluations to be viewed at all level 8 unaware pc dull often in coma on this new scale the very good easy to run cases are at level 3 skilled engram running can handle down to level 4 engram running is useless from level 4 down level 4 is questionable level 1 is of course an ot level 2 is the clearest clear anybody ever heard of level 3 can run engrams level 4 can run early track engrams if the running is skilled level 4 includes the black v case level 5 has to be run on general arc processes level 6 has to be run carefully on special arc processes with lots of havingness level 7 responds to the cchs level 8 responds only to reach and withdraw cchs predianetic and prescientology mental studies were observations from level 7 which considered levels 5 and 6 and 8 the only states of case and oddly enough overlooked level 7 entirely all states of case were considered either neurotic or insane with sanity either slightly glimpsed or decried in actuality on some portion of every time track in every case you will find each of the levels except 1 momentarily expressed the above scale is devoted to chronic case level and is useful in programming case but any case for brief moments or longer will hit these levels in being processed this is the temporary case level foundonly in sessions on chronically higher level cases when they go through tough bit thus engram running can be seen to be limited to higher level cases other processing notably modern arc processes moves the case up to engram running now what makes these levels of case it is entirely charge the more heavily charged the case the lower it falls on the above scale it is charge that prevents the pc from confronting the time track and submerges the time track from view charge is stored energy or stored or recreatable potentials of energy the emeter registers charge very high or low tone arm sticky or dirty needle all are registrations of this charge the chronic meter of case is an index of chronic charge the fluctuations of meter during session are registering relative charge in different portions of the pcs time track more valuably the meter registers released charge you can see it blowing on the meter the disintegrating rr the blowing down of the ta the heavy falls the loosening needle all show charge being released the meter registers charge found and then charge released it registers charge found but not yet released by the needle getting tight by dn by climbing ta or ta going far below the clear read then as this cleans up the charge is seen to blow charge that is restimulated but not released causes the case to charge up in that charge already on the time track is triggered but is not yet viewed by the pc the whole cycle of restimulated charge that is then blown gives us the action of auditing when prior charge is restimulated but not located so that it can be blown we get arc breaks the state of case the chronic level as given on the above scale is the totality of charge on the case level 1 has charge on it level 8 is total charge the day to day condition of case its temper reaction to things brightness depends upon two factors the totality of charge on the case and b the amount of charge in restimulation thus case being processed varies in tone by the totality of charge remaining on the case b the amount of charge in restimulation and c the amount of charge blown by processing charge is held in place by the basic on chain when only later than basic incidents are run charge can be restimulated and then bottled up again with very small amount blown this is known as grinding out an incident an engram is getting run but as it is not basic on achain adequate amount of charge is being released later than basic incidents are run either to uncover more basic earlier incidents or b to clean up the chain after basic has been found and erased full erasure of incidenown time track you cannot have decent honest or capable beings as long as they are trapped and overwhelmed while this philosophy may be contrary to the intentions of slavemaster or degrader it is nevertheless demonstrably true the universe is not itself trap capable only of degradation but beings exist who beaten and overwhelmed themselves can utilize this universe to degrade others the mission of engram running is to free the charge which has accumulated in being and so restore that being to appreciated life all cases sooner or later have to be run on engrams matter what else has to be done for it is in engrams that the bulk of the charge on the time track lies and it is therefore those parts of the time track called engrams which overwhelm the thetan these contain pain and unconsciousness and are therefore the record of moments when thetan was most at effect and least at cause in these moments then the thetan is least able to confront or to be causative the engram also contains moments when it was necessary to have moved and most degrading to have held position in space and the engram contains the heaviest arc break with thetans environment and other beings and all these things add up to charge an impulse to withdraw from that which cant be withdrawn from or to approach that which cant be approached and this like two pole battery generates current this constantly generated current is chronic charge the principal actions are when the attention of the thetan is directed broadly in the direction of such track record the current increases b when the attention is more closely but not forcefully and accurately directed the current is discharged c when the basic on the chain is found and erased that which composes the poles themselves is erased and later incidents eased for further generation is possible by that chain and it becomes incapable of producing further charge to be restimulated the above are the actions which occur during auditing if these actions do not occur despite auditing then there is case betterment so it is the auditors responsibility to make sure they do occur as the time track is created by an involuntary response of the thetan it is and exists as real thing composed of space matter energy time and significance on level8 case the time track is completely submerged by charge even down to total unawareness of thought itself at level 7 awareness of the track is confined by extant charge to opinions about it at level 6 charge on the track is such that pictures of pictures of the track are gratuitously furnished causing delusive copies of inaccurate copies of the track at level 5 charge is sufficient to cause only inaccurate copies of the track to be viewable at level 4 charge is sufficient to obscure the track at level 3 charge is sufficient to wipe out portions of the track at level 2 there is only enough charge to maintain the existence of the track at level 1 there is charge and track to create it all charge from level 1 and up into higher states that is generated is knowingly generated by the thetan whose ability to hold locations in space and poles apart results in charge as needful this would degenerate again as he put such matters on automatic or began once more to make time track but these actions alone are not capable of aberrating thetan until he encounters further violent degradation and entrapment in the form of implants aberration itself must be calculated to occur the existence of time track only makes it possible for it to occur and be retained thus thetans first real mistake is to consider his own pictures and their recorded events important and his second mistake is in not obliterating entrapment activities in such way as not to become entrapped or aberrated in doing so all of which can be done and should be engram running is step necessary to get at the more fundamental causes of time track and handle them so it is skill which must be done and done well l ron hubbard lrhdrjh copyright

letter of september 10 1962 cenocon staff clearing program this replaces all programs there are other staff clearing programs of any kind auditing is being given to staff this doesnt disturb staff families and so forth being fed into the hgc at unit rates as offered for dc only when you have spare auditor or intern or something like that but it does knock out all other staff clearing programs in its place we put staff clearing program which we will call the staff r3 clearing program the essence of this is supervision and administration the personnel required for it are supervisor saint hiller and an assistant he has an office and auditing room which are the same thing this auditing room also has in it an administrative desk for use after auditing hours the activity of the staff who are auditing each other is as follows problems intensive if necessary then running on current goals procedures saint hiller is appointed as staff supervisor of staff cases he calls them in during the day checks over cases and progresscan even audit them does anything and everything to clear them now there are two zones of activity i for the inexperienced the untrained or the fellow who doesnt think he is too competent to audit somebody this we call the staff coaudit and that meets at least twice week in the evening for three hour session they would give three hours and receive three hours like they would give three hours on tuesday and receive three hours on thursday now this activity is supervised by the part time assistant of the supervisor who is also the administrator he comes on duty at the end of the days auditing in the hgc and does his administrative actions and on the off evenings when hes not supervising any class he can catch up on his administrative work reports and so on this fellow has aboard which denotes the staff coaudit and how many people are on that now we come to the second activity on staff which is mutual auditing activity and everybody has pc and everybody is pc these hours of auditing are given at the discretion of these people they can audit in their own rooms or most anyplace everyone of their sessions has to have full auditing report which must be brought into the administrator of the staff clearing program who is the staff auditor who is also the supervisor of the staff coaudit and that auditor report must be checked out and okd and an eye must be kept on the progress of the sessions theres rule here that person may not receive more auditing hours than they give so therefore the number of auditing hours received and given must be posted as part of the posting on the lists of this mutual auditing activity of course the staff coaudit keeps itself more or less straight but if somebodys absent from that god knows what happens this must be discouraged on goofoffs persuasive action will be taken we will just say this is the way it is this is what you do and god help you if you dont if youre not interested in clearing somebody in the staff clearing program we dont think youre interested in being part of this org we wont threaten with immediate excommunication because people get restimulated and everything else but dont expect on clearing program everything is going to go smooth and everybodys going to stay in session because theyre not there will be lot of randomity and it takes just pure unadulterated force to keep it in line now there must be checking of rudiments and checking for missed whs and such activities as that how these are arranged is relatively unimportant but they must exist if the supervisor or technical director finds that staff auditor is goofing up on his staff clearing program pc there should be an investigation of hgc to find out what that staff auditor is doing to the public pcs the coaudit supervisor moves as rapidly as possible to get as many goals run out as possible when new person comes on staff he is added to the bottom of the list order of seniority must be established from time to time introduce any necessary training to keep the members of the coaudit abreast of current technique the supervisor finding bad sessions going on should make some duressful action he should say the bulletins were available you didnt read them what the hell was wrong with you this is tough this program is not the courtesy staff mutual coaudit or staff clearing weve had in the past where we were being nice to everybody and marking time theres vast difference here this is ourdetermination to get everybody cleared on staff it takes somebodys determination to get people cleared person himself bucking into this line is apt to quail and fall back so therefore you have to keep the determination high to get the project completed its not courtesy our feeling is if person does not want to get cleared or help clear somebody he has business whatsoever in the organization thats just that bang the administrator makes the team assignments but appeal may be made to the supervisor or technical director whose adjudication is final you can have an additional part time administrator to help out and if you have another well fine theres limit on this except the amount of talent you must not put non sthil graduate on the post of supervisor it would cause the demise of the org this program abolishes the responsibility of the d of p for staff state of case that all goes under the supervisors hat the supervisor could be the technical director or another saint hill graduate working under technical director coaudit teams which exist already on staff and which are successful should not be broken up this would be breach of the auditors code do not permit frequent change of auditors that is the program as i see it if this is carried forward quite forcefully and quite persuasively and without anybody listening to any nonsense and so forth youre going to wind up with in very few months bunch of clears on staff arc break assessments are done where necessary anything and everything is done to help clearing of staff if you kept this program going forward and furnished people for training to sthil on whom you could count when they came home in sufficient number so that youve got them for the public and youve got them for staff youll wind up with completely ot staff before you get through and i can see that this is well within our existing technical reality two further notes an eye should be kept on the progress of cases and it should be part of the supervisors hat to check such cases that are listing to clear and frankly his time from the time he ceases to audit on his regular auditing period during the day to the end of the working day should be more or less consumed with checking over cases and seeing how they are going rather than doing administration these cases should be checked over for free needle and this and that and the other thing the missed wh program run on staff by org sec or throughhco or by hgo or by the org sec sec or anything else any security program of any kind or any missed wh program of any kind has absolutely nothing to do with the staff clearing program l ron hubbard lrhdrrd copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard

by chains bulletin 3 routine 3r engram running by chains given knowledge of the composition and behavior of the time track engram running by chains is so simple that any auditor begins by overcomplication you almost cant get uncomplicated enough in engram running in teaching people to run engrams in 1949 my chief despair was summed up in one sentence to the group i was instructing all auditors talk too much and thats the first lesson the second lesson is all auditors acknowledge too little instead of cheerily acking what the pc said and saying continue auditors are always asking for more data and usually for more data than the pc ever could give example pc i see house here auditor okay how big is it thats not engram running thats just lousy q and the proper action is pc i see house here auditor okay continue the exceptions to this rule are nonexistent this isnt special brand of engram running it is modern engram running it was the first engram running and is the last and you can put aside any complications in between the auditor is permitted one question per each hew point of track and that is all example auditor move to thebeginning of the 88 plus trillion year incident waits moment what do you see pc its all murky auditor good move through the incident wrong example auditor move to the beginning of the 88 plus trillion year incident waits moment what do you see pc its all murky auditor can you see anything in the murk flunk flunk flunk the rule is acknowledge what the pc says and tell him to continue then theres the matter of being doubtful of control wrong example auditor move to yesterday are you there how do you know its yesterday what do you see that makes you think flunk flunk flunk right example auditor move to yesterday waits moment what do you see good another error is failure to take the pcs data you take the pcs data never take his orders right example auditor meter dating is it greater than eighteen trillion less than eighteen trillion gets contradictory reads or dn off meter are you thinking of something pc its less than 18 trillion auditor thank you on meter is it greater than seventeen trillion five hundred billion less than pc its seventeen trillion nine hundred and eight billion four hundred and six million ninetyfive thousand seven hundred and six years ago auditor having alertly written it all down thank you ends dating wrong example auditor is it greater than eighteen trillion less than eighteen tr pc its less than eighteen trillion auditor ok is it greater than eighteen trillion less than eighteen flunk flunk flunk in dating the pcs contrary data unspoken and untaken can give you completely wrong date your data comes from the pc and the meter always for anything and if the pcs data is invalidated you wont get meters data if the pc says he has ptp and the meter says he doesnt you take the pcs data that he does in dating an argument with the pc can group the track so take the pcs data and if the pc is dubin you should be running the arc processes not engrams anyway as the case is overcharged for engrams if the pc isnt dubin then the pcs data is quite reliable also minimize pcs dependency on meter dont keep confirming pcs data by meter read with that reads yes thats there yes theres rocket read just let the pc find his own reality in running an engram all auditors talk too much you can date on meter but only so long as the pc doesnt cognite on the date you can help pc identify or choose an area of track but only if hespecifically asks you to example pc ive got two pictures here can you find out which one is the earlier one is of freight engine the other is whole train auditor on meter is the freight engine earlier than the whole train is the whole train earlier than the freight engine to pc the whole train reads as earlier now however if the pc has two facsimiles your problem is only that youve missed something rule whenever charge is missed the time track tends to group this does not mean the auditor has to do something about it unless the pc gets confused and asks for help at which time the only action is to spot on the meter what charge has been missed and tell the pc arc breaks all routine 3 arc breaks including r3n and r3r are handled the same way an exact way there is deviation from this if the pc becomes critical of anything outside the engram room auditor scientology the technology it is an arc break arc breaks are of greater and lesser magnitude ranging throughout the misemotional band of the tone scale the handling of arc breaks always follows this rule arc break rule 1 if the pc arc breaks issue further auditing commands until both pc and auditor are satisfied that the cause of the arc break has been located and indicated do not issue more orders do not run process do not offer to run process do not sit idly letting the pc arc break follow this rule arc break rule 2 when pc arc breaks or cant go on for any reason do an r3r arc break assessment and locate and indicate to the pc the bypassed charge the only harm that can be done in r3r or r3n is issuing further orders to the pc or trying to run something before the bypassed charge has been located and indicated given this handling of arc breaks and an exact adherence to the rote of r3r all former problems of engram running vanish early engram running auditor who knew earlier than june 1963 engram running should consider he or she knows how to run engrams routine 3r is itself it has dependence on earlier methods of running engrams failure to study and learn r3r because one knows about engram running will cause lotof case failure early engram running was often attempted on cases below case level 4 the technology further was too varied too much was demanded of the pc too little effort was put into finding the basic on chain too many forcing techniques were used too often the auditor ran just any engram he could get these and other faults prevented engrams from being run r3r is rote procedure that is victory in itself but it is better procedure if you know oldtime engram running there is attempt here to invalidate you or that knowledge or make you wrong in any way those are all ways to run engrams and gave you better grasp on it i only wish to call to your attention that r3r is not oldtime engram running but is scientology routine designed to achieve the state of ot and is not designed for any other use than freeing the spirit of man therefore study and use r3r and dont mix it with any earlier data on engram running anything you know about engram running will help you understand r3r but it wont help your pc if mixed in with r3r i couldnt put this too strongly youll trace any failure in the auditor with r3r to 1 inability to execute the auditing cycle 2 inability to run session 3 failure to study and understand the time track 4 failure to follow r3r exactly without deviation 5 failure to handle arc breaks as above 6 using r3r on lower level cases not prepared by preengram running processes routine 3r engram running by chains is designated routine 3r to fit in with other modem processes it is triumph of simplicity it does not demand visio sonic or other perception at once by the pc it develops them the ordinary programming of the lowest level case would be reach and withdraw processes cchs repetitive processes r3r r3n r3r routine 3r is the process that leads to case level 2 only some additional exercises are needed then to attain the next level otso r3r is the fundamental bridge step to ot and were going only for ot now for various reasons including political we have bypassed clear which remains only as courtesy title denoting one or more gpms run many cases even the black v can begin at once on r3r r3r by steps r3r is run in the 3n model session preliminary step establish the type of chain the pc is to run by assessment step one locate the first incident by dating step two move pc to the incident with the exact command move to date step three establish duration length of time of incident an incident may be anything from split second long to 15 trillion trillion years or more long step four move pc to beginning of incident with the exact command move to the beginning of the incident at date wait until meter flicks step five ask pc what he or she is looking at with the exact command what do you see if pcs eyes are open tell pc first close your eyes acknowledge whatever pc says do not ask second question ever step six send the pc through the incident with the exact command move through the incident to point duration later step seven ask nothing say nothing do nothing except observe meteror make quiet notes while pc is going through the incident if the pc says anything at all just acknowledge and let him continue using this exact command softly okay continue do not coax distract or question pc during this period exception only if the pc arc breaks take action and then only do the r3r arc break assessment if the pc gets stuck bounces gets into another incident or if the somatic strip sticks or refuses to obey the auditor only do an arc break assessment do not force the pc onward by any command or question step eight when the pc reaches the end of the incident usually pc moves or looks up say only what happened take whatever pc says acknowledge only as needful say nothing else ask nothing else when pc has told little or much and has finished talking give final acknowledgement step nine repeat exactly and only steps two to eight continue to do so until pc either spots an earlier incident or b gets change on run through the incident from the run just before in event of either or b do steps one to eight exactly and only on the new incident step ten at the end of any session of r3r leave the pc where he is on the time track do not attempt to bring the pc to present time or take the pc to rest point as these actions may very well bypass charge end any r3r session with very careful goals gains as the pc is usually rather anaten and any needed havingness but keep the havingness very brief only enough to restore can squeeze do not end session on boiloff or arc break step eleven at the beginning of any new r3r session if you finished the last engram you were working on begin precisely and anew with step one if you are still working on an engram already found begin precisely with step four and carry onstep twelve if the pc gets into trouble in the session do not use mid ruds or ask for missed withholds mid ruds will mush an engram missed withholds unless found as part of the arc break assessment may move the pc violently about through recently found engrams do only the arc break assessment and locate and indicate charge accordingly if the session goes wrong since the last time i audited you mid ruds and missed withholds are permissible at session start before any r3r action is taken in that session step thirteen when encountering goals engram such as the helatrobus implants lay aside r3r and use r3n when encountering goals engram prior to the helatrobus implants or subsequent to them use r3m2 but only when such an engram has ris step fourteen when basic on any chain is found flatten it fully and permit it to be stripped of any lock engrams or earlier incidents that appear in finding basics remember that the time track by my most recent measurements considerably exceeds trillion trillion trillion years basics may occur as early as they occur but seldom nearer pt than 200 trillion years ago and quite ordinarily at 15 trillion trillion years ago end of steps there is variation of these steps for any reason this is the most exact procedure known and there you have it rote engram running superior to any engram running ever done and giving superior and faster results future hco bulletins will expand the reasons for these steps give exact methods of dating give the arc break assessment for r3r the assessment for types of chains

to run engrams it does not have to be run on pc before engrams are run only when an auditor can produce results with r2h should he or she run engrams on any pc for r2h combines the most difficult

reality communication triangle from which comes the tone scale and is best covered by the booklet notes on lectures bypassed charge is covered very fully in recent hcobs on arc breaks r2h by steps the auditing actions of routine 2h are complex and must be done with great precision the actions are done in routine 3 model session mid ruds and missed withholds may be used step onetell the pc recall an arc break when pc has done so acknowledge that the pc has done so do not ask the pc what it is if pc says what it is simply acknowledge it is business of r2h to know what the arc break consists of step two date the arc break on the meter if the pc volunteers the date do not verify it on the meter further accept it at once and write it down the date is more important than the content of the arc break step three assess the arc break for bypassed charge using the attached list find the greatest read the assessment is seldom gone over more than once as whole and those that read are then read again until one remains this is rapid action on the meter look only for tiny ticks or falls or small left to right slash of the needle do not expect large reactions the mark v meter is indispensable step four indicate to the pc what charge was missed in that arc break he or she has recalled the pc must be satisfied that that was the charge missed the pc may try to recall what it was that was indicated this is not vital part of the drill but the pc must be satisfied that the located bypassed charge was the source of the arc break there is danger here of great deal of auditor adlibbing and tanglefoot if the pc is not satisfied and happier about it the wrong by passed charge has been found and step three must be redone it is part of this process to run an engram or secondary thus located the assessment form this is sample form it may be necessary to add to it some lines of it may eventually be omitted however thisform does work the auditor may add few lines to it in asking the questions preface the whole assessment with in the arc break you recalled _______ do not preface each question so unless pc goes adrift dirty needle means pc has started to speculate ask have you thought of anything and clean needle had an engram been missed had withhold been missed had some emotion been rejected had some affection been rejected had reality been rejected had communication been ignored had similar incident occurred before had goal been disappointed had some help been rejected was an engram restimulated had an overt been committed had an overt been contemplated had an overt

the correct incident chain is run on the pc for that pc many chains locks secondaries and engrams are available on any pc but some of them are beyond the pcs reality and ability and some of them are too featherweight to get any case gain the basic problem in starting case on r3r is to run the pc on chain that will improve the case b hold the pcs interest c be within the pcs current ability to handle the establishing of the correct chain was missing element in all earlier engram running almost any pc from level 7 upwards could have run engrams if the exact chain necessary to resolve the case could have been established this is accomplished now by an accurate assessment using sensitive emeter and the following form and procedure it does not matter if the pc begins on chain of locks secondaries or engrams so long as running it does b and c above you do not have to specify in r3r whether you are running engrams secondaries or locks the word incident covers all also it does not matter if the pc stays within this lifetime or goes whole track so long as the assessed chain is followed and basic eventually discovered for it the chain leads where the chain leads but once having found the proper chain the auditor must follow that chain not skip about to do this the auditor when asking for an earlier incident in later r3r steps always specifies the proper chain found in this assessment by the level item result of this preliminary step assessment for example if the chain found here in the preliminary step is decisions to die level found decided item found to die one obtains earlier incidents by always saying is the next earlier decision to die more than years ago less than years ago thus the result obtained in the preliminary step is used on and on until an actual basic is reached this may be fiftyor more engrams run and perhaps even some r3n in the middle of the chain if the chain leads into gpm by normal rote use of r3r when basic is reached and discharged and the chain being run now gives little or ta action or even free needle new preliminary step is done but until that happens this preliminary step is not repeated with the other steps once it has happened basic found and run however new preliminary step is done exactly as given here for the first chain assessment you find the chain you run engram after engram on that chain or lock after lock or secondary after secondary you find basic you run the basic thoroughly with ta action now gone on the chain found you do new preliminary step rule ta action exists on the correct chain rule chain once assessed must be fully run rule ta action ceases on discharged chain rule new assessment is done only when chain is discharged rule any properly assessed chain will produce ta action rule if chain assessed does not produce immediate ta action with skilled r3r the assessment or the resulting question formed is incorrect the exact procedure of assessment is 1 assess pc by elimination as below for r3r form level 2 list the form level found to completed list 3 nul the completed list to single subject 4 use the form level plus subject to designate the character of the incident to be found every time an incident is looked for all rules of listing as developed in r212 apply to this preliminary step they are not repeated here one is not looking for rrs or rses in the preliminary step assessment any type of read is valid arc breaks when doing this step of r3r use the arc break assessment for listing form not the r3r arc break assessment form the main sources of arc breaks in the preliminary step are 1 wrong level assessed 2 the listed list incomplete 3 the wrong item taken from the list 4 former chain or engram abandoned to do new assessment 5 earlier levels restimulated old prehav auditing 6 earlier listing restimulated such forms will be published from time to time as they tend to change and improve earlier assessments done the very earliest assessment 1948 used was what the pc could see when he closed his or her eyes this was then run this was followed by an arbitrary method of assigning necessary incidents to be run such as birth and prenatals the next earliest assessment 1949 was to ask each time for the incident necessary to resolve the case an automaticity known as the file clerk was depended upon impinged into action by finger snapping the next period 1951 concerned whole track exploration running whatever you could get to read on meter the next period 1952 concerned overt engrams located by what the pc seemed to be doing physically this ended the dianetic period where engrams were run to clear but mainly to cure psychosomatic illnesses variations of these assessments were revived from time to time in dianetic uses culminating in the 5th london acc where overt engrams were run with confront and great stress was laid on getting the postulates out of them the meter and shrewd guesses played their part in assessments up to this time there was great dependence on insight and judgment we were barred to some degree by my own ability to see other peoples pictures which made engram running very easy for to do along with my general knowledge of the whole track and the mind this led to be very hard to convince that engram assessment was subject at all or that most auditors couldnt do itwith the advent of scientology with its complete shift from dianetic goals healing went out as reason for running engrams and concern about the body vanished as an auditing target this led to stresses on exteriorization of the spirit moving it away from the body as the reactive bank was thought to be part of the body its engrams received further attention eventually i discovered that the thetan had engrams and that these were being automatically involuntarily created by him engram running has vanished as healing process engram handling by chains has emerged as an entirely reoriented subject not even vaguely connected with the body and with the target not of human clear but of operating thetan the assessment for engram chains or any kind of chain emerges finally in routine 3r this assessment technology from beginning to end is scientology none of it was ever heard of in dianetics therefore we have crossed bridge i have finally understood that precise assessment is vital for an auditor and that an auditor can learn the exact chain to be run on the pc without any intuition or second sight and that even my own auditing is bettered thereby and that the thetan cannot be freed and reempowered without an assessment and rote technology for engram running this is r3r the earliest r3r assessment for chains was done by pc interest and the button protested the pc was merely asked in this lifetime what have you protested and with listing whatever the pc said and seemed interested in was taken this however did not often produce adequate ta action when the chain was then run the next improvement was using the 18 prepcheck buttons this drew blank on some pcs level reacting accordingly i then developed new prehav scale based mainly on flows it is protest that is basically responsible for making mental image picture however very few cases are up to this level in order to bring more levels of case under engram running and to get more ta action for any case i developed this preliminary step scale the present scale takes some account of 1 the old prehav scale 2 the knowtomystery scale 3 the chart of attitudes 4 the 18 buttons and 5 the flows scale as well as some old wellknown buttons several possible levels such as create have been left out because they would go at once into the gpm or implant goals it may not be important that they do indeed with experience we may even come to guide the pc at them but for the moment they are left outthere would be nothing wrong in borrowing further from these sources to draw up longer preliminary step scale but i think this should cover most pcs the three most important visible factors in r3r are pcs interest b tone arm action c the ability of the pc to run the incidents if the auditor can see these he knows his preliminary assessment was right interest does not mean happiness and joy interest is only absorbed attention and desire to talk about it tears terror or agony may be present without the interest factor being absent chain of engrams is expected to produce pain and anaten chain of secondaries is expected to produce misemotion these have nothing in them to head an auditor off chain equally significance and story content have bearing on the rightness or wrongness of chain selected they are entirely incidental to judging the correctness of chain all the auditor is interested in is whether the pc is interested b the ta action is good and c can the pc run the incidents on the chain with correct and exact r3r that careless auditing and bad r3r can influence c leaves us with only two exact criteria for correct assessment pcs interest and b ta action while running incidents only these two things tell us the assessment was right the assessment can be right and unskilled r3r can wreck both in the later steps fact which has to be taken into account in reviewing cases in progress r3r assessment this is the assessment for r3r preliminary step in this form will be recognized the old prehav scales and others but improved for the purpose of engram chain assessment this assessment must be done accurately it is hard to do if the pc doesnt understand level during assessment ks startled by one or disagrees these will make the assessment inaccurate if the assessment is inaccurately done the pc will arc break or the resulting engram chain will not give ta action when being runthe final level assessed will probably give ta action at once when found if right the key sentence in assessing is in this lifetime have you mainly level this is repeated for each level called levels are called once as in ordinary elimination those that stayed in are reassessed the same way the one form can be used for many additional assessments on the same pc as chains are run out the use of this form brings r3r down to case level 7 in workability chain of engrams being run must give ta action if none is present in running engrams and the ta stays high or low the assessment was wrong the level found here is used to make and complete list with the question in this lifetime what have you level found in this lifetime is used not because we only want chains in this lifetime but to keep pc from going all over the track during the preliminary assessment this making it too long the chain you want comes into this lifetime all rules of listing apply as in r212a in doing this list in event of an arc break while doing the preliminary step use the arc break assessment for listing if needle dirties up in assessing this form give form to pc and ask what happened and if that fails get in bmrs on this assessment suppressed

opinions about not had opinions about in nulling this scale the pc may suddenly break down emotionally or get an overpowering reaction not just twinge or an interest in level since the pc will not know the real level until it is found if so stop dont go on go back to above the point where pc was all right and then carefully null back down to where you stopped go over this area getting in suppress and invalidate if needful and youll have the pcs level found you may lead into arc breaks if you persist in going on as you have bypassed charge but the pcs reaction must be large for you to use this mechanism beware of sell by the pc pc doesnt know the level until it is actually found some pcs will decide on level and it will then read in such case get in protested and decided with on this scale haveyou by fast check dont let your pc mess up an assessment by sell or decision but dont keep on down long assessment of this scale with the pc shattered by pain or emotion as the pc will suppress the right level when you have found the pcs level on the above scale by elimination then list the following question using that level found in this lifetime what have you level found list the list to clean needle so that it nuls very easily leaving very few in on the first nulling only two or three in on the second nulling of what has been left in put mid ruds in on these if necessary nul out to the final item combine the level found and the item found this is very simple step the wording may have to be altered in tense but not in sense decided may become decision failed to think may become failure to think in the item found some shift of the pcs wording may be needful but be very careful that you get combination of level and item that makes sense to the pc and reads on the meter without protest reading too these reads are often not very large and at best assume steep falls with ta action so be careful to add up the level and the item found to sensible statement that does not alter the sense for instance you can err greatly if the level was fear and the item was entrapment if you vary it to fear of traps that wont give you the same chain at all the correct one is fear of entrapment of course you can have correct level correct item and then fail to combine the two sensibly if so you will get confused pc and b wrong chain either way youll get little ta action and r3r done the level failed to convince and the item father had better be left just that way it gives short chain this lifetime soon done by changing the item father to fathers you would go whole track but the significance is wildly altered and might not run at all the less alteration the better and never alter the sense of it use the question is the first available level item incident earlier than five years ago later than five years ago and using times to suit go on with step one of r3r note the above scale is in random order of arrangement at this time and positions of levels on the scale have

assessment hco bulletins on all executives including registrars and on all staff auditors and instructors arc break assessments these lists are valuable intelligently used they put an auditor or scientology staff or executive at cause over all session arc breaks and scientology upsets the following assessments are for use in finding bypassed charge in various auditing activities the source of all arc breaks is bypassed charge there is other source of arc breaks the type of charge that canbe bypassed varies from one auditing activity to another r3r 3n etc therefore different lists for assessment are necessary for different routines in auditing another list for general auditing is also necessary everything that has been written about bypassed charge is valid all by passed charge is in some degree missed withhold missed by both auditor and pc having these lists for assessment there is excuse for an arc break to long continue in session or for anyone to remain arc broken with scientology the following assessments find what kind of charge has been missed it is then up to the auditor to locate it more precisely as to character and time and indicate it to the pc the pc will feel better the moment the right type of bypassed charge is identified by assessment and indicated by the auditor if the pc does not feel better but further arc breaks then the assessment is either incomplete or incorrect many complicated ways exist for charge to be bypassed there is reason to go into these you will find it is always bypassed charge and that it could have been located and indicated in any arc break r2h is the training process for use of these lists in r2h devoted to in auditing or when an arc break is found in past auditing session during an r2h session the type of list that applied to that session is used there are four ways of using these lists the first is to assess by elimination and come up with one list line still reading on the meter and indicate it as the charge to the pc the second is to go down list taking each one that reads and clearing it up with the pc finishing the whole list and then finally indicate what read the most the third way is like the second except that the pc is required to help find what made the type of charge read and actually identify it as particular thing the fourth way is to assess only for biggest read or one line and have the pc help spot it the third way is the one most commonly used at the end of session where it is just cleaning up the session and each question is completely cleaned on the needle in turn the first way is most used on violent arc breaks the second or the fourth ways are used in r2h assessment often has to be done through dirty needle effort is made to clean it up before assessment and just because the needle is dirty is reason to call them all in learn to read through dn for both arc break assessments and dating it is rather easy to do with mark v meter as the characteristic of the dn shifts when one is in effort has been made here to convert the words tononscientology language as the sense would be lost to scientologist these lists are all barebone and contain only the usual types of by passed charge they may be added to as experience with them increases they become too unwieldy when they are too long the only way you can get confused as to how to locate and indicate charge is by finding the wrong charge general arc break assessment used in general sessions of all kinds where an arc break has occurred or at session end in all routines and for r2h the prefix sentence in this session has is used when cleaning up session at its end or during the session at that time had is used for r2h the actual date may be occasionally substituted for time to keep the pc oriented but only

coachs questions is given in addition coach should take instructions from the commands and training stress and frame them in the form of questions for example in cch 1 coach could ask did you make every command and cycle separate coach must avoid invalidating student and not ask questions on what coach thinks the student has done wrong the correct method is to ask few questions at time choosing and forming questions at random on the other hand coach should not ask question about something that has not happened in the drill for example in cch 3 if coach has not manifested dopeoff coach would not ask when i doped off did you take my hand and execute the command one hand at time cch 1name give that hand tone 40 commands give that hand physical action of taking hand when not given and then replacing it in the coachs lap making physical contact with the coachs hand if coach resists thank you ending each cycle all tone 40 with clear intention one command in one unit of time take up each new physical change manifested as though it were an origin by the coach when it happens and querying it by asking whats happening this twoway comm is not tone 40 run only on the right hand position student and coach seated in chairs without arms students knees on outside of both coachs knees purpose to demonstrate to pc that control of pcs body is possible despite revolt of circuits and inviting pc to directly control it absolute control by auditor then passes over towards absolute control of his own body by pc training stress never stop process until flat place is reached freezes may be introduced at end of cycle this being after the thank you and before the next command maintaining solid comm line to ascertain information from the coach or to bridge from the process this is done

half inch of space between his and the coachs palms the command being put your hands facing mine about 12 inch away follow them and contribute to their motion did you contribute to their motion

hand mimicry something was needed to supplant look at who am i and find the auditor part of rudiments cch 4name book mimicry commands there are set verbal commands student makes simple motions with book hands book to the coach coach makes motion duplicating students mirrorimagewise student asks pc if he is satisfied that the coach duplicated the motion if coach is and student is also fairly satisfied student takes back the book and goes to next command if coach is not sure that he duplicated any command student repeats it for him and gives him back the book if coach is sure he did and student can see duplication is pretty wrong student accepts coachs answer and continues on gradient scale of motions either with the left or right hand till coach can do original command correctly this ensures invalidation of the coach tone 40 only in motions verbal 2way quite free position student and coach seated facing each other comfortable distance apart purpose to bring up pcs communication with control and duplication control and duplication communication training stress stress giving coach wins stress students necessity to duplicate his own commands circular motions are more complex than straight lines tolerance of plus or minus randomity are apparent here and the student should probably begin on the coach with motions that begin in the same place each time and are

and why tv5 p 3147 ntv vii p 2204 hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 9 july 1963 central orgs franchise technical summary the required skills of processing and why here is where we stand and where were going an auditor to make clear or ot has to be able to handle confidently certain skills today we assume that every successful process we ever had is and was valid process we are at point of summation and valuation as we are achieving excellent and steady progress even on the most unlikely cases i consider that the period of basic mental research has ended and the period of adjustment of skills on which i will for some time be engaged has been entered upon i list here the auditor skills which are requisite to handle any case skills by case level case levels 8 7 and 6 objective processes reach and withdraw commands cchs havingness processes case levels 7 6 and 5 model session repetitive command processes r2h meter reading simple assessment of form case levels 6 5 4 and 3 assessment of levels listing and nulling lists r3r 3n these constitute to use another table the following exact skills handling the pcs body as in reach and withdraw or 8c ability to execute the auditing cycle ability to give repetitive commands ability to handle meter ability to run model session and keep the pc in session ability to read tone arm ability to accurately meter date ability to run r2h ability to locate and handle arc breaks ability to assess simple form ability to find level ability to list complete and nul list ability to run r3r ability to do 3n ability to do form line plot for gpm ability to do line plot for an offbeat gpm ability to list for and find goal ability to list for and find top oppterm knowledge of the time track knowledge of the thetan knowledge of the basics of life general knowledge of scientology note the abilities of r3r r3n and r2h are also listed separately in the above these briefly are the skills required to make an ot they are well taught at saint hill they are practiced in central orgs as fast as released hco bulletins exist on nearly all this material except some fine points of r3r which are known but not yet written up and some of the r3n line plots not yet issued basic skills if you examine the above you will find that where the auditor cannot do the required skill the faults are only one or more of the following cannot execute the auditing cycle cannot execute an auditing cycle repetitively cannot handle session cannot read meter cannot study and apply scientology data given the ability to execute the auditing cycle once or repetitively handle session read meter and study and apply procedures all the above listed auditing skills are easily acquired and successfully done therefore in looking for the reasons for results one finds the failure to apply the required procedure and in tracing that one inevitably finds one or more of these five basics amiss in the auditor it is longer question of whether scientology works it is only question of whether the auditor can work scientology if he or she cant then the trouble lies in one or more of these basics the trouble does not lie with the procedure or with the pc of course some procedures above are harder to do than others and some pcs can worry an auditor far more than others but these are incidental and are very junior to the five basics abovethe lower the case level of the auditor the harder time he or she will have grasping the knowhow and using it for instance squirrel is only dramatizing case level 6 or 7 student having rough time is case level 6 or 5 somebody almost heartbreaking to teach is case level 7 or 8 but with alert guidance and even making mistakes i have seen case levels from 3 to 8 alike getting wins and finally smoothing out on the five basics above ive seen it myself in the past two years of training at saint hill so ive discarded case level as an index of auditing ability it is only an index of howhardtotrain the question of psychotic or neurotic does not enter these are artificial states and have real bearing surprisingly enough on case level my belief in an auditors ability to audit has far more bearing on his auditing than his or her aberrations the only factor left is auditor judgment this varies about and improves with wins but processes are so arranged that it is question only of what is the highest process that gives ta action rather than presession case estimation trial and error is the best test i would use it myself for i have often found the most unlikely preclear at first glance capable of running high level processes and some very capable people at casual inspection unable to see wall so i always run the highest level that i hope pc can run and revise on experience with the pc if necessary former training as all modern courses and academies have stressed basic skills as above for some time past training has been lost those who learned r212 are much better fitted to do r3r and 3n than those who did not we look on any auditor today to be able to do repetitive processes but remember that was sometimes hardwon ability and old book and bottle was developed to assist it people who learned prehav assessing or goals finding are definitely well progressed anyone who can do the cchs successfully will always find them handy so i count training lost and i am about to collect ill earlier processes that worked on psychosomatic ills and publish them since being careful not to do healing has not protected us at all and we might as well take over the medical profession for i now find that only their trade association has been firing at us in the press so that opens up use for almost all training on processes ever given if an auditor has learned the above basics he or she can easily do the long list of skills required for clearing or ot clearing we can clear to keyedout clear or clear stably i have considered it necessary to stress thorough clearing we are on longer road but more certain and stable road when we erase the time track or sections of it clear is now case level 2 the main goal however is ot due to the general situation when we were attacked i decided on policy of 1 hold the line on the legal front and 2 accelerate research to ot as our best means of handling the situation both these policies are being successful in the extreme and i hope you agree with them by courtesy one gpm run gives first goal clear further test is done one chain of engrams completed is an r3r onechain clear this is easier than you might think theta clear at this time is case level 2 that is exterior ot is case level 1 complete with skills rehabilitated the route to these states is very well established and is contained in the first list above hours of processing cases require as many hours as they are located on the case level scale the lower they are the more hours they require the higher they are the less they require as some index i have had about 800 hours lately including all techniques from r212 forward much of it purely research auditing on myself as pc developing procedures and getting line plots barely 250 hours of this was effective auditing and i am definitely on the easy last half to ot in period of about half that mary sue achieved 10 goal clear and has just completed her first assessed r3r chain this included all the r3 goals work the research of r212 on her as pc as well as r3n and r3r effective auditing given the data now known amounted to about 150 hours or less guess to ot given skilled auditor and training on all modern data as above and an able pc would be less than 500 hours to one chain r3r clear this expectancy is being fulfilled on the saint hill course for those now in z unit to this would have to be added any processing time necessary to get the pc up to r3r i consider that ot lieson the sunny side of 1000 hours of processing now for cases that can be audited difficulty of clearing case is really easy higher state attained is an uphill fight so dont underestimate the difficulty of clearing we went too long on the time track before developing and working at scientology but we can do it and it is lot more than worthwhile it is vital that we do do it if we miss now we may be finished for there is help elsewhere and there never has been this technology or any successful mental technology and just now nobody cares but us when weve succeeded all the way everybody will want on but not yet my own job is very far from an end the job of getting the purely technology developed and organized is practically over unless you consider recording of the full technology as part of the job ive only recorded essentials and am just writing the last bulletins on those but ahead is vast panorama of research on other dynamics and enormous amounts of other technology l ron hubbard lrhdrrd copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 106 hcopl 9 jul 63

oppterm creationishness to creatingishness and make other pattern changes as indicated above text for hco bulletin the aircraft door goals this goal pattern hco bulletin of 17 april 1963 as changed was in use in an aircrafttype set between 315 trillion years ago and 216 trillion years ago and less and is the pattern which precedes the helatrobus implants in this galaxy it remains to be seen if all preclears have it the goals were given with one or more goals in seriesusually one and that goal was to create the preclear possibly has this goal several times during this period it was given in the mockedup fuselage of an aircraft with the thetan fixed before an aircraft door there are also two or more aircraft fuselages used in the helatrobus implants but the preclear moved through them was not fixed in them the date is the way to tell the pattern the helatrobus implants existed only between 52 trillion and 38 trillion years ago the total life span of the helatrobus government if the goal is found to lie earlier between 315 trillion and 216 trillion or later up to 52 trillion years ago then it is probably this pattern the goal items were laid in with explosions the gorilla goals this same pattern but given in an amusement park with single tunnel roller coaster and ferris wheel was used between about 319 trillion years ago to about 256 trillion trillion years ago long span the symbol of gorilla was always present in the place the goal was given sometimes large gorilla black was seen elsewhere than the park mechanical or live gorilla was always seen in the park this activity was conducted by the hoipolloi group of operators in meat body societies they were typical carnival people they let out concessions for these implant amusement parks pinkstriped white shirt with sleeve garters was the uniform of the hoipolloi such figure often rode on the roller coaster cars monkeys were also used on the cars elephants sometimes formed part of the equipment the hoipolloi or gorilla goals were laid in with fantastic motion blasts of raw electricity and explosions were both used to lay the items in the series is always five goals these are very simple goals long words to end to be dead to be asleep to be solid to create to find to be visible to be sexual not to have sex as some pcs give it to be invisible to postulate and very few more were used always five goals in series the series usually started with to be dead but to end to sleep and to be asleep must also be investigated as the first goal of each series the pattern in hcob 17 apr ad 13 is correct for all of these goals as changed in this hco bulletin the bear goalsfrom about 256 trillion trillion years ago to about 370 trillion trillion years ago the gpms are the bear goals these use the same pattern similar amusement park arrangements the same type of goals as the gorilla goals the only real difference is that instead of mechanical gorilla mechanical or live bear was used and the motion was even more violent there is however change of pattern in the bear goals in that two ris were added these come as pair just below the vast value of goaling they are oppterm any worries about being or goaling opposed by terminal worried goaler aside from this addition the pattern is the same as the gorilla goals mostly raw electric sprays are used in the bear goals to drive in the items the bear goals were handled by group called i think the brothers of the bear and were the ancestors of the hoipolloi the black thetan goals from about 390 trillion trillion years to 370 trillion trillion years ago the black thetan goals were given these were given in glade surrounded by the stone heads of black thetans who spat white energy at the trapped thetan the trapped thetan was motionless the pattern is the earliest to form of gpm now known there were six ris per goal consisting of accomplished not accomplished action ing never action ing goal not goal there were from 15 to 18 goals in the series all of simple nature such as to end to be dead to be asleep etc the full series will be published at later date but is easily reconstructed always following the same pattern of six the invisible picture goals from somewhere around 110000 trillion trillion years ago or earlier to 390 trillion trillion years ago the most difficult gpms on the track were given these contain four ris per set positivenegative in dichotomy examplewake never wake sleep never sleep the four given five times for every one picture shown this makes 20 firings per picture but the first picture is invisible and the thetan afterwards is not expected to find then the first twenty firings of ris four in row repeated five times this makes vacuum for picture and groups the bank this type of implant is probably the source of vacuums in the reactive mind the remaining pictures vary during different periods of the sequence but consist usually of scene of cave railway an airplane view of sun and planets the first picture making the total number of five is invisible and is picture the pictures have moving object in each except the invisible one which backs up halfway through the series the trick is to get the ris out of the invisible picture particularly the basic first four the ris also fire right left then left right so that the never ri the next time has swapped sides they go positive negative then with swapped sides positive negative they are simple aberrative words start never start end never end are always the first firings followed by begin never begin stop never stop for the second whole series of firings the same four run through all five pictures then the next four go through all five etc there are many words used early in the series 3dimensional sets were used late in the series only 2 dimensional pictures were employed ______________ there may be earlier gpmtype implants but the goal idea does not go back earlier evidently than 390 trillion trillion yearsin the black thetan implants earlier material is only positive negative and dichotomies according to present data but the earlier ones are more aberrative to the pc ______________ programing the trick is to run full series through on any of these as found matter how late it is in the period then find the first time the series was given the pc and run the complete series then get the next earlier type of series and do the same thingyour pc may not have been in the areas where these patterns were used and may have different types of implants if so make sure first that the implant you have found does not contain one of these patterns before going to the hard labor of trying to make one up with the pc later day implants between 38 trillion years ago and present time lot of offbeat implants can be found they sometimes have only pictures sometimes only items sometimes items and pictures both they are usually short often have goal in them only positivenegative commands and are not hard to work out the pc can usually get them easily if theyre on his assessed r3r chain ______________ warning in complex gpm pattern almost anything can be made to fire until the exact ri is found then rr is left wrong ris leave white mass and eventually crumple up the engram missed ris leave black strips or patches partially discharged ris leave gray patches restimulated but not run ris turn everything black in the picture scan pc through ris you dont suspect and it all goes black get wrong date or wrong duration and the pc has visio or pictures that dont belong there ______________ summary this is rapid resume of principal gpms on the track where the pattern applies it must be done exactly as given note all trillions used are us trillions which are 1000 million l ron hubbard founder 111 hcob 17 jul 63

out errors observed in running 3n and may be of value to other orgs re probable field and org alteris on the running of 3n on my return here i found the following errors among others being committed in the running of 3n by the hgc auditors and even worse in the staff coaudit i fear they may be occurring elsewhere 1 confusions in the blue line plot hco technical form of may 26 ad13 in block two goal being directly added into blue line plot which already has to written in producing eg absolutable to to forget nix absolutable to to forget etc very common and apparently getting some sort of rrs on them when found in great numbers also to to forgetting etc in the 149 160 band b in block five inserting the ing form of the goal in the blank while an ing is sitting on the line already producing eg those who are forgeting ing someone who isnt ever forgetting ing there is extra ing c in block six incorporating the er into the oppterm side producing the exhaustion of forgetering the stupidity of forgetering there isnt any er on the oppterm side d in block five and block six attempting to form the ing form of the goal by adding ing to the goal minus to which as fas as i can see would only occur at item 163 164 thus producing many items with section reading such as go awaying not going away and be in heavening not being in heaven even though the earlier line plot red has the ing form of these goals indicated in the block 2 rerunning gpms after they had been run through to bottom oppterm rather than finding next goal and going on one poor sob had partly run gpms first 3 and then to be in heaven run as next goal in series i say partly because of chocked rrs one of them rerun twice and one rerun once and goal oppose long done done on to remember after to go away had been run which actionapparently sticks batches of the other goals on the list all this done with the sickenedup line plots as shown above 3 despite clarity of approriate bulletins run to be in heaven with and assertion that it is the 4th goal of the series ________________ id recomment clarification on the blue plot and warning to be published on at least the 2nd point auditors tend to look at the goal as

break process despatch from dennis stephens dscn acting assoc sec sydney is informative in handling coaudit on the arc break processthe commands of the arc break process are not entirely fixed at this time but are more or less as follows each command being called leg what attitude has been rejected what reality has been refused what communication has been ignored in private sessions each leg of this process is run flat more or less before the next is run and so on and on around and around some effort being made to give each leg an equal time the rules of arc to raise one that is low raise the other two apply so that great stress is given an inability on one leg but all are treated equally the process fits in at case level 5 is bit higher than r2h l ron hubbard the despatch follows dear ron the new arc 1963 process is producing good results here in sydney we have recently introduced it onto our public coaudit certain problems introduced themselves in the application of this process to group of unskilled auditors who were not trained in the use of emeters etc the process as given was to be run leg at time each leg to quiet ta or 3 equal comm lags or cognition now to run it against the ta on public coaudit meant each student had meter which they havent and the idea was rejected as impractical similarly training them in spotting cognitions and comm lags was also rejected as being time consuming the other possibility was the supervisors go around continuously and take ta reads now this system is not good because the supervisor coming up and taking reads disturbs the pc and so disturbs the ta and so defeats its own purpose the other possibility was an elaborate series of wiring where each pc is switched in to master board and the supervisor by switches plugs each pc onto the meter at his desk we havent got such equipment and can barely afford its installation anyway that was discarded too how to run it well i tried the following system out and it works like dream other orgs might find it useful too the pc runs the first leg until he has more answers he then goes to second leg until he has more answers andsimilarly with the 3rd leg he then returns to the first leg etc etc if the pc should ever heaven forbid and its never happened yet have more answers for each and every leg he either has thumping arc break or needs prod from the meter so the supervisor would just meter check one of the legs and steer the pcs attention to the answer and hes off on another chain the system works ok because the pc is going round and round the same series of commands and always gets another chance to look at each question run in this manner the process becomes virtually unlimited this system of running the process is particularly applicable where raw people are concerned with not even comm course under their belt and fresh from pe course anyway it works very well very best dennis l ron hubbard lrhdrjh copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 113

rightness and wrongness form common source of argument and struggle the concept of rightness reaches very high and very low on the tone scale and the effort to be right is the last conscious striving of an individual on the way out iamrightandtheyarewrong is the lowest concept that can be formulated by an unaware casewhat is right and what is wrong are not necessarily definable for everyone these vary according to existing moral codes and disciplines and before scientology despite their use in law as test of sanity had basis in fact but only in opinion in dianetics and scientology more precise definition arose and the definition became as well the true definition of an overt act an overt act is not just injuring someone or something an overt act is an act of omission or commission which does the least good for the least number of dynamics or the most harm to the greatest number of dynamics see the eight dynamics thus wrong action is wrong to the degree that it harms the greatest number of dynamics and right action is right to the degree that it benefits the greatest number of dynamics many people think that an action is an overt simply because it is destructive to them all destructive actions or omissions are overt acts this is not true for an act of commission or omission to be an overt act it must harm the greater number of dynamics failure to destroy can be therefore an overt act assistance to something that would harm greater number of dynamics can also be an overt act an overt act is something that harms broadly beneficial act is something that helps broadly it can be beneficial act to harm something that would be harmful to the greater number of dynamics harming everything and helping everything alike can be overt acts helping certain things and harming certain things alike can be beneficial acts the idea of not harming anything and helping everything are alike rather mad it is doubtful if you would think helping enslavers was beneficial action and equally doubtful if you would consider the destruction of disease an overt act in the matter of being right or being wrong lot of muddy thinking can develop there are absolute rights or absolute wrongs and being right does not consist of being unwilling to harm and being wrong does not consist only of not harming there is an irrationality about being right which not only throws out the validity of the legal test of sanity but also explains why some people do very wrong things and insist they are doing right the answer lies in an impulse inborn in everyone to try to be right this is an insistence which rapidly becomes divorced from right action and it is accompanied by an effort to make others wrong as we see in hypercritical cases being who is apparently unconscious is still being right and making others wrong it is the last criticismwe have seen defensive person explaining away the most flagrant wrongnesses this is justification as well most explanations of conduct matter how farfetched seem perfectly right to the person making them since he or she is only asserting selfrightness and otherwrongness we have long said that that which is not admired tends to persist if one admires person for being right then that persons brand of being right will persist matter how mad it sounds scientists who are aberrated cannot seem to get many theories they do not because they are more interested in insisting on their own odd rightnesses than they are in finding truth thus we get strange scientific truths from men who should know better including the late einstein truth is built by those who have the breadth and balance to see also where theyre wrong you have heard some very absurd arguments out among the crowd realize that the speaker was more interested in asserting his or her own rightness than in being right thetan tries to be right and fights being wrong this is without regard to being right about something or to do actual right it is an insistence which has concern with rightness of conduct one tries to be right always right down to the last spark how then is one ever wrong it is this way one does wrong action accidentally or through oversight the wrongness of the action or inaction is then in conflict with ones necessity to be right so one then may continue and repeat the wrong action to prove it is right this is fundamental of aberration all wrong actions are the result of an error followed by an insistence on having been right instead of righting the error which would involve being wrong one insists the error was right action and so repeats it as being goes down scale it is harder and harder to admit having been wrong nay such an admission could well be disastrous to any remaining ability or sanity for rightness is the stuff of which survival is made and as one approaches the last ebb of survival one can only insist on having been right for to believe for moment one has been wrong is to court oblivion the last defense of any being is i was right that applies to anyone when that defense crumbles the lights go out so we are faced with the unlovely picture of asserted rightness in the face of flagrant wrongness and anysuccess in making the being realize their wrongness results in an immediate degradation unconsciousness or at best loss of personality pavlov freud psychiatry alike never grasped the delicacy of these facts and so evaluated and punished the criminal and insane into further criminality and insanity all justice today contains in it this hidden error that the last defense is belief in personal rightness regardless of charges and evidence alike and that the effort to make another wrong results only in degradation but all this would be hopeless impasse leading to highly chaotic social conditions were it not for one saving fact all repeated and incurable wrongnesses stem from the exercise of last defense trying to be right therefore the compulsive wrongness can be cured matter how mad it may seem or how thoroughly its rightness is insisted upon getting the offender to admit his or her wrongness is to court further degradation and even unconsciousness or the destruction of being therefore the purpose of punishment is defeated and punishment has minimal workability but by getting the offender off the compulsive repetition of the wrongness one then cures it but how by rehabilitating the ability to be right this has limitless application in training in social skills in marriage in law in life example wife is always burning dinner despite scolding threats of divorce anything the compulsion continues one can wipe this wrongness out by getting her to explain what is right about her cooking this may well evoke raging tirade in some extreme cases but if one flattens the question that all dies away and she happily ceases to burn dinners carried to classic proportions but not entirely necessary to end the compulsion moment in the past will be recovered when she accidentally burned dinner and could not face up to having done wrong action to be right she thereafter had to burn dinners go into prison and find one sane prisoner who says he did wrong you wont find one only the broken wrecks will say so out of terror of being hurt but even they dont believe they did wrong judge on bench sentencing criminals would be given pause to realize that not one malefactor sentenced really thought he had done wrong and will never believe it in fact though he may seek to avert wrath by saying so the dogooder crashes into this continually and is given his loses by itbut marriage law and crime do not constitute all the spheres of living where this applies these facts embrace all of life the student who cant learn the worker who cant work the boss who cant boss are all caught on one side of the rightwrong question they are being completely onesided they are being lastditchright and opposing them those who would teach them are fixed on the other side admityouarewrong and out of this we get not only nochange but actual degradation where it wins but there are wins in this imbalance only loses for both thetans on the way down dont believe they are wrong because they dont dare believe it and so they do not change many preclear in processing is only trying to prove himself right and the auditor wrong particularly the lower case levels and so we sometimes get nochange sessions and those who wont be audited at all are totally fixed on asserted rightness and are so close to gone that any question of their past rightness would they feel destroy them i get my share of this when being close to extinction and holding contrary views grasps for moment the rightness of scientology and then in sudden defense asserts his own rightnesses sometimes close to terror it would be grave error to go on letting an abuser of scientology abuse the route is to get him or her to explain how right he or she is without explaining how wrong scientology is for to do the last is to let them commit serious overt what is right about your mind would produce more case change and win more friends than any amount of evaluation or punishment to make them wrong you can be right how by getting another to explain how he or she is right until he or she being less defensive now can take less compulsive point of view you dont have to agree with what they think you only have to acknowledge what they say and suddenly they can be right lot of things can be done by understanding and using this mechanism it will take however some study of this article before it can be gracefully applied for all of us are reactive to some degree on this subject and those who sought to enslave us did not neglect to install rightwrong pair of items on the far back track but these wont really get in your way as scientologists we are faced by frightened society who think they would be wrong if we were found to be right we need weapon to correct this we have one here and you can be right you know i was probably the first to believe you were mechanism or mechanism the road to rightness is the road to survival and every person is somewhere on that scaleyou can make yourself right amongst other ways by making others right enough to afford to change their minds then lot more of us will arrive l ron hubbard lrhgljhcden copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved

hco bulletin of 22 july 1963 issue ii central orgs tech depts org technical hgc processes and training hco secs check out on all technical staff star rating it is of the utmost importance that hgc technical continues to be maintained as the worlds best auditing the whole repute of scientology on continent ultimately depends on the quality of technical delivered by central organizations in times of shifting technology this may be considered difficult however nothing in the book maintains that an hgc must only deliver the latest the book only says the best staff morale the unit broad dissemination depend basically upon technical quality if you will look into even the oldest hgc files you will find profiles with fine gains this does not mean thenthat todays research line has to be installed at once to get gains on pcs of course to attain clear or ot todays research line is vital but the problem is not upper echelon processing in hgcs it is lower level cases if you go not on the basis of make clears and ots but solely on the basis of get maximum tone arm action on the pc you will have very happy pcs and eventual ots to get tone arm action it is necessary to 1 have pcs who are getting wins and 2 have staff auditors doing processes they can do successfully hgc gains then depend on getting tone arm action on every pc and b training auditors to handle the five basics well programming for hgc pcs depends on the pc and the auditor available programming pcs the stable datum for programming pc is rule run the highest level process on the pc that can be run that produces good tone arm action the stable dont for programming pc is rule dont run process pc feels he or she cannot do or the auditor cannot do you dont need to predetermine and sometimes downgrade pcs level in order to process him or her programming has nothing to do with tests or hope or critical opinion programming is trial and error proposition based on c what highest process gives the pc ta action d what process has the pc been interested in what process can the auditor do confidently pc interest is nearer certainty of needle reads on the meter and tone arm action than many other methods of assessmentany pc who has had earlier auditing can tell you what was or was not interesting discussion of this with the pc will establish which type of process it was dont necessarily just go on doing that process but use it to classify what type of process the pc will most likely have wins doing ie objective processes repetitive processes engram running etc lot of pcs are audited at levels they have idea they can do they will do them but simple discussion about processes they have been interested in doing will reveal to them and the auditor where they are most likely to get ta action with strain gains gains on pc can be measured in terms of charge discharged not necessarily in goals run out or some specific action done you can run out goals with ta action run out engrams with ta action and yet the pc does not change the goals set by the pc at session beginning change on changing pc in reviewing cases watch those goals on the auditors report if they deteriorate the auditor has messed it up leaving bypassed charge if they remain the same session after session there was real ta action if the goals change session by session theres lots of ta action too you can just get lots of ta action whatever you run and eventually see cleared pc matter what is run lack of ta action will clear one wrong time is the exclusive source of ta action therefore as pcs time concept is improved or his dates corrected you will see more ta action but many things contribute to wrong time including bad meter dating and time disorienting implants the question is not what corrects the pcs time so much as is the pc getting the tone arm action that shows time is being corrected well done auditing cycles alone correct flawed time concept so you have pc interest and tone arm action that tell you the programming is right and if the pc is going clear and ot buck these things and the pc wont go anywhere matter what is run precautions wrong dates wrong goals wrong items bypassing charge never flattening process running pc beyond regaining an ability or cogniting the process flat account for most upset in auditing there is valid reason for pc getting upset now that arc break assessments exist providing that the auditor isauditing as per the next section auditor skill basic auditor skill consists of five things if an auditor can do these five little further trouble will be found any staff training program any academy basic goal any hgc auditing that produces results depend on these five basics if you review staff auditors or examine students on these basics by themselves all auditing would rest on solid ground and get gains where any one of the following are out in an auditor there is going to be trouble all along the line fancy new process will cure what is wrong in session if these things are not present the basic auditing skills are 1 ability to execute the auditing cycle 2 ability to execute the auditing cycle repetitively 3 ability to handle session 4 ability to read meter 5 ability to study and apply scientology data it takes very little to establish the presence or absence of these abilities in an hgc auditor or student each one can be reviewed easily view an auditors ability to audit in the light of the above only put him on tv for halfhour rudiments and havingness actual session of any model session he or she is trained to use and watch 1 to 4 above then give him or her an unstudied short hco bulletin and see how long it takes for the auditor to pass verbal exam on it comparison of this data with number of the staff auditors hgc case reports will show direct coordination to the degree that few results were obtained the auditor missed on 1 to 5 above to the degree that good results were obtained the auditor could pass 1 to 5 above inspection of half dozen different cases the auditor has done is necessary to see complete co ordination there is your training stress for staff training programs only when the above skills are polished up do you dare to go into involved processes with the auditor for more complicated process further throws out any existing errors in the above five abilities and makes hash out of the lot during such period one can fall back on auditor confidence what process is the auditor confident he or she will get wins with well let him or her run it on the current pc and meanwhile with training smooth theauditor out and get him or her genned in on higher level or more recent processes without an auditor case will not progress and case will progress more with confident auditor who can do something of what he or she is doing than with an auditor who is shaky for the shakiness will magnify any faults in the five skills that the auditor has auditors do by and large pretty fine job it takes while to gen in new skill i can do it in one or two sessions so its not causing any strain mary sue can get one straight in about four sessions so nobody expects new skill to appear magically perfect in time at all but the length of time it will take to groove in on new skill depends on the five abilities above the main auditor faults will be found in auditors who are trying so hard themselves to be right that thee and must be proven wrong that shows up most strongly in 5 above the degree of disagreement an auditor has with data measures the degree of unworkability that auditor will enter into processing and this is the same degree that that auditor thinks he or she has to preserve his or her survival by making others wrong this also enters into the other four abilities by covert effort to make the pc wrong this is rare but it is best measured by an inability to accept data and so can be tested by 5 above processing on rightness and wrongness remedies this other processing remedies it and just practice remedies it this factor is easily disclosed as unhandled in some training courses where blowing student sometimes gives long dissertations on what they dont agree with in scientology that what they say doesnt exist in scientology does not deter them from believing it does for their last spark of survival demands that only they be right and all others wrong such state of mind doesnt make good auditor since both scientology and the pc must be made wrong squirrels are only case levels 7 or 6 dramatizing alteris on scientology instead of their track even they can be made to audit by long training even in the absence of processing they arent just trying to make others wrong essentially that is the characteristic of case level 8 unaware there arent many of these around auditing and training can handle them even if it takes long time such people would almost die literally if they found they had ever been wrong and they get quite ill with aplomb just to prove you are wrong it goes that far case level or sanity have little to do with anything when it comes to training auditors insanity is goal to be insane not an index of potential auditing ability and only case level 8 does complete shatter of session as an auditor take these factors into first account in an hgc dont keep staff upset by shifting processes continuallyprocessing is pretty stable which is why i can give you this expectancy for new high level performance in hgc groove the staff auditor in for wins and ta action and all will be well groove them in by processes only and all will be chaos and in the academy stress this data and teach the five abilities above beyond all other data and youll have auditors if the hgc could expect from an academy graduates who had the five abilities listed above everyone would get more comfortable an hgc need not have to run school of its own to provide itself with auditors summary the data i have given you in this hco bulletin is not subject to change or modification hgc pcs will only win if they are run so as to obtain good ta action the hgc will have trouble achieving that only to the degree that its staff has not achieved the five abilities above we are building on very solid ground all actions we now undertake in the hgc and academy should contribute to successful auditing for out of that alone can clearing be achieved l ron hubbard lrhdrrd copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 115 hcob 23 jul 63 auditing rundown missed whs to be run in x1 unit tv5 p 328 ntv vii p 242 hubbard communications

title remimeo supervisors students central orgs tech depts training technology coaching theory material all stress in the theory section of the course is on duplicating and understanding the correct data the student must duplicate the data before he can understand it however simple duplication with the use of memory machine does not mean that the understanding is present if the student understands the data he will find that he has little difficulty in duplicating retaining and applying it i have tried out method of coaching theory on the saint hill special briefing course that has gotten amazing results when it was correctly appliedwhat do you consider that means coaching orill the student and the coach sit opposite each other each holding copy of the material to be learned step one the coach has the student read aloud the rule axiom definition sentence or short paragraph to be learned the coach must ask for only one major thought at time when the student has read what was asked for the coach acknowledges the coach repeats this step until the student reads the exact material as written step two the coach asks the exact question what do you consider that means and always acknowledges whatever answer the student gives step three repeat step one and step two until the student duplicates the material to be learned in response to the question what do you consider that means the coach then asks the question do you understand what it means if the student doesnt or is not sure the coach gets the student to define each word on the line clearing up any that he was not sure of or hesitated overwith good dictionary the coach makes sure that all definitions of word are cleared and gets the student to use them in sentences until he undersrands them then he repeats steps one and two until the student is able to duplicate the material and understands what it means the coach then takes up the next major thought sample what do you consider that means coaching session coach read the 1st arc break rule aloud student all arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge coach good what do you consider that means student well pause all arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge coach thank you do you understand what it means student yes all arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge coach very good now read the 2nd arc break rule student to turn off an arc break find and indicate the bypassed charge left out correct coach ok read that again student to turn off an arc break find and indicate the oh correct bypassed chargecoach thank you what do you consider that means student goes into an explanation coach when student is finished thank you read the 2nd arc break rule student does so coach thank you what do you consider that means student shorter explanation coach thank you read it again student does so coach thank you what do you consider that means student lets see in order to handle an arc break find and indicate the bypassed charge coach thank you read it again student to turn off an arc break find and indicate the correct bypassed charge coach good what do you consider that means student to turn off an arc break find and indicate the correct bypassed charge coach thank you do you understand what it means student yes coach good read the next sentence student charge can be bypassed by one going later than basic on any chain without further search for basic coach good what do you consider that means student well you can bypass charge by going after something closer to present time than the basic on the chain and stopping there without further search for basic coach exact word for word duplication not being necessary for something not in capital letters good do you understand what it means student yes coach good read the next sentence etc another examplecoach read the 1st arc break rule student all arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge coach good what do you consider that means student all arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge coach thank you do you understand what it means student im not sure coach has the student define each word and cears up any word he is not sure of with good dictionary the coach makes sure that all definitions of word are ceared and gets the student to use them in sentences until he understands them student does so coach good what do you consider that means student gives an explanation coach good continues steps one and two until student gives exact duplication of the rule in response to what do you consider that means good do you understand what it means student yes coach good read the 2nd arc break rule etc tips to coaches the exactness of duplication required is dependent on the importance of the material axioms rules stable data in capitals and patter must be duplicated word for word and understood definitions must be closely duplicated and understood general theory and examples must be understood if you are in doubt whether the student has duplicated the data well enough continue the drill this coaching method works well only if it is tightly muzzled any extra questions or additives to the exact procedure of steps one two and three are destructive the coach may understand and acknowledge student originations but he must do nothing else not designated in the drill coaches will flnd that some students may spend some time on the first few bulletins coached in this manner however the students ability to duplicate and understand will improve rapidly and his learning rate will come way up if the student has too much difficulty doing this drill run reach and withdraw on the material to be learned to flat point and return to the drill if you havent done this drill you wont know that it works do it do it exactly as written and youll bewinning from

manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 28 july ad13 central orgs franchise star rating time and the tone arm hco secs check out on all technical staff except for percentage of cases which is not star rated i recently completed study begun many years ago which gives us new hope and easier auditing of difficult cases we have known for many years dianetic axioms that time is the single source of human aberration this did not have the importance it deserved to make an ot one has to clear the time track this seemed very easy when i discovered few months ago that anybody can run an engram the reasons one cant are just 1 wrong time of the incident 2 wrong duration of the incident 3 incident may contain an implanted gpm or 4 it may be false track therefore having wrong time andwrong duration so anybody that can be put into an auditing session can run time track with good perception if the perceptions arent there its just wrong time or wrong duration or both or its gpm in which case one reverts at once to r3n or its false track in which event one finds accurately when it was installed and the duration of that incident all apparent grouping of the track comes either from wrong time or false track which is also wrong time either one looks like incidents are grouping well that seemed to wrap up clearing and ot but i still didnt broadly release it i wanted to be sure i dont mind being wrong but i dislike making you wrong in your auditing its already happened too often so i carefully researched this all over again and found it was not enough just to clean track one had to run track with tone arm motion thats the real barrier to clear and ot given the above data one can run incidents and gpms but do these when run give tone arm motion without tone arm motion charge is being released and actual case betterment is observed beyond few somatics removed the pcs session goals stay the same the pcs life doesnt change so the clue to ot and clear is tone arm motion it must exist during the session if it doesnt something is wrong at first i thought that dating prepcheck on dating or on dates would reestablish all ceased ta action it will up to point and is valuable repair of cases must contain such prepcheck and also discovering wrong dates and durations on engrams and gpms this is vital but it will not make some cases continue to get ta motion on the time track if case even when cleaned up on dating and properly assessed for level and item in r3r or on r3n does not then get ta motion on running track another factor is present what is that factor the pc has fragile tone arm just one wrong date or duration in r3r or just one wrong ri in r3n and tone arm action ceases the ta going way up or down and staying there stuck ta cases then give us type of case so i knew there was another factor involved rather than time alone time remains the single source but pcs regard for or attitude about time can make it difficult for the auditor to run r3r or r3nregard for time sums up of course into arc about time or just arc the mechanics of time as in earlier writings time is actual but is also an apparency see dianetics 55 or other similar material time is measured by motion motion is matter with energy in space thus person can conceive of time as only matter and energy in space such as clock or planetary rotation time is actual but the person has become so dependent on matter moving in space to tell time that his time sense has become dependent on matter energy and space we care only for ta action our opinion of pcs time sense is unimportant does the pc get ta action on r3r andor r3n if so the pcs time sense is okay for making ot straight away if not if the ta is fragile sticks easily high or low then the pcs time sense needs improving time sense deteriorates to the degree that one has depended upon matter energy and space to tell time and on time confusing implants such as false track however running out false track on ta motion case is not an answer the dwindling spiral was as follows state time sense state b time sense dependent upon matter energy and space state c arc breaks with matter energy space and other beings state d deteriorated time sense by the time state d is thoroughly reached you have pc who gets ta motion running track as energy will not flow in the absence of time there are four degrees of poor time sense the first is average and common but is not enough to impair ta action the ta sticks but getting wrong dates off restores ta action which then continues the second is case that has to be continuously repaired and delicately handled to get any ta action at all the third is case that gets ta action on repetitive processes or rudiments but not on gpms or engram running while silently moving through an engram few people get ta action this comes when they answer what happened the third under consideration doesnt get any ta even when answering what happened and rarely if ever rrs the fourth is case that gets ta action on repetitive processes and very little if any on rudiments the four types of poor time sense compare to case level 5 first type above gets ta action only when wrong dates are cleaned upcase level 6 second above gets ta action only with constant careful handling and ta action always packing up case level 7 third above ta action only on some repetitive processes and rudiments case level 8 fourth above ta action on repetitive processes and only now and then on rudiments case levels 2 to 4 get ta action matter what happens this then ta action is your best index of case levels iq graphs tests behavior in life are all incidental identification aaa is most easily present when time sense is awry therefore the degree person identifies different things establishes the degree of aberration programming cases are programmed only against ta action obtainable in auditing case must not be run without ta action or with minimal ta action case may be case level 5 and need only few wrong dates and durations corrected to get good ta action but it may also be case level 6 7 or 8 trial and error programming is best program high and drop low matter what the morale factor may be try to run gpms the goal to forget etc with r3n if it cant be done assess for r3r preliminary step and run chain of engrams if still ta drop to processes for case level 7 if still ta drop to processes for case level 8 you may see by the pcs past auditors reports what the case level is how stuck has that ta been dont run case lower than it easily gets ta action and dont brand case at low case level and then never graduate it upwards when the lower process is flat the upper process should now be runnable the story is told by the ta with one exception auditor ability and training but case levels 2 3 4 are not all that influenced by the auditor ability the auditors skill has to be pretty good to run case level 5 on r3r and r3n the auditor doesnt live who can run r3r or r3n on case levels 6 7 or 8 it just wont run in the guess department the bulk of the cases about are 4s and 5s good sized percentage are 6s and 7s about 10 are case level 8 about 1 are case level 3 thereforeabout 30 of usual group of pcs will run with good ta on the time track given trained auditing without trouble another 30 will run with good ta on the time track with careful coddling and serious date goofs except for the 1 case 3 the rest will fall into case levels 6 7 and 8 meaning that about 39 of the cases in scientology wont run at once on r3r or r3n and another 30 case level 5s need saint hiller hanging over the auditors shoulder or in the chair and the other 30 case level 4s will run very well and easily on r3r and r3n so the biggest percentage group case levels 6 7 8 combined need special processes to graduate up to action with r3r and r3n these case level 6 7 and 8 processes now exist and are being released as rapidly as they are demonstrated workable r2h for case levels 5 and 6 has already been released r2hl for case levels 6 and 7 is being readied up for bulletin the corner process and others for case level 8 are tested and the data is being assembled and other advances can be made to audit easily and relaxed with good ta action on the pc is my immediate desire for auditors and auditing supervisors i feel we are over the hump on this the

meeting field auditors take up at group meetings exactly where are we technically personally and organizationally it may be of some surprise to you that we have just about arrived weve been so long on the road that some fainter hearts have begun to despair and less high case levels have begun to gloom since last october i have been cracking through trying to get there before we were got it now is obvious that we have made it and even if we were hard hit socially or politically we would still make it for we have the data i have not had time to get it all to you yet but the data is now assembled for ot for everyone who can be audited at all you already have most of it on the various ptps of scientology we have had some very significant wins as follows 1 the discoveries about time and the tone arm hco bulletin of july 28 ad13 related to case levels tells us if case is winning why it isnt winning and how to make it win and gives us far less worries as auditors auditing cases for some time now overlooking four score of cases many very rough i have been breathing easy and theyre all winning 2 getting cases to rr on gpms is entirely matter of auditing those cases who dont on current basic processes until they do so it isnt worry about getting the case to rr its only how to get the case to run with ta action and get high enough to rr and run gpms we have the patterns and technology needful now 3 arc breaky cases the arc break assessments correctly done finish the problem of the consequences of arc breaks and put the auditor at cause over arc breaks 4 natter persons who get auditing and natter staff members who snap and snarl bad morale all wrap up in the arc break assessments this done weekly in any group on group members clearing every line restores theta atmosphere 5 incredulity of our data and validity this is our finest asset and gives us more protection than any other single thing if certain parties thought we were real we would have infinitely more trouble theres actual terror in the breast of guilty person at the thought of ot and without public incredulity we never would have gotten as far as we have and now its too late to be stopped this protection was accidental but it serves us very well indeed remember that the next time the ignorant scoff6 the cold war has gotten less threatening differences are less violent we have had the time we needed 7 government attacks have entered more desultory stage meters will go to jury trial eventually and we will certainly win the us government attorney handling the case became terribly ill and had to resign it 8 economic problems in organizations gross income is generally on the increase throughout the world and shows signs of dwindling and all this in the face of bad press personal income depends

tone arm action on any process you will eventually make ot ot is wholly matter of consistent tone arm motion session after session not the significance of what is run 10 state of training as auditors although i would like to see more auditors trained at saint hill general training has improved and training data is complete shortened training time will soon be reality new positive goal for hpahcas will make more good auditors i feel very good about general auditing ability i recently summed up the basic skills of auditing and find that over the years we have been working right along and winning on training all training done has been to the good changing technology has not influenced the basic skills and forthcoming material follows the pattern in which we have been trained other problems solutions unexpectedly leaped up in fields where we were only vaguely aware of problems we bought an awful lot of time with the discovery of the exact nature of between lives implants and how its worked using this data it is possible to keep any scientologist from ever getting another one of those implants as the general course of living is therapeutic it takes violent implants such as earth people get at every death to keep people unaware of former lives and aberrated just by omitting those implants and using their reporting technology to keep in touch amongst ourselves we would salvage the lot in few hundred years in any event our data is too widely disseminated to be recollected and burned and just the other day i was personally looking over their shoulders world clearing is possible without extensive auditing if we just keep our own show on the road and keep track of each otherthis was breakthrough i didnt expect and its all ours the discovery of false pasts and futures was also bonus for it means more ta action on more cases and faster clearing its doubtful if ordinary track ever hurt anybody summary all weve got to do is keep going as we are for things to improve now the only thing which could slow us down is our own selfcreated dissidence all we have to do is do our jobs and keep the peace and weve got it the makebreak point is behind us ahead are only better

been working hard to clarify time track work which was more or less left off in 1952 with the discovery of the relationship of time and the tone arm i immediately went to work to see if any eager loops had used time confusion in order to immobilize and incapacitate thetan i found almost at once that false timing of incidents wasnot only used but very nearly specialized in the exact character of the betweenlives implants only then came to view and could be mapped and other implants of earlier times were disclosed entire false pasts and futures have been installed and even actual dates and incidents have been grouped this is good news rather than bad news for it gives one measure of the effort necessary to keep thetan aberrated and gives us the reason some persons wont rr or get ta motion who otherwise might for all gpms may be falsely dated and if correctly dated might run this does not mean that r3n or r3r are in any way changed or that one does not run gpms it does mean that slight variation in r3r is needed when false track is found in order to make the dating easier on it this will be called r3t it consists of r3r plus clever methods of dating that get past implanted dates meanwhile be very careful in dating dates released on anything may be accurate including the helatrobus implants im sorry if this held anybody back but as usual you know as soon as i know so carry on get ta action on your pc but be very cautious about accepting dates without checking is this incident and date in false past is this incident and date in false future the best trick is to find if right now or as in the betweenlives implants the year zero exists in the false track and date it was the year zero hundreds of years ago thousand etc clever eh some of you have been groaning

materials level four is more or less complete more so now than three this brings lot of order to our technical and gets us past the past lives scramble and other points which slow dissemination by relegating these to upper levels lord knows we have enough fascinating data at level one without feeding the public level four organizational structure we are neating up the corporate structures of scientology using each org as company whose majority shares are owned by central company this makes the structure easier to handle and better off for tax purposes the instructions on this will soon be released shares and life memberships will all be properly adjusted organizational attitude finding exactly who were up against on earth the ama helped but finding exactly what each one of us faces and

there isnt nobody can be half in and half out of scientology scientologists are scientologists matter what they do for living if were going to make this we have to work at it personally administratively and as group and work well the prize is regaining self and going free the penalty for our failure is condemnation to an eternity of pain and amnesia for ourselves and for our friends and for this planet if we fail weve had it its not just matter of getting killed its matter of getting killed and killed andkilled life after life forever more even if you have great reality on this

communication cycle error tv5 p 3347 ntv vii p 2559 hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 4 august 1963 central orgs franchise all routines emeter errors communication cycle error the emeter has its role in all processing and must be used well however an emeter can be misused in several ways meter dependence the meter in actual fact does nothing but locate charged areas below the awareness of the pc and verify that the charge has been removed the meter cures nothing and does not treat it only assists the auditor in assisting the preclear to look and verify having looked pc can be made more dependent upon the meter or can be made more independent of the meter all in the way meter is used by the auditor if pcs case is improving the pc becomes more independent of the meter this is the proper direction meter dependence is created by invalidation by or poor acknowledgement of the auditor if the auditor seems not toaccept the pcs data then the pc may insist that the auditor see it read on the meter this can grow up into formidable meter dependence on the part of the pc the rise of the ta is whats it the fall of meter ta is an its _______ to get maximum charge off the pcs groping whats it must become pcs finding its if the pc asks the auditor what or which reads on the meter and the auditor always complies the pcs ta will rise more and fall less as the pc is saying whats it and only the meter is saying its _______ pc must be carefully weaned of meter dependence not abruptly chopped off the pc says whats it the auditor must begin to ask occasionally well whats it seem to you and the pc will find his own its _______ and the ta will fall as it would not if only the meter were employed milking the ta of all the action you can get requires that the pc get most of the its as for his whats its see diagram attached dating dependence rule use the meter to date and verify date correctness by all means but only after the pc has been unable to come up with the date example pc cant decide after much puzzling if it was 1948 or 1949 finally the auditor says 1948 1949 and sees the meter reads on 1948 and says it was 1948 but if the pc says it was 1948 the auditor only checks it if the ta sticks up higher meaning probably wrong date he checks with in this session have we had wrong date that reads what date was wrong and lets the pc argue it out with himself ta action will restore ris reliable items have to be clean the pc can usually tell but the pc cant tell the right ri out of list or the right goal unless the auditor sees it rr or fall but sometimes the auditor thinks an ri is clean longer reads having read when it still has somatics on it in this case its suppressed and the auditor checks it for suppress the pc saying the ri is not clean should still be reading carries more weight than the meter as the pc gets along in running time track and gpms with their goals and reliable items he or she often becomes better than the meter as to what is right or wrong what is the goal what ri still reads meter invalidation an auditor who just sits and shakes his head didnt rocket read can give pc too many loses and deteriorate the pcs ability to run gpms in conflict between pc and meter take the pcs data why because protest and assert and mistake will also read on meter you can get these off but why create them the meter is not there to invalidate the pc using the meter to invalidate the pc is bad form youll have less trouble by taking the pcs data for the pc will eventually correct it the meter is invaluable in locating bypassed charge and curing an arc break but it can be done without meter just by letting the pc think over each line read to him or her from the arc break assessment ana say whether it is or isnt and if it is spotting the thing bypassed cleaning cleans the auditor who cleans clean meter is asking for trouble this is the same as asking pc for something that isnt there and develops withhold of nothing example ask do you have present time problem get needle reaction ask the pc for the ptp that hasnt read that is impossible for the pc to answer thats whats meant by cleaning clean dirty needle all dirty needles are caused by the auditor failing to hear all the pc had to say in answering question or volunteering data charge is removed from case only by the comm cycle pc to auditor the auditors command restimulates charge in the pc the only way this charge can be blown is by the pc telling the auditor auditor means listener the auditor who has not learned to listen gets first dirty needle next stuck tone arm finally arc break the most important line in auditing is from pc to auditor if this line is open and not hurried or chopped you get dirty needles and lots of ta actionto continuously get in auditor to pc and impede the line pc to auditor is to pile up endless restimulated charge on case rule tone arm action of any kind without any significance of whats behind it will take pc to ot eventually rule the most correct track significances run but without ta action will not change but can deteriorate case rule the correct track significances run with ta action will attain ot fastest thus we see that an auditor can get everything right except ta action and not make an ot and we see that ta action without running specific things will make an ot though it might take thousand years therefore ta action is superior to what is run running the right things with ta action is faster only thus the line pc to auditor is somewhat senior to the comm line auditor to pc see diagram dont get the idea that the process is not important it is people were made to talk in psychoanalysis without getting anywhere but there they probably had ta and ran the wrong significances it takes the right process correctly run to get ta action so dont underrate processes or the action of the auditor realize that the answering of the process question is senior to the asking of another process question pc could talk for years without getting any ta action got it so listen as long as ta moves learn to see if the pc has said everything he or she wants to say before the next auditor action never do new auditor action while or if the pc wants to speak and youll get superior ta action cut the pc off get in more actions than the pc is allowed to answer and youll have dirty needle then stuck ta and then an arc break see the attached drawing of this and all will suddenly get clearer about any pc youve audited and trouble will evaporate by cutting the itsa line an auditor can make case gain disappear learn to listen thats what auditor means it has taken so long to see this in others because i dont cut the pcs line very often and repair it fast when i do so forgive for bringing it up so late when the pc is talking and youre getting ta you already have an arc break or are about to get one so assess the bypassed chargerule dont demand more than the pc can tell you rule dont receive less than the pc has to say watch the pcs eyes dont take auditing actions if the pc is not looking at you dont give acknowledgements that arent needed over acknowledgement means acknowledging before the pc has said all summary running the right process is vital getting ta action on the right process is skilled auditing listening is superior to asking build up the pcs confidence in his own knowingness and continuously and progressively reduce the pcs dependence on meter l ron hubbard lrhdrcden copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved

occasionally government plant or active commie will endeavour to gain access into the org the academy is the easiest point of entry for stay of little time for such undesirables for example wave of suppositional reports of this occurred after the recent fda attack in washington dc if they were true then it was an affront to scientology quite apart from anything else however such an attempt can be regarded comparatively as rarity nevertheless directors of training should have some easy foolproof method to pick off such and satisfy themselves that students are in their academies for anything other than what the students stated they were there for ie to receive training and graduate the dt normally interviews all new students before they enter on course in his academy and this stage would be convenient point in which to have fast check accordingly during the brief duration of this interviewthe dt should place the student on the emeter which is set at high sensitivity and ask with arc this question are you here for any other purpose than what you saystate this question may need clearing with student but it should take only very brief time to clear and clean variations of this question may be used but this type question designed as fast check question on new students will be referred to henceforth as form 5b the dt is merely to be satisfied that the new student being interviewed by him is not plant then having cleared the question and the dt is satisfied the student is bona fide the dt can then brief the student crisply for starting course etc and bring the interview quickly to close remember the question is designed to pick up plants and such an attempt will be very rare but nevertheless may occur from time to time in the event of the dt having some doubt on the person being interviewed by him he should refer the person to the technical director immediately for further check the totality of the duration of the dt interview need not be more than 10 minutes in its entirety judgement is required by the dt in administering this filter point in that it is not intended to act as complete embargo on all and every student whether bona fide or otherwise the chances of the latter being attempted are slim but this form 5b should now handle such an attempt smoothly issued by peter hemery hco sec ww for l ron hubbard authorized by l ron hubbard

bulletin of 19 august ad13 central orgs franchise scientology two star rated hco bulletin how to do an arc break assessment hco secs check out on all technical executives and personnel tech dir check out on hco secs and assn org secsthe successful handling of an arc break assessment is skilled activity which requires 1 skill in handling meter 2 skill in handling the itsa line of the auditing cycle 3 skill in assessment the lists given in hco bulletin of july 5 ad 13 arc break assessments are used either from that hco bulletin or amended there are several uses for arc break assessments 1 cleaning up session arc break 2 cleaning up auditing in general 3 cleaning up pcs or students possible arc breaks 4 cleaning up member of the publics possible or actual arc breaks 5 regular use on weekly basis on staff or organization members there are others those above are the chief uses for long time periods the standard 18 button prepcheck is faster but an arc break assessment is still useful in conjunction with it the drill is simple if complicated by adding in r2h material dating and other additives the arc break assessment ceases to work well and may even create more arc breaks if used every time pc gets in little trouble in r3n dr r3r the arc break assessment is being used improperly in r2h r3n r3r sessions it is used only when the pc shows definite signs of an arc break to use it oftener constitutes auditing unnecessary use of an arc break assessment may arc break the pc with the assessment the arc break assessment may be repaired by an 18 button prepcheck on arc break assessments arc break assessment by steps step one select the proper list this is done by establishing what the pc has been audited on if more than one type of bypassed charge is suspected do more than one list ifthe arc break is not completely cured by one list do another kind of list all lists have been in hcobs as l step two inform the pc that you are about to assess for any charge that might have been restimulated or bypassed on his or her case do not heavily stress the arc break aspect right i am going to assess list to see if any charge has been bypassed on your case wrong im going to try to cure or assess your arc break step three without regard to pcs natter but with quick attention for any cognition the pc may have during assessment as to bypassed charge assess the list phrase the question in regard to the reason for the assessment in this session during this week in scientology etc call each line once to see if it gives an instant read the moment line gives reaction stop and do step four step four when line reacts on the needle say to the pc the line reacts what can you tell about this step five keep itsa line in do not cut the pcs line do not ask for more than pc has let pc flounder around until pc finds the charge asked for in step four or says theres such charge if line reacted because the pc did not understand it or by protest or decide make it right with the pc and continue assessing step six in session if pc found the bypassed charge ask pc how do you feel now if pc says he or she feels ok cease assessing for arc breaks and go back to session actions if pc says theres such charge or gets misemotional at auditor keep on assessing on down the list for another active line or even on to another list until the charge is found which makes pc relax in routine arc break check not session but for longer period dont stop assessing but keep on going as in step five unless pcs cognition is hugeend of steps please notice this is not r2h there is dating the auditor does not further assist the pc with the meter in any way if the pc blows up in your face on being given type of charge keep going as you have not yet found the charge typical response to wrong charge found pc well of course its cut communication youve been cutting my communication the whole session you ought to be retreaded etc note here that pcs attention is still on auditor therefore the correct charge has not been found if the bypassed charge has been found the pc will relax and look for it attention on own case several bypassed charges can exist and be found on one list therefore in cleaning up week or an intensive or career any long period treat list like rudiments cleaning everything that reacts blow down of the tone arm is the meter reaction of having found the correct bypassed charge keep doing steps one to six until you get blow down of the tone arm the pc feeling better and being happy about the arc break will coincide almost always with tone arm blow down you can however undo session arc break assessment by continuing beyond the pcs cognition of what it is continuing an assessment after the pv has cognited invalidates the pcs cognition and cuts the itsa line and may cause new arc break rarely but sometimes the arc break is handled with ta blow down purpose of assessment the purpose of in arc break assessment is to return the pc into session or into scientology or into an org or course bypassed charge can cause the person to blow out of session or out of an org or course or scientology with session formerly in is defined as interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor against session against session is defined as attention off own case and talking at the auditor in protest of auditor pt auditing environment or scientology with scientology with scientology is defined as interested in subject and getting it used against scientology against scientology is defined as attention off scientology and protesting scientology behavior or connections with organization with organization can be defined as interested in org or post and willing to communicate withor about org against organization against organizationness is defined as against organization or posts and protesting at org behavior or existence the data about arc breaks can be expanded to marriage companies jobs etc indeed to all dynamics with dynamic against dynamic what it boils down to is this there are only two conditions of living but many shades of grey to each one these conditions are 1 life not arc broken capable of some affinity for some reality about and some communication with the environment and 2 death arc broken incapable of affinity for reality about and communication with the environment under one we have those who can disenturbulate themselves and make some progress in life under two we have those who are in such protest that they are stopped and can make little or progress in life one we consider to be in some arc with existence two we consider to be broken in arc with existence in session or handling the living lightning we handle people can be hit by forceful charge of which they are only minutely aware but which swamps them their affinity reality and communication life force is retarded or cut by this hidden charge and they react with what we call an arc break or have an arc broken aspect if they know what charge it is they do not arc break or they cease to be arc broken it is the unknown character of the charge that causes it to have such violent effect on the person people do not arc break on known charge it is always the hidden or the earlier charge that causes the arc break this makes life look different and more understandable people continuously explain so glibly why they are acting as badly as they are whereas if they really knew they would not act that way when the true character of the charge or many charges as in full case is known to the person the arc break ceases how much bypassed charge does it take to make case the whole sum of past bypassed charge this fortunately for the pc is not all of it in constant restimulation therefore the person stays somewhat in one piece but prey to any restimulationauditing selectively restimulates locates the charge and discharges it as seen on the action of moving tone arm however accidental rekindlings of past charge unseen by pc or auditor occur and the pc mysteriously arc breaks similarly people in life get restimulated also but with nobody to locate the charge thus scientologists are lucky in heavily restimulated circumstances the person goes out of in such condition people want to stop things cease to act halt life and failing this they try to run away as soon as the actual bypassed charge is found and recognized as the charge by the person up goes affinity and reality and communication and life can be lived therefore arc breaks are definite their symptoms are known their cure is very easy with this understanding and technology an arc break assessment seeks to locate the charge that served being hidden as whiphand force on the person when it is located life returns locating the actual bypassed charge is returning life to the person therefore properly handling arc breaks can be called with exaggeration returning life to the person one further word of caution as experience will quickly tell you seeking to do anything at all with an earlier bypassed charge incident which led to the arc break immediately the earlier incident is found will lead to vast mess let the pc talk about it all the pc pleases but dont otherwise try to run it date it or seek to find what bypassed charge caused the earlier incident in assessing for arc breaks keep the itsa line in very well and keep the whats it out in every respect except as contained in the above six steps summary an arc break assessment is simple stuff so simple people are almost certain to complicate it it only works when kept simple old auditors will see similarity in an arc break assessment list and old end rudiments they can be handled much the same but only when one is covering long time period otherwise assess only to cognition and drop it the trouble in arc break assessments comes from additives by the auditor failure to keep on with additional lists if the type of charge causing the arc break isnt found on the first list chosen failure to read the meter and failureto keep the itsa line in doing arc break assessments to cure arc breaks is not the same drill as r2h and confusing the two leads to trouble handled skillfully as above arc break assessing cures the great majority of woes of auditing registraring training and handling organization if you find you arent making arc break assessments work for you check yourself out on this hco bulletin carefully review your meter reading and examine your handling of the itsa line if you want live people around you learn to handle arc break assessments dont worry about pcs getting arc breaks worry about being able to cure them with assessment until you have confidence you can theres nothing so uplifting as that confidence except perhaps the ability to make any case get ta motion dont ever be reasonable about an arc break and think the pc is perfectly right to be having one because if that arc break exists the pc doesnt know whats causing it and neither do you until you and the pc find it if you and the pc knew what was causing it there would be further arc break l ron hubbard lrhdrcden copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard all

central orgs franchise scientology three four r3r r3n the preclears postulates we have long known that the preclears postulates made at the time of the incident contained charge as the preclear is moved back on his time track beyondtrillions three you will find that incidents and reliable items contain less charge proportionately to the pc who was stronger then and that the pcs postulates made then contained more charge in short as you go earlier on the time track the incidents seemed weaker to the pc then and the pc being more capable had stronger postulates thus it is not uncommon to find gpm on the early track producing only falls on the pc and the pcs postulates made at that time rocket reading or falling this in fact gets even more disproportionate so that on the very early track you might find that running ris out of gpm produces ta motion but taking the pcs postulates out produces ta blow down that goes through 7 around the whole ta dial and back up in my recent surveys of the tone arm and its relationship to auditing it became apparent that three types of charge existed in gpm 1 charge as an engram 2 charge as reliable items 3 charge as postulates all three must be removed from gpm any incident wherever it is on the track contains postulates comments considerations directions made by the pc at that time thus in all incidents the pcs postulates must be called for and removed to remove postulate from any incident have the pc repeat it until it longer reacts on the needle of the meter if it comes down to persistent tick get suppress off it and get it repeated again just as in the case of any ri in gpm dont leave postulates charged treat them like gpm items whether in gpm or an engram add to your arc break l lists l3 and l4 have we bypassed any postulates there are implants which tell the pc not to erase his own postulates there is also bear series goal to postulate sometimes the postulate lies ahead of the actual engram in r3r example man decides to get hurt then enters into an engramic situation the engram does not wholly free until the postulate is removedoccasional calling for any postulates considerations or comments you had in this incident while running r3r engrams or r3n will keep the incident going well when the pc says one have him or her repeat it until it longer reacts on the needle i bring this up at this time as i have found case that got ta action on engrams or gpms or rrs on ris until the postulates were given special attention at which time ta action of an excellent kind occurred summary stuck ta is always caused by running the pc above the pcs tolerance of charge you can stop any ta by ramming the pc into incident after incident without cleaning them up postulate is only one kind of charge at any position on the time track also look for the pcs postulates early on the time track expect them to occasionally blow the meter apart flatten any postulate found by getting it repeated until the reaction is gone off the needle and all charge of course on anything whether falls or rrs must be removed from engrams or gpms l ron hubbard lrhdrbh copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 135 hcopl 21 aug 63

association secretaries hco secretaries technical directors directors of processing and training pe directors registrars letter registrars staff auditors and instructors and the state of the academy hgc and staff coaudit this technical advance makes many other things possible we will designate their broad application to central org planning and dissemination project 80 essentially what has happened is that i have found the minimum essentials of why auditing works and have selected out the important parts for concentration these parts are 1 in scientology one and two the itsa line 2 in scientology two tone arm action 3 in scientology two directing the pcs attention to those things which bar him from release and clear and 4 in scientology three and four directing the pcs attention to and handling those things which bar him from ot this looks almost too simple but it makes for an enormous difference in results and dissemination why because of the ease by which auditing results can be attained because simplicity makes for far reaching ease of communication new scientology basic definitions 1 scientology i what is an auditor an auditor is one who listens auditor means listener 2 scientology i what is preclear one who is discovering things about himself and who is becoming clearer 3 scientology i what is case gain any case betterment according to the pc 4 scientology i what is scientology the common peoples science of life and betterment 5 scientology i how is scientology different in scientology the preclear is always right scientology holds that people know best about themselves6 scientology i what is scientology against scientology is against brutality and euthanasia in medical brain damaging and against abuse and slavery and punishment in any form 7 scientology i what does scientology stand for freedom from mystery freedom from fear 8 scientology i what is book auditor someone who has studied books on scientology and listens to other people to make them better 9 scientology i what is coaudit team of any two people who are helping each other reach better life with scientology processing 10 scientology i what is an auditing session precise period of time during which the auditor listens to the preclears ideas about himself 11 scientology ii what is professional auditing sessions given by trained auditor who is governed by ethical codes and technical skill who directs the pcs attention to areas which when examined by the preclear will cause release of sufficient charge to cause tone arm action thus reaching the eventual state of clear 12 scientology i what is release one who knows he can continue to improve by auditing and that he will not now become worse in life 13 scientology ii what is clear one who has straightened up this lifetime note these definitions and others like them should be published and posted and lectured about continually until familiar to everyone you will find that if you concentrate on these aspects of scientology and auditing your dissemination will improve where you exceed this simplicity inside the organizationstechnical departments and activities you will probably have more losses than gains in all auditing done except that by saint hill graduates this includes auditing supervised by saint hill graduates meaning that where even this supervised auditing exceeds the above definitions you will have more loses than wins in fact it takes saint hill graduates to groove even this auditing level in so dont despise it as an organization your future depends on service where service attempts to exceed the above definitions you will have financial and technical loses and devt this does not mean saint hill grads should not coaudit at the level of class iv it does mean that where you insist others exceed the above technical levels you will have mess itsa line in and ta moving and anyone will eventually go ot so youre not barring people out indeed youre only then making 1t possible for them to go ot r1c is your work horse for coaudits w unit outside coaudit teams etc r2c is your professional level version up to clear your service includes arc break assessments and all scientology i and scientology ii skills and data this means fast academy training good permanent hgc results good public dissemination and few headaches this does not mean that those qualified and classed to run iii and iv material in an org cannot do so it means only that an org specializes in positive wins at i and ii we have now exceeded processing results of former years with just the itsa line and ta motion in spite of the simplicity of the material we have also exceeded by technical advance public reality therefore we have in the various classes of data scientology within scientology firm scientology one in the public lines and pe good scientology two in the academy and hgc and youre in scientology three and four are firmly based in the accomplishment first of scientology one and two and scientology five is based firmly on scientology four so one level is based wholly upon the earlier level and particularly agree in r and c with that level the r and c of scientology one match the public the coaudits and the lower levels of the academy when that r and c has been attained then the being is ready for scientology two and can gradually increase his r and c to match it and so on if those of us whose r and c already match scientology three and four and this includes lot of hpahcas and old timers continue to run orgs only at that r and c level we will certainly lift the orgs away from the r and cpotential of new public and even scientology two people creating ivory towers we then cut our public line you would be amazed how far above the public technical grasp even this is life is yet it at the moment is our best scientology one book actually its at the level of scientology two we have just learned this by testing some saint hill students thus when we exceed the above data for scientology one and two and fail to keep supporting work and data at those levels we cut ourselves off from the vast majority of the public and even some scientologists and find ourselves standing quite alone in the civilization our potential with what we know is majority of all populations solidly with us we have not accomplished that because 1 we didnt have our subject in orderly divisions 2 we were still concentrating on problems of upper level technical now solved and 3 we had already cut our bridge to the general public and average practitioner by technically exceeding his r and c potential therefore as i think you will agree we must publicly disseminate at the level of scientology one only get outside public coaudit processing teams not groups doing only scientology one processing on which they call win specialize in org hgc and academy technical on scientology one and two only and use scientology three four and five to run the show and pick up those whose r and c is graduating up to them i hope you see this as sound policy 1 know already that technical wins are in store for orgs using only the above data the keynote of an org is not money it is service if service is_given at the level of the r and c demanding it money floods in service means technical results my heaviest interest is in high technical results and i know that what i am outlining for you here will give you higher technical gain per student and pc than any amount of higher level data inadequately rendered therefore i am not downgrading but upgrading technical with this simplicity as you will discover i have to write up scientology one and scientology two articles and texts but you already have the technical side of them or will have in few days of this policy letter it will take some doing to groove all this in if you do there are your new buildings and mobs of people and bursting bank accounts and influence so this is it organizationally were readying up for the public kick off well all have to work hard to accomplish it but we can do it providing we do not exceed the basics above and providing we give service at the r and c level of those demanding itl ron hubbard lrhdrrd

bring home to central organizations the current ease of getting acceptable results in the academy on the hgc and in the coaudit by use of only the tone arm and itsa line and carry forward the groundwork for outside coauditing and broader dissemination we are building all future processing training and dissemination on the very firm foundation of the definition of an auditor one who listens the itsa line listen to the preclear and the solution of problems the preclear is always right this communicates with extreme ease and simplicity we are building all professional auditing on the itsa line plus directing pcs attention plus the tone arm we are building all top skill auditing on the itsa line directing the pcs attention to what must be audited to make clear and ot and the tone arm these tapes contain all the vital basic information if you are having any difficulties with income results staff coaudit or public dissemination the broad technical data contained in the itsa line arc break assessments and tone arm action will rapidly resolve them this begins new era for scientology get the data known to staff by holding these tape plays for at least two of these tapes week with all staff attending stressing any other data or reviewing any other material playing any other tapes broadly to staff or students at this time will retard your forward progress by overloading the line

confidential hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussexhco bulletin of 24 august ad 13 central orgs missions scientology four routine 3n the train gpms the marcab between lives implants this is rough fast survey of the train gpms and the between lives implants and the pattern used the data involved in all this is of great scope and as it concerns all the peoples of earth considerable more work will be done on it as these are the most involved and lowtoned implants on the time track it is recommended that other earlier gpms be completed before the between lives material is tackled after all tone arm action is the important thing and any earlier gpm that gives it makes the between lives implants and train gpms easier to run so program for earlier gpms however pcs do get into the between lives implants and do connect with the gpms there and in the train gpms so the pattern and data is released where possible run earlier gpms in any event safe rule is to run whatever gpm you can get your hands on and date as little as possible in 3n the train goals these are given to the being on his first contact with the marcab invasion force in this sector of the universe thus the train gpms date from hundreds of years ago to hundreds of thousands of years ago earlier on the track there are lots of trains such as in the invisible picture gpms so the mere existence of train in the implant doesnt make it the train implants this is established by date the implanting is done from huge train station the announcer through speakers on the platform gives continual running fire of wrong dates and directions and orders to depart and return to this point and you dont know when this happened to you lot of hellos and goodbyes and false information the being is put in railway carriage quite like british railway coach with compartments speakers are to the right and left in the compartmentthe train is backed up rapidly through eight pairs of stands eight on either side of the track sixteen in all these spray white energy against the side of the carriage none of the white energy touches the pc one pair of ris fires during the whole backward run between the stands and then reversing in the speakers fires all the way forward again one pair of ris in the pattern then fires complete round trip then the next pair fire for complete round trip forward and back and so on there are then sixteen repeats for each pair 8 forward and 8 back before the next pair the pattern is as follows list for oppterm remaining terms use the whole phrase of the goal to be _______ oppterm not oppterm all complete goal nothing complete goal best complete goal not best complete goal inevitable complete goal questionable complete goal doubted complete goal certain complete goal accursed complete goal commendable complete goal unforgivable complete goal forgivable complete goal hopeless complete goal hopeful complete goal single ri thats your goal at the start of each goal or pair perhaps face may come up and say you still here get out get off this train we hate you and from the speakers this happened to you yesterday tomorrow now this is your departure point keep coming back youll be meeting all your friends here when youre killed and dead keep coming back you havent chance to get away youve got to report in this happened to you days ago weeks ago years ago you dont know when this happened to you we hate you get out dont ever come back theres lot more of this including how youll be pulled and pulled when youre dead until you come back lot of wrong dates are also thrown in the type of goal is of the worst negative dichotomy to be caught to be wrong to go away to commit suicide etc the gpm to end begins the series there is large number of gpms in the series this series may have been given the pc on entrance to the marcab confederacy plus or minus 200000 years ago andthen again much later just before the first between lives implant as preliminary step before the actual between lives implant it is therefore important to run these train gpms before trying to run the between lives implant itself for all these gpms are repeated again in the between lives implant in running these train gpms be sure to get the first pair on their first fire there is standard swinging arm crossing signal that sounds at the end of each run of the train trains play large part in implanting there are lots of pictures of them lots of rails way earlier than the train gpms but earlier ones are given inside coach this is what makes it nightmarishthe white energy only hits the coach sides not the pc the rush of the train puts heavy kinesthetic into the engram the goals to start to stop to change make the pc feel he cant control the train to be unable to be instantaneous various perceptions are all in this series of train gpms if its bad its there the between lives implant this implant properly has six parts l pcs actual death not in first one given 2 first screen section to left giving false death many gpms calculated to obliterate memory and group the time track and some pictures containing groupers this says it is 15 days long 3 the main screen purporting to give the future trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years from the year zero on this the pcs past implants get stuck up 4 the next hundred days screen on the right of the main screen giving number of positive dichotomy gpms to fit the negative dichotomy goals on the first screen section 2 this also contains false projection to earth into baby complete with sonic on the delivery room home bedroom with oatmeal wall paper or the current fashion on earth 5 the actual kickoff from the implant station not by projection to earth but being dumped on earth 6 the actual search for baby the main screen is long white board with grate near the top all the way along there is roar in the whole place like blowers goinghuge numbers of earlier gpms stack up on 2 lots of earlier implants stack up on the main screen the whole operation is huge grouper but given good ta action it all eventually flies apart especially if many earlier gpms and the train gpms are run first with good ta action the pc has had at least two series of train implants and perhaps as many as 300 between lives implants in the last many thousands of years therefore the way to program all this is to run mainly earlier gpms on the pc then the train gpms then any more earlier gpms that can be found and then the between lives implants the between lives implants and the train gpms have the full intention of installing compulsion to return and feeling the pc can be reached by them and be pulled about and wiping out all memory of former life but any pc can be run on earlier gpms in spite of all this the reason this and other screen implants acts as grouper is because it restimulates earlier track charge which then pushing forward toward pt crushes the incidents and gpms on the screen of course it is all wrong dated and wrong durationed and this contributes to the crush of the material toward pt but basically it is simply restimulated charge on the early track that presses toward pt and shoves the pc into the screen implant therefore if you just restimulate and do not run early track gpms when found eventually you will find your pc crushed up against recent times and in these between lives screens if life and these screen incidents have not already done it this is the secret of the amnesia restimulate enough early track charge and do not discharge it and the being will have amnesia on the whole track if you are monkeying about on the backtrack and just partially discharging incidents going on to something new all the time failing to run series of gpms completely when you find them after while past track will become unreal to the pc then it will blot out and vanish and you will only have these between lives type of implants to work with then if you flub them your pcs pictures will disappear the danger signal is decreasing ta action this all occurs on the mechanism of early track restimulation compounded with wrong dates and wrong durations so the way to handle any pc is to locate or spring off the bank early gpms or implants and run them fully lack of tone arm action may upset this program but it is mainly gpms that stick tone arms since they stall timea pc is in danger if earlier track is becoming less real or is vanishing or the bank is pressing forward and landing on screens the remedy is take what was already restimulated earlier particularly gpms any gpms and run them thoroughly 1 as gpms 2 as engrams and 3 as pcs postulates this discharges them keep this up be thorough dont restimulate more than you discharge fully and the pcs pictures will come back on and the track go straight again the above gives you the right way to handle the between lives implants peel off the gpms from it meaning early track gpms restimulated on it and visible on the screen and run them fully before taking something else off the screen to run thus one does not really run between lives implant until very late on case the auditor uses it when it appears on case l to realize that the earlier track has been restimulated too much and too little discharged from it and 2 to find earlier gpms to run excessive restimulation and flopping about on the early track and running nothing clean will inevitably bring the pc forward and up against the between lives implants so the auditor who restimulates and does not run early track material when found is doing dangerous thing the between lives implants create amnesia only because they restimulate early track and dont discharge it if they didnt do this they would not produce the same effect therefore auditing undoes this mechanism only when early track incidents are thoroughly run when contacted the worst sinner is the gpm so never fail to run any early track gpm completely when found with its whole series dont go skipping about going earlier omitting goals leaving gpm incompletely discharged otherwise you will make the acquaintance with the between lives implant area if you know of any early gpm series left unhandled on the pc run it completely before restimulating anything else and if you are running the between lives implant grab off of it any earlier gpm or incident you can find and take it early and run it dont stay with the screen peel things off it that are earlier and run them otherwise the pcs bank will feel like crumbling forward into pt like an avalanche this mechanism of the production of unawareness by restimulating but not running charge on the early track is itself an important discovery it forbids then browsingthrough the early track sip here datum there be thorough or crash out goes the lights into pt slides the pc with thousand volts driving him on if you know of any early track gpm on your pc that can be run with tone arm motion clean it up as gpm clean up all the gpms in that series run it as an engram run any and all postulates out of it get it clean and then find something else the cycle of pc in total amnesia at start of auditing would be if audited with good ta action 1 contacts yesterday 2 contacts this life 3 contacts childhood 4 contacts past life 5 contacts incidents on this planet in the past few thousand years 6 contacts early track 7 contacts lots of early track and gpms 8 contacts earlier gpms 9 contacts very early material 10 continues to clean up track 11 contacts reasons for making pictures 12 goes ot if you try to rush this by practicing unthoroughness from 5 on then when pc reaches 9 above you will suddenly find him on the between life screens you will have overcharged early track and failed to discharge it and the result will be 8 contacts earlier gpms but has trouble holding position on the track to run them and is arc breaky 9a contacts earlier material but it groups and scrunches and sticks together 10a collides with screen implants like the between lives there are earlier ones 11a cant keep pictures apart things easily wrong dated and is very arc breaky and is stuck in between lives 12a cant reach the early track and at session starts is found to be stuck in this lifetime there is shortcut back to finding when he started to make pictures the phenomenon of early charge pushing the pc back toward pt if not run defeats any such attemptso making an ot is keeping the ta going with itsa line in and being thorough on early track incident running if the pc has gotten into condition 12a above or is approaching it dont waste time on endless dating just find any early gpm already partially run the earliest one you can lay your hands on without restimulating others and run it completely then find another and another and shun all new material until you have completely handled the old and dont let the pc wander around on the early track just find and run gpms and clean up fully whatever you find or youll be sitting there reading this hcob despairingly trying to get your pc off between lives screen even if these listed evils occur however you have not lost the ta action already gained if misguidedly on the case and the matter is easily repaired providing you redo what youve left undone and this time be neat and restimulate the case otherwise as little as possible he or she is still closer to ot they were just making it the hard way l ron hubbard founder 140 hcob 1 sep 63 i routine three sc tv5 p 35356 ntv vii p 28891 hubbard communications

technical that it may have looked to you that we were in state of rapid change this was occasioned by speedup caused by various events you are getting about century of research or more in very few months so bear with the end is not only in sight its here my job is mainly now to refine and get the data to you the order brought into our work by making five levels ofscientology is paying off rapidly level one is in development level two is well away level four is complete and suddenly level three leaped to final phase we can clear clear clear this has been stepchild for months even years now it has been mauled messed up invalidated and rehabilitated and knocked around but book one clear was what most people came into scientology to obtain and now ive done it ive found out why not and how and this hco bulletin is hurryskurry outline of the steps so you can do it there will be lots of hco bulletins on this the tapes of august 27 28 and 29 ad13 give most of its theory clear defined book one definition holds exactly true clear is somebody with held down fives in this lifetime see evolution of science clear test clear sits at clear read on the ta with free needle natter upsets whole track keyed in service facsimile clear stability we are not concerned with stability but we can now key out so thoroughly that we need not stress keyed out clear i have found the means i am sure to make this state far more stable and recreate it easily if it slips so forgive for being indecisive about clear states for these past many months the breakthrough is stated as follows if you cannot make clear in 25hour prepcheck the pc has one or more service facsimiles the barrier to clearing and the reason for fast relapse when clear was attained has been the service facsimile service facsimile defined advanced procedure and axioms definition accurate added to this is the service facsimile is that computation generated by the preclear not the bank to make self right and others wrong to dominate or escape domination and enhance own survival and injure that of others note that it is generated by the pc not the bank thus the pc restimulates the bank with the computation the bank unlike going to ot does not retard the pc in this instance the service facsimile is usually this lifetime effort only it might better be called service computation but well hold to our old terms the pc is doing it in usual aberration the bank is doing it the pcs engrams etc where you cant clear the pc by auditing just bank you have to get out of the road what the pc is doing to stay aberrated if you clear only what the bank is doing theclear state rapidly relapses if you clear what the pc is doing the bank tends to stay more quiet and unrestimulated it is the pc who mostly keys his bank back in therefore the pc who wont go free needle clear is himself unconsciously preventing it and by knocking out this effort we can then key out the bank and we have fast clear who pretty well stays clear until sent on to ot the state is desirable to attain as it speeds going to ot all this came from studies ive been doing of the tone arm the tone arm must move during auditing or the pc gets worse all those pcs whose tone arms dont easily get into action and hang up are service facsimile pcs note that the service facsimile is used to first make self right make others wrong second to avoid domination to dominate others third to increase own survival to hinder the survival of others the service facsimile is all of it logical gobbledygook it doesnt make good sense thats because the pc adopted it where in extreme cases he or she felt endangered by something but could not itsa it hence its illogical because it is senseless really the computation escapes casual inspection and makes for aberrated behavior to make clear the steps in brief are 1 establish service fac this is done by assessment of scientology list one of 212 and using that for starter and then using the preliminary step of r3r as published hco bulletin of july 1 ad13 one uses only things found by assessment never by wild guesses or pcs obvious disabilities these assessments already exist on many cases and should be used as earlier found 2 audit with rightwrong ask pc with itsa line carefully in first question in this lifetime how would whatever was found make you right adjust question until pc can answer it if pc cant dont force it off on pc if its correct it will run well dont keep repeating the question unless pc needs it just let pc answer and answer and answer let pc come to cognition or run out of answers or try to answer the next question prematurely and switch questions to second question in this lifetime how would whatever was found make others wrong treat this the same way let the pc come to cog or run out of answers or accidentally start to answer the first question go back to first question do the same with it then to secondquestion then to first question again then to second if your assessment was right pc will be getting better and better ta action but the ta action will eventually lessen on any big cognition end the process this may all take from 2 hours to 5 i dont think more the idea is not to beat the process to death or sink pc into bank gpms the pc will have automaticities answers coming too fast to be said easily early in the run these must be gone and pc bright when you end you are only trying to end the compulsive character of the service facsimile so found and get it off automatic and get pc to see it better not to remove all ta action from the process 3 audit second process using the same method of auditing as in 2 above use the third question in this lifetime how would same one used in step 2 help you escape domination when this seems cooled off use fourth question in this lifetime how would same one help you dominate others use third question and fourth question again and until pc has it all cooled off or big cognition 4 audit third process using the same method as in 2 above use the fifth question in this lifetime how would same one aid your survival and then sixth question in this lifetime how would same one hinder the survival of others use five and six as long as is necessary to cool it all off or to produce big cognition 5 prepcheck with big mid ruds using the question in this lifetime on same one has anything been and get in suppress careful of failed to reveal invalidate suggest mistake been made protest anxious about decided if the pc has really shattering cognition just halt prepcheck and end it off this prepcheck is done of course off the meter until the pc says then checking it on the meter and cleaning it off once youve gone to meter on button stay with meter for further queries but dont clean cleans and dont leave slows or speeded rises either and dont cut pcs itsa line that should be the end of service facsimile but pc may have several so do it all again through all steps as often as is needed pcs who have had scientology list one of r212 should be given these as the first things used pcs who have had assessments done for r3r chains should have these assessment results used or as much of them as apply for the next runs even if the chain assessment has been run on r3r still use it for r3sc completing clearing to complete clearing then it is only necessary to give apermissive in this lifetime 18 button prepcheck making the pc look hard for answers short of arc breaking pc and you should have beautiful free needle and ta at the clear read and the pc shining if clearing did not occur these following faults were present in the auditing 1 pc did not agree with assessment it read only because pc did not understand it or protested it 2 the assessment was wrong 3 the atmosphere of auditing was critical of pc 4 the itsa line was not in 5 the auditor let the itsa line wander to early track 6 the auditor qed and aed and went off process and into engrams on pcs sell 7 the process was not done 8 the assessment was done by physical disability inspection or by choosing pcs habits not by actual assessment 9 the auditing did not produce ta action wrong assessment andor itsa line out would be all that could produce ta action 10 pc already sitting in heavy arc break by reason of whole track bypassed charge 11 this process used instead of an arc break assessment well done thus making this process punishment 12 questions phrased wrong 13 questions were overrun 14 questions were underrun 15 auditor too choppy on prepchecking 16 arc breaks in these sessions were not cleaned up 17 pc trying to plunge into early track and stay restimulated 18 pc trying to get early track gpms or engrams run to avoid giving up service facsimile 19 auditor missed withholds accumulated during clearing 20 process end product clear overestimated by auditor pc or supervisors the keynote of clearing service facsimile is interest ifpc isnt interested in it the assessment is wrong the keynote of auditing tone is permissive happy easy not militant let pc run on and on on phrasing question matter what is assessed it is always it makes pc right and others wrong pc is not trying to make it wrong an ordinary prepcheck done with service facsimile present will turn on mass on the pc why pc is asserting service facsimile well thats the fast rundown on r3sc routine three service facsimile clear and thats clearing lot of theory is missing in this hco bulletin but not one essential step you can do it if person is cleared before going on to ot they make it hundreds of

what problems have you had in your marriage gives confusions not data correct question what have you done about your mind incorrect question what has been bothering you about your mind you want the stable datum which holds back the confusion the discovery is if you get the pc to asis his selfinjected solutions his confusions will vanish as discharge on the ta this process is called r1c thats because it can be used at level one it is understandable best at level two where one knows about meters charge confusion and the stable datum etc it is wonderful coaudit process but if the auditing supervisor of the coaudit doesnt know the rules of the process as above half the cases will go blooey eventually covertly trying to run r3sc with how have you been right will become quick bog only half the questions are there actually only 16 and it will jam up weirdly trying to run an engram with when have you gone unconscious would obviously fail you can possibly alleviate things with r1c but only if you follow the rules of the game the pc must not be permitted to wander on the early track hell tie his case in knots so theres some direction of attention required the process is wonderful it

scientology five instructing in scientology auditing instructors task d of ps case handling as given at the saint hill special briefing course instructors conference of this date the task of the scientology auditing course instructor and ds of p handling cases through uncleared staff auditors is to accomplish training and processing and therefore auditing with uncleared students or auditors the following drawings and explanations were made items inside were in circles in the original drawing comm line auditor auditors xxx pc of observation service fac drawing b auditors observation line auditor pc xxxx auditors xxx service fac drawing c auditor service bank or pc fac drawing d auditor xxx service fac stressed by pc instructors occurence supervisors v pc condition cared for by strict adherence to data body drills and data by auditor drills in drawing we see the auditors perception of the pc as limited by auditors own service facsimile in drawing b we see the auditors perception of the pc the way it would be if the service fac were removed thus we see judgement missing because of lack of perception of the pc or his or her condition or case in drawing thus permitting only processes not requiring high level perception or decisions based upon the momentary condition of the pc in drawing b we see that perception is not limited judgement can be exercised by the auditor because the pc can actually be observed by him higher level processes can only be run by an auditor approximating the observation condition shown in drawing b in drawing c we see the actual observation limitations of auditor or pc in an aberrated condition the keynote is safe assumptions as per service fac thus only safe assumptions will be entertained and real auditing occurs only ineffective assumptions or questions are likely to be asked or viewed example what about thinking about stealing paper clip from hasi this actual question was once asked in ow and its prototypes keep real auditing from occurring since neither pc nor auditor get close to any real aberration that either auditor or pc consider the assumption safe does not mean it is not aberrated and subject to fault so real auditing of the case is undertaken and when something worth while auditing is contacted either auditor draws off or pc unobserved by an aberrated auditor draws off this reduces processing results to next to nothing it also sometimes leads both auditor and pc in over both their heads as little is observed and all these safe assumptions are also aberrated the instructors and case supervisors solution is seen in drawing d auditing at lower stages done by aberrated auditors who have service facs in place must be assumed to be independent of observation of the pc occurrences since observation of the pc as in drawing does not exist the instructor therefore directs the student auditors attention toward the scientology body of data in order to get effective auditing done so does any case supervisor this body of data is designed to accomplish auditingindependent of observation of the pc and the many varieties of changes and differences amongst pcs the instructor uses such mechanisms as if you can breathe you can audit do it exactly by the bulletin he instructs only in broadly workable processes and along definite rote lines he uses the habit patterns of discipline to enforce the auditors attention to and compliance with workable drills and data if this is done and only if this is done will auditing occur that is capable of producing effective results independent of the condition shown in drawing if the condition shown in drawing c is permitted to occur then all manner of squirrel processes and actions will occur in sessions wild solutions will reign and general chaos will result but more importantly the auditing necessary to produce the ideal condition shown in drawing b can occur only in the presence of instruction or supervision shown in drawing d thus one produces cleared auditors by operating only as per drawing d these facts are not the result of theoretical supposition but of careful empirical observation and test therefore instruction and performance of uncleared auditors must follow drawing d the accomplishment of classes ii and iii auditing and levels ii and iii results is possible by following drawing d it fails only when drawing d is not understood and followed by instructors and auditing supervisors the liability is that the students or auditors service fac may contest instruction as shown in drawing d there is liability if the student is already capable of drawing b observation which is rare in uncleared persons if service fac is in the road of instruction as per drawing d it still has been and can be overcome far more easily than overcoming various erroneous and varying observations of pcs as to confront the pc is to confront aberration directly and to confront the body of data is to confront only an orderly and pleasant arrangement of truthful facts that will still hold good when the student is cleared whereas the pcs aberration unstable before processing will be gone thus we study valid workable data that is broadly true and enforce compliance with it rather than studying or classifying individual cases and their aberrations as was done exclusively in older mental sciences which failed where we have already succeeded for years class iv material ot and whole track is sometimes too much for the uncleared auditor since it is complex it requires strict adherence to the body of data as well as some observation of the pc thus class iv materials ot and whole track are best done when the conditions of drawing b and drawing d both be present in the session this establishes levels of data and classification of itsuse some auditors with service facsimiles in place will be unable to successfully handle class iv data and some pcs unless cleared of the added restimulation of this life and the environment before being put on whole track will be unable to climb the hill therefore all instruction and use of scientology auditing skills and materials are most successfully done as per drawing d and have proven unsuccessful when auditor observation of the pc was assumed or auditor judgement relied upon while the auditor or student was in an uncleared state as per drawings and c this shows an instructor in or supervisor of scientology auditing his surest route to success with students without blocking those students already in condition to observe pcs those students whose service facsimiles revolt at drawing d will also most surely prevent their observation of the pc and instruction and supervision methods as per drawing d can overcome the barrier whereas nothing will actually surmount the failure to observe the pc short of clearing the auditors service fac this last is matter also of close observation of students over period of two years the object is to get auditing done under supervision and both during and after instruction only then can we ever broadly attain cleared auditors or any of our objectives instruction fails when these principles are not present or when done without heavy stress on the body of data and compliance with good auditing practice this is in way critical of students or uncleared auditors it is simple observation it is effective it is mean development to accomplish auditing without observing the more subtle conditions of the pc we have done just that therefore as the student or auditor does not usually observe the pc because of his own service fac and as level ii and iii can be done entirely by data drills and rote procedures all but class iv can be attained without cleared auditors if only cleared auditors were permitted to audit then nobody would be able to start the clearing this shortage of cleared auditors will exist to nearly the end of this universe so it is good thing to have the problem resolved as it is in this hco bulletin of course the most valid reason for using this approach is that only the disciplined body of data used exactly is capable of resolving cases and amount of confront of pc occurrence would by itself resolve anything its the body of data exactly and precisely used that resolves the human or any other mind and thats the main reason to make the student concentrate upon it so this is safe thing to do concentrate on the body of data matter whyl ron hubbard lrhdrbh copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 145 hcob 9 sep 63 repetitive rudiments and repetitive prepchecking tv5

compiled from hco bulletins of july 2 3 and 4 ad12 how to get the rudiments in just as an emeter can go dead for the auditor in the presence of monstrous arc break i have found it can go gradiently dull in the presence of out rudiments if you fail to get one in then the outness of the next one reads faintly and if your tr1 is at all poor youll miss the rudiments outness and there goes your session to get over these difficulties ive developed repetitive rudiments the auditor at first does not consult the meter but asks the rudiments question of the pc until the pc says there is further answer at this point the auditor says i will check that on the meter and asks the question again if it reads the auditor uses the meter to steer the pc to the answer and when the pc finds the answer the auditor again says i will check that on the meter and does so the cycle is repeated over and over until the meter is clean of any instant read see hco bulletin of may 25 1962 for instant read the cycle1 run the rudiment as repetitive process until pc has answer 2 consult meter for hidden answer 3 if meter reads use it to steer that that each time the meter flicks the pc to the answer 4 stay with the meter and do 2 and 3 the process is flat when there is instant read to the question one does not bridge out or use two more commands when the meter test of the question gets instant read the auditor says the meter is clean the trick here is the definition of with session if the pc is with session the meter will read if the pc is partially against session the meter will read poorly and the rudiment will not register and the rudiment will get missed but with the pc with session the meter will read well for the auditor fast checking fast check on the rudiments consists only of steps 2 and 3 of the cycle done over and over watching the meter the auditor asks the question takes up only what reads and careful not to q and clears it one does this as many times as is necessary to get clean needle but one still says the meter is clean and catches up the disagreement by getting the additional answers when the question is seen to be clean the question is left in using fast checking never say that still reads thats flunk say theres another read here repetitive prepchecking we will still use the term prepchecking and do all prepchecking by repetitive command step one without now looking at the meter the auditor asks the question repetitively until the preclear says thats all there are more answers step two the auditor then says i will check that on the meter and does so watching for the instant read hco bulletin may25 1962 if it reads the auditor says that reads what was it and steers the pcs attention by calling each identical read that then occurs there that that until the pc spots it in his bank and gives the datum step three the auditor then ignores the meter and repeats step one above then goes to step two etc step four when there is read on step two above the auditor says the meter is clean this is all there is to repetitive prepchecking as system anything added in the way of more auditor questions is destructive to the session be sure not to q and hco bulletin of may 24 1962 be sure your tr4 is excellent in that you understand really fake what the pc is saying and acknowledge it really so the pc gets it and return the pc to session nothing is quite as destructive to this type of auditing as bad tr4 end words the emeter has two holes in it it does not operate on an arc broken pc and it can operate on the last word thought minor only of question whereas the question thought major is actually null pc can be checked on the end words of rudiments questions and the charge on those single words can be made known and the question turned around to avoid the last words charge example are you willing to talk to about your difficulties the word difficulties said to the pc by itself gives an instant read remedy test difficulties if it reads as itself then change the question to concerning your difficulties are you willing to talk to this will only react when the pc is unwilling to do so caution this trouble of end words reading by themselves occurs mainly in the presence of weak tr1 and failure to groove in the question to thought major with good tr1 the end words read only when the question is asked in practice you only investigate this when the pc insists strongly that the question is nul then test the end word for lone reaction and turn the question about to make itend with another end word question not to have words changed only shifted in order then groove it in and test it for instant read if it still reacts as question thought major then of course it is not nul and should be answered double cleaning cleaning rudiment that has already registered nul gives the pc missed withhold of nothingness his nothingness was not accepted the pc has answer missed noanswer then occurs this is quite serious once you see rudiment is clean let it go to ask again something already nul is to leave the pc baffled he has missed withhold which is nothingness l ron hubbard lrhjwbpcden copyright c 1963 by l ron

processes starting with control going to communication and leading to havingness in that order the cchs are auditing specifically aimed at and using all the parts of the two way comm formula control is the first action of the cchs and is highlighted by being done tone 40 for the first two cchs cch 1 and cch 2the reason for control being the main point is simply to bring about an awareness of terminals to which communication will be possible this is done by bringing to the pcs awareness that his body and he are being controlled from particular known source point and b that he also is source point of control with control over self and body all of which is accomplished with cch 1 ie awareness of two known terminals once the above has been done with cch 1 the gains can be developed further with cch 2 by finding for the pc more known points environment and familiarity in this new environment plus the beginnings of the next major step forward in this developement of communication the awareness of distance communication cch3 is the next major step forward in the rehabilitation of your pc tone 40 is used in the next step but only on the motion communication is encouraged the type of communication practised by the actual auditing actions is that of one way communication iecausedistanceeffect with intention attention duplication and understanding plus the first glimmerings of cause being given to the pc by auditor receiving pcs comm and then getting the pc to get the idea of contributing to the motion in this section you are also going to develop the pcs ability to reach by showing him it is safe to reach across distance hand contact mimicry and then reduce his dependency on yes and increase his reach even more hand space mimicry as an added bonus to the above you are also on the beginning step of havingness duplication as you will be teaching the person to duplicate as being in two way communication and not as body with reference to body right and body left havingness is the final step in this portion of the cch formula full formula cchcactch where attention control t thinkingness control this step of cch 4 is the final culmination point which restores the pcs ability to be in good two way communication with high level of havingness by the use of duplication the full two way communication formula is practised in physical manner with the result that you will have travelled very very steep case gain from comm as thetan to full two way communication as thetan with lots of havingness ie the emanation of an impulse or particle book and motion from source point across distance to receipt point with the intention of bringing about at receipt point duplication and understanding of that which emanated from the source point with receipt point then becoming the source point back across the distance to the source point which has now become the receipt point with intention attention duplication and understandingobserved general errors 1 not knowing how to change from hand contact mimicry to hand space mimicry ans the change occurs on the run through the cchs after hand contact mimicry is flat with change ie cch 1 2 3 hcm with change 4123 hcm with change 4 2 1 2 3 hcm 5 commands only change 4 1 2 3 hand space mimicry 2 trying to handle verbal originations on tone 40 cch 1 and 2 ans tone 40 is used to overcome revolt of circuits body originations are handled circuits are not validated 3 overwhelming pc with very slow very fast or continuously varying speeds of movements ans an overwhelm is always wrong velocity plays an important role in being part of the comm formula by all means experiment with it but pay close attention to pc make for wins and increase tolerance not losses and decrease tolerance 4 interrupting pc to handle body origination ans body originations must be picked up when they occurs in deciding to pick up body origination the auditor should bear in mind that it is against the auditors code to prevent pc from carrying out command 5 while doing cch 4 auditor tells pc to do it mirrorimagewise ans when the process is being done as per the two way communication formula you will see that the pc will be executing the command mirrorimagewise the receipt point has become the source point however to tell the pc to do it mirrorimagewise is absolutely wrong as such direction will prevent the pc from looking and put him on selfaudit 6 not being sure of cch flat point ans flat point 3 cycles with change in comm lag physically observed change and the pc doing it 7 imprecise body movements of auditor on cch 2 ans auditor on right side of pc pc on auditors left with auditor slightly in front of pc except on turn around the change of position is achieved by moving the left leg one paoe to

has been carefully designed andor approved by lrhit should therefore be apparent that it is unnecessary for an instructor to explain data training drills or procedures either in long individual talks or in lectures to groups of students the job of an instructor is restricted to and his efforts should be concentrated on checking to see that student knows his data can do his trs and can follow auditing procedure this is done by testing and observation if student flunks test he is directed to study andor practise the material some more if instructor finds from observation that student does not know his data or is not practising it correctly then the student is directed to study andor practise accordingly an instructor is not coach within the foregoing is the student who asks questions this shows he does not know his data or training drill the answer to the students question is contained in the published data so all an instructor has to do is to refer the student to the book chapter bulletin or tape that contains the data instructor should avoid giving direct answers for at least two reasons 1 to encourage student to find out for himself 2 to obviate the possibility of an instructor giving his interpretation of data which may be an alteris of the correct data instructors should set good example to students by handling them with good arc emphasis should be put on the following tell student you can do it dont tell them they have done wrong but point out that they havent properly understood the data and direct them to the data they havent understood when student has done good job or is making good progress tell him dont give student continuous losses try to find something however small that he has done right and point this out to him at all times an instructor should present an unruffled demeanour and clean and tidy appearance an instructor maintains 8c with arc not with the overbearing discipline of sergeantmajor he calls the roll directs students where to go and arranges schedules he infracts infringement of course rules and students failure to follow instructions students who are constantly failing in their studies are missing out somewhere in their basic data so they need to be directed to study basic material remember that you are training auditors one day you may need one of them to audit you so make sure they know their data and can use it

mid ruds called because middle of session was the earliest use rudiments of session are less employed today because of the discovery that all dirty needle phenomena is usually traced to the auditor having cut the pcs communication to get rid of dirty needle one usually need ask only have i cut your communication or do an arc break assessment if that doesnt work dirty needle continuously agitated always means the auditor has cut the pcs itsa line matter what else has happenedchronically comm chopping auditors always have pcs with dirty needles conversely pcs with high tone arms have auditors who dont control the itsa line and let it overrestimulate the pc by getting into lists of problems or puzzlements but high tone arm also means heavy service fac whereas dirty needle seldom requires

hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 23 september 1963 central orgs scientology 0 to v tape coverage of new technology due to certain pressures in the world at the end of 1962 i deemed it advisable to speed up research as means of handling developing situations this activity proved fruitful beyond any expectations for the period devoted to it to increase an already burdened personal time schedule was not without repercussion it was in the first place impossible to crowd more action into the crowded hours but somehow i did so i cut out all social engagements almost all appointments and even reduced time spent talking to students i cancelled all lecture appearances abroad i let my cars and motorcycles rust and my cameras gather dust i kept mary sue up all night auditing or being audited and somehow through the devotion of staff everywhere kept the show on the road and handled the legal front also the stepped up schedule period has not ended but the golden knowledge has been gathered in and all targets hoped for have been exceeded this period has also been hard on staff students and all scientologists due to shifting technology one of the ways of reducing research time is omitting written records therefore i have relied on the saint hill course lecture tapes to bear the burden of collecting the data together on these tapes over certain period we have full record of the results of this stepped up period of research what one is greeted with in listening to these tapes is whole new clarification of scientology including

sussex hco bulletin of 25 september 1963 central orgs franchise scientology i to iv adequate tone arm action now that it has been established fully that pcs gain is directly and only proportional to tone arm action the question of how much tone arm action is adequate must be answered these are rough answers based on direct observation of pcs after sessions tone arm action is measured by divisions down per 2 12 hour session or per hour of auditing ta action is not counted by up and down only down is used usually the decimal system is used but fractions can also be employed needle falls are neglected in the computation only actual motion of the tone arm is usedone can add up or approximate the total down tone arm motion after session if an auditor is keeping good reports of ta motion one adds up all the divisions and fractions of division of down motion not up and the result is known as total ta for the session needle gives about 10th of division of motion in one sweep across the dial but as above is not used in his computation needle action is neglected in the addup example as noted in the ta column of an auditors report 45 42 48 40 35 gives you 3 8 5 gives you 16 divisions of ta action for that period of time when this is done for full 25 hour session the following table gives you rough idea of what is expected and what will happen to the pc amount per session session rating pc reaction 25 divs excellent feels wonderful 20 divs good feels good 15 divs acceptable feels better 10 divs poor slight change 5 divs unacceptable change 0 divs harmful gets worse anything from 10 divs to 0 divs of down tone arm for 2 12 hour session is something to do something about one gets very industrious in this range for 25 hour intensive the scale of ta divisions down for the entire intensive would be amount per intensive session rating pc reaction 250 divs excellent feels wonderful 200 divs good feels good 150 divs acceptable feels better 100 divs poor slight change 50 divs unacceptable change 0 divs harmful gets worse the preclears case state can be completely predicted by the amount of ta action received in session or an intensive the only exception is where the pc in running r4 old r3 processes can get into creak of bypassed goals or ris which make him uncomfortable although ta action has been good or even excellent case analysis will locate the bypassed charge on any auditing where charge has been bypassed but ta action was good the pcs subjective reality on gain will not seem to compare with the ta action gotten in the auditing but the moment the by passed charge is located the gain attributable to ta action will be feltl ron hubbard lrhjwrd copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 153 hcopl 25 sep 63 hats of student instructors for shsbc

the auditing supervisor with direct personal observation and control of individual auditing sessions in order to accomplish the above student instructors have the following duties1 know in detail all the auditing activities permitted in the section assigned 2 ensure that the sessions in the assigned unit are started and ended on time are properly located and all pcs and auditors are present be sure that the auditing schedule is being followed 3 check all sessions to see if auditors are following the d of p instructions in the folder andor the correct auditing procedure of that unit and reporting any digression to the instructor of that unit the evening student instructor may give note to the student auditor pointing out the error and must state the error on his report to the

enquiries are handled by saying do what you are going to do and write up an infraction for unauthorised break the auditing section gives the students the reality that they will get results by first applying the basic fundamentals and then following exact procedure the student auditor can do it the student instructor helps them by getting them to do it get the student to apply the basic fundamentals and exact procedure and they will get results auditing supervisor procedure for student instructors theory section all the theory section student instructors are examiners their job is to make the student knows and understands the correct data contained in the theory material listed on the check sheet 1 the first thing new student instructor does in the theory section is study and get checked out on hco policy letter of february 14 1963 how to examine theory examinations and hco policy letter of march 15 ad 13 check sheet rating system 2 the student instructor then gets sheet of goldenrod paper master check sheet and testing location from the theory supervisor put your name and the date at the top of the goldenrod paper and use it to record the flunks and passes for each student tested during lull period in the testing and about 10 minutes before the end of the assigned period stop your testing and record the flunks and passes on the master roster and our copy of the student check sheet 3 at the time of the check out record the results on the goldenrod sheet sign date and record pass or flunk on the students copy of the bulletin sign your full surname on both check sheets never use your initials 4 record in the master roster in the column designated flunk or pass slash mark for every pass or flunk student has been given the 5th slash mark is made through the previous 4 making definite group of 5 in the pass columns the ist 10 passes go in the ist pass column the 2nd10 passes in the 2nd pass column etc never leave the theory section until all passes and flunks are fully recorded on the master roster and our copies of the students check sheet the master roster and check sheet binder is never to be touched unless you are on duty as student instructor check outs are to be given except when you are on duty as student instructor 6 when student passes bulletin say pass when student flunks bulletin say flunk 7 if you ask general question be willing to get general answer if you want specific answer ask for it specifically 8 only ask enough questions to be certain that the student knows the correct data contained on the bulletin this may be as few as one question or as many as 50 9 an examiners job is to determine whether the student knows the data or not if the student does he passes if the student doesnt he flunks 10 ask direct straightforward questions and keep accurate uptodate records and the students will work hard and continue winning with their theory theory section supervisor practical student instructor 1 calls roll promptly at 10 pm and 30 pm each day and at 455 pm on mondays thats it is given at 250 pm and 445 pm each day and at 60 pm on mondays 2 reports any student not present at roll call to the training office if the practical supervisor is not present the student must be found 3 sees that students are paired up immediately after roll call if one student is left over it must be reported at once to the practical supervisor or to the training office another student must then be sent over from theory or that student goes to theory and comes over the next period 4 infractions see auditing section infractions 5 files all new pink sheets in the green folders files all completed pink sheets in green folders and puts an x through the carbon duplicates already in the green folders these are then put in the practical supervisors top basket this is done every day immediately after 3 has been done 6 on monday student instructor chooses two chairmonitors whose duties are to place in chapel at 445

an auditor learning the data and the theory of auditing is vitally important perfecting your practical drills is essential however the final test lies with the question are you getting results with your pc whether you are getting results or not is totally dependent on whether or not you are actually applying the data and theory you have learned and are utilizing the practical skills you have developed the bridge between the learning of data and development of practical skills and their actual application in the auditing session can be mightily bolstered by the pink sheet system of auditing supervision how to issue pink sheets 1 put two sheets of pink foolscap size paper on clipboard with carbon between 2 at the top of the sheet write the name of the student auditor being observed the date and the name of the observer 3 head wide column on the right hand side of the sheet with observations narrow column to the left of centre with theory and practical assignment and two more narrow columns on the left hand side with coach and instructor 4 take the above with your ball point into the vicinity of the auditing session to be observed close enough to hear and see what is going on without intruding in the session 5 write in the wide column labelled observations exactly what is happening in the session this is very difficult to do for most people especially for someone at the case level of only able to confront own evaluations do not look for auditing errors just look and record what is happening do not write in evaluation do not write in invalidations do not attempt to correct or teach in the observations columns simply observe the session and record what is happening 6 after you have filled one or more pages of the observations column now is the time to evaluate study what you have observed taking place in the session and see if anything actually diverges from the correct theory and practice of auditing 7 write in the column headed theory and practical assignment the date and title of the exact bulletin or tape containing the correct data or the title of the exact practical drill which will correct the error recorded in the observations column if the session observed was complete shambles it means that some basic basic fundamental of auditing is absent in the student auditors repertory dont overload the student with tons of drills and theory assignments look over your observations column carefully and it will suddenly dawn on you that this student hasnt clue about the auditing cycle or doesnt note the difference between the needle and the ta on the meter if you still cant find the main difficulty you can always sit the student down and ask something like what happens when you sit down in front of pc or whats the meter for youll be surprised with some of the answers youll get on the other hand you might find that youll fill up couple of pages of pink sheet without recording any errors the auditor didnt happen to goof thats fine send it to him without any assignment it will still help him send the top copy of the pink sheet to the student and filethe carbon copy in the students pink sheet folder when the completed top copy is returned by the student with all the necessary signatures throw away the carbon copy and replace it with the completed top copy pink sheet examples 1 the following would be poor pink sheet theory practical assignments observations tr0 poor tr0 meter reading auditor cant read the meter tape of sep 18 62 aud cycle lousy handling of auditing cycle in the above example the observer has evaluated invalidated only made general comments the above may all be true but the student auditor is not helped by them and the assignments dont pinpoint his major difficulty 2 the following would be helpful pink sheet theory practical observations assignments auditor leaning on table toying with the ta and pen running since the last time i audited you tr3 buttons called speeded rise on careful of clean on f to r pc said i dont think that answered tape of sep 18 62 the question aud ok ill check aud cycle it on the meter ta blew down to clear read on f to r aud went on to clean invalidate in the above example the observer states exactly what is happening in the auditing session the majority of observations noted show an inability to complete an auditing cycle even the missed meter read was an incomplete cycle the student is therefore assigned material that will help him learn and apply the auditing cycle there may be other things that can help him like tr0 or meter drills however adding these to the pink sheet will only disperse his attention which should be applied to learning and using the auditing cycle coaching pink sheets pink sheets should be coached in both practical and theory the coach first reviews the observations thoroughly with the student and goes over and over the bulletin or drill with the student until the correct data is completely learned and understood or until the student can perfectlyexecute the drill once this is done the coach signs his name opposite the assignment notation on the pink sheet in the coachs column the student is then ready to have test on the assigned material checking out pink sheets in checking out the assigned material on the students pink sheet the instructor should carefully go over the observations with the student and have the student spot the specific errors he has made then have the student give the correct data from the assigned bulletin or tape or show by doing the practical drill that he has now mastered the skill that was poorly applied in the auditing session the whole bulletin or drill should be reviewed by the instructor but specific attention should be paid to points that the student was observed to be weak in applying to his auditing be doubly strict on these points to be sure the student doesnt continue to make the same errors again and again if each pink sheet thoroughly corrects only one gross auditing error really knocks it out the students auditing ability will improve markedly in very short time conclusions pink sheets are never used as punishment or to make the student wrong they are used to improve the students auditing ability by having him thoroughly learn data and practical skills he is weak in students weakness in data and skills often will not show up under the normal conditions of theory and practical testing but they will stick out like sore thumb when he has to apply them in an actual auditing session therefore pink sheet assignment does not mean that the student hasnt learned the material if he has already passed it in theory or practical it does mean that he hasnt learned it well enough to utilize it under the duress of an actual auditing session if student has gone whole week without receiving pink sheet he should start screaming if his auditing is not being observed and his weak points picked up how does he expect to improve so make fuss student if you are not receiving pink sheets and instructors keep tabulation of when student is issued pink sheet so that you are sure to observe each student at least

bulletin of 8 may 1963 missions all saint hill graduates scientology four important actual goals this hco bulletin should be of great interest to older saint hill graduates the actual goals and items of the preclear are several thousand times more aberrative than implant gpms i have covered the entire scope of implanted goals and implants in general and we are fortunate to have all this material an auditor must know it to cope with class iv auditing as these implant gpms become confused with actual goals problem masses on meter further the implanted gpm gives the student auditor marvelous training ground for running actual gpms and it is recommended that the implant gpm be studied and some of them run before the auditor tries to handle actual gpms furthermore it was wise to know all the tricks out there before we went so i had to collect them for you confusion between implant and actual gpms occurs because the implanters used types of goals and patterns found in actual gpms implanters obviously had knowledge from historical record or even research of what thetans owngoals look like but obviously they never developed the data to workable therapy or they probably would not have continued to be driven to such costly expedients as continuous implanting between lives installations etc the highest level of treatment technology known to exist in the universe before scientology was pictureology wherein at signal from the therapist the thetan crunched up the engram this is currently in use and has been for many trillions of years in the galactic confederation there are few further complications to it except putting the thetan under control with sleep lights pictureology is very close to implanting the practitioner gets picture of the scene of the accident holds it before the thetan and snaps pair of bars not unlike cine clap sticks before the thetan the thetan eventually gets the idea and angrily or otherwise duplicates the action of the stick by crunching his own engram there are numerous kinds of traps and ways of catching and freezing thetan these are categorized as projectile which shoot thetan usually with beams or lights luring which cause thetan to inspect pole which trap thetan with his own energy prison which imprison the thetan and maze which confuse thetan temperature and perhaps chemicals are used to paralyze thetan once caught all other mental activities are done by implanting screen implants cause the thetan to put his pictures up on screen where they are misdated and scrambled picture implants simply show the thetan pictures which he recoils from or takes to be his own picture implants are also occasionally filled with false dates they give the thetan false pasts and futures they often repeat the actual beginning and ending of the incident in picture form making it hard to get before or after the implant as one sees pictures of his arrival and departure and so thinks he is not into the implant or out of it goal implants are the third and most serious type of implant they take goal and pattern of items with left and right firing poles or jets and implant terminals and opposition terminals the pattern is too regular gpm not unlike thetans own gpms this confuses the thetan as to his own goals and seeks to scramble his own goals and items the implanted gpm gets confused into the thetans own gpms and often in running thetans own goals and items one gets into implant goals or items and vice versa one only needs to straighten it out by carefully asking on the meter if this is an installed goal or items or an actual one the things one runs for gain today on the pc are 1 r1c itsa line 2 r2t dating somatics 3 r2h arc breaks4 r3sc service facsimile clearing 5 r4m2 formerly r3m2 finding goals is done via r3sc r4m2 listing takes the first rr on the item list the auditor stops the pc and reads the item and says is this your item and concludes then the usual r3m2 steps the change of designation from r3 to r4 is to agree with the new levels of scientology all routine 3 materials are now called routine 4 because it belongs in level 4 ot engram running by chains remains r3 and is used for this lifetime r3n running implant goals is now r4n and is otherwise unchanged r4m2 is unchanged except for letting the pc itsa whether or not the rring item is his or her item one doesnt let the pc have an item that doesnt rocket read on being called ______________ it is almost amusing to note how hard implanters work and what overts they must feel they run up and to note as well that if it were not for thetans own goals problem masses they could effect nothing harmful how hard they work and all for nothing they are not the source of aberration they merely make the universe seem more unpleasant as for creating aberration they could not sleep lights screens falsepicture projectors goal implants alike are wholly innocuous compared to the thetans own goals problem masses one aberrates himself and if he did not nobody else could ______________ the service facsimile is in actual fact the two top reliable items of the last present time pcs actual goals problem mass this does not prevent one from using r3sc on the contrary this makes r3sc work the pcs present time current goal can be used as service facsimile if accidentally found providing one uses it in r3sc process with in this lifetime appended to every command employed programing r4m2 in programing r4m2 1 if you find an actual correct goal of the pc run it only if it is the present time latest goal on the track if not do goal oppose lists until you do find the present time goal2 unless youve done lot of rlc and r3sc on the pc the present time overrestimulation keeps the present time goal or any actual goal from being found 3 it is easier to find an implant goal than an actual goal so carefully ask about it and sort out any goal on the meter 4 get the pcs actual present time gpm before you do any r4m2 on it dont go listing items on backtrack gpm 5 start present time actual gpm by listing for the top terminal its easier to find the top terminal for the pt gpm is usually truncated incomplete 6 go on down through the gpm to the goal 7 find the next goal below the present time one list the present time goal as an ri to find the top oppterm of the next goal note this step is optional bank can be cleaned up without finding the next goal below never include this step if your pc is getting less than 20 divs of down ta per session as you wont find the lower gpm until you have completed the one youre working so omit finding next goal on low ta motion pcs and find it ollly when all other steps are taken 8 go back to the present time gpm read the items already found on the line plot to the pc take the highest one nearest pt that ticks complete the list from which it came from not the list that opposes it or it opposes 9 using the new item found continue r4m2 on the current gpm 10 when more items exist in the top present time gpm prepcheck the goal and all auditing on goals and items 11 go to the next gpm for which you already have the top oppterm and continue with r4m2 12 use the same steps used on the present time gpm to run and clean up each gpm in turn gpms are run from the latest nearest present time back down the track items are found from the latest top nearest present time to earlier always the pcs reality is always greatest at the nearest to pt end of any gpm matter how far back they are overlisting lists is all that gets the pc skipping about and into other gpms so keep the lists very short 510 items just until the first rr is seen list only until the item being listed from does not tick on test keep the pcs itsa line in let the pc say it is or isnt his but dont let the pc have an item that doesnt rrdont worry the pc about tone arm or auditing actions let the pc run his bank you run the session do careful case analysis arc break lists and case analysis lists to be published when the case goes wrong find lots of reliable items if you dont let the pc have lots he has nothing to itsa therefore you get less tone arm action actual gpms give far more ta action than implants on r4n the implant gpm routine that uses line plots the pcs own line plot is quite individual like the original line plot for to scream in hcobs implant gpms are all pattern same ris every time it is easy on overlisting or listing only by blowdown as has been tried for the pc to skip ris or get into wrong gpms the auditor must be careful not to run an actual gpm below the goal as an item and into the next gpm the only thing that will turn off the pcs rocket read is running items out of gpm for which one does not have the goal running backtrack gpm before the present time gpm is run or skipping gpm going back sows the earlier line plot with items from the missed gpm the pcs current actions are always explained by the pair of items nearest present time this is true for all gpms matter how far back youve run the pc has only small number of actual gpms less than 50 perhaps more than 20 the length of the time track is infinitely greater than one supposes trillions one hundred is not the start of track thats trillion written one hundred times one seldom dates in r4m2 and only then to orient some item worrying the pc that has gotten out of place and only then by order of magnitude of years ago anything worrying the pc or reducing his capability or life potential is to be found in actual items or goals not in engrams or implants these are not primary causes only the pcs own goals and items are capable of basically causing the trouble the whole explanation of how an ri forms lies in the discussions of the service facsimile and the original explanations of the goals problem mass 1962 ______________ i am sorry to have caused auditors of this period to work so hard on r3n implant goals but without this data andunderstanding found between may and september of 1963 actual gpms are impossible to handle as one gets into implants pcs confront of his own gpms is increased by running implant gpms providing ta action occurs in sufficient quantity after running few implant gpms one comes up to contempt for their aberrative value the pc is lucky who has run few before tackling his own gpms the pcs own goals and items are the final road to ot l ron hubbard founder 159 hcob 1 oct 63 how to get tone arm action tv5 p 36975 ntv vii p 31321 hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 1 october 1963 franchise cenocon scientology all how to get tone arm action the most vital necessity of auditing at any level of scientology is to get tone arm action not to worry the pc about it but just to get ta action not to find something that will get future ta but just to get ta now many auditors are still measuring their successes by things found or accomplished in the session though this is important too mainly at level iv it is secondary to tone arm action 1 get good tone arm action 2 get things done in the session to increase tone arm action new data on the emeterthe most elementary error in trying to get tone arm action is of course found under the fundamentals of auditing reading an emeter this point is so easily skipped over and seems so obvious that auditors routinely miss it until they understand this one point an auditor will continue to get minimal ta and be content with 15 divisions down per session which in my book isnt ta but meter stuck most of the session there is something to know about meter reading and getting ta until this is known nothing else can be known tone arm assessment the tone arm provides assessment actions like the needle reacts on list items so does the tone arm react on things that will give ta you dont usually needle assess in doing levels i ii and iii you tone arm assess the rule is that which moves the tone arm down will give tone arm action conversely another rule that which moves only the needle seldom gives good ta so for levels i ii and iii and not level iv you can actually paste paper over the needle dial leaving only the bottom of the needle shaft visible so the ta can be set by it and do all assessments needed with the tone arm if the ta moves on subject then that subject will produce ta if the pc is permitted to talk about it itsa it almost all auditors when the itsa line first came out tried only to find future ta action and never took any present ta action the result was continuous listing of problems and needle nulling in an endless search to find something that would produce ta action they looked frantically all around to find some subject that would produce ta action and never looked at the tone arm of their meter or tried to find what was moving it now this seems almost foolish thing to stress that what is producing ta will produce ta but it is the first lesson to learn and it takes lot of learning auditors also went frantic trying to understand what an itsa line was they thought it was comm line or part of the cchs or almost anything but what it is it is too simple there are two things of great importance in an auditing cycle one is the whats it the other is the itsa confuse them and you get ta if the auditor puts in the itsa and the preclear the whatsit the result is ta the auditor puts in thewhatsit and the pc the itsa always it is so easy to reverse the role in auditing that most auditors do it at first the preclear is very willing to talk about his difficulties problems and confusions the auditor is so willing to itsa discover what is troubling the preclear that an auditor green in this will then work work work to try to itsa something that will give the pc ta that he causes the pc to whatsit whatsit whatsit thats wrong with listing is not really good itsaing its whatsiting as the pc is in the mood is it this is it that even when solutions are being listed for assessment the result is poor ta ta comes from the pc saying it is not is it examples of whatsit and itsa auditor whats here whatsit pc an auditor preclear meter itsa itsa really isnt even comm line its what travels on comm line from the pc to the auditor if that which travels is saying with certainty it is i can sit down with pc and meter put in about three minutes assessing by tone arm action and using only r1c get 35 divisions of ta in 2 12 hours with more work than writing down ta reads and my auditors report why because the pc is not being stopped from itsaing and because i dont lead the pc into whatsiting and also because i dont think auditing is complicated tone arm action has to have been prevented if it didnt occur example an auditor noting whatsit moved the ta every time promptly changed the whatsit to different whatsit actually happened yet in being asked what he was doing in session said i ask the pc for problem he has had and every time he comes up with one i ask for solutions to it he didnt add that he frantically changed the whatsit each time the ta started to move result 9 divisions of ta in 2 12 hours pc laden with bypassed charge if he had only done what he said he had he would have had ta if it didnt occur tone arm action has to have been prevented it doesnt just not occur in confirmation of auditors being too anxious to get in the itsa line themselves and not let the pc is the fad of using the meter as ouija board the auditor asks it questions continually and never asks the pc up the spout go divisions of ta is this item terminal the auditor asks the meter why not ask the pc if you ask the pc you get an itsa i think its an oppterm because and the ta moves now to give you some idea of how crazy simple it is to get in an itsa line on the pc try this start the session and just sit back and look at the pc dont say anything just sit there looking at the pc thepc will of course start talking and if you just nod now and then and keep your auditors report going unobtrusively so as not to cut the itsa youll have talking pc and most of the time good ta at the end of 2 12 hours end the session add up the ta youve gotten and you will usually find that it was far more than in previous sessions ta action if absent had to be prevented it doesnt just fail to occur but this is not just stunt it is vital and valuable rule in getting ta rule silent auditor invites itsa this is not all good however in doing r4 work or r3r or r4n the silent auditor lets the pc itsa all over the whole track and causes over restimulation which locks up the ta but in lower levels of auditing inviting an itsa with silence is an ordinary action in scientology levels i ii and iii the auditor is usually silent much longer proportionally in the session than he or she is talking about 100 of silence to 1 of talking as soon as you get into level iv auditing however on the pcs actual gpms the auditor has to be crisp and busy to get ta and silent idle auditor can mess up the pc and get very little ta this is all under controlling the pcs attention each level of auditing controls the pcs attention little more than the last and the leap from level iii to iv is huge level i hardly controls at all the rule above about the silent auditor is employed to the full level ii takes the pcs life and livingness goals or session goals for the pc to itsa and lets the pc roll the auditor intruding only to keep the pc giving solutions attempts dones decisions about his life and livingness or session goals rather than difficulties problems and natter about them level iii adds the rapid search by ta assessment for the service facsimile maybe 20 minutes out of 2 12 hours and then guides the preclear into it with r3sc processes the rule here is that if the thing found that moved the ta wouldnt make others wrong but would make the pc wrong then it is an oppterm lock and one prepchecks it the two top ris of the pcs pt gpm is the service facsimile one is terminal the pcs and the other is an oppterm they each have thousands of lock ris any pair of lock ris counts as service facsimile giving ta good slow prepcheck but still prepcheck whether running rightwrongdominatesurvive r3sc or prepchecking the only 2 processes used one lets the pc really answer before acking one question may get 50 answers which is one whatsit from the auditor gets 50 itsas from the pclevel iv auditing finds the auditor smoothly letting the pc itsa ris and lists but the auditor going at it like small steam engine finding ris ris ris goals ris ris ris for the total ta in an r4 session only is proportional to the number of ris found without goofs wrong goals or other errors which rob ta action so the higher the level the more control of the pcs attention but in the lower levels as you go back down the processes used require less and less control less auditor action to get ta the level is designed to give ta at that level of control and if the auditor actions get busier than called for in the lower levels the ta is cut down per session overrestimulation as will be found in another hco bulletin and in the lectures of summer and autumn of 1963 the thing that seizes ta up is overrestimulation the rule is the less active the ta the more overrestimulation is present though restimulation can also be absent therefore an auditor auditing pc whose ta action is low below 20 ta divisions down for 2 12 hour session must be careful not to over restimulate the pc or to gently restimulate the pc this is true of all levels at level iv this becomes dont find that next goal bleed the gpm youre working of all possible charge and at level iii this becomes dont find too many new service facs before youve bled the ta out of what you already have and at level ii this becomes dont fool about with new illness until the pc feels the lumbosis you started on is handled utterly and at level i this becomes let the pc do the talking overrestimulation is the auditors most serious problem underrestimulation is just an auditor not putting the pcs attention on anything the sources of restimulation are 1 life and livingness environment this is the workaday world of the pc the auditor handles this with itsa or since big mid ruds and even by regulating or changing some of the pcs life by just telling the pc to not do this or that during an intensive or even making the pc change residence for while if thats source this is subdivided into past and present 2 the session and its environment this is handled by itsaing the subject of session environments and other ways this is subdivided into past and present 3 the subject matter of scientology this is done by assessing by ta motion the old scientology list one andthen itsaing or prepchecking whats found 4 the auditor this is handled by what would you be willing to tell who would you be willing to talk to and other such things for the pc to itsa this is subdivided into past and present 5 this lifetime this is handled by slow assessments and lots of itsa on whats found whenever it is found to be moving the ta during slow assessment you dont null list or claw through ten hours of listing and nulling to find something to itsa at levels i to iii you see what moves the ta and bleed it of itsa right now 6 pcs case in levels i to iii this is only indirectly attacked as above and in addition to the actions above you can handle each one of these or whats found with slow prepcheck list for assessment assess for ta motion the following list the surroundings in which you live the surroundings you used to live in our surroundings here past surroundings for auditing or treatment things connected with scientology scientology list one myself as your auditor past auditors or practitioners your personal history in this lifetime goals you have set for yourself your case at level ii one gets the pc to simply set life and livingness goals and goals for the session or takes up these on old report forms and gets the decisions actions considerations etc on them as the itsa cleaning each one fairly well of ta one usually takes the goal the pc seems most interested in or has gone into apathy about as it will be found to produce the most ta whatever you assess by tone arm once you have it get the ta out of it before you drop it and dont cut the itsa measure of auditorsthe skill of an auditor is directly measured by the amount of ta he or she can get pcs are not more difficult one than another any pc can be made to produce ta but some auditors cut ta more than others also in passing an auditor cant falsify ta its written all over the pc after session lots of ta bright pc small ta dull pc and body motion doesnt count extreme body motion on some pcs can produce division of ta some pcs try to squirm their way to clear good way to cure ta conscious bodymoving pc is to say i cant record ta caused while youre moving as you may suspect the pcs case doesnt do great deal until run on r4 processes but destimulation of the case can produce some astonishing changes in beingness keyout is the principal function of levels i to iii but charge off case is charge off unless destimulated case cant get rocket read or present the auditor with valid goal levels i to iii produce book one clear level r4 produces an ot but case conditioning clearing is necessary before r4 can be run and an auditor who cant handle levels i to iii surely wont be able to handle the oneman band processes at level iv so get good on levels i to iii before you even study iv the first thing to learn by slow assessment is meant letting the pc itsa while assessing this consists of rapid auditor action very crisp to get something that moves the ta and then immediate shift into letting the pc itsa during which be quiet the slowness is overall action it takes hours and hours to do an old preclear assessment form this way but the ta flies the actual auditing in level iii looks like this auditor going like mad over list or form with an eye cocked on the ta the first movement of the ta not caused by body motion the auditor goes tiny bit further if that and then sits back and just looks at the pc the pc comes out of it sees the auditor waiting and starts talking the auditor unobtrusively records the ta sometimes nods ta action dies down in couple minutes or an hour as soon as the ta looks like it hasnt got much more action in it the auditor sits up lets the pc finish what he or she was saying and then gets busy busy again but action taken by the auditor cuts into the ta action in levels i to iii assessment list is continued beyond seeing ta move until that ta motion is handled in doing scientology list one assessment one goes down the list until the ta moves not because of body motion then because ta is not very pinpointed the auditor covers the one or two above where he first saw ta andwatching the pc for interest and the ta circles around that area until he is sure he has what made the ta move and then bleeds that for ta by itsa or prepcheck yes you say but doesnt the auditor do trs on the pc one question one answer ratio let the pc finish what the pc was saying and let the pc be satisfied the pc has said it without lot of chatter about it ta not moving signals auditor to act ta moving signals auditor not to act only the auditor can kill the ta motion so when the ta starts to move stop acting and start listening when the ta stops moving or seems about to stop listening and start acting again only act when the ta is relatively motionless and then act just enough to start it again now if you can learn just this as given here to act when theres ta and not act when there is ta you can make your own start on getting good ta on your preclear with this you buy leisure to look over whats happening with half hundred rules and your own confusion to worry about also youll never get beginning so to begin to get ta on your pc first learn the trick of silent invitation just start the session and sit there expectantly youll get some ta when youve mastered this and what fight it is not to act act act and talk ten times as hard as the pc then move to the next step cover the primary sources of overrestimulation listed above by asking for solutions to them learn to spot ta action when it occurs and note what the pc was saying just then coordinate these two facts pc talking about something and ta moving thats assessment levels i to iii just that you see the ta move and relate it to what the pc is saying just that moment now you know that if the pc talks about bugs he gets ta action note that down on your report but dont otherwise call it to pcs attention as pc is already getting ta on another subject this pc also gets ta on bugs store up 5 or ten of these odd bits without doing anything to the pc but letting him talk about things now few sessions later the pc will have told all concerning the prime source of overrestimulation i hope you were covering with him or her by only getting the pc started when he or she ran down but you will now have list of several other things that get ta the hottest ta producer on this list will get pcs goal as it is his service fac you can now get ta on this pc at will all youhave to do is get an itsa going on one of these things any ta is the sole target of levels i to iii it doesnt matter continental what generates it only level iv r4 processes are vital on what you get ta on for if youre not accurate you will get ta at level iv from levels i to iii the pcs happiness or recovery depends only on that waving ta arm how much does it wave thats how much the case advances only at level iv do you care what it waves on youre as good an auditor in levels i to iii as you can get ta on the pc and thats all and in level iv youll get only as much ta as youre dead on with the right goals and ris in the right places and those you dont want lying there inert and undisturbed your enemy is overrestimulation of the pc as soon as the pc goes into more charge than he or she can itsa easily the ta slows down and as soon as the pc drowns in the overrestimulation the ta stops clank now your problem is correcting the case and thats harder than just getting ta in the first place yes you say but how do you start getting in an itsa line what is an itsa all right small child comes in room you say whats troubling you the child says im worried about mummy and i cant get daddy to talk to and ta this child is not saying anything is it this child is saying confusion chaos worry ta the child is speaking in oppterms small child comes in room you say whats in this room child says you and couch and rug thats itsa thats ta only in r4 where youre dead on the pcs gpms and the pc is allowed to say it is or isnt can you get ta good action out of listing and nulling and even then failure to let the pc say it is it can cut the ta down enormously auditor says youve been getting ta movement whenever you mention houses in this lifetime what solutions have you had about houses and theres the next two sessions all laid out with plenty of ta and nothing to do but record it and nod now and then the theory of tone arm action ta motion is caused by the energy contained in confusions blowing off the case the confusion is held in place by aberrated stable data the aberrated nonfactual stable datum is there to hold back confusion but in actual fact the confusion gatheredthere only because of an aberrated consideration or postulate in the first place so when you get the pc to asis these aberrated stable data the confusion blows off and you get ta so long as the aberrated stable datum is in place the confusion and its energy wont flow ask for confusions worries problems difficulties and you just over restimulate the pc because his attention is on the mass of energy not the aberrated stable datum holding it in place ask for the aberrated stable datum considerations postulates even attempts or actions or any button and the pc asises it the confusion starts flowing off as energy not as confusion and you get ta just restimulate old confusions without touching the actual stable data holding them back and the pc gets the mass but release of it and so ta the pc has to say its _______ some consideration or postulate to release the pentup energy held back by it thus an auditors worst fault that prevents ta is permitting the dwelling on confusions without getting the pc to give up with certainty the considerations and postulates that hold the confusions in place and thats itsa its letting the pc say whats there that was put there to hold back confusion or problem if the pc is unwilling to talk to the auditor thats what to itsa decisions youve made about auditors for one example if the pc cant seem to be audited in that environment get old environments itsaed if the pc has lots of ptps at session start get the pcs solutions to similar problems in the past or just prepcheck slow the zone of upset or interest of the pc and youll get ta lots of it unless you stop it theres reason at all why truly expert auditor cant get plenty of ta divisions down per 2 12 hour session running any old thing that crops up on pc but truly expert auditor isnt trying to itsa the pc hes trying to get the pc to itsa and thats the difference honest its simpler than you think l ron

sussex hco bulletin of 8 october ad13central orgs franchise scientology i to iii how to get ta analyzing auditing there are several distinct forms or styles of auditing there was first the old finger snapping handing of engrams then there is formal auditing for which we still have trs 0 to 4 then there is tone 40 auditing still used today in the cchs these are distinctively different styles and good auditor can do one or another of them without mixing them up just as tone 40 auditing is still used so is formal auditing in fact scientology 4 on the gpms must be run only with formal auditing and the old trs and other training are still used to develop it in the student now there has emerged new auditing style it is listen style auditing and the first thing to learn about it is that it is new style of auditing and that it is distinctly different from formal auditing and tone 40 auditing naturally an auditor who can do this new style can also do other styles better but the other styles are themselves and this new style is itself listen style auditing is peculiarly fitted to undercut formerly difficult cases at the lower levels of scientology and to get the necessary ta action listen style auditing has or is developing its own trs it has its own technology and this leaves the technology of other auditing styles still valid and untouched some of the data of listen style auditing is 1 the definition of auditor is one who listens 2 the pc is always right 3 the task of the auditor is to get the pc to command to itsa 4 the success of the session is measured solely by tone arm action 5 the style applies to scientology levels i to iii 6 as the level in which it is used is increased the amount of auditor direction of the pcs attention is increased the gap becomes very wide in control between level iii and iv so much so that only formal auditing is used for gpms as this material is all subitsa for the pc the basic crimes of listen style auditing are 1 not getting tone arm action on the pc2 cutting the pcs comm 3 cutting evaluating or invalidating the pcs itsa 4 failing to invite itsa by the pc 5 itsaing for the pc 6 not getting tone arm action on the pc these are some of the major musts and crimes of listen style auditing while some of these also apply to formal auditing to show you how different the new style is if you tried to use only listen style auditing on scientology iv and failed to use formal auditing at that high level the pc would soon be in great big mess so the style has its uses and exactions and it has its limitations now realizing it is new style not whole change of scientology the older auditor should study it as such and the new student as mainly listen style will be taught in academies should spend some earnest time in learning to do it as itself i have had to learn every new auditing style and sometimes have taken weeks to do it i can still do them all each as itself it took two weeks of hard daily grind to learn tone 40 auditing until i could do it with misses its like learning different dances and when you can polka and also waltz if youre good you dont break from waltz into polka without noticing the difference or looking silly so the second thing to learn well about listen style auditing is that it has to be learned and practiced as itself listen style auditing is peculiarly fitted by its simplicity to analysis by an instructor or student or oldtimer the steps are 1 learn hco bulletin of october 1 1963 2 muck along with what you learned bit 3 tape 1 hour session you give on tape recorder 4 analyze the tape youll be amazed at the amount of miss until you actually hear it back these are the points to look for 1 did the auditor get dirty needle continual agitation not smooth flow up or down if so the auditor cut the pcs commthis is entirely different from cutting itsa just how was the pcs comm cut listen to the tape whether the auditor got dn or not do this step how many ways was the pc prevented from talking to the auditor particularly how did the auditors actions cut the comm with auditing or unnecessary action how was the pc discouraged from talking what was said that stopped the pc from talking 2 establish whether or not the auditor got good ta action by adding up the sessions total down ta see hco bulletin of september 25 1963 if the auditor did not get good ta action he or she either cut pcs itsa or b restimulated nothing for the pc to itsa which was it the odds are heavily on listen to the tape and find out how the auditor reduced the pcs itsa note that itsa is entirely different than comm was the pc given anything to itsa was the pc permitted to itsa it how much did the auditor itsa for the pc did the auditor attempt to change the itsas 3 by various ways by direct invitation sounding doubtful unconfident challenging an auditor can make pc whatsit the amount pc is made or allowed to whatsit reduces ta action how many ways did the auditor make the pc whatsit give problems confusions as answers or just plain put the pc into questioning attitude how doubtful or worried did the auditor sound how much did the auditor make the pc worry over ta action or other things all of which add up to making the pc whatsit thus reducing tone arm action 4 how much did the auditor invite unwanted communication about confusions problems by silence how much did the auditor prevent wanted communication by various actions 5 what errors in the session are obvious to the auditor what errors are not real to the auditor 6 does the auditor have another rationale or explanation for not getting ta action or for what causes ta action does the auditor consider there is another explanation for getting dirty needles 7 does the auditor consider ta action unnecessary for session gains 8 does the pc in the taped session agree with the faults discovered may be omitted such tape should be made periodically on an auditor until that auditor can get 35 divisions of ta at any level from i to iii on any pc l ron hubbard lrhdrrd copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 163 hcopl 8 oct 63 i new saint hill certificates and course changes oec v4 p 434 hubbard communications

senior scientologist st hill this certificate will be issued to any student attending the course 16 weeks if all course requirements are also met class iii will be awarded an additional four weeks only will be allowed for completion of check sheets but student enrolled will be held beyond sixteen weeks or extended on course more than an additional four weeks the cost of the course has been

illustrate just what is taking place in slow assessment and how the definitions given above apply approximation of diagram club itsa substitute itsa xxxxxxxx taxes mountains itsa itsa cars pc tv problems itsa itsa work itsa itsa football wife itsa itsa garden house large circle surrounds all of the above outside it are the following comments with arrows pointing to items inside the circle above problem about cars some confront with an arrow pointing to cars pcs pt environment with an arrow pointing towards football and garden etc big area of problems and confront with an arrow pointing towards taxesservice fac ignore them with an arrow pointing towards the substitute itsa line leading towards taxes end of diagram while the pc is talking about football he can say itsa game itsa played by two teams itsa played on field etc etc etc the same applies to the areas tv work wife club garden house and mountains all this will give nice ta action and good gains for the pc now when he starts talking about cars he will say i often have punctures i wonder why my car will only do 100 mph etc etc while hes talking like this there will be ta action or rising ta and if the auditor lets the pc continue he will get steadily worse so the auditor must put in an itsa line eg what have you done about this and the ta will start moving again and the pc will get brighter as now he is itsaing before he wasnt later or earlier the pc will start talking about taxes his problems worries puzzlements wonders about taxes the ta will rise and the pc will become glum then even though the auditor puts in an itsa line as with the subject of cars the ta continues to rise and the pc remains glum this is because the pc cant itsa this area hes got it all made ignore them and this does all his confronting for him in other words the service fac is substitute confront and so the ta rises note the old rule about rising needle equals confront this is glum area so the auditor lists in this lifetime what would be safe solution regarding taxes completes the list nulls it gets the service fac ignore them runs it on r3sc and soon the pc will be able to itsa on the subject of taxes this area could be found in the first 5 minutes in which case it may be possible to just note it down and get the pc on to areas he can confront and come back to this one later the assessment should go on for hours and hours and hours with excellent ta action and the pc gaining in his ability to itsa all the time however it wont go that way if the auditor doesnt get the pc to really itsa what is in his environment eg the auditor shouldnt be content to have the pc say he lives out in the suburbs he wants the address its distance from the city the type of house how many rooms what the street looks like the names of the houses occupants who the neighbors are etc etc etc itsa itsa itsa also it wont go that way if the auditor tries to list safe solutions every time the pc starts talking about his problems in an area as in the example given above with the car problems are not itsa itsa itsa itsa equals ta action ta action ta action equals pc better pc better pc better good gainsi hope you find this all okay and pass it on ron as its sure doll of an auditing activity very best ian tampion ps i found out how most of this goes in auditing by making mistakes first so i learnt the hard way l ron

form and others to be issued are breakdown of the 8 dynamics into areas where important itsa may be developed write down important information about your pc on data sheets with consecutively numbered pages also note down on the data sheet the number of the dynamic you are working on and the designation letter from this form of the area being covered keep running recording of time and ta position on the lefthand margin of your data sheet on the form record the ta position at the start and again at the end of working on any specific area and check off each area and subarea covered also write down the data sheet page number on the form so that the information can be found easily if so requiredall other information should be recorded on the data sheets which are kept attached to the form this form can be used several times each time taking up longer period of this lifetime with the pc it is suggested that the first time through you cover present time back to about year ago the second time you cover longer period say about the past 10 years and the third time through cover this lifetime this will of course vary from pc to pc some areas on this form will develop tremendous amount of itsa others very little work at the pc reality level and where the pcs interest lies dont be in hurry to leave an area if the pc has good itsa line going and you are getting good ta action clean up any hot area thoroughly before leaving it however if an area has nothing in it dont spend lot of time with it get on down the line to something that produces itsa and ta action if you or the pc dont understand any of the forms areas of potential itsa skip them however dont skip something because you think the pe has nothing on it or you are afraid of being nosy attempt has been made to give you the questions to ask and some of the forms subareas would not pertain to short time period use the subareas that pertain to the time period you are handling or shift them around to fit your time period some subareas are much more important than others but this will depend on your pc add into the space provided anything else you find to be important in getting in the itsa line on any area and subarea on this assessment be very sure to cover the following points 1 where it is or was and its location relative to other locations 2 who are the people involved 3 when it was and how long did it take place assessment stress the stress of this assessment is not in finding something the stress is on ta motion at the end of the session add up the total amount of ta blowdown only thats downward movement 4 to 3 55 to 375 if your total downward ta movement is 30 divisions of ta or more you can consider that you have had good ta motion if your total is 40 divisions or more you have had excellent ta motion if you have less than 20 divisions of downward ta motion one of two things are wrong the first is that you are not letting the pc itsa and you dont have clue about what itsa isthe second is that the pc has this lifetime arc break of fantastic magnitude if this is the case you should handle it as follows this lifetime arc break assessment 1 make short list of major this lifetime arc breaks 2 assess the list for the major arc break 3 date the arc break 4 take the period month or so before and after the arc break and run r2h on this time period 5 continue with r2c slow assessment conclusion study these directions and know them perfectly before you audit with the form it is essential that you keep all records of r2c legibly and exact the data is vital for later

sussex hco policy letter of 28 october 1963 central orgs academies student arc breaks just as pc cannot be audited over severe arc break so student cannot make good progress if he or she has an arc break with the course andor instructors all students should be made aware of this and told that if they have an arc break they should take it up with theinstructors in question or the d of t or in the case of shsbc the course secretary the instructor d of t or course secretary should try to clear the break with straightforward twoway comm and if this does not work the student should be given an arc break assessment by senior student it is the responsibility of all students and instructors to see that any student who is nursing an arc break and not doing anything about it is handled as above

room with is it all right to audit in this room not metered 3 can squeeze squeeze the cans please and note that pc registers by the squeeze on the meter and note the level of the pcs havingness dont run hav here 4 put in r factor by telling pc briefly what you are going to do in the session start of session 5 is it all right with you if i begin this session now start of session tone 40 has this session started for you if pc says say again start of session now has this session started for you if pc says say we will cover it in moment rudiments 6 what goals would you like to set for this session please note that life or livingness goals have been omitted as they tend to remind the pc of present time difficulties and tend to take his attention out of the session 7 at this point in the session there are actions which could be undertaken the running of general ow or the running of mid rudiments using since the last time i audited you or pull missed whs as indicated but if pc cheerful and needle smooth just get down to work one would run general ow if the pc was emotionally upset at the beginning of the session or if the session did not start for the pc the latter being simply another indication of the pcs being upset or arc broken but these symptoms must be present as sometimes the session hasnt started merely because of poor tone 40 or because the pc had something he wanted to say before the auditor started the session running ow if it is all right with you i am going to run short general process the process is what have you done what have you withheld the process is run very permissively until the needle looks smooth and the pc is longer emotionally disturbed where are you now on the time track if it is all right with you i will continue this process until you are close to present time and then end this process after each command ask when that was the last command is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this process end of process running the mid rudiments one would use the middle rudiments with since the last time i audited you if the needle was rough and if the tone arm was in higher position than it was at the end of the last session order of buttons here is the correct wording and order of use for the big mid ruds _______ has anything been suppressed _______ is there anything you have been careful of _______ is there anything you have failed to reveal _______ has anything been invalidated _______ has anything been suggested _______ has any mistake been made _______ is there anything you have been anxious about _______ has anything been protested _______ has anything been decided _______ has anything been asserted in using the first three buttons suppressed careful ofand failed to reveal the rudiment question should be asked directly of the pc off the meter repetitive when the pc has more answers check the question on the meter if the question reads stick with it on the meter like in fast rud checking until it is clean the last six buttons are cleaned directly on the meter as in fast ruds pulling missed withholds use since the last time you were audited has withhold been missed on you

actual mass it has density weight and size it can be measured reliable item has mass and size implants locks and actual goals of the thetan have mass this mass is caused by by the suppression of the things by the thetan only nonimplant gpms and ris have any aberative value on the thetan the others are merely confusion factors the bank is composed of these masses and nothing else when gpm or ri or ris or gpms are pulled out of line by restimulation and brought into present time they impinge upon the body when this happens in auditing we say the pc has the creak when this happens in life the doctors say he has an incurable case of lumbosis when one of these masses is restimulated out of line the thetan then has mass bearing down on him large ugly heavy black mass mass that brings pressure against his body mass that tries to inhabit the same space the thetan is inhabiting with his body and when two or more such masses may get restimulated ow restimulation of these masses all the time in life auditing is handling these masses all the time matter what level of auditing it is when you are having pc simply talk about his like and livingness as with r1c or you are doing r2c slow assessment or you are doing r3sc or an r4 case analysis any one of these you are handling the masses of the bank gpms ris etc the pc is looking at these masses matter what you are running r4m2 is the only technology which asises or gets rid of these masses on the pc in any combination not only could apc get the creak but the croak now since the bank has its own snarled up ares in it from life restimulation already any auditor is going to make errors running r4m2 when he runs into an already snarled up area of the bank if the auditor is trained in r4m2 he will know how to unsnarle the bank and correct his error but the auditor who is not trained in r4m2 does not know how to unsnarle an already snarled bank and who attempts to run r4m2 will run into snarled area make mistakes and these masses will fall in on the preclear result pc with the croak good way to make mds rich perhaps so the point is matter what you are doing with the pc matter what auditing technique you are using you are handling and having the pc look at itsa the masses called gpms ris etc and as long as you dont try to run these masses out if you are not trained in r4m2 but run r1 r2 or r3 techniques your pc will get better and better and wont croak stick to auditing levels i ii iii until you have been trained in r4m2 youll get plenty of charge off and make keyedout clears and the pcs will be happy another point is that pc cannot be run on r4m2 unless he knows what gpm an ri etc is anyway r4m2 is for educated pcs ots are made with r4m2 when run right dead thetans can be made with r4m2 run wrong

change or objection to this plan should be airmailed to at saint hill so that any necessary amendments can be issued before the effective date if objections are minimal and acceptance general this plan goes into full effect february 15 1964 without further announcement and will remain the stable gauge of all training processing certifying and classification in the future it is only possible to formulate this now that technology to ot is complete signalizing the discovery and refinement of all levels of processing up to and including the highest targets set in scientology research the following classification schedule has been developed it is evident that 13 years of research developed many processes and styles of auditing and that these are all useful and necessary to the successful progress of cases to open the road to everyone it is necessary to have precisely mapped course of progress experience shows that preclears entering too high into processes without adequate processing and training background at lower levels will fail technical data now makes it evident that person not trained to run high level ot processes cannot receivesuccessful case improvement on them and that it is dangerous to run an uneducated pc at high levels this alone makes classification of preclears as well as auditors necessary even at lower levels it will be found that preclears lacking training do not advance well further it is economical to coaudit to higher levels therefore without disturbing private or hgc processing commitments and yet placing these as well into these classifications for the protection of the preclear and auditor alike the following rules are adopted and have the full force of policy effective february 15 1964 auditors and preclears violating these policies will be subject to committees of evidence 1 preclear may be audited above his or her class 2 auditor may use processes on anyone above his or her class 3 preclear may be processed with the processes of his or her class or with the processes of any lesser class 4 an auditor may use the processes of his or her class or any lesser class but may not use on any particular preclear any process above that preclears class regardless of the auditors classification any hubbard certified auditor or hubbard professional auditor who holds the actual certificate may train any person to the level of hubbard apprentice scientologist and may further train to class i and by application to the nearest central organization may have the person he has trained certified or classified for which application forms and certificates will be furnished by central organizations full classification chart will be published from time to time giving the requirements and processes of every level and concise text books and answer sheets are in preparation for every class but absence of texts shall not preclude training or classifying so long as the materials are communicated at least until such time as texts are complete and available it readily will be seen that stress is being placed on coaudit at every class level while objection will be made to private pcs or hgc pcs the above rules apply as to what the pc may be run on and pc who fails to study for and attain his next classification levels will not be able to be processed at higher levels technical surveys demand these measures for the safety of preclears furthermore training is far cheaper than processing in the long run it will be found that auditing skill varies even within class it is true that an auditor receives better processing than he gives if only for the reason that one wants to coaudit with him or her when the skill is lowtherefore there is an incentive to be very good auditor if only to receive good processing at any class level these measures are dictated by desire to have everyone make it and to leave precisely marked roadway from the lowest to highest levels it will also be found that auditors disseminate and purely preclears seldom do great many recent instances are to hand which not only demonstrate the impossibility of attaining the highest levels without training but also demonstrate the way cases are barred out at the lower levels through lack of training and orderly forward programming up through the levels the only case barriers now are failures to have experienced certain processes at lower levels which reduced the confusion of the environment hidden standards etc for instance you cannot pull missed withholds on preclear who has concept of communication much less the definition of missed withholds unless we take this step and adopt classification for preclears as well as auditors we will find ourselves continuously losing people off the road and halting our forward advance the general classification chart issue one is as follows class process types certificate 0 listen style has i listen style has classed assist s r1c principles of arc dynamics ii

hco policy letter of august 12 1963 is cancelled the certificate hubbard book auditor is withdrawn the certificates hubbard apprentice scientologist hubbard clearing scientologist and hubbard advanced auditor are reinstated hca and hpa are both given international standing but now are different classes the rules of processing apply to class not to certificate certificate may have almost any lower class stamped on it it is the classification not the certificate that permits use of processes or being run on processes while under actual training for the next class preclear may be run on those processes but to be under training for the next class one must have been classified for the immediately preceding class one cannot enter training for the next class regardless of the certificate held unless classed for the earlier class each class has its theory practical and auditing section each process has its basic auditing technique and case analysis for that class it is envisioned that training courses be brief and precise and require exact levels of attainment as to theory practical and auditing requirements every effort is being made to handily assemble this data for each class although all of it already exists in various forms such as books bulletins and tapes more expansive classification chart is nearing completion stress in any course is 50 on auditing 50 on case gain it is not expected that person will be allowed into the next class until the processes of the previous class have been flattened on him or her maximal attention will be paid in the enforcement of this policy to circumstances surrounding persons who have long been in dianetics and scientology for these special class is being created saluting their long presence in dianetics and scientology and permitting the use of processing as auditors and preclears up to reasonable class level in keeping with their experience successes and case advance the only proviso being that actual case advance has been obtained and that their cases are not impeded by having failed to benefit from certain lower level classification changes and upgrades will not however be attempted above the class iv of the above chart and any class iv now awarded may be upgraded in special cases only to class v classification for class vi is nowobtainable except by training and actual gpms may be run by any auditor until the full technology is released and reclassification is earned this is due to the numerous upsets at this level vi classes v vi and vii may only be awarded at saint hill classes to iv inclusive may be awarded by central organizations classes to i may be awarded by hcas or above by application for not of rights to award but for certificate and class to hcos of central organizations the right to award has and classes and i are inherent in holding valid hca or hpa certificate note if any pre1960 auditor feels confused about his class he or she need only honestly answer the question what processes do i do very successfully and get good results with and do i succeed on myself as case and that will serve as good gauge of what class that auditor should have in order to go forward on the

of 26 november 1963 central orgs franchise all levels star rating new triangle basic auditing technique case analysisall processing can be broken down into three separate parts for any level of auditing these three parts are 1 basic auditing 2 technique and 3 case analysis basic auditing the handling of the pc as being the auditing cycle the meter comprise the segment of processing known as basic auditing if an auditor cannot handle this segment or any part of it well trouble will develop in the other two segments technique and case analysis when technique and case analysis seem to fail even when done by the book the fault commonly lies in basic auditing one or more of the five faults elsewhere listed will be present and these faults effectively prevent any technique or case analysis from working where scientology isnt working the wrong first places to look are technique and case analysis the right place to look is basic auditing until an auditor can handle pc in session easily handle meter smoothly and accurately and is flawless in his auditing cycle he or she should have hope of making any technique work or of analyzing any case for anything in smooth basic auditing lies the open sesame to all cases for only then do technique and case analysis function the gun barrel is basic auditing technique and case analysis form the ammunition and sight poor basic auditor using fine technique is firing ammunition with gun it doesnt go anywhere there is level of basic auditing for every level of scientology at the lowest level it is only the ability to sit and listen it grows in complexity from there up to the fabulous coordination of pc auditing cycle and meter so flawless that neither auditor nor pc are aware of the presence of basic auditing at all but only the actions of the technique and the guidance of case analysis and between those two practices of basic auditing lie many gradients basic auditing is the rock on which all gains are built technique the techniques of scientology are many spread out over 13 years of development technique is process or some action that is done by auditor and pc under the auditors directionthe lowest technique is the single coaudit question given by the supervisor to let the pc itsa the highest is the complex listing of goals and gpms technique is patterned action invariable and unchanging composed of certain steps or actions calculated to bring about tone arm action and thus better or free thetan there have been thousands of techniques less than hundred at guess are in common recommended use for the various levels of auditing techniques have their place in various levels of auditing today rather than various differences of case as cases may be audited only at the level in which they are trained by modern ruling and as several techniques exist at each level for choice out of case analysis it will be found quite simple to select technique and get results with it safe auditing and good sense dictate such selection and classing of techniques and trouble only results when someone sells himself out of his level to high fast flounder techniques exist in tables and texts for the various levels and it will be found that these give the best case results applied in that way case analysis case analysis establishes two things what is going on with the case and b what should be done with it case analysis is new subject to auditors at this time it is commonly confused with techniques and the gravest fault is treating case analysis as only another assessment technique there is level of case analysis for every level or class to compare with the basic auditing and technique of that class my first development in this new segment of processing was programming this is the consecutive techniques or actions case should have to get adequate tone arm action and achieve new plateau of ability but case analysis itself has steps like and b above there is also an invariable sequence of application in more advanced case analysis these steps should be very very well known by trained auditor since all case analysis fits into them 1 discover what the pc is sitting in 2 have the pc detail what assumptions and considerationshe or she has had about it and 3 identify it fully and correctly the it above can be as slight as worry as bothersome as present time problem or as overwhelming as goals problem mass whatever it is the case analysis steps would be the same in the first step the survey may be very brief it should certainly have certainty in it for the pc it can be very general it can be part of case or geographical location the pc could be clear or insane the sequence or the 3 steps would be the same the next step 2 gets the lies off giving ta action and thus clearing away charge for more accurate assault in 3 this second step can be very lengthy as in level two or very brief as in ot auditing techniques but it must exist whether short or long otherwise the analysis is heavily hindered by the lies and these will read on the meter and upset the analysis or they will cloud the pcs perception on which all itsa depends so the lies must come off in any case analysis usually this is quite permissive and gently done but it can amount to also pulling missed withholds it all depends on the level on which the analysis is being done and what is being analyzed this step 2 becomes itself technique at lower levels it is just spatter and promise at high level auditing the third step can be long or short but must always be there here with the charge gone in 2 the auditor and pc can now identify the thing much better and the pc can have final certainty on it usually at lower levels the certainty is only that it is gone the familiar how do you feel about that problem now what problem is lower level result of case analysis at the highest level on checking the meter i find that is wrong item would be the auditors final 3 statement so case analysis at any level has as its action establishing what the pc is in what it has been supposed to be and what it now is or isnt anything from habit to headache could be analyzed in this way at the lowest levels it could occupy an intensive at the highest levels five minutes arc break handling has been the most familiar tool of case analysis case analysis handles the momentary or prolonged problem determines the technique to be used and is always done with basic auditing an auditor has three hats one is his basic auditors hat this he never takes off the other two are his technique hat and his case analysis hat and these he switches backand forth at need these are the three segments put together well they make successful auditing l ron hubbard lrhdrrd copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 176 hcopl 4 dec

sussex ma bpi hco information letter of 10 december 1963 scientology zero the dangerous environment the true story of scientology the true story of scientology is simple concise and direct it is quickly told 1 doctor of philosophy developed philosophy about life and death 2 people find it interesting 3 people find it works 4 people pass it along to others 5 it grows when we examine this extremely accurate and very brief account we see that there must be amongst us some very disturbing elements for anything else to be believed about scientology these disturbing elements are the merchants of chaos they deal in confusion and upset their daily bread is made by creating chaos if chaos were to lessen so would their incomes the politician the reporter the medico the drug manufacturer the militarist and arms manufacturer the police and the undertaker to name the leaders of the list fatten only upon the dangerous environment even individuals and family members can be merchants of chaos it is to their interest to make the environment seem as threatening as possible for only then can they profit their incomes force and power rise in direct ratio to the amount of threat they can inject into the surroundings of the people with that threat they can extort revenue appropriations heightened circulations and recompense without question these are the merchants of chaos if they did not generate it and buy and sell it they would they suppose be poor for instance we speak loosely of good press is there any such thing today look over newspaper is there anything good on the front page rather there is murder and sudden death disagreement and catastrophe and even that bad as it is is sensationalized to make it seem worse this is the coldblooded manufacture of dangerous environment people do not need this news and if they did they need the facts not the upset but if you hit person hard enough he can be made to give up money thats the basic formula of extortion thats the way papers are sold the impact makes them sticka paper has to have chaos and confusion news story has to have conflict they say so there is good press there is only bad press about everything to yearn for good press is foolhardy in society where the merchants of chaos reign look what has to be done to the true story of scientology in order to make it news story by modern press standards conflict must be injected where there is none therefore the press has to dream up upset and conflict let us take the first line how does one make conflict out of it 1 doctor of philosophy develops philosophy about life and death the chaos merchant has to inject one of several possible conflicts here he is not doctor of philosophy they have to assert they are never quite bold enough to say it is not philosophy but they can and do go on endlessly as their purpose compels them in an effort to invalidate the identity of the person developing it in actual fact the developer of the philosophy was very well grounded in academic subjects and the humanities probably better grounded in formal philosophy alone than teachers of philosophy in universities the oneman effort is incredible in terms of study and research hours and is record never approached in living memory but this would not be considered newsworthy to write the simple fact that doctor of philosophy had developed philosophy is not newspapertype news and it would not disturb the environment hence the elaborate news fictions about 1 above then take the second part of the true story people find it interesting it would be very odd if they didnt as everyone asks these questions of himself and looks for the answers to his own beingness and the basic truth of the answers is observable in the conclusions of scientology however to make this news it has to be made disturbing people are painted as kidnapped or hypnotized and dragged as unwilling victims up to read the books or listen the chaos merchant leaves 3 very thoroughly alone it is dangerous ground for him people find it works hint of workability would ever be attached to scientology by the press although there is doubt in the press mind that it does work thats why its dangerous it calms the environment so any time spent trying to convince press scientology works is time spent upsetting reporter on 4 people pass it along to others press feels betrayed nobody should believe anything they dont read in the papers how dare wordofmouth exist so to try to stop people from listening the chaos merchant has to use words like cult thats closed group and they have to attack organizations and their people to try to keep people out ofscientology now as for 5 it grows we have the true objection as truth goes forward lies die the slaughter of lies is an act that takes bread from the mouth of chaos merchant unless he can lie with wild abandon about how bad it all is he thinks he will starve the world simply must not be better place according to the chaos merchant if people were less disturbed less beaten down by their environments there would be new appropriations for police and armies and big rockets and thered be not even pennies for screaming sensational press so long as politicians move upward on scandal police get more pay for more crime medicos get fatter on more sickness there will be merchants of chaos theyre paid for it and their threat is the simple story of scientology for that is the true story and behind its progress there is calmer environment in which man can live and feel better if you dont believe it just stop reading newspapers for two weeks and see if you feel better suppose you had all such disturbances handled the pity of it is of course that even the merchant of chaos needs us not to get fatter but just to live himself as being so the true story of scientology is simple story and too true to be turned aside l ron hubbard founder 179 hcopl 11 dec 63 classification for everyone

given class ii the student is now qualified to train to has and class i and to use and be audited on class ii materials since he or she is in training for class ii when the student feels ready he or she may take their classification examination for class ii additional training may be sold this student by an academy until the student is class ii and additional class ii course may be given this student the cost of the original hqs course is envisioned as l35 it may not be priced above this figure anywhere the cost of an has course is envisioned as not more than l5 where it is charged for and the class i course for has class i is envisioned as an additional course costing more than l10 any auditor from hqs up may teach and charge for has courses and has class i courses there is restriction on auditing fees charged by auditors or hgcs charges for coaudit unit attendance are at discretion in short it is envisioned that person may receive his has from any auditor hqs or above or from any scientology organization and similarly may receive his has class i these has and has class i courses are envisioned as evening or weekend courses the only restriction is that failure to train well before awarding can result in committee of evidence for the trainer any has class i may take his or her hqs course at any academy will be certified on completion and will be given classification examination for class ii at future date without further formal training it is necessary to have been classed as class ii before being permitted to take an hcahpa course at level iii academies will teach the hcahpa course with level iiimaterials the course is envisioned as 2 months in length and its cost about l78 classification arrangement is similar to hcahpa it is not envisioned that people taking has or hqs or even hcahpa courses are making career out of scientology they are expected to keep on working at their jobs this must be stressed there is effort to follow medical psychiatric practitioner patterns and have offices there is an effort to work evening and weekends running small organizations of coaudits the effort is to make scientologists not have patients this dictates the length of the hqs course as people can seldom get off work for more than month this does not interfere however with someone working full time in scientology cost and length of courses rise somewhat as they increase in class as the increased ability of the student if well processed on classification level processes commonly brings him or her more income and leisure the intent of this programme is to 1 open the road for everyone 2 provide wider dissemination 3 guarantee an increase of knowledge to keep pace with increase of ability 4 provide the cheapest possible processing 5 regulate processes by class level to guarantee more real advance 6 steer around rough spots found in the past in technical administrative and personal areas there is effort to decrease the income or present activity of any

difficulties not because we are in healing but because the ama should be taught lesson for attacking us the research took sudden optimistic turn with the new subject of case analysis hco bulletin of november 261963 while case analysis is not used for healing purposes it can be varied at very low levels to produce some astonishing results in health the steps for case analysis are 1 discover what the pc is sitting in 2 get the lies off 3 locate and indicate the charge in 1 the pc is sitting in whatever the pc says he or she is sitting in ie i dont know means pc is sitting in puzzle and is used with steps 2 and 3 by finding what he has supposed and then with the itsa handled establishing the truth of it the following example severely follows the 1 2 and 3 steps of case analysis without seeming to and without the pc having clue about either case analysis or scientology for that matter this was done by dscn using the new fundamentals of case analysis as an independent action to help someone and very cleverly done it was i asked the auditor to write it up for you dear ron an account of an assist which i gave recently the pc aged 17 years was completely new to scientology he was suffering from chronic bronchitis which was currently particularly worrying to him as he had just been given serious warning by his doctor that this could become tb i used the caseanalysis assist first establishing he was sitting in chest trouble then getting him to tell all he could about the condition then i asked after the ta had slowed down what he considered was the cause of the trouble ie getting the untruth off and he said well i think it is caused by the climate this was accompanied by big ta blowdown further considerations were forthcoming and more ta action so i then asked if this condition had anything to do with something that he himself had wanted to do ie an actual gpm bd so then asked did it have any connection with something that someone else had tried to make him do ie implant gpm bd so then asked if this was connected with someone or something he had ever known ris this produced big bd and pc spoke of his grandfathers death further bd when i enquired if his grandfather had died of some chest trouble then i asked if any other person or incident was connected to his chest trouble big bd on nearly drowned in swimming pool just before grandfather died i let him itsa on both these incidents until ta slowed down then indicated to him that the trouble was connected to grandfathers death and the neardrowning incident this gave further bd in all this assist in model session took 34 minutes and made 7 divisions of ta bd pc made his goal to get to the cause of the trouble and the gain its got deeply interested in the work pc has virtually lost his cough and has applied for staff appointment at hco wwthis pc had never heard of scientology prior to about one week before the assist best auditor note 12 days after this auditing the coughing was still in

office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 28 december 1963 central orgs franchise routine vi indicators part one good indicators note auditor at this date is qualified to run actual gpms regardless of any former training the successful technology has not been fully released there are class vi auditors if you were trained run only implant gpms the technology for which has been fully released an indicator is condition or circumstance arising in an r vi auditing session which indicates whether the session is running well or badly and if badly what action the auditor should at once take there are good indicators and bad indicators but all of them are indicators the good indicators mean that the session is progressing properly and that the next routine action should be undertaken good indicators abound in properly run session here are some good indicators pc cheerfulpc cogniting on items or goals pcs items found are the ones the pc thought they were on the list pc listing items briefly and accurately early items on list turning out to be the right ones the right item reading on the needle with chug as though through resistive wall and then heavily falling with blowdown items found not rocket reading goals found rocket reading short item lists 1 to 15 or 20 items on the list items being found rapidly without lot of hassle even though the right item hard to make read tone arm continuing in motion not stuck symptom of wrong goal or by passed gpms or ris needle active not stuck symptom of rr gone off which means wrong goal or wrongly worded goal pc not troubled with new mass appearing when item is given ri given pc blowing tone arm down when pc asked if it is it further blowdown of ta with full dial needle slash when pc told it is his or her item distinct needle slash two inches or so when pc asked if new item solves or is solved by ri found just before full dial slash of needle when pc answers question as to what is the position of the newly found item in the bank heat on the item list heat on the goals list heat on the ri found pain on ri found tone arm riding between 25 and 375 acceptable or 225 and 3 excellent good tone arm action on finding items about 125 ta divisions per gpm in fast running about 30 or 40 ta divisions down per 2 12 hour session minimum the right item reading with only some coaxing pc with ptp about which really went where concerning goals or ris found in earlier sessionpc with question as to what was the right goal or item after it is found pc not critical or arc breaky pc not protesting auditors actions pc looking younger by reason of r vi auditing pc without weariness pc without pains or aches or illnesses developing during auditing pc wanting more auditing pcs confidence in finding goals and items getting progressively better pcs itsa free but not so extensive as to halt session progress giving more than 30 seconds or minute usually less to itsaing goal or item auditor seeing how goals oppose goals auditor seeing how ris solve ris or are solved by them the goals plot making sense to the auditor the line plot looking proper with correct gradients to the auditor vast mental effort demanded of the auditor to follow pcs logic in why something opposes something or solves something pc not developing heavy ptps or somatics between sessions or in session the good indicator tells you things look the way they ought to look and are going the way they have to go to make an ot when these good indicators are absent then is the time to start doing searches repairs etc in actual practice you get so used to good indicators that you dont really think of them as indicators at all therefore you keep your attention alert for bad indicators and when these show up you have to act and promptly like many other things in this universe you dont concentrate on the smooth you stay alert for the rough but it is great mistake for an auditor to be so nervous about bad indicators that the pc is thrown into whatsit when nothing is wrong things will go wrong then for sure the rule is expect good indicators and go on with routine actions as long as they are present observe quickly and knowingly bad indicators and rapidly act with the correct responseevery bad indicator is precise easily observed and has an exact counteraction the speed with which bad indicator is observed and the certainty with which it is corrected prevents the session from producing more bad indicators observe the trouble sign instantly know what to do for that exact sign instinctively repair swiftly and in these points we have the whole secret of fast progress it is not the pc who slows the session it is the auditors lack of knowledge of bad indicators and their remedies the longer bad indicator goes unobserved and unrepaired the longer it will take to repair it in r vi errors consume time far far out of proportion to successes one overlooked bad indicator can consume month of auditing time in that month three whole banks would have been run but the month is consumed with unproductive wanderings the pc and auditor torn to bits with stress and arc breaks its all matter of indicators and knowing what to do if that knowledge is poor then well ot thats all the road is traveled with total correctness only it is never traveled at all when unremedied bad indicators are present the auditor is either totally competent or totally incompetent there are shades of grey one error unremedied puts the whole project on the dump heap so the auditor has to know his business and so does the pc and errors cant be let go by this is the routine of perfection sloppy hope it will get by well it doesnt matter attitudes will not make ots any error passed up and neglected will within minutes or sessions wreck the lot miss gpm or half dozen items and within two banks the pc will bog completely and hopelessly and never progress further until the earlier error is remedied its like having pc on rubber bands the pc will go down the track from an error just so far and then as though the bands tighten to drag him back will run slower and slower and then suddenly one is faced with pc who cant run at all but these errors are not undetectable the instant they occur bad indicator shows up the speed errors are remedied determines the speed of advance of the case the dont care hopeitwillgetby whyrepair auditor just cant audit r vi and will only seriously mess up pcs this is the condition of the final road out i wish it were different but it isnt its that way an auditor can know his business there is finite specific answer for every bad indicator that shows up therefore an auditor to succeed in r vi must1 know basic auditing and meters and itsa like an old smoothie 2 know the anatomy of gpms ris and the objects of the mind and all their possible combinations like card sharp knows cards 3 know the techniques of r vi like completely relaxed oneman band 4 know all good indicators at glance 5 know every bad indicator and its response with bangbang onetwo certainty that never permits moments wonder as to whats going on or what to do 6 know the rules of r vi ratatattat given those six things an auditor can make an ot in under thousand hours weakness on any one of them will not only not make an ot but will fiendishly mess up case for even if you know r vi cold you will make enough mistakes to keep you very busy the pity of it is that one must become an expert before he or she performs on an actual case but that must be overcome i learned it from scratch so can you with all the data now neat before us l ron hubbard lrhdrbh copyright c 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 185 message late 63 dec rons journal ntv vii page 3667 not in old tech vols rons journal late december ad 13 well here we go into ad 14 with all our technology assembled with complete bridge with ots emerging with worldwide organization still intact with all attacks upon us failing or failed with all research targets attained happy new year there has been such blur of activity to completeeverything that i doubt youve had time to catch up i know i havent in january of 1963 antiscientology actions intensified and to play it safe i adopted the policies of holding the line in legal spheres and b intensified research as the most workable counterattack these policies were successful we have held the line thanks to the activities of organization and association secretaries hcos and all scientology staffs and scientologists and we have even made headway fda is backing down as they have case and will lose it even if it ever comes to court theyll still make noise but its sounding brass and the tinkle of the temple bell john fudge scientology us has done fine job with the help of our attorney mr brinkman in australia the labor party tried to pass bill in the victoria state parliament to bar out scientology we demanded hearing and sued various slanderers for quarter of million pounds hasi australia did grand job of holding the fort looks like weve come through the bad news period youll still see the summer lightning flitting about the horizon but in actual fact its finished storm and we will emerge bone dry and smiling however all this tension resulting from the main upsets and numerous other brush fires put rather heavy strain on i had to carry out in the face of all this the most intense period of research ive yet done by august i had it complete to ot and during the autumn was able to subdivide all old technology and provide new basic technology scientology zero to bridge from the man in the street all the way to ot every level of auditor and case progress has been plotted now and most of the material released at least on tape i have been able to replot activities of auditors and organizations to make the road far less expensive and much more easily followed results from processing are in the stars today at any level compared to even year ago what i have learned is that cases do not progress beyond their scientology education level this has made great difference case hangs right at the point to which it has been educated in scientology processing gains are parallel to education gains and the two balance fifty percent of case gain is from processing fifty percent from training dc back in the days of dick steves onetime organization secretary used to produce graph gains by training alone as dick used to point out its quite impossible to go to ot without full knowledgeof ot processes and an ability to audit them that was the main point that emerged but similarly nobody gets past lower levels as case without knowledge of them this was the main hang up in cases lack of education in scientology and so our whole pattern of forward progress had to change you have to know to go and coaudit to ot is the only way it can be made so vanished is the idea of patients and practitioners scientologist is an auditor well its been an exciting ad 13 lets all get wins in ad 14 happy new year l ron hubbard founder end of 1963 materials
