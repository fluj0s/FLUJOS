home viewer extension and reauthorization act shvera which ex tends and expands upon earlier acts that regulate the satellite levision tv industry one of the most contentious issues was whether to allow satellite tv companies to retransmit broadcast network digital tv signals to their subscribers who cannot r eceive digital tv from their local network broadcast stations that is they live in digital white areas shvera provides limited authority for satellite companies to offer distant digital signals if certain conditions are met this report will not be updated grade b signals unserved h ouseholds and white areas congress has passed veral laws regulating the sate llite television industry in those laws and others that regulate cable tele vision congress has ttempted to balance the interests of the broadcast satellite and cable television industries with the goal of ensuring that as many households as po ssible have access to free local television programming while expanding consumer choices in programming and service providers the first satellite tv law was the 1988 sate llite home viewer act shva it was amended in 1994 and expanded in 1999 as the satellite home viewer improvement act shvia some of the provisions of shvia were due to expire at the end of 2004 prompting congress to revisit satellite tv issues in the 108th congress the resulting satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act shvera is title ix of division j of the fy2005 consolidated ppropriations act h r 4818 pl 108447 this report addresses only the digital white area issue in shvera see crs report rs21768 for more on the earlier acts and othe r shvera issues the two major satellite tv companies are echostar which markets its service as dishtv and directv shva allowed satellite comp anies to retransmit pr ogramming from broadcast network affiliates such as abc nbc and cbs only to households that could not receive good quality signals from their local ne twork affiliate via ove rtheair rooftop or rabbit ear antennas formally they are called unserved households but arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21990crs2 1 dmas are defined by nielse n media research there are 210 dmas in the united statescolloquially known as white areas the origin of that term is unclear but some imagine that it refers to situation where viewers see only snow on their tv screens satellite tv companies are allowed to provide subscribers who live in unserved households with network programming from an of the network ffiliates regardless of which television market or designated market area dma1 they live in since the signals are from nonlocal station they are referred to as outofmarket signals or distant network signals the criterion that determines which house holds are eligible to receive distant network signals is the grade b signal intensity standard set by the federal communications commission fcc it is m easurement in decibels of the intensity of the analog signal received at particular house hold from tv station if household cannot receive an analog sign of grade b intensity it is an unserved household and is permitted to receive distant ne twork signals via satellite h ouseholds that can receive grade b signal generally may not receive distant network signals some subscribers who were receiving distant network signals illegally were grandfat hered in shvia and allowed to continue receiving them each tv station has grade b contour th at can be envisioned as roughly circular or elliptical area around the transmitter in wh ich most viewers can receive grade b signal households outside the grade b c ontour are unserved also due to terrain or building blockages some households within grade b contour also may be unserved the fcc uses computerized predictive m odel the individual location longleyrice illr to predict which households can r eceive grade b sign consumers who disagree with the predictive model ve recourses see crs report rs20425 until recently the debate over who is allowed to receive distant network signals was based on analog tv signals however th television industry is transitioning to digital tv see crs report rl31260 raising the stion as to whether similar concept should be applied to digital tv signals that is if satellite tv subscriber cannot receive digital signal from local broadcast network affiliate ie if they live in digital white area or are digitally unserve d should the subscriber be allowed to receive distant digital network signal via satellite localintolocal versus distant network signals shva addressed only distan t network signals in 1999 shvia allowed satellite companies for the first time to offer local network signals to their subscribers this service is referred to as l ocalintolocal because the sa tellite companies take the local network signal transmit it to their satellites and then rebroadcast it back into the same dma where it originated the satellite companies are permitted but not required to offer localintolocal according to th eir websites on nove mber 30 2004 echostar offered it in160 dmas and directv offered it in 130 dmas the distinction between local and distant network signals is important for understanding satellite tv regulation local signal is broadcast and received within network affiliates dma di stant network signal is from elsewhere in the country forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21990crs3 example if consumer lives in denver and receives signal from denver network affiliate that is local signal if consum er lives in west virginia and receives signal from that denver network affiliate via satellite it is distant network signal this report addresses the distant ne twork signal debate but some of the rules apply differently if the subscriber has access to localintolocal service the debate over digital white areas certain provisions of shvia were due to expire at the end of 2004 prompting congress to again debate sate llite tv issues see crs repor t rs21768 as part of the debate the satellite broadcasting and communications association sbca proposed that satellite subscribers who cannot receive digital tv sign als from their local network broadcasters should be able to receive dist ant digital network tv signals via satellite sbca represents the satellite communications industry including directv and echostar sbca and other groups such as the digita l transition coalition argued that digital tv is being rolled out too slowly they contended that permitting satellite tv companies to offer distant digital signals creating in the law digital white areas similar to analog white areas would spur the tv industr to convert to digital more quickly the national association of broadcasters nab countered that broadcasters are converting to digital as quickly as they ca n and in congressional testimony insisted the proposal was recipe for mischief broa dcasters have succe ssfully sued satellite companies over many years on the basis that the satellite companies provide distant network signals to subscribers who are not eligible for them they worry that the satellite companies may again exceed their authorizati on leading to more tension and lawsuits the fcc did not publicly take position on this issue legislative action jurisdiction over satellite tv issues is divided between the commerce and judiciary committees the house passed hr 4518 on october 6 2004 it merged provisions in that bill as reported from the house judi ciary committee hrept 10866 with hr 4501 reported from the house energy and commerce committee hrept 108634 the housepassed bill did not include the requested digital white area provisions instead it directed the fcc to begin process that migh t lead to establishment of digital signal standard so that digital white areas could be defined they would be different from analog white areas analog tv signal strength falls off gradually creating areas of varying signal quality and the signals may reflect off various objects producing ghost images digital signals are either received or not there are fuzzy pictures or ghosting the senate commerce sc ience and transportati on committee reported s 2644 on november 19 2004 written re port the senate judici ary committee reported s 2013 on june 17 2004 written report neither bill reached the senate floor the senate commerce bill included digital

108447 the digital white area provisions are very complex the final language allowed both sides to declare vi ctory nab president eddie fritts said that the bill thwarts efforts to establish digital white areas2 sbcas press release listed the major features of the bill including the creation of digital white area which will allow satellite companies to now deliver digital and high definition television signals to millions of rural americans who are currently digitally unserved3 the details of the final version are described below essentially they mean that subscribers who are unserved for purposes of analog tv signals will also be considered unserved for purposes of digital tv signals other satellite tv subscribers may receive distant digital signals only under very narrow circumstances that ppear to minimize the number of eligible households subscribers in analog white areas subscribers who cannot receive an analog sign of grade b intensity ie they are unserved households for analog television are also considered to be unserved for digital television they may receive distant digital signals via satellite if they also meet the criteria described below regarding their access to localintolocal service other subscribers subscribers are eligible for distant digital signals if they are determined to be digitally unserved based on digital sign intensity test there ar specific provisions about when subscribers are eligible for the test how it must be conducted nd who pays for it when test may be requested trigger events if the subscriber is within the analog grade b contour of network station and is seeking to get distant digital signal from the same network the subscriber is not eligible for test until the following trigger events occur april 30 2006 if the local network sta tion is within the top 100 television markets and has received tentative digital tv service channel designation that is the same as that stations current digital tv service channel or has been found by the fcc to ve lost interference protection or july 15 2007 for any other local network st ations other than translator stations which amplify and simultane ously rebroadcast the signal of tv station on different frequency orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21990crs5 in the case of translator station on year after the date on which the fcc completes all actions necessary for the allocation and assignment of digital tv licenses to tv translator stations the fcc may grant waiver to netw ork station and prohibit subscribers from receiving the testing the request from the station for waiver must be filed less than five months before the implementation deadlines specified in the clauses above the waiver shall expire at the end of more than six months but may be renewed the fcc may only grant the waivers upon clear and convincing evidence that the stations di gital signal covera ge is limited due to the unremediable presence of one or more of the following and under circumstance can waivers be granted because of financial exigency the need for internationa l coordination or approvals clear zoning or envir onmental legal impediments force majeure the station experiences substantial decrease in its digital signal area due to necessity of using sidemounted antennae substantial technical problems that result in station experiencing substantial decrease in its coverage area solely due to actions to avoid interference with emerge ncy response providers or satellite carrier is providing localintolocal analog service in the local market the fcc may grant waivers to translator stations for not more than three years if it determines that the translator sta tion is not broadcasting digital signal due to one or more of the following frequent occurrence of inclement weather or mountainous terrain at the transmitter tower location test procedures the test must be conducted in accordan ce with fcc regulati on 73686d of title 47 cfr regarding how to collect field stre ngth data or any successor regulation and the subscriber cannot receive signal of the standard set in section 73622e of title 47 cfr regarding digital tv service areas measured in decibels above 1 microvolt per meter as in effect on the date of enac tment of this act shvera also requires the fcc to complete study within one year of enactment to determine if these are the best methods for determining whethe r household is digitally unserved and report to congress with ppropriate r ecommendations the subscriber must make written request to the satellite company for test the test must be conducte d within 30 days after the s ubscriber submits the request the test must be conducted by qualifie d and independent person selected by the satellite company and the network stations or who has been previously approved by the satellite carrier and each affected station but not previ ously disapproved but the tester cannot be disapproved after the test has commenced circumstances under which the loser pays or the subscriber pays for the test in the case of subscribers who are not eligible for distant digital signal because they do not receive an analog signal of grade b intensity but are inside network stations grade b contour the satellite company may ask the network station for ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21990crs6 waiver if the station grants waiver or fails to respond within 30 days the subscriber may receive the distant digital signal if waiver is denied the subscriber may request the satellite carri er to conduct the test unle ss the satellite company and network station otherwise agree the loser pays for the test if the test shows that the subscriber is not digitally unserved the satellite company pays for test if the test shows that the subscriber is digitally unserved then the network station pays if the satellite company does not request the test or fails to respond to the subscriber within 30 days the subscriber may request test and pay for it himself or herself in accordance with regulations to be prescrib ed by the fcc the satellite company must inform the subscriber of the typical costs of the test all subscribers who can receive localintol ocal service any eligible subscriber who is lawful subscriber to distant digital signal on the date of enactment of shvera may continue to receive that distant digital signal whether or not the subscriber subs cribes to localintolocal other subscribers who are digitally unserved but can receive analog localintolocal signals must choose between th localintolocal signals or distant digital signals if in the 48 contiguous states the distant dig ital signal is the secondary transmission of station whose prime time network programming is generally broadcast simultaneously with or later than the prime time network programming of the local affiliate of that network in any local market the retransmission of the distant digital signal of the distant station occupies at least th equivalent bandwidth as th digital signal broadcast by such stations and the subscriber subscribes to the analog signal of local network station within 60 days after that stations analog signal is made available by the satellite company and adds to or replaces the stations analog signal with its digital signal within 60 days after that digital signal is made available by the satellite carrier however the distant digital signal can be continued if the s ubscriber cannot be reached by the satellite transmission of the local digital signal new subscribers who are digitally unserved but can receive digital localintolocal service may not get distant digital signals via sate llite unless they cannot be reached by the satellite transmission of the local digital signal new subscribers who are digitally unserved and cannot receive digital localintolocal may receive distant digital signal from stati on affiliated with par ticular network but they can only do so if in the case of local ma rkets in the 48 contiguous states the distant network affiliates prime time network programming is generally broadcast simultaneously with or later than the prime time network pr ogramming of the local affiliate the satellite company may continue to provide the distant digital signal after it makes digital local intolocal signal available only if the subscriber subscribes to the digital signal from the local network station unless th subscriber cannot be reached by the satellite transmission of the local digital signal
