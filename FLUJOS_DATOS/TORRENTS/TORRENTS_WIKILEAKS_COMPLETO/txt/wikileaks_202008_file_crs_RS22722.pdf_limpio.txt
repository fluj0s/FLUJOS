edward v murphy government and finance division october 31 2008 abstract there is some evidence that the underwriting standards of nonbanks that chose to securitize loans outside of fannie mae and

defaults in the subprime mortgage market have drawn attention to the regulatory framework for mortgage lending traditionally banks subject to federal regulation have extended loans to potential home buyers and kept the loans in their own portfolios alternatively mortgage lenders can sell their loans to the secondary market where the loans are transformed into mortgage backed securities mbs in process called securitization securitization allows banks and nonbanks to offer mortgages without retaining longterm interest in the loans themselves nonbank lenders are often outside the safety and soundness regulation of federal bank examiners although they are still subject to the consumer protection mandates of the truth in lending act tila the federal reserve issued new rules pursuant to tila for all mortgage loans in july 2008 federal reserve implements tila through regulation z guidances issued by the financial regulatory members of the federal financial institutions examinations council ffiec help maintain prude nt lending standards for covered institutions securitization of loans originated by nonbanks however allows some mortgage lending to escape these guidances the underwriting standards of fannie mae and freddie mac regulated for safety and soundness by the federal housing finance agency fhfa could still influence underwriting standards of nonbank lenders caps on the loans they could purchase and other factors however had limited the influence of these governmentsponsoredenterprises gse underwriting standards these caps were substantially raised up to 625000 in some highcost areas by hr 3221 pl 110289 there is some evidence that the underwriting standards of nonbanks that chose to securitize loans outside of fannie mae and freddie mac became weaker as the housing boom progressed indicators of excessive debt appear to have weakened more than indicators of borrower payment history potential reforms of securitization and the nonbank lending channel

mortgage market have drawn attention to the potential for lenders to engage in imprudent underwriting during the housing boom of 20022005 many borrowers may have become overextended because their loans in hindsight were not sustainable although federal bank examiners are primarily concerned with the financial stability of the system one byproduct of their regulations may be to limit the chances that borrowers will be offered imprudent loans by regulated institutions securitization which transforms pools of loans into marketable securities may have contributed to looser underwriting standards because it creates nonbank source of mortgage funds which is outside federal bank examination nonbank mortgage originator can open line of credit to fund its lending rather than accepting deposits or raising its own capital the originator then draws down the line of credit to make loans the originator sells the mortgages to the secondary market and uses the proceeds to pay back the line of credit and extends more loans once in the secondary market the mortgages can be packaged together and held in passive trusts the trusts can then distribute the mortgage payments by prearranged formula to securities called mortgagebacked securities mbs which are purchased by investors this securitization of mortgages increased the supply of funds available for mortgage lending 1 but has also reduced regulation nothing in the nonbank mortgage originators activities triggers safety and soundness regulation by traditional federal bank examiners although disclosure rules for consumer protection are federally regulated and apply to all loans the prudence of the lenders underwriting is disciplined only by the perceived willingness of investors to purchase the loans this report discusses the network of federal mortgage regulators and the impact of securitization on prudent mortgage underwriting

mortgages securitized grew significantly increasing from 492 in 1997 to 677 in 2006 in dollar terms the value of mortgages securitized grew from 423 billion in 1997 to 2 trillion in 2006 the growth of this securitization channel may have facilitated more lending by institutions not subject to federal bank examiners although some of the increase in securitization share came from regulated banks also selling to the secondary market private securitization has since collapsedthe volume of nonagency mbs was 93 lower for the first eight months of 2008 compared with the same period in 2007 3

the absence of federal regulation of nonbanks using securitization does not necessarily mean that there is federal influence on nonbank underwriting many mortgages are securitized by government sponsored enterprises gses especially fannie mae and freddie mac lenders planning on selling their mortgages to the gses would have to conform to the underwriting standards of those institutions which are subject to safety and soundness oversight by the federal housing finance agency fhfa formerly known as the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo standards enforced by fhfa could indirectly influence the willingness of the gses lending partners to extend credit for more risky mortgages 3 calculated from monthly mbs issuance available from the securities industry and financial

limited the influence of the gses underwriting standards as the housing boom progressed first there is cap on the size of the loan that the gses are allowed to purchase called the conforming loan limit loans larger than the cap ranging from 417000 up to 615000 in some highcost areas are called jumbo loans and can only be securitized outside the gses securities from issuers other than the gses are called nonagency mbs because the housing markets in some highcost areas such as california were particularly active during the boom and mortgages in these areas are more likely to be above the cap nonagency mbs grew faster than the overall market second the gses did not enter the risky subprime market directly instead they purchased the more senior and therefore less risky securities of nonagency subprime mbs lender planning to sell to nonagency mbs issuer would be unlikely to alter underwriting standards for gse purchases of senior curities one reas on the gses purchased nonagency subprime mbs was that the department of housing and urban developments hud housing goals were rising huds housing goals mandate that the gses purchase minimum share of their mortgages for lowerincome borrowers and in underserved areas the gses received prorated credit toward their housing goals for their share in nonagency mbs in this way the gses provided additional funds to subprime markets without corresponding extension of their underwriting standards third there was relatively high proportion of refinances during the boom the decline in interest rates caused drop in the share of mortgages that were goalsqualifying for gse purchase higherincome home owners disproportionately took advantage of the opportunity to refinance this meant that relatively large mortgages which are generally not goalsqualifying grew as share of the gseeligible market as reference the share of gseeligible mortgages that were refinances in the first quarter of 1995 were 26 but the share of mortgages that were refinances in the first quarter of 2003 were 80

it is difficult to assess the underwriting standards of nonagency mbs because the information is proprietary there is some evidence however that underwriting standards loosened as the housing boom progressed the results of one study of the boom by ubs are presented in table 24 the table shows an increase in the average risk of loans underwritten in 2005 for example interestonly mortgages ios rose from 00 of subprime loans in 2000 to 265 of subprime loans in 2005 before falling back to 163 an interestonly requires reset to higher payment even if interest rates do not change other risk indicators such as debttoincome ratio dti and combinedloantovalue cltv also increased during 20012005 interestingly the primary indicator of borrower payment history the fico 5 score improved during 20002005 from 590 to 627 although it fell back to 624 in 2006 this suggests that the use of nontraditional products such as ios and debtburdens may have played as important role as the payment histories of the borrowers on the other hand improving economic conditions and rising house prices could generally improve fico scores and increase the size of loans relative to incomes even if underwriting criteria had not loosened 4 the us subprime market an industry in turmoil thomas zimmerman ubs presentation

subject to their guidance have fared much better than nonagency mbs originated by nonbanks6 on the one hand the guidances of the ffiec provided for more prudent underwriting standards and closer scrutiny of subprime loans even before the housing markets cooled off on the other hand the guidances are administered by bank examiners within an exis ting institutional framework and it is unclear how nonbank lenders would be incorporated could they be subject to examination by existing agencies and personnel or would there need to be significant changes to agency structure or staffing g6g152g561g16g152g157g145g146g151g144g561 the market has already improved underwriting standards and punished the riskiest lenders with bankruptcy and the investors in the riskiest securities with significant losses underwriting standards for nonagency mbs were essentially set by the willingness of investors to accept the estimated risk of the mortgage pools because investors rarely had detailed knowledge of the loan pools they often relied on ratings agencies to evaluate the risk while house prices were rising troubled borrower could sell the house rather than default which held down expected default rates because housing markets have slowed down and loan defaults have been rising markets have been reevaluating the risks in nonagency mb s as result mbs ratings have been falling and funding for the riskiest mortgages has already all but dried up disadvantage of taking action is that while the market has already raised current underwriting standards there is assurance that future boom and bust cycle will not be repeated 6 statement of sheila c bair chairman federal deposit insurance corporation on recent events in the credit and mortgage markets and possible

standards are unsuitable for the borrowers circumstances one advantage of this approach is that originators have direct contact with borrowers and have great deal of information about each borrowers circumstan ces relative to mbs investors or financial regulators originator liability could ensure that mortgage brokers and lenders retain stake in the longterm performance of their loans disadvantage of this approach is that suitability is difficult to define subject to significant uncertainty and litigation risk and determined only after events occur that trigger defaults

originations the advantage of this approach is that it would encourage secondary market participants to be more vigilant in monitoring the practices of mortgage brokers and lenders this approach also
