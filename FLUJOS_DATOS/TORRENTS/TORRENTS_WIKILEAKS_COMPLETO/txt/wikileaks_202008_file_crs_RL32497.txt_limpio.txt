paralympic games will be held september 17 28 in athens the parlaympics have not received the same level of attention with regard to security that the olympics have received which suggests that the

some may be concerned that terrorists might mount an attack on the paralympics wouldbe terrorists might anticipate that following an uneventful olympics security procedures would be loosened which could make an attack easier to stage additionally depending on what situations or issues including those deemed to be innocuous arise during the olympics involving for example transportation the electrical grid plumbing crowd management access points or accommodations wouldbe terrorists might be able to identify vulnerabilities in olympic venues and logistics in turn they might be able to capitalize on this information for the purpose of planning and executing an attack during the paralympics although they would have limited amount of time within which to act us involvement in security efforts the information that follows comes mostly from news accounts details about security plans and initiatives generally have not been publicized security measures could be compromised if
