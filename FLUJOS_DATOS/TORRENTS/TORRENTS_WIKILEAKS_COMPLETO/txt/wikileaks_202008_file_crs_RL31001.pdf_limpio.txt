offsetting receipts of the department inclusion of receipts would result in net outlays of 757 billion instead of gross outlays of 808 billion appropriations for fy2002 us department of agriculture and related agencies most recent developments on november 28 2001 the president signed into law the fy2002 agriculture appropriations act pl 10776 hr 2330 that provides 75902 billion in budget authority for the us department of agriculture and related agencies the total amount provided is 118 million below the senatepassed level 13 billion above the housepassed level 16 billion above the administration request and 25 billion above the enacted fy2001 level excluding fy2001 supplementals separately on september 18 2001 supplemental appropriations act pl 107 38 was signed into law providing 40 billion in emergency funding for disaster assistance to regions affected by terrorist acts and to augment antiterrorist activities the allocation of portion of these funds is yet to be determined however to date usda has received 72 million in supplemental funding for pl 480 food aid grants for afghan refugees usda spending at glance the us department of agriculture usda carries out its widely varied responsibilities through approximately 30 separate internal agencies and offices staffed by some 100000 employees usda is responsible for many activities outside of the agriculture budget function hence spending for usda is not synonymous with spendin g for farmers nor with the agriculture appropriations bill which includes funds for nonusda programs notably the food and drug administration fda usda gross outlays for fy2000 the most recently completed fiscal year for which data are available were 808 billion1 the mission area with the largest gross outlays was for farm and foreign agricultural services which totaled 372 billion or 46 of total spending within this area are the programs funded through the commodity credit corporation eg commodity support programs the conservation reserve program and certain trade programs crop insurance farm loans and foreign food aid programs another 32 billion or 40 of usda spending is for food and nutrition programs primarily the food stamp program the costliest of all usda programs various child nutrition programs and the women infants and children wic programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs2 figure 1 us department of agriculture gross outlays fy2000 fy2000 gross outlays also included 52 billion 65 spent on an array of natural resource and environment programs approximately threefourths of which was spent on the activities of the forest service and the balance for number of conservation programs for farm producers usdas forest service is funded through the interior appropriations bill and is the only usda agency not funded through the agriculture appropriations bill usda programs for rural development 205 billion in gross outlays for fy2000 research and education 198 billion marketing and regulatory activities 861 million meat and poultry inspection 645 million and departmental administrative offices and other activities 434 million account for the balance of usda spending mandatory vs discretionary spending key distinction between mandatory and discretionary spending involves how these two categories of spending are treated in the budget process congress generally controls spending on mandatory programs by setting rules for eligibility benefit formulas and other parameters rather than approving specific dollar amounts for these programs each year eligibility for mandatory programs is usually written into authorizing law and any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requireme nts is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law spending for discretionary programs is controlled by annual appropriations acts the thirteen subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees originate billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs3 each year which decide how much funding to devote to continuing current activities as well as any new discretionary programs approximately threefourths of total usda spending is classified as mandatory which by definition occurs outside of the direct control of annual appropriations eligibility for mandatory programs is usually written into authorizing law and any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law currently accounting for large portion of usda mandatory spending are the farm commodity price and income support programs which are funded through usdas commodity credit corporation ccc other separately funded mandatory programs include the food stamp program child nutrition programs and the federal crop insurance program and certain foreign trade and conservation programs although these programs have mandatory status many of these accounts ultimately receive funds in the annual agriculture appropriations act for example the food stamp and child nutrition programs are funded by an annual appropriation based on projected spending needs supplemental appropriations generally are made if and when these estimates fall short of required spending an annual appropriation also is made to reimburse the commodity credit corporation for losses it incurs in financing the commodity support programs and the various other programs it finances table 1 usda and related agencies appropriations fy1994 to fy2002 budget authority in billions of dollars fy94 fy95 fy96 fy97 fy98 fy99 fy00 fy01 fy02 discretionary

and children wic the public law pl 480 international food aid program meat and poultry inspection and food marketing and regulatory programs current fy2001 funding for all usda discretionary programs except for the forest service is provided by the fy2001 agriculture appropriations act pl 106387 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs4 agriculture and the fy2002 budget resolution the fy2002 budget resolution hconres 83 adopted by congress last may currently guides federal spending and revenue for the next 10 years the budget resolution which does not require presidential approval provides blueprint for all federal spending including agriculture the level of mandatory farm commodity support spending and mandatory agriculture conservation spending allowed by hconres 83 sets the fiscal parameter for the agriculture committees as they design the next farm bill hconres 83 as adopted increased baseline budget spending for mandatory agriculture and conservation programs by 55 billion in fy2001 and by 735 billion in fy2002 this is in addition to the baseline spending estimate of 215 billion in fy2001 and 143 billion in fy2002 for mandatory agriculture programs allowed under current law the budget resolution assumes that most of the funds will be used to provide income assistance to farmers however discretion is given to the agriculture committees to report legislation that increases spending on any mandatory programs under their jurisdiction by these amounts for fy2003fy2011 the budget resolution created reserve fund of 6615 billion over nineyear period fy20032011 for mandatory agriculture programs the reserve fund will be made available to the agriculture committees when legislation to authorize new multiyear farm bill is reported the house completed action on its version of the farm bill on october 5 2001 the availability of the reserve fund also is contingent on there being projected onbudget nonmedicare surplus to cover these new expenditures fy2001 supplemental authorization bill hr 2213 in response to the increased allocation to the agriculture committees for fy2001 granted by the fy2002 budget resolution congress completed action before the august recess on measure pl 10725 hr 2213 that provides 55 billion in fy2001 economic assistance to help agricultural producers recover from continued low farm commodity prices of the total amount provided 46 billion was to be paid directly to growers of wheat feed grains cotton and rice 4235 million to oilseed growers 542 million to peanut growers 129 million to tobacco growers 169 million to wool and mohair growers 847 million to cottonseed growers and 1594 million to specialty crop growers primarily fruits and vegetables the budget resolution requires that the funds be disbursed before the end of the fiscal year september 30 2001 earlier the senate agriculture committee had reported measure s 1246 that would have provided total farm assistance of 75 billion 55 billion in fy2001 and 2 billion in fy2002 the bill was blocked from senate floor consideration by senate republicans who felt that the spending was excessive the administration had also threatened to veto any bill that provided more than 55 billion in assistance cloture vote failed by vote of 4948 on august 3 2001 and was followed by unanimous consent agreement to accept hr 2213 as passed by the house httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs5 the 2002 farm bill and the budget the full house has passed hr 2646 and the senate agriculture committee has reported s 1731 their respective versions of an omnibus farm bill that will establish agricultural policy for multiyear period as estimated by the congressional budget office both bills would increase spending over 10 years fy20022011 by nearly the full 735 billion made available by the fy2002 budget resolution ie 735 billion in fy2002 plus the 6615 billion reserve fund allocated for fy20032011 the new 10year estimated spending of 735 billion in both bills is in addition to the 70 billion in estimated farm commodity support spending and 214 billion in mandatory conservation programs spending already allowed for fy20022011 under current law for more information see crs report rl31195 the 2002 farm bill overview and status terrorism response on september 18 2001 supplemental appropria tions act pl 10738 was signed into law providing 40 billion in emergency funding for disaster assistance to regions affected by the september 11th terrorist acts and to augment antiterrorist activities the allocation of portion of these funds is yet to be determined however to date usda has received 72 million for pl 480 food aid grants for afghan refugees according to the office of management and budget usda currently spends approximately 50 million in regular appropriations annually to combat terrorism primarily through its research and inspection agencies in an effort to prevent deter and detect biological agents and pathogens that could be used to adversely affect the us food supply the administration has requested that 517 million of the available 40 billion in supplemental funding be allocated to usda of which portion would be used to enhance security at its facilities 172 million construct research facility for bio hazardous material 141 million improve response to food supply threats and other bioterrorism protection activities 139 million separately the administration has also requested 346 million from the funds for the food and drug administration to expedite the evaluation and approval process of vaccines and biologics fy2002 agriculture appropriations action chronology administration request on april 9 2001 the administration presented its detailed budget request for all federal spending for fy2002 including spending for the us department of agriculture and related agencies for all of usda except the forest service which is funded through the interior appropriation s bill and related agencies food and drug administration and commodity futures trading commission the adminis tration requested an fy2002 appropriation of 7429 billion the requested amount is up approximately 875 million from the regular fy2001 appropriation of 73416 billion however it is about 265 billion less than the fy2001 appropriation when 36 billion in onetime emergency supplemental funding is counted the administration request does not assume the recurrence of emergency funding in fy2002 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs6 house subcommittee action on june 6 2001 the agriculture subcommittee of the house appropriations committee completed markup of the usda and related agencies appropri ations bill for fy2002 the subcommittee measure recommended an appropriation of 7440 billion including 58884 billion for usda mandatory programs and 15519 billion for discretionary programs the 15519 billion recommended by the subcommittee was equal to the allocation given to the subcommittee for discretionary programs and was 111 million above the administration request and 443 million above the regular nonemergency appropriation for fy2001 the subcommittee adopted report language stating that the committee expects usda to fund the global food for education initiative in fy2002 at the fy2001 level of 300 million using usdas commodity credit corporat ion as the funding source an amendment to require usda to fund the program was defeated out of concern that the 300 million cost of the program would be scored against the subcommittees 15519 billion allocation separate amendment to require fda to study the effects of irradiation on food was also adopted in subcommittee but was deleted by the full committee an amendment to allocate funds to combat terrorist actions against agricultural research installations was defeated by both the subcommittee and the full committee house full committee action the full house appropriations committee completed markup of the measure on june 13 2001 and subsequently reported the bill hr 2330 h rept 107116 on june 27 2001 the full committee adopted an amendment to provide 150 million in emergency assistance to apple growers who experienced loss of markets to their 2000 crop caused by either low commodity prices or production lost to natural disaster this adopted amendment increased the bill total to 7455 billion however as adopted the 150 million in emergency apple payments would not have counted towards the 15519 billion allocation for discretionary programs in the bill this emergency designation concerned fiscal conservatives who felt that such spending violated the terms of the current budget resolution thus causing delay in consideration of the bill on the house floor the emergency designation for the apple assistance was subsequen tly removed in an amendment adopted as part of the rule h res 183 for consideration of the bill and the allocation to the bill for discretionary spending was increased by 150 million an amendment to extend authority for the northeast dairy compact and authorize southern dairy compact was offered in committee and subsequently withdrawn an attempt to require usda to fund the global food for education initiative similar to the subcommittee rejected amendment was defeated in full committee emergency spending of 500 million for usda to promote biofuels research was also rejected in committee the full committee adopted an amendment to prohibit any funding for the administration of the pork checkoff program house floor action the house began floor consideration of hr 2330 on june 28 2001 before adjourning for the july 4 recess during the debate on june 28 the house adopted two separate amendments that earmark fda spending for certain purposes one adopted amendment provides an additional 25 million to expedite the consideration of generic drug applications and the other allocates an additional 5 million for research on antimicrobial resistance when floor consideration of the measure resumed on july 11 the house debated 23 additional amendments before passing the measure by vote of 41416 among the adopted amendments was provision that allows individuals to import nonnarcotic fdaapproved prescriptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs7 2the senate adopted the senatereported bill s 1191 as substitute amendment to the housepassed bill hr 2330 hence both the house and senatepassed bills are numbered as hr 2330 drugs an earlier floor amendment that would have allowed individuals and businesses to reimport drugs originally manufactured in the us was defeated also adopted on the house floor was 10 million increase in elderly nutrition programs and 54 million increase for rehabilitating aging dams both of which were offset by reductions in other usda spending attempts to eliminate mandatory emergency spending for wool and mohair producers and all spending for overseas promotion of us agricultural products through the market access program were defeated on the house floor senate committee action on july 16 2001 the agriculture subcommittee of the senate appropriations committee referred an fy2002 appropriations bill for usda and related agencies to the full senate appropriations committee without conducting formal subcommittee markup the full committee marked up the measure on july 17 2001 and reported s 1191 on july 18 only managers bloc amendment was adopted in full committee markup which made several minor changes to report language senate floor action on october 25 2001 the full senate approved the senate appropriations committeereported version of the fy2002 agriculture appropriations bill with amendments by vote of 9152 as passed the senate bill provides total appropriation of 7602 billion which is 147 billion above the housepassed bill 173 billion above the administration request and 26 billion above the regular nonemergency appropriations in fy2001 most of the difference between the senate bill and the housepassed bill and the administration request is that the house and the administration recommend mandatory spending food stamp contingency reserve of 1 billion while the senatepassed bill recommends 2 billion of the total appropriation the senate bill provides 1614 billion for discretionary programs which is 468 million above the house level of 1567 billion and 728 million above the administration request before voting on the measure the senate adopted 35 amendments in two bloc votes the first six amendments adopted bloc were all technical corrections to the committee bill language only one of the 29 amendments adopted in the second enbloc vote added to the total cost of the bill an increase of 19 billion in mandatory funding for the food stamp reserve fund from 100 million in the senate reported bill to 2 billion several of the adopted amendments increased spending in one account and offset the new spending with reductions in other accounts these included 5 million increase in funding for research at the 1890 land grant institutions offset by reductions in other research accounts 5 million increase in conservation spending to fund pilot program to monitor migratory bird harvest offset by 53 million reduction in usda inhouse research spending and 1 million increase in fda spending on dietary supplement labeling offset by like decrease in the salaries and expenses for the federal crop insurance program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs8 other senateadopted floor amendments made policy changes without affecting spending levels including postponement of the assessment required of sugar processors until september 2002 the deletion of bill language that would have prohibited the use of any funds to implement the kyoto protocol to control greenhouse gas emissions prohibition on the labeling of certain imported fish as catfish and oneyear extension through 2002 for eligibility for available disaster funding for citrus canker

areas within usda farm commodity support most spending for usdas mandatory agriculture and conservation programs is funded through usdas commodity credit corporation ccc the ccc is wholly owned government corporation it has the legal authority to borrow up to 30 billion at any one time from the us treasury these borrowed funds are used to finance the spending of ongoing programs such as farm commodity price and income support activities including annual production flexibility contract or socalled amta payment s and loan deficiency payments and various agricultural conservation and trade programs the ccc has also been the funding source for ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs9 large portion of emergency supplemental spending over the years particularly for ad hoc farm disaster payments and direct market loss payments to growers of various commodities which have been provided in response to low farm commodity prices the ccc must eventually repay the funds it borrows from the treasury but because the ccc never earns more than it spends its losses must be replenished periodically through congressional appropriation so that its 30 billion borrowing authority debt limit is not depleted which would render the corporation unable to function congress generally provides this infusion through the regular annual usda appropriation law because of the degree of difficulty in estimating its funding needs which is complicated by crop and weather conditions and other uncontrollable variables the ccc in recent years has received current indefinite appropriation which in effect allows the ccc to receive such sums as are necessary during the fiscal year for previous years losses and current years losses indefinite appropriations have become more common for the ccc in recent years particularly in fy2000 when ccc net outlays in that year totaled 32 billion without an indefinite appropriation the ccc would have exhausted its 30 billion borrowing limit the administration estimates that the ccc will require an appropriation of 231 billion in fy2002 compared with 253 billion in fy2001 pl 10776 concurs with the request general provision in pl 10776 extends the authority for the dairy price support program through may 31 2002 at the current level of support neither version of the bill contained this provision the program was slated to expire at the end of 2001 multiyear extension is being considered along with other farm commodity programs in the context of the pending omnibus farm bill versions of which have passed the house hr 2646 and have been reported in the senate s 1731 pl 10776 also provides 75 million in market loss assistance to apple growers to help them recover from low market prices the senatepassed version contained 150 million in assistance the housepassed version contained assistance crop insurance the federal crop insurance program is administered by usdas risk management agency rma it offers basically free catastrophic insurance to producers who grow an insurable crop producers who opt for this coverage have the opportunity to purchase additional insurance coverage at subsidized rate most policies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insurance companies that have their program losses reinsured by usda the annual agriculture appropriations bill makes two separate appropriations for the federal crop insurance program it provides discretionary funding for the salaries and expenses of the rma it also provides such sums as are necessary for the federal crop insurance fund which funds all other expenses of the program including premium subsidies indemnity payments and reimbursements to the private insurance companies for fy2002 pl 10776 concurs with the administration request for 74752 million for the fy2002 salaries and expenses of the rma the only discretionary component of the federal crop insurance program this funding level is 93 million above the fy2001 appropriation of 6545 million most of the additional fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs10 is requested for improvements in information technology systems the senatepassed bill would have provided 1 million less than the request to offset an increase in fda spending for product labeling of dietary supplements for mandatory expenses of the crop insurance program premium subsidy program losses and reimbursements to private insurance companies the administration estimates an fy2002 appropriation of 304 billion which is 232 million above its fy2001 estimate of 280 billion pl 10776 concurs with this estimate and provides such sums as may be necessary the act includes house provision that reduces from 10 million to 36 million the available fy2002 mandatory funding for crop insurance education and information program s as an offset for new conservation spending on the repair of watershed dams pl 10776 also includes senate provision that requires usda to provide similar insurance coverage for sweet potatoes as other potatoes total estimated fy2001 and fy2002 crop insurance spending is significantly higher than the actual mandatory spending of 23 billion in fy2000 primarily because of major legislative changes made to the program in 2000 in pl 106224 which became effective in the 2001 crop year this legislation provided an additional 82 billion in new mandatory spending to the crop insurance program over 5 years fy20012005 primarily in the form of additional premium subsidy to participating farmers for more information on the crop insurance legislation see crs report rl30739 federal crop insurance and the agriculture risk protection act of 2000 pl 106224 farm service agency while the commodity credit corporation serves as the funding mechanism for the farm income support and disaster assistance programs the administration of these and other farmer programs is charged to usdas farm service agency fsa in addition to the commodity support programs and most of the emergency assistance provided in recent supplemental spending bills fsa also administers usdas direct and guaranteed farm loan programs certain conservation programs and domestic and international food assistance and international export credit programs fsa salaries and expenses this account funds the administrative expenses for program administration and other functions assigned to the fsa these funds consist of appropriations and transfers from ccc export credit guarantees from pl 480 loans and from the various direct and guaranteed farm loan programs all administrative funds used by fsa are consolidated into one account pl 10776 concurs with the administration request and the senatepassed level for an appropriation of 939 million for farm service agency salaries and expenses for fy2002 in fy2001 fsa received regular appropriation of 8266 million and subsequent supplemental of 50 million to hire additional employees to administer the agencys implementation of disaster payments and other emergency farm assistance programs the amount provided by pl 10776 for fy2002 reflects the continued need for employing additional temporary staff not included in the appropriation is an ongoing transfer of 276 million to fsa salaries and expenses from various export and farm credit program accounts that are administered by fsa httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs11 fsa farm loan programs through fsa farm loan programs usda serves as lender of last resort for family farmers unable to obtain credit from commercial lender usda provides direct farm loans and also guarantees the timely repayment of principal and interest on qualified loans to farmers from commercial lenders fsa farm loans are used to finance the purchase of farm real estate help producers meet their operating expense s and financially recover from natural disasters some of the loans are made at subsidized interest rate an appropriation is made to fsa each year to cover the federal cost of making direct and guaranteed loans referred to as loan subsidy loan subsidy is directly related to any interest rate subsidy provided by the government as well as projection of anticipated loan losses caused by farmer

breeders with losses caused by mare reproductive loss syndrome to be eligible for fsa emergency disaster loans in fy2001 regular appropriation of 117 million was made to support 309 billion in total farm loans however the fy2001 loan authority was supplemented by an emergency appropriation which when combined with the regular fy2001 appropriation was expected to result in total fy2001 loan volume of 425 billion contributing to the need for supplemental funding were widespread natural disasters and the continued weak state of the farm economy which caused more farmers to qualify for federal credit programs agricultural trade and food aid for the international activities of usda that are funded through annual appropriations discretionary programs pl 10776 provides fy2002 budget authority of 1124 billion most of this goes to fund pl 480 foreign food aid this amount is slightly higher than the fy2001 enacted amount and the presidents budget request both of approximately 109 billion many of usdas international programs are not subject to direct annual appropriations but are funded through the borrowing authority of usdas commodity credit corporatio n ccc these mandatory programs include export credit guarantees export subsidies export market development and foreign food aid programs other than pl 480 discr etionary programs within the 1124 billion for discretionary programs pl 10776 provides budget authority of 9986 for pl 480 food for peace programs normally the main channel for us foreign food aid and the largest appropriated international usda program the fy2001 level

export credit programs loan subsidy costs of export credit guarantees are provided through permanent indefinite appropriation and not by an annual appropriation the actual level of credit guarantees will depend on market conditions and the demand for export financing two other cccfunded programs help to develop markets for agricultural exports for the market access program map the administration estimates spending of 90 million the maximum allowed under the 1996 farm law map has been frequent but unsuccessful target of budget cutters who label it corporate welfare and of some members in search of funds to offset increased spending for other programs house floor amendment that would have prohibited any map funding in fy2002 was defeated by vote of 85341 the foreign market development cooperator program fmdp would require outlays of 28 million in fy2002 both the housepassed farm bill hr 2646 and the senate agriculture committee reported version of the bill s 1731 would increase funding for both of these export market development programs the export enhancement program eep and the dairy export incentive program deip also funded through the ccc are usdas only current direct export subsidy programs the administration proposed eep spending at 478 million the maximum authorized in the 1996 farm law and under the world trade organization wto agreement on agriculture however usda has used minimal eep funds in recent years only 1 million in fy2000 and 69 million in fy2001 because according to usda global supply and demand conditions do not favor its use proposals have been made to divert unused eep funding authorizations to other export programs notably to map and fmdp if their funding authority is increased as proposed see above for deip the administration proposed program level of 42 million an increase from the current fy2001 estimate of 32 million this level of deip reflects limits imposed by wto commitments an end to the rollover authority in the wto agricultural agreeme nt which allowed countries to draw on unused subsidy authority from previous years and improved world market conditions for skim milk powder the senate appropriations committee report indicates that it expects thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs13 administration to use fully its deip authority further it expresses its concern that the program has lost substantial percentage of its wtopermitted tonnage every year because not all foreign sales of deipawarded export sales are completed due to buyer cancellations and other factors the report directs usda to prepare plan to ensure that all lost tonnage be reallocated during the applicable export year so that it is not lost due to the wto provision ending rollover authority in other report language the senate committee directs fas to increase its efforts to educate foreign trading partners regarding the safety of biotechnology and the thoroughness of the us regulatory oversight of biotechnology section 416b commodity donations and food aid provided under the food for progress ffp program are also cccfunded the administration notes that for section 416b commodity donations to private voluntary organizations and foreign governments the level of programming in fy2002 will be determined based on availability of uncommited ccc commodity inventory section 416b donations were valued at more than 565 million in fy2001 commodity value only allocations of commodities under section 416b could augment the fy2002 program level and outlays for international activities ffp which provides us farm commodities to developing countries and emerging democracies would require an estimated 94 million in fy2002 all of section 416b and much of ffp are funded by the ccc pl 10776 requires that up to 25 million worth of section 416 tonnage be made available to foreign countries to mitigate the effects of hiv and aids on communities and families in another area pl 10776 allows 4 million for the congressional hunger centers emersonleland hunger fellowships the house appropriations committee directs usda to make decisions about foreign commodity donations by february 15 of each year the house committee also directs the department as it reviews international commodity assistance to take into account the committees beliefs that commodity assistance is prudent way to help move commodities that are in surplus and urgently needed meanwhile senate committee report languag emphasizes that the us agency for international development us aid should ensure that more pl 480title ii resources are directed toward development programs that address chronic hunger and its root causes in areas with inadequate food security the 1996 farm law generally requires that minimum of threefourths of tonnage under title ii which authorizes commodity donations for humanitarian and development aid be used for addressing chronic hunger and food security problems goal that the committee report in effect underscores other senate report language urges usda to continue to emphasize purchases of valueadded rice for food aid the conference report to pl 10776 urges the secretary of agriculture in the strongest possible terms to use available authorities to continue global food for education initiative begun in fy2000 during fy2002 an unsuccessful subcommittee and full committee amendment to the house version of the fy2002 agriculture appropriations bill would have required usda to fund the second year of this pilot international food for education program at the fy2001 cccfunded level of 300 million instead of the bill amendment the subcommittee included in report language that it expects the administration to fund the program in fy2002 at 300 million opponents to the amendment to require funding were concerned that the 300 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs14 would be scored towards the subcommittees allocation for discretionary spending which would have required comparable offset in order to stay within budget senate report language also expresses support for the initiative both the housepassed farm bill hr 2646 and the trade title of the senate agriculture

ib98006 agricul tural export and food aid programs and crs issue brief ib10077 agricultural trade issues in the 107th congress conservation and environment discretionary programs pl 10776 provides 9621 million for discretionary usda conservation programs this amount is less than the senate passed version 9854 million and more than the housepassed version 9090 million the discretionary conservation funding in pl 10776 is greater than both the 9286 million requested by the administration and the fy2001 total of 9071 million the house total does not include 45 million rescission for the agricultural conservation program cost sharing program which was terminated by the 1996 farm bill the conference committee rejected this proposal almost all discretionary conservation funding is administered by the natural resources conservation service for the core technical assistance effort the conservation operations program pl 10776 provides 7790 million which is less than would have been provided by either the senate 8075 million or the house 7828 million these amounts are all higher than the administration request of 7735 million and the fy2001 appropriated level of 7125 million using conservation operations funds to provide technical assistance in support of the conservation reserve program crp has been contentious because it has reduced the funds available for other programs and activities the crp is mandatory program that allows eligible farmers to retire from production highly erodible and environmentally sensitive farmland and in return receive technical assistance and annual rental payments to establish and maintain permanent vegetative cover pl 10776 concurs with solution approved by the senate to allow the secretary to transfer to the crp up to 13 million from the environmental quality incentive program eqip mandatory conservation costsharing program it rejects another senate solution that would have applied up to 18 million in savings from limiting enrollment in specified components of the crp as well as the solutions proposed by the administration and the house the conference committee did not comment on most of the numerous conservation operations earmarks identified in both the house and senate committee reports the final act does provide 215 million for the grazing land conservation initiative which splits the difference between the house bill 200 million and the senate bill 230 million conferees also added report language for 4 earmarks httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs15 pl 10776 provides funding levels for other conservation line items that are at least at the level of the lower of the two chambers these amounts and the approved levels in both chambers the administration request and the fy2001 funding levels include 110 million for watershed surveys and planning the same as approved by both chambers and in the administration request and an increase from 108 million in fy2001 1066 million for watershed projects the senate approved the administrationrequested amount of 1004 million while the house provided 1111 million all of these amounts are greater than 992 million in fy2001 480 million for the resource conservation and development program the same as the senate approved and slightly below the 484 million that the house approved but large increase from both the administration request of 439 million and the 419 million in fy2001 and 68 million for the forestry incentive program 1 million less than the senate level while the house endorsed the administra tion proposal by providing funding the clinton administration had made the same proposal the three preceding years the senate and house both included numerous earmarks in their versions of the bills especially in the watershed operations portion pl 10776 includes 455 million limitation on technical assistance under the watershed and flood prevention operations program it also concurs with the senate by adding new separate line item for rehabilitating aging watershed projects and providing 10 million the house had sought to provide new budget authority of 54 million within watershed operations for rehabilitation the conference agreement includes report language for the resource conservation and development program to fund as many applications as possible also pl 10776 provides new funding for emergency programs although it does earmark small amount to arkansas to complete project from available emergency funds the administration had not requested funding for any of the emergency conservation programs which would have been replaced by proposed governmentwide national emergency reserve that could be tapped for these and other government emergencies neither chamber acted on the reserve proposal and do not provide any funding for emergency agricultural conservation programs mandatory programs for the mandatory conservation programs that are funded through the borrowing authority of the commodity credit corporation and not subject to annual appropriations the administration proposal did not assume the recurrence of the several single year increases provided in fy2001 under various emergency supplemental measures conservation advocates had sought increases for these programs for several years and the clinton administration and congress both supported them in fy2001 probably because of the emerging budget surplus and because some of these programs had reached their mandated enrollment or funding caps set in the 1996 farm bill the bush administration proposed new funding for these programs rather than sustaining them at higher but unauthorized levelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs16 supporters of these programs have characteriz ed the administration proposals as reductions pl 10776 endorses positions approved by both the house and senate to provide additional funding for these programs beyond authorized levels in fy2002 the mandatory programs that have already reached their authorized enrollment or funding caps include the wetlands reserve program capped at 1075000 acres the wildlife habitat incentives program capped at 50 million and the farmland protection program capped at 35 million pl 10776 contains general provision to prohibit the use of any funds to implement fourth mandatory program the conservation farm option for which the

appropriations acts including fy2001 subsequently for fy2001 congress provided additional eqip funding of 46 million pl 10776 provides full funding for fy2002 but allows the secretary to transfer up to 13 million of that amount for technical assistance to implement the crp as mentioned above the administration had proposed to fund eqip at 174 million in fy2002 but both chambers supported full funding the senate bill would have allowed up to 26 million to be applied to technical assistance to implement the crp future funding for eqip and all other mandatory conservation programs will be

children wic and several commodity donation programs the administration request for fy2002 was 252 billion or 74 higher than estimated budget authority for these programs for fy2001 budget authority in pl 10776 for these programs is 372 billion or about 11 higher than fy2001 food stamps the food stamp program is the largest of the domestic food assistance programs pl 10776 funds this program at total of 2299 billion for fy2002 the same amount proposed by the senate and 1 billion more than the administration request and house proposal this reflects 287 billion increase above the fy2001 level and includes food stamp reserve fund of 2 billion as compared to the 100 million reserve for fy2001 and 1 billion reserve proposed by the house and administration also included in the food stamp appropriations are funds for the cost of food benefits to food stamp participants employment and training administrative costs funding to buy commodities for the emergency food assistance program efap and nutrition assistance for puerto rico which is an alternative to the food stamp program the 1956 billion for food stamp expenses in pl 10776 reflects projections of modest food price inflation and participation growth of 800000 for an estimated total of 184 million participants in fy2002 this amount also includes funding for the food distribution program on indian reservations fdpir which is an alternative to food stamps on or near indian reservations pl 10776 also includes additional funding from the food stamp appropriation up to 3 million to buy bison meat for the fdpir additional funding is also provided for food stamp reserve fund 2 billion to be used if participation exceeds projected estimates for nutrition assistance for puerto rico 134 billion and to buy commodities for the efap 100 million the 134 billion for nutrition assistance for puerto rico is slightly more than the fy2001 level of 1301 billion funding to buy efap commodities is provided at the same level as fy2001 for background information see crs report 9859 food stamps background and funding child nutrition programs the housepassed bill concurred with the administration recommendation for budget authority of 10088 billion for child nutrition programs for fy2002 55 increase from the fy2001 level the conferees agreed to the slightly lower 10087 billion amount in the senatepassed bill the fy2002 funding levels anticipate projected inflation adjustments to meal reimbursements and program participation shifts and do not reflect some 400 million worth of commodities provided to child nutrition programs at charge from section 32 surplus purchases and cccheld stocks major program changes are envisioned conferees agreed to fund new program entitled school lunch program integrity at 2 million in fy2002 but as part of the food program administration account rather than as part of child nutrition appropriation as proposed by the househttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs24 4 there is nocommodity assistance program authorized by statute rather it is name used by appropriators to represent two separately authorized programs the csfp and efap 5 this puts into statute explicit authority for program activities funded for fy2001 through the commodi ty credit corporation and initiated in january 2001 by the clinton administrationpl 10776 also provides 500000 for school breakfast startup program in the state of wisconsin the pilot project with the alisal union school district in salinas california that combines school lunch and summer food service administration is continued and conferenc report language directs the usda fns to clarify guidance materials issued on buy american with respect to procurement for more background see crs report 9825 child nutrition programs background and funding wic program pl 10776 includes wic program funding of 4348 billion for fy2002 this is approximately 211 million more than the housepassed bill and administration recommendation and 101 million more than the senatepassed bill the amount requested by the administration assumed carryover of 100 million in fy2001 unspent funds and was projected by usda to cover the cost of food price inflation and maintain average monthly participation of 725 million women infants and children the same level as in fy2001 the amount in pl 10776 is approximately 305 million more than fy2001 funding conferees agreed to require the secretary to obligate 10 million for the farmers market nutrition program within 45 days of enactment and up to an additional 15 million to this program if the secretary determines the such funds are not needed to meet wic caseload requirements the farmers market is authorized under the wic statute and makes available federal funds of up to 20 per wic participant per year to be used to buy fresh foods at farmers markets the housepassed bill had permitted the secretary to obligate up to 25 million for the farmers market program the senate had required the secretary to obligate 20 million the house bill also directed 15 million of wic funds not needed to maintain the current caseload be used to carry out activities under new senior farmers market program this program was not authorized by statute but was initiated by the clinton administration in january 2001 it was funded using commodity credit corporation funds and awarded 15 million in grant funds to states to assist lowincome seniors buy fresh produce from farmers markets concerned that this program would not be continued the committee decided to use wic funds not needed to maintain caseload to continue it conferees rejected the house proposal to provide up to 15 million of wic funds for senior farmers market program but did require that 10 million of funds appropriated for commodity assistance programs see below be used for this purpose commodity assistance program pl 10776 provides total of 1528 million the house recommended level for the commodity assistance program this is title in appropriations bills that includes the commodity supplemental food program csfp and the emergency food assistance program efap4 pl 107 76 adds new program to the mix by requiring that 10 million instead of the 15 million proposed by the house be used to fund senior farmers market activities5 it also specifies that 208 million of the appropriated amount be used for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs25 administrative costs of operating the csfp there is specification as to how much of the remainder 12199 million should be used to buy commodities for the csfp or to make grants to states for the administrative costs of the efap however this balance is 27 million more than the 1192 million in fy2001 estimated budget authority for these two programs 742 million for csfp commodity and 45 million for efap administrative grants pl 10776 is silent on proposals in both the house and senatepassed bills that raised funding for efap administrative grants from 45 to 50 million such an increase would require some reduction in fy2001 budget authority for csfp commodity purchases because of the earmarks for the senior farmers market program and csfp administrative funding the conferees agreed to rescind 33 million from unobligated csfp balances available at the beginning of fy2002 instead of the 53 million proposed by the administration and senate food donation programs other commodity distribution programs the pacific island assistance pia program and the nutrition program for the elderly npe will receive total of 15075 million under the conference agreement this is the same amount provided for these programs for fy2001 it reflects the administration request and senate proposed level but is less than the level in the housepassed bill which would have increased funding for the elderly nutrition program by 10 million above fy2001 under an amendment adopted during floor debate reportedly the new spending in the housepassed bill was to have been offset by similar reduction in spending for agriculture buildings and facilities and rental payments of the lower amount agreed to by the conferees 108 million is for the pia program and 14967 million for the nutrition program for the elderly which distributes commodities or cashinlieu of commodities for program serving meals to senior citizens food and drug administration overview the food and

agency decides to finalize its january 2001 draft guidance on the voluntary labeling of bioengineered foods and wants the agency to publish expeditiously final version of this draft guidance the conferees provided 1 million from food safety funds to be used to analyze risks associated with biotech foods and develop criteria for evaluating the safety of these foods in animal feed it also directs the agency to fund efforts to educate foreign governments on the safety of biotechnology for more information see crs report rl30198 food biotechnology in the united states science regulation and issues the conference agreement also asked the agency to meet with stakeholders early in the process of developing petitions to irradiate foods to speed up the review of petitions once they are submitted and to ensure that labeling on irradiated foods can be understood by the general public consistent with this interest the confereeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs27 directed fda to report to the appropriations committees by february 1 2002 on the results of focus groups recommendations on irradiated food labeling and how these recommendations will be integrated into final decisions the conferees declined to earmark 250000 for fda food labeling activities instead they want food import inspections to be given higher priority on the agencys inspection agenda the conferees expressed concern over the agencys lack of enforcement of standards of identity for milk protein concentrates in standardized cheese the committee noted that gao had uncovered sharp increase in concent rated milk protein imports that may not meet fdas regulatory standards to address this concern the conferees asked the agency to report to congress by may 1 2002 on how it is enforcing these standards of identity on milk protein used in cheese the conferees also noted that fda consider petition requesting new standard of identity for yogurt and asks that the agency report on the petitions status by june 1 2002 in 1999 the general accounting office report on dietary supplements said that the adverse event reporting aer system used by fda to monitor the safety of dietary supplements needed improvement more recently the office of the inspector general within hhs made similar recommendation regarding the aer system as well to address these concerns the conferees directed the fda to follow the recommendati ons made by these reports as part of the agencys overall plan to consolidate and improve its adverse reaction reporting systems and required the agency to use 15 million to strengthen its data collection aers for dietary supplements the conferees added 1 million to be used by the agency to continue collaboration with the national center for natural products research in oxford mississippi to review botanical ingredients in dietary supplements also the conference agreement added 500000 for fda to enhance enforcement of statutory requirements related to the enforcement of product labeling of dietary supplements recognizing that some individuals with latex allergies can suffer an allergic reaction when they come in contact with food that has been prepared by handlers wearing latex gloves the conferees encourage fda to add latex to its list of food allergies and to report back to the committee in 9 months on the incidence of latex allergies related to food handling how fda is monitoring the situation and how it plans to eliminate exposure to latex from gloves used in food handling if needed the report also encourages fda to promulgate regulation s to prevent cross contamination of food by undeclared food allergens and to report how they will address these concerns in report to the appropr iations committees by march 1 2002 drug issues the conference rejected house amendment offered by representative gutknecht and included within the house appropriations bill that would have allowed consumers either in person or by mail to import fdaapproved drugs made in fdaapproved facilities into the united states for personal use for more detailed discussion on the drug reimportation issue see crs report rs20996 prescription drugs importation for personal use httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs28 the conference committee recognized that the timely approval of generic drugs is an important factor in addressing the rising cost of prescription drugs as such the committee provided an increase of 25 million above the fy 2001 level 154 million for the generic drugs program and generic drug education this amount included 250000 increase for generic drug education activities for total of 400000 for generic drug public education campaign the conferees directed the office of generic drugs to allocate 1 million to monitor the listing of drug patents in the approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations also known as the orange book to strongly encourage fda to make safe and effective animal drugs available the conferees urge the agency to review animal drug applications in timely efficient manner to meet statutory time frames for their review and to report to the appropriations committees prior to the fy2003 appropriations hearings on its completed reviews the conferees also expect the agency to produce detailed report by may 1 2002 on how its funding has supported activities of the national antimicrobial resistance monitoring system narms the report must include detail on how fda funds are allocated to narms its activities and overhead costs and address the interagency agreements and interactions with nongovernmental institutions which support narms activities for more information see crs report rl30814 antimicrobial resistance an emerging public health issue the conferees were concerned that fda does not pay enough attention to genderbased research and that number of drugs recently withdrawn from the market for safety reasons have had disproportionate impact on women in response the committee directed the fda to develop an agency wide database system focused on womens health activities to include demographic data on clinical trials they also want the agency to begin capability assessment for each of its main centers and the office of the commissioner this assessment will review currently available critical clinical trial databases coordinate data collection and identify areas where data gaps exist to achieve these goals the conferees allocated 500000 to the office of womens health and directed the agency to submit report by june 3 2002 on the current pilot program and on the capability assessment the conference agreement included 132 million for the orphan products grants program 1 million increase over fy2001 the grants program was authorized under the orphan drug act which congress enacted in 1983 to provide drug companies with tax and marketing incentives to develop drugs to treat rare diseases of the 1 million increase for the grants program the conferees agreed that 850000 should be directed towards grants and 150000 for administrative expenses the conference agreement requires that fda submit report by july 1 2002 addressing whether the agencys policies governing the dissemination of information about offlabel ie nonfda approved drug use violate the first amendment ie infringement of free speech and what actions it has taken to address these policieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs29 biologics issues the conference committee agreed to 500000 increase to the center for biologics evaluation and research so that it could modify its gene therapy system to meet congressional intent to track individual patients health status in the short and long term also the committee directed fda to submit quarterly reports to the appropriations committees on the establishment of new tracking system concerned about the safety of blood products and that fda never finalized its proposed rule to require manufacturer tracking the committee urged the agency to complete implementation of this blood product safety mechanism for years congress has been concerned about the transmission of creutzfeldt jakob disease cjd and its related nonhuman counterpart mad cow disease processing multiple tissues from multiple donors could pose substantial risk of transmitting cjd to patients receiving tissue transplants pooling or batch processing could also result in the transmission of other diseases recently fda has proposed new rules for tissue processing that would prohibit the pooling of tissue from multiple donors but allow for waivers under certain circumstances the conferees felt that the agency should only grant waivers from the pooling prohibition if it would be shown that the products are safe and potent as tissue products that have been processed without pooling the conference committee urged fda to encourage medical innovation and to use balanced sciencebased process to evaluate applications for waivers also the committee directed fda to provide the appropriations committees with quarterly reports on the status of such waivers medical devices congress has been concerned for years about high rupture rate of silicone breast implants and fdas past decision to allow the marketing of saline filled implants in previous years congress has directed the agency to monitor breast implant manufacturers patient information brochures informed consent documents and package inserts to be sure that the information they contain is medically accurate the conferees asked fda to work with manufacturers to ensure that women receive full and accurate information before enrolling in any study or undergoing implant surgery congress is also concerned that the slow rate of review for new medical devices is having negative impact on the health of americans as remedy the conferees agreed to an increase of 139 million to fund fdas device and radiological health program areas an amount the committee feels is consistent with agency estimates for bringing review times within statutory requirements congress has expressed concern that some reprocessors of medical devices are obtaining the devices they collect for reprocessing by sorting through medical waste as an enforcement remedy the conferees directed the fda to take appropriate enforcement actions against businesses that use inappropriate and unsanitary methods to procure used devices it also wants the agency to make sure that all reprocessors are aware of which collection methods it considers appropriate and sanitary also thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31001crs30 committee urged the fda to require premarket submission for each model of device that is to be reprocessed if an application was required for the original device buildings and facilities the conference agreement provided 343 million for buildings and facilities of which 23 million is to be used to complete construction of the fda laboratory in angeles the conferees denied funding for any closures or relocation of fda offices in st louis missouri and denied funds to be used to reduce staff levels at fda offices in michigan or to reassign employees in
