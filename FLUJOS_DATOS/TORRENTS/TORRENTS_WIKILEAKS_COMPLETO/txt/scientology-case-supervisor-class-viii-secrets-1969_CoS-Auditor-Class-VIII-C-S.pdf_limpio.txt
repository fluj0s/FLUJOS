hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 12 august 1969 confidential class viii only case sup ervisor actions the following are basic case super visor actions it is to be noted symptoms are double lettered aa bb and the directions to auditors are numbered 1 2 3 when more than one direction applies to symptom letter is added lb in the future if related symptom is added it will go to triple letter for the same class bbb jjj in the future for triple letter direction will be numbered as hundreds bbb 200 bbb 200 thus to have system which can expand and be refined which can be charted and boxed chart can be drawn up of symptoms this chart gives the numbers for directions to save himself from writing the case super visor can get the slips run off separately in quantity these slips can be packaged in envelopes or go into covered wooden box with 80100 pigeon holes the door closes over the holes the chart is on the inside of the door the whole thing can be padlocked the pattern is that of flag locker in which signal flags are kept each pigeon hole is numbered the cs then simply looks on his chart deals out of the cs locker number of slips staples them puts on auditor and pc uses time and date stamp and he is very much in business the cs does not issue the symptoms in folders only the directions his comments to the auditor can be made on blank sheet stapled in front of the separate slips he then has his locker he has an independent copy of this hcob for separate reference he will have his chart his only real problem is how to keep himself supplied with slips of directions it is probably best to cut these all of piece on mimeo stencils and get them run off in batches standard grade s are not part of this setup as it is understood that the auditor knows these directions to do standard grade s are written on the blank sheet the standard dianetic case supe rvisor actions and dianetic remedies have been added as
