r210 and r212 lecture given on 8 january 1963 thank you well how are you tonight audience fine im glad to see you again i arrived just in time to save you from fate worse than auditing all right this is the what audience 8 january ad 13 eight january ad 13 the saint hill special briefing course lecture number one the year started out beautifully for days i received nothing but good news on new years day i had oh i think there must have been six or eight telexes nothing but good news you know the most good news id ever seen the next day of good news next day i think then the fatal fifth arrived and we dont knowbut what that isnt good news too and before i get on with this lecture where i have something important to say ill take up the us government the story is very very briefly told ive got it all in now and all the returns are in and the casualties have been counted but in august i wrote kennedy he was offered by at that time help in the space race speeding up the iq straightening out pilots and this the white house has already asked us twice for presentations of scientology and weve granted them and they have done weird things like fire the fellow who asked for them and that sort of thing but actually the president of mit himself was fired i think for trying to suggest thatat least it was within the same twentyfourhour period and anyway in august thinking that it would be good gesture i wrote him letter concerning this at the white house and time rolled along and the fda suddenly became very interested and the organization was sniffing around the corners and suddenly the us governmentlets not compartment this thing down see its just the governmentissued smear campaign in the washington press calling us all sorts of hard names organized this thing completely down to the last detail and actually the papers were on the streets before anybody appeared at the organization interesting isnt it hours later somebody appeared at the organization anyway they raided church and seized philosophical and religious texts for burning and meters armed raid on church stop and think about it for moment how could they get away with this howd they do this well the way they did this was lie to federal court and theyre in trouble today are they in trouble man they didnt tell the right name of the organization to the court and so got warrant but there is doubt about who issued the warrant it says right there the president of the united states issued the warrant says so right on the warrant and they didnt tell the federal court who the warrant was for they said it was for the distribution center and the hubbard guidance center and the academy of scientology the premises of which are all rented by and under the name of the founding church of scientology of washington dc and they avoided the mention of books so in the papers church was raided books were seized not in the papers so they carefully corral this and they broke into the organization and actually made quite mess of things they burst into sessions and snatched emeters off the auditing desks and they just had themselves ball they got down to the dci by that time somebody in hco said do you realize that youre raiding church and this kind of slowed them down and they got down to dci and bucked into anton and he was wearing his cross that day and they got much calmer in fact they got awful quiet and they came in like lion and they went out kind of tiptoeing they knew theyd collided with something and they figured there would be repercussions of course there will be repercussions the immediate thing that itwill happentheres supposed to bewere supposed to go to court to claim our property and give reasons why and actually this is very easy action to win the warrant is false all of the titles seized almost without exception predate the emeter and they cant connect the emeter and these titles because the emeter wasnt even in existence at the time of most of theselike dianetics evolution of science furthermore theyre dianetic titles and scientology is practiced at the church these things are very easy to win this thingd be handsdown our new york attorneys say crashcrash all we ought to do is go in and grab the property and so forth but our washington attorneys say we had better use this to unseat the current administration so theyre not going to fight on the court day of the twentyfourth theyre going to delay that and thebunch of ads are being placed in newspapers in the bible belt giving the salient dates and data which i have just got through giving you kennedy isnt in much trouble you see and today something was mailed to congress which is just reconvening every congressmanssenator i think the program said would receive statement by saying i would like to have meeting with president kennedy because im sure that we could settle our religious differences and that anyway it may be very well we may even make them scientologists i frankly was getting worried you know wed been ignored too long here we are sawing away at the very foundations of man is mudman is an animal you see chipping away at the sacredity of psychology and things like this you know and nobody paying any attention at all sooner or later was going to break someplace i didnt however expect it to break on the note of complete insanity and it couldnt have broken on better note theyi dont think they did one thing right see once they got the error rolling they really did it up well and theyll probably be hearing about this for years well anyhow the main danger of it is that we get very fixated on the us government frankly it isnt big enough target to be worried about and we spend great deal of time working sweating slaving trying to push over the government when as matter of fact its halfway over on its back the thing which we should do is to of course get on with the job of good processing and so forth and theres where we have it made not fighting the government the governmentthe government turns out to be its own worst oppterm but i thinki think maybe if few of the guys and i were holding war council over in my office at 1927 trying to figure out something to get the government to do that would call some attention to scientology i think this suggestion probably would have been offered and we probably would have polished it up and i dont think we could have done better job than the government did off its own little bat so there we are now actually auditor organization nothing is threatened they didntthey didnt threaten anybody and as far as thats concerned warrants were issued for anybody nothing like that see they did just halfa halfdelirious job and did it halfway andstrictly straitjacket stuff so anyway the organizations going on as usual everythings going on as usual except those kids over there are doing meterless auditing right at the present moment im sure few of them were smart enough although they havent put it on the wires because theyre afraid itd be inspectedim sure few of them were smart enough to have their meter parked underneath their deskor left home that day and im sure there are meters around actually theres quite stock of old 57 meters and i imagine those things you canyou can read rock slam on one of those you know so anyway thats the sad story now lets get on with something important you have been wrestling around now with routine 212 and this is lecture on 210 and 212 and show you what raids of that sort of thing do they actually just slow down technology i have bulletin on my desk right now which is oneabout halfwritten on very fast simple routine 2 10 and you need it but heres the gist of the situation on 212 i put it in your hands youve been wrestling with it you find out what its doing what it cant do what are the difficulties with it and some of you have had considerable success with it its very very good success youve had with it and some of you have had moderate success and some of you have darn near chewed the pc to pieces with it and some of you have almost spun in on it this is very varied set of results from one process now its quite important that process not give varied set of results so ive been taking complications out of this whole technology that youre doing watching the mistakes youve been making apprehensions and misapprehensions about it and have been boiling it downboiling it down to its essentials and giving you far more indicators when you see this why this is true and when you see that that is true not leaving it up to any kind of decision on the part of the auditor he just seeshe sees the needle is acting this way and therefore he does soandso thisthis is much easier to learn now before you go into eight thousand nine hundred and sixtyseven questions all of which are based on complicated comprehension of routines 210 and 212 let give you dissertation on the simple pure version of what this came from okay all right the basis of this technology is as follows you do list and this is not as it was this is as it isyou do list you dont take list see you do listthis is the pure technologyand get that down to point where only one rs is seen on nulling only one rs on the list on nulling if you had more than one rs on the list on nulling your list is incomplete now what do we mean tiger drilled just seen the first time you go over it you call an item off if its going to rs itll rs and thats all there is to that you got that as step you take list list notyou dont take an arbitrary list you take list question and having taken this list question you complete it and having found the item that that list completes to you oppose it properly now you could oppose it two ways in view of the fact that you make mistakes in oppositionand you do most any of your long lists comes from mistaken right way to or wrong way to such as who or what would catfish oppose when it should have been who or what would oppose catfishthose are your long lists why just list it both ways just list it both ways for page just page and notice which one the needle was stiffer than the other on in other words youd list who or what would catfish oppose and noting the character of the needle and tone armtone arm plays very little part in thisand then turn your page over and list who or what would oppose catfish for page and who or what would oppose catfish gives you looser needle than who or what would catfish oppose the wrong way to always gives you stiff jerky needle and the further you go on wrong list the more the pc surges on cognitions and invalidations and that sort of thing in other words if he thinks thought and youre running wrong list why that would have been tick early on the list and if itsif you keep on going for another dozen pages its halfadial fall when he does this you understand in other words your needle manifestations are increasing and on wrong list you have more rses toward the end of the list than you do at the beginning of the list lets take the second page of the list and compare it to the last page of the list theres more rses on the last page of the list than there are on the second page of the list you probably have been listing wrongway to the reason for that is the bank beefs up on wrongwayto in other words the bank is getting more solid and so forth and therefore your rses become more frequent and et cetera et cetera et cetera you understand now in other words you could tell there right at the outset pretty good guess anyway because you listed who or what would catfish oppose and this needle is see stiff and it goes bzzz zzzz zzz bzzz zzzzz zzz zzzzzz bzzz zzzzzzz see and then it maybe goes rock slam maybe not who cares but its just stiff that thing is not going anyplace it is not rising it is not doing anything it is stiff man and the other one you turn around and you list it and the needle is stiff for moment and thenthen startsstarts flowing and drifting around and so forth and you say thats right way to and youd think it was the other way around but it isnt okay and thats your second item and then you get that one the same wayto one rs when seen when nulling one rs seen when nulling nobody said anything about tiger drilling one hasnt even mentioned tiger drilling this one rs seen when nulling and when you get to the end of the line thats your package now what should happen when you find an item on that first list or that second list what should happen i got some nice indicators for you here youll be very happy with these things this makes it littlemake life lot easier to live with ive been looking for indicators like mad in other words ive been trying to put up signposts i had half dozen signposts up on this road and i there was this rock see this big rock and it was white rock and i said well thats good enough you just go down to the white rock and there you are see and lot of you are having trouble with white rocks so i nowbeen putting up signposts around the white rock you understand and then signposts beyond the white rock directing you back to it and this indicatorthis indicator youll be very very interested in if you give the pc the wrong item he will instantly have more mass perceived by him than he had moment beforemarkedly this is now thats not pain thats not sen he doesnt have more pain or sen hes got more mass see hewhered this mass come from well it came from the fact you just handed him wrong item in other words you say catfish well i got your item here joe haha hoho i got your item here its catfish and joe says and you say all right did you perceive something when i said that yeah ruddy thing with tail showed up in front of my face you right awaywrong item now lets not worry about what he perceives lets not get into this one see now we saynow you understand he had itemhe had some mass there and he perceives it but its not more mass than he had before when you say this first item to him you understand he always knew he had this little mass there see but its this kind of action see heres your pcs vision area the top of the desk here and you say to him catfish he says where the hell that come from got the idea and actually its this visible now you may only perceive it by something crushing into him hard but you understand ill do that again see here he is hes got relatively clear field see you say to him well joe i just found your item here its catfish he says what whered that come from you know that sort of thing thats very interesting yes i guess that is my item ive always sort of been like that see its that kind of reaction oh yes thats my item yeah you know wild burst of enthusiasm you know well thats wrong source wrong way to or incomplete list of course you understand that wrong way to is also wrong source its catfish oppterm and it should have been catfish term andbut wrong source wrong way to or incomplete list well with this test whereby youre going to list it both ways on your opposition you shouldnt be making many wrong way tos so it usually would boil down to the fact that you just havent got complete list now if your list is incomplete another indicator shows up your pc in the next few minutes will arc break inexplicably and you wont be able to get your rudiments in and you can run general ow and stand on your head and wiggle your ears and do all kinds of things try to amuse him and get him out of it but hes still arc broken you find that the very reasonable auditor says yes of course i can understand how he is arc broke because i did goof and so forth they dont realize that this extreme arc break is from routine 2 thats routine 2 mistake its not an auditing error its nothing the auditor did except he didnt complete the list the usual fact is that when an arc break occurs it isnt really that youve gone by the item in my experience its been it isnt on the list yet im prepared to find an exception to that but i have not found any exceptions so far it just isnt on the list yet now here in essence you get completely the reverse aspect when you package here sits this thing here see pc alreadyalways known its been there and you come along and you say well joe ive got your item here its waterbuck and he says oh yes whered it go right item mass diminishes wrong item mass increases thats handy one isnt it and youll find thats quite invariable that is the mccoy now if its incomplete listnot wrong way to but incomplete list wrong way to he wont arc break because hes been arc break the wholearc broken the whole timea little bit but he wonthe wont go up in smoke now when i say arc break i mean up in smoke i mean he goes into complete apathy or blowy or somethingits quite misemotional hell be misemotional all through the time to the next session and so forth hes liable to blow up in your face he goes out of gear fast and thats usually incomplete list thats usually incomplete list you get all kinds of puzzlesive got puzzle right now wheres ray yeah i got puzzle right now on his pc i just wrote in therei just wrote in his folderhedoing beautifully see hes been doing just this hes been doing just what i described to you as this routine 2 activity and hes got two rsing items ahhaha on his list haha and the items are on the first page of the list and hes gotten many rses that follow but those rses evidently dont fire on nulling or he hasnt nulled them butorbut theyre not firing on nulling now that list is incomplete or he hasnt got the item he has not got the item yet and the pc says oh yes im fine im not quite up to understanding what this is all about and so forth therell be reservations of this particular kind he just hasnt got the item thats all its either later on the existing list but i dont think its ever been put on the list because hes got two rsing items he saw one of the items kind of go pfiff and he took little tiny suppression of off and it started to rs about an inch wide and he already found one of the other items an inch wide and he because he confused the second list he was doing with first list on scientology because the other item was scientology so he started to pick it up off the list oh so ive got in there big red letters exclamation point complete that list see now theres only one place where pc knows exclamation point knows pc reallya lot of the time doesnt know whether its pain or sen pc lot of the time doesnt know what hes worried about and he doesntcertainly doesnt know what his present time problem is what is really eating him upthis always comes as surprise to him but he does know something he knows whether or not its the item now look if he didnt know what the item was then the process would havenot be working see the itemsee its only against the pcs knowingness see youre only auditing up to the pcs knowingness so if he doesnt know its his item well thats it youve had it thats good enough test right there so thats another test see pc queases around even slightly on the thing you havent done it man somethings wrong here hes got to say oh well yes catfish always has been my item and so on you dont get that kind of response when you get the catfish man oh catfish oh what do you know yeah yeah catfish see pcs knowingness is paramount in knowing whether or not its the item not thenot the item youre representing perhaps or something like that but when you find an item the pc knows it is it and when you package it the pc knows thats package he wont even discuss the matter with you thats it see but if he isnt quite oh yes yeah oh yes they go together as package yeah yes thats not good enough see oh well of course yes haha waterbucktiger haha golly funny i never recognized that before you know i often thought those that so on and so on and so on and so on oh yes of course that thats the kind of response you want got the idea because if you dont get up to the pcs knowingness where have you got to you havent got any other place to get to now the funny part of it is that routine 2 carries forward little miracle all by itself when its done in this fashion now you understand im talking to you now about just this routine 2 im talking to you about see you do some sort of list and complete it now notnow understand that list isim not even talking about it being from anything you understand see just do that list and complete it and then you oppose it and the two items go together and the pc knows all about it when you do that you get the funniest little miracle you ever wanted to see they go pffssssffffff gone where the hells the mass you longer got rock slam on one you longer got rock slam on the other one you might have little dirty needle if the pc had withhold or something on it but its gone pfffffsss but the mass is gone too so properly done routine 2 delivers less mass and wrongly done routine 2 delivers more mass now this is so marked you can even put the pc on scale day by day if the pc gains three pounds on tuesday he had wrong routine 2 on monday see that this is the old havingness test you know the thetan does develop energy and the way he got that energy is you saying to him like thisthis is where the energy came from this is the three pounds that he got see you said well well joe thatsgot your item here its catfish three pounds worth see catfish says where the hell did that come from see now actually you didnt materialize it as the auditor dont get spooky about the thing because the thing was there to grab see it was there to grab and it did have mass the moment his attention went on it but the reason it had massisitwas not fundamental see its like grabbing the third withhold from the bottom of the chain it sticks now the fact that youve grabbed nonfundamental mass and told lie about it that it is the fundamental mass brings about this instantaneous solidity it doesnt take place tomorrow it takes place right now bang funniest looking thing you ever saw funnyfunny experience and then lets take up the next step then ofyou might say this is pure theoretical and can be done its not just in theory it actually works right out in practiceroutine 2 then we find another way to list another complete list see we make another complete list and we oppose that and this has not been completely carried forward but maybe one of the easy ways to do that is to reverse the first list now were invading 3 21 one of the ways of listing goal and crossing up routine 2 with routine 3 is one of the best ways you can possibly list goal this is this is doll you say in present time who or what would your goal whatever it is influence see and you make list influence and that list has got to be complete to only one rsing item on that first list you do of it see its complete to one rsing item and there it is and then you take that one rsing item you determine whether its the terminal or an opposition terminal and at that time you oppose it get yourself complete list to only one rs seen on nullingsee there could be dozen rses you see on writing it downnow only one rs seen on nulling now how do you see this rs well actually just by calling them off you say boots saddles catfish waterbuck uhgulp there it went rsed didnt do anything else to it you understand were talking about rses you dont do anything else to to get them to rs when we say only one rsing item you got that were assuming that your pc is sitting in the auditing chair being pc not completely snoring with missed withholds you understand and we assume that the pc is not being audited up against horrendous and screaming arc break that you could have figured out that your routine 2 was bad day before yesterday and you havent solved it yet you understand were talking about pc hes in shape to have something nulled not necessarily cleanasawhistle needle but hes in shape to have something nulled and youre nulling it and you just see that thing now oddly enough you call it the second time and the rs maybe wont be there but justthat you saw it the first time is enough to say the list isnt complete the way you do thatill give you the exact way you do that you come down here and you say waterbuck tiger now lets just get the idea of forty items between each one of these see but we say waterbuck tiger tiger goes ffflflflfl little rs and then forty items and then youre nulling you see so far its tiger see and then you said willow wand ffflflflfl hahaha your list is incomplete and at that very moment you dont say to the pc willow wand is your item or anything stupid like this see you dont say anything to the pc except well i think itd be very very good idea if we added some items to this list see i dont care if we got two more pages to null dont null list down to the end before you add to it stop at the second rs always at the second rs you got it and after youve added to it if you see further rs on your meter as youre adding to it you either missed itmissed seeing itor the pc hasnt put it on the list yet so you better go little furtherheh the pcs will sometimes argue about going further on list when they got more to put on list too dont forget that its the delicacy of the auditor to get him to list further without making him list under protest usually the pc lists under protest usually only when the auditors really goofed the item is on the list or is answering the auditing question some other way well lets see if i can get enough items on this list in order to get away who or what would oppose catfish so that i can get enough items on this list so that we can get away from it and do something else thats the question hes answering see hes not actually thinking over who or what would oppose catfish at all and you have to get that question there straightened out but anyway its always the second rs now after youveafter youve gotseen an rs on your meter here youve gone down the line and youve seen an rsand by the way ill bet some of you are pulling gag i saw an auditor doing the other day and here was the way they were doing this thisthisll amuse you they were listing with the meter over here on the extreme left and writing over on their extreme right in other words their pad was over here and their meter was over there so theyd only occasionally be able to look in the direction of the meter you got that actually the meter belongs up there almost in the pcs chest and this list you can actually put your meter on the clipboard if you have to do it on small restricted area but for gods sakes dont be writing anything on list further than about six or seven inches out in front of that meter you understand because as you write the needle is in your field of vision and you can see it out of the corner of your eye so you never miss these rses when it goes down do you see how you do that in other words you keep your listing up close to the dial and the dial in line and if you can get the list the meter and the pc in line you can keep them all in order just one line see straight out from the auditor list meter pc why you wont miss these rses as they go down be pretty hard to do all right thats just point so anyway youve had your second rs so you added to the list you saw an rs as it went down you say thats good enough all right you go back and you test your first rs even give it little tiger if you want to you know just on been suppressed or anything of the sort you know this thing is now quiet its quiet when being called quiet when being tiger drilled its quiet theres charge on it see you go to your second one now you understand if there were two of them neither are it you want to i got an auditor the other day on this and the auditor couldnt get this either now listen neither one can be it why why can neither one of these be it because putting the second one down didnt take the charge off the first one so the second one cant possibly be it its never going to be either of the two that rsed and youll know if your list is complete now if you cant get either of those two to rs got it so you test both of them and if either one of them gives you an rs your list is incomplete you could go on cycling like this but ordinarily you dont its usually just you find two rses on the list and you continue the list and the rs disappears off of both of them matter what you do to them and you go on down the list and null the new part of the list now and youll find out it rses like mad and there arent two rses on it or anything of the sort theres just one and thats your item you tell it to the pc you get the lessmass phenomenon pcs happy as clam with the thing you oppose it runs like welloiled dream there you are you understand but its never either one of those that rsed if you can get anything on list to rs by standing on its head by shaking it in paper bag by putting brown sugar on iti dont care how see if you can get anything on list to rs except the item the list is not complete you get two rses on list regardless of how you get those two rses on the listim not telling you methodology now im just telling you the basic truths of life about the bees and birds two rsesitem not on the list if either one of them rs after youve added to the list your list still isnt complete because it can never be those first two got that and ordinarily those rses are perceived just by reading someday youll have the bad luck of having very suppressed pc and youll go down the list and when the pc listed the thing they suppressed it like mad and youll miss the rs and youll know then that you goofed and you will have to do something extraordinary and also as far as im concerned the item is not on the list because the pc inexplicably arc breaks there is explanation as to why the pc arc breaks and yet he arc breaks you say well its waterbuck and he says well all right its waterbuck what do you know i never noticed that over there before anyhow you know ititsits right all right i got an item here that yeah its waterbuck all right yeah guess it is but you know i havent been getting any of your acknowledgments lately i wish youd speak up and you heh dont do this man dont do this all right in this session have i missed withhold on you is there something ive nearly found out have i missed withhold on you have i missed withhold on you have i well yes you missed withhold on of course you missed withhold on naturally you havent gotten anything ive said in the whole session you dont acknowledge naturally you say all right finally got him to say something see have i missed withhold on you have i missed withhold two hours later have i missed withhold is there something you nearly found out you could go on like this three sessions later trying to clean rudiments in this session has anything been suppressed in that session when there was that terrible arc break is there anything you invalidated is there anything you failed to reveal now thats taking the course of auditing to heal up gonewrong routine 2 and auditing wont heal up gonewrong routine 2 believe take it from it wont do it thats one of the troubles youre having is your routine 2 goes wrong and then you try to cure it up with auditing and of course youre trying to put out the fire by spitting on it it just doesnt go out thats all finally you get smart enough to say somewhere around here ill bet ive missed an item which of course is the biggest missed withhold the pc can have and you say all right so on well i dont want to list on that list ive answered all the questions on the list you got everything well just for fun lets list on the list oh but i havent got anything yeah and so on thats the whole trouble with the thing right now is im listing under protest i about this timesay well what question have you been askanswering oh ive been answering who or what would doodlebug wupwukor whatever it is whatever question youve got thats what ive been answering and you say well all right now at any time have you answered it for some reason have you deeded something about this answer have you decided oh well yes i deeded i put it on the list when i said tiger and heh ive been listing since well heh what would oppose tiger heh hehheh he hadnt been listing who or what would oppose waterbuck see or hes been listing trying to get enough on the list to make the auditor shut up see itstheres something different going on here with the auditing question now were just down to the basics of auditing dont you see you finally say well i dont care whether its tiring you or not its evidently right way to weve already stressed that apparently the source was okay apparently that and the only thing weve got here that could cause this is youre not putting enough items on this list so you just sit there and start giving items matter whether youre arc broke or not goddammit come on next item oh well if you put it that way pc goes on all of sudden puts the item on the list youll see the thing rs as matter of fact hes been fighting the item dont you see and see the thing rs and boom hes got it on the list you check it out and its all of sudden that phenomenon happens see whered it go you know whole package if its the second item goes psssss and you say well hows that arc break and hell say arc break arc what arc oh oh well ohoh that i donti dont know why you were worried about it im not worried about it thats almost the only arc break you get in this actually you can take it from wrong source and the pcll grind on forever just muttering little bit now and then but you get these spectacular arc breaks just when it isnt on the list thats all you got few indicators now on this see this all right now i said the stylizedthe pure method of all of this was very simple in that you completed the first list now the more arbitraries you introduce in itill take my hair down here and give you few of the facts of lifethe more arbitraries you introduce into any pure technology well the more trouble youre going to have with it im not talking about signs rules and indicators as to how to do it right i mean the more arbitraries as to how it is donethat you introduce into something which are unneeded unnecessary to its execution the more trouble youre going to have with it at the time that r212 was developed we were having lot of trouble with rock slammers and we were having lot of trouble with this and that and the other thing i coped with this best way i could and knew and found outnow listen very carefullythat r212 could be done at several levels of action ityou could get several different kinds of results out of it if you do r212 right even against an arbitrary thats quite arbitrary as your first source well lets say they had five rock slamming items on list one and you pick one of those closest to the session you do that youre going to make change in the pcjust listing it regardless of finding the item and you list that out and so forth and you get the thing more or less complete and you find an item over there and you oppose it see all right youre going to get change in the pc well lets say that this was kind of poorly done and you found one of these rock slamming items and you listed it out and all of sudden huge mass materialized for the pc and you oppose that and so forth hell man youve still changed his mind with regard to this situation see you still have youll still get result now nobody in what im telling you now is invalidative of this because im telling you on the basis of aof an improvement of something that was already pretty good now therefore you could get mediocre result thatd be quite impressive to the pc simply by listing list not even nulling it see you can even list the wrong thing and get some kind of aof result there are lot of results to be had here im here tonight trying to tell you how to get the purest best result im trying to tell you how to get miraculous result now i found out in doing these other things you ran into more trouble than i ever thought youd run into quite few cases around ran into lot of troubleprobably lot of trouble in organizations right now as theyre doing it on staff so lets move this thing down to its absolute essentials and lets take look at the source of any of these difficulties you have had now any time you pick something theres either of two sources of lists actually theres the present timethree sources of liststheres the present time environment of the pc there is the auditing environment of the pc were talking about his livingness environment dont you see thats one list source and then theres his auditing environment you know the auditor and scientology and that sort of thing and then theres parts of existence as sourceso these three pet sources youd say number one and number three might overlap and true enough they very often do but nevertheless you can ask for them separately now i gave you this inthis influence for the goal and this notinfluence for the goal thatsyou already have the pcs goal so you get two entirely separate attacks on the situation in present time who or what would your goal influence and youll get rock slamming list and then you get youve packaged that all up see thats all packaged you want to take off again well youre not likely to get much on influence in present time but you can get notinfluence in present time gives you rock slamming list dont you see so you could say what is part of your life and livingness in present time and what is not part of it this gives you two separate sources from life and livingness each one of them could be handled as complete list and each one of them damn well better be complete list thats your first list i just described to you see now if one of them doesnt rock slam the other one will but usually if the first one did the second one also will so youve got two separate entirely different list sources in life and livingness now lets take the session now we got to find something that isnt rock slamming in order to get list now thats new look isnt it you never represent rock slamming item just never never never i dont care if it was done in 3ga criss cross we got away with it then for various reasons because it wasnt long and we werent packaging and we werent doing it for keeps and we were just using it it was softened off by goals but it becomes fatal to do this in routine 2 you just nevermust never never never write represent or consist or an influences or an upset aboutfrom aor anything like thatfrom rock slamming item in other words in present time who or what does your life consist of well thats somewhat clumsy question but im just giving you an example here see and the pcll go downhill like toboggan if your life rock slams you got to test the source just make sure the source is not rock slamming dr thats okay rock slam boy that is definitely not all right see actually you should tiger drill your source little bit see if you get rock slam if you get rock slam you do one of two things you can either oppose it or skip it and take something else and the best thing to do is skip it and take something else you got that dont be so triumphant that you got that thing to rock slam because youll be representing rock slamming item and thats fatal and you mustntthats big ruleyou mustnt ever represent rock slamming item you only oppose those never represent always oppose rock slamming item all right so your life bangbangbangbangbang you better not write who or whatin present time who or what does your life consist of you know nothing like that because thats representing rock slamming item i dont usecare if you use consist of or any other such word or associated with or any such wording will give you the same mess youd better sayyoud better say something or other that doesnt rock slam youd better say who or what do you associate with associate with associate withits all right see in your life who or what do you associate with thats all right youll get list there got the idea thisin other words you avoid the rsing source for represent list thats another rule avoid it now why do you avoid it because its always out of the context of another list which is always incomplete so you actually to do pure beautiful magical routine 2 you never pick something out of midair that the pc hasnt listed you all of sudden find you know hoho you say hey that slams oh well heck now we got to oppose that you had better avoid it why because is part of list you dont know the heading of and which is incomplete you got that that list is incomplete and is probably right out of the middle and if completed would probably give you something else so just any outoftheblue rock slamming item that the pc presents to you just consider it as part of list that hasnt been completed now it may or may not have been completed now actually theres great destruction to doing something with that but it doesnt give you total and optimum routine 2 thats not terribly destructive youve been doing it but you notice how long those lists can run you notice sometimes they dont complete and you notice the great percentage of coterms that you get out of it you notice that and furthermore im finding out that it takes you longer to handle one of those than to find out what the original list was in the first place and get it completed now routine 2 goes very very fast on raw meat particularly its well you take session you get list you know take session and you null it im talking about two threehour sessions now i mean thatd be slow sort of routine 2 but pocketapocketapocketa see youre always coming up with result all right what if youwhat if you found that scientology was rock slamming now from security measure and in actual fact you could oppose scientology and the case will make gain see thats in actual fact even just oppose it and write long list and abandon it and the pcll do better but thats got liability that list is liable to go forever its liable to be out of context of another list whats the title of the list so weve got our life and livingness see type list and there can be positive and negative life and livingness unless one of them rock slams at which time youll have to find some way to get around that rock slam see dont do anything with rock slam from source avoid that random rock slamming source that came from place see matter how attractive it is and your second is your positivenegative scientology list well look what youre up against supposing the pc rock slams on scientology you cant say to him who or what does scientology represent to you see because thats doing represent now how are you going to get around that youre going to have to take some part of scientology or some way of stating scientology so that youre not representing scientology itll behave to be something identifiable by the pc that doesnt rock slam and then youve got the positive and negative side of that what does represent it what doesnt represent it see what is part of it what isnt part of it i dont care how you state it youits the same list in actual fact and then you have as your third category also positive and negative youve got existence parts of and youre actually asking him now for anything on the whole track he can dream up you not asking for present time anything he usually gives you the present time item thats next to come up now you go back over some pcs folder and you find out you did dynamicdynamic assessment on this pc and here are the dynamics all beautifully written out and four of them rock slammed that tells you your source its from an incomplete list and itll behave like an incomplete list source and you say you rock slam on scientology and hes instantly got this mass whered it come from do you see that in other words it obeys all the rules of an incomplete list its not something different or special well its up to you to complete the list howre you going to do it well youre going to get clever if scientology rock slams how are you going to complete scientology list well youll just have to find something about scientology that is broad and embracivemental activities or rons work see something we dont care what it is avoid that rs and then you can list it positive and you can list it negative see you list it positive and get your whole package see you do your original list see thats that complete list down to whatever it is and then you do an oppose to it and that gives you your package now that saves you one list doesnt it and it saves you the hardest toughest list so its much shorter to do it this way so you get thisthat packages and if you do it right just like ive been telling you here see itll go bbzzzzmmmm lot of mass disappears and the pc feels great in other words that will blow that will blow with rapidity he wont feel somewhat better about it you understand hell feel terrific all right then you can do negative who or what isnt part of scientology if scientology didnt rock slam and then you can do dynamic assessment and you say what are the parts of life and existence and what are not the parts of life and existence and it gives you two more potential packagestwo more packages not two more items you understand so theres source of six packages right there now i would say that they were the basic packages of routine 2 six packagestwelve items you should be able to get off that if you cant change fellows life with those twelve items you ought to quit now youthe degree that you will succeed in this the success that you will have in this is monitored this way as long as you repair routine 2 with routine 2 and not auditing youre okay if you do right routine 2 and repair things that go wrong with routine 2 you can keep everything beautifully polished up and flowing beautifully with little bit of auditing but with little bit of routine 2 and an awful lot of auditing mid ruds and general ow and preparing the pc and getting the rudiments in boy youre just going to get that pc place see because you can straighten up the case with routine 2 where auditing will fail routine 2 is more powerful than auditing why is routine 2 more powerful than auditing because it is hitting at the present time problem and the hidden standard of the pc the hidden standards of the pc and the present time problems of the pc are the things which has gotten in the road of pc progress from the beginning of dianetics and scientology thats the one thing the pc cant get across that he doesnt know these things exist he really doesnt know what present time problem hes got he appears that he has knowdoes know the moment youve gotten it but he actually didnt know until that moment case makes forward progress to amount to anything in the presence of present time problem hidden standard is another thing he is finding out if his sciatica still twinges and that is everything he is doing in all of his processing he only compares it to his sciatica thats the hidden standard you ask any pc youre processing to some degree he has hidden standard you say do you feel better because of processing all right how do you know you feel better because of processing and heif you drum at him for while hell come up with his hidden standard and sometimes these things are quite interestingwhether or not the tips of their ears burn see he knows hes getting better because he gets warm feeling in his chest and so forth and hes actually sitting there in session waiting for the warm session to turn on so that he knows he is better its quite amazing its very interesting littlelittle side alley of research some hpa academy student should undertake sometime to do just ask them howaskgo around and ask his fellow students how do they know theyre feeling better and an academy level without any 212 at all why theyd have abundant answers well what wouldwhat wouldwhat would some healing have to do to you what would some healing have to do to you in order tothat you knew you were better and youll get an almost automatic response on the part of most people sometimes they have to think for while and they finally tell you well idback of my neck wouldnt be tired anymore well theyre telling you theyre trying to find out if an item is shiftedthats what theyre actually telling you till you get the hidden standard out of the road he does everything through this and oddly enough because its really circuit hes consulting all of his answers as to whether or not hes better are from the circuit and this goes much deeper than you would think hes in consultation with circuit supposing it was member of the fda hoho any ease gainitd tell him hes worse do you see thats the hidden standard all right well present time problem its justpresent time is just plowed in he is so fixated on present time you see that huhhuh he cant take his attention off be quite painful for him to invest any time in improving hes just got to be totally alert and up here in present time bugeyed fighting this thing all the time youve seen pcs come into session worried about theirthe wife or worried about the husband or worried about their job or something like that you actually could process them bang bang thud thud crash crash crash on and on and on with the most violent and wonderful processes and so forth and take graph on them afterwards and they got absolutely change whatsoever on the graph weve done that many times you run liability now with omitting your model session of not catching that momentary ptp that momentary ptp can keep the more fundamental ptp from showing up sometimes but routine 212 is usually worth taking chance on its usually worth taking chance on because it is so much greater ptp and it is so much greater withhold and its got so many more overts in it than you could possibly get off with rudiments that most of the time you can get away with not using model session on it all right so what do you do you get you pull the dumbbell to pieces you make it disappear there goes their ptp another dumbbell there goes their hidden standards maybe the same one went both ptp and hidden standards dont you see then you get another one heres their fixation on this that or the other thing here you get another one and they can all of sudden see the walls and didnt ever know they couldnt before you work it on up youre suddenly at position where if you list goals on them they wont give you these first eight or nine items if you had listed goals on them before theyd just give you the intentions of these ptp circuits and youd just get nothing but on and on and onintentions of these circuits i got some actual case history on this which is quite interesting i dont care how long the goals list was the pc was just listing their ptp circuit goals they never listed back of that which i thought was fascinating so of course you could never get the pcs goal on the list now they can move on the track enough now in order to put goal on the list you could do 321 after you had few packages out of the road with routine 2 now that is actually the purpose of routine 2 there isnt any other purpose back of it its not really to make the pc feel better and its not to make the pc fly and its not to make the pc get big reality on scientology nothing its none of those purposes any of those that add in are simply bonuses and theyre all very very worthwhile and you do perfect routine 2 you will get some very very miraculous results its very well worth doing now can you get goals list you get few packages off of somebody and you get them off of him well and he all of sudden just starts presenting you with his goal various things of this character occur but youre trying to clear up the pt environment to point where the individual can be run on goals process and cleared now there is your essence of the thing now the repair of case or anything like that may be another story entirely and it has nothing to do with this very pure rendition of routine 2 which ive just given you if your auditing can compare to the very pure rendition which ive just given you youll have marvelous success in auditing there is doubt about that at all okay thank you
