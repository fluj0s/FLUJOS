predatory lending for reasons discussed below is almost entirely problem in the subprime market1 prime borrowers generally have higher incomes and stronger credit ratings than their subprime counterparts additionally mortgage lenders often try to fit prime loans into the industry standard debttoincome ratios dti and loantovalue ratios ltv set by secondary mortgage market entities like fannie mae and freddie mac so that those organizations are able to purchase the loans in the secondary market 2 subprime borrowers on the other hand tend to be of lower income have lower credit scores and generally have little besides their home equity to put up as collateral for loans3 subprime borrowers for these reasons are considered riskier customers by lenders because of this increased risk subprime loans are less likely to meet fannie mae and freddie mac standards and subprime lenders generally seek higher interest rates and other fees on the loans in part to offset the danger of default the subprime mortgage market began to flourish in the 1990s prior to this time many borrowers with lessthanperfect credit profiles were not extended credit the expansion of the subprime market improved access to credit for these borrowers as such the subprime mortgage market has likely played large role in the increase of homeownership in the country 4 as subprime mortgage lending increased predatory lending did as well commentators have had difficult time coming up with an explicit definition of predatory lending the joint report offered this definition in predatory lending situation the party that initiates the loan often provides misinformation manipulates the borrower through ggressive sales tactics andor takes unfair advantage of the borrowers lack of information about the loan terms and their consequences the results are loans with onerous terms and conditions that the borrower often cannot repay leading to foreclosure or bankruptcy5 obtaining mortgage can be an intimidating and confusing process to negotiate the attendant maze of loan terms fees and financing documents borrowers frequently place trust in the lenders providing them the loan this creates the potential for abuse by unscrupulous lenders6 who can take advantage of borrowers by adding terms and fees to loan agreements that while potentially 1 it should be made clear that predatory lending is not confined exclusively to the subprime lending market however the majority of predatory loans are also subprime see national predatory lending task force curbing predatory home mortgage lending

borrowers if loan terms are too burdensome then borrowers may default on their contractual obligations which increases the likelihood that lenders will foreclose on mortgages and force borrowers out of their homes drawing the line between valid subprime lending and predatory lending has proven to be difficult task7 determining at what point higher rates and fees and more onerous loan terms become predatory is fundamental factor in adopting appropriate legislation to curb these practices if restrictions on lending practices go too far the availability of credit for those with damaged credit profiles could dry up leaving th em without the option of homeownership on the other hand if the restrictions are too loose then borrowers may be stripped of the equity in their homes by unscrupulous lending practices the unnecessary loss of equity caused by points fees or rates that make loan more expensive than what borrower should qualify for considering the borrowers financial and other relevant characteristics is detrimental to borrowers it can be especially harmful to lowincome subprime borrowers who have few savings other than the equity in their home the 103 rd congress responded to the influx of predatory lending practices by passing the home ownership and equity protection act hoepa8 which proscribes some common abusive tactics some have argued that while hoepa has helped curb some predatory lending practices it does not go far enough9 others believe that hoepa has gone too far arguing that it has reduced competition and dried up credit to risky borrowers as some lenders as matter of policy stopped extending hoepacovered loans10 for these reasons some in congress are seeking to amend hoepa11 additionally at least 30 states and the district of columbia have already enacted wide array of legislation seeking to improve upon hoepa some are only minimally different from hoepa12 while others are far more comprehensive13 the differences among them reflect the difficulty in striking the appropriate balance between discouraging predatory terms and conditions wit hout also unreasonably restricting lending to borrowers with lessthanperfect credit these differences have come under increasing scrutiny since the office of the comptroller of the currency occ concluded that hoepa and its regulations preempt the application of state predatory lending statutes to nationally chartered banks 14 and their subsidiaries15 this view has received at least partial support from the us 7 joint report at 17 8 subtitle b of title i of the riegle community

chartered banks and their subsidiaries are not subject to state lending laws whereas many subprime lenders must adhere to both state and federal lending laws where the federal laws serve as the

statutes that are discussed in this report can be beneficial to borrowers in certain circumstances for instance refinance just two months after borrower acquired loan could be in the borrowers best interest if at that time she unexpectedly earned job promotion that increased her credit rating thus qualifying her for lessexpensive loan another example would be borrower agreeing to six year prepayment penalty in exchange for other more favorable terms if that borrower is reasonably confident that she will remain in the same home for at least six years critics consequently would argue that by proscribing prepayment penalties after the first five years of the loan barring refinances within three months of acquiring the underlying loan or otherwise limiting the availability of loan terms predatory lending statutes are actually harming borrowers rather than attaining the policy goal of helping them the fact that these lending practices can be legitimate in some circumstances while predatory in others can make regulating them quite difficult it is important to weigh these counterbalancing factors when devising predatory lending statute g5g152g159g142g155g142g141g561g14g152g138g151g156g561 one of the most important features of predator lending statute is the determination of which loans fall under the umbrella of its protections and restrictions many statutes exempt certain types of mortgages from their definition of covered loans predatory lending statutes also generally set thresholds that nonexempt mortgages must meet before their protections are triggered most commonly the thresholds are ba sed on the loans annual percentage rate apr andor the total points and fees paid by the borrower in connection with the loan19 hoepa applies to mortgages that are secured by borrowers primary residence but exempts from coverage residential mortgage transactions20 reverse mortgage transactions21 and open end credit plans22 the most significant of these exemptions is residential mortgage transactions 19 definitions of points and fees also differ among the statutes see eg 12 cfr 22632b1 which includes finance charges compensation paid to mortgage brokers premiums or other charges for credit insurance application fees late paymentdefault charges overdraft charges credit plan fees sellers points interest forfeited due to legally required interest reduction on time deposit used to secure the loan and real estate related fees such as title examination preparation of documents notary etc 20 defined at 15 usc 1602w the term residential mortgage transaction means transaction in which mortgage deed of trust purchase money security interest arising under and installment sales contract or equivalent consensual security interest is created or retained agains t the consumers dwelling to fi nance the acquisition or initial construction of such dwelling 21 defined at 15 usc 1602bb the term reverse mortgage transaction means nonrecourse transaction in which mortgage deed of trust or equivalent consensual security interest is created against the consumers principal dwelling securing one or more advances and with respect to which the payment of any principal interest and shared appreciation or equity is due and payable other than in the case of default only after the transfer of the dwelling the consumer ceases to occupy the dwelling as princi pal dweller or the death of the consumer 22 defined at 15 usc 1602i the term open end credit plan means plan under which the creditor reasonably contemplates repeated transactions and which provides for finance charge which may be computed from time to time on the outstanding unpaid balance credit plan which is an open end credit plan within the meaning of the preceding sentence is an open end credit plan even if credit information is verified from time to time

to meet the scheduled payments some predatory lenders however make loans based on the value of the security interest eg the home without consider ing the borrowers financial characteristics this practice is already discouraged by federal banking regulators because it is considered speculative and unsound25 it is also alleged that some lenders make loans knowing that borrowers will be unable to repay thereby allowing the lenders to refinance the loans while adding additional up front fees or to obtain borrowers houses through foreclosure26 state statutes often combat these practices by requiring lenders to consider the borrowers financial characteristics such as their debttoincome ratios dti and loantovalue ratios ltv27 hoepa prohibits lenders from engaging in pattern or practice of providing covered loans based on the value of the collateral without regard to the borrowers ability to repay28 lender is presumed to have violated this provision if the lender engages in pattern or practice of extending covered loans without verifying and documenting consumers repayment ability29 proving lender has engaged in pattern or practice requires evidence of more than just single violative act30 g18g155g142g153g138g162g150g142g151g157g561g18g142g151g138g149g157g146g142g156g561 prepayment of loans often takes place as result of relocation or refinancing some lenders particularly those in the subprime market charge fees for prepayment that are intended to cover the lender for lost interest payments incurred due to such early payment prepayment penalties 23 these types of loans usually are covered by state predatory lending statutes they also are often referred to as purchase money mortgages because of the exemption of residential mortgage transactions hoepas coverage is basically limited to certain secondary mortgages and refinances 24 12 cfr 22632 15 usc 1602aa the board of governors of the federal reserve system the board has the authority to adjust the

borrower into the existing loan which could be more expensive than loan for which the borrower currently qualifies31 consequently predatory lending statutes typically place limitations on prepayment penalty terms32 hoepa prohibits prepayment penalties after the first five years of the covered loan where the borrower has total monthly indebtedness inc luding monthly payments under the proposed mortgage greater than half the borrowers monthly income this prohibition does not apply to funds obtained from refinancing the mortgage with the same lender or one of its affiliates33

the principa l balloon payments tied to highcost loans with short terms can be particularly difficult for lowincome subprime borrowers to make thus encouraging them to refinance sometimes repeatedly with new highcost loans 34 many statutes prohibit payments that are more than double the average of earlier payments35 hoepacovered loans of less than five years may not include terms under which the aggregate amount of the regular periodic payments would not fully amortize the outstanding principal balance36 this basically bars balloon payments in covered loans that last less than five years

increase in the loans principal this may be beneficial to borrower who has low cashonhand at the time of closing but whose income is likely to increase in the near future eg recent graduate with good job lined up however borrowers lose equity under such payment scheme37 which is why predatory lending laws often prohibit these terms in covered loans38 hoepa bars the inclusion of terms in covered loan that would allow the principal to increase due to the fact that regular payments do not fully cover the loans interest39 31 see joint report at 9394 32 see eg colo rev stat 5351021g 33 15 usc

flipping is the practice of refinancing loan frequently over short time while charging the borrower fees for each transaction the borrower may get an individual benefit for the refinance such as lower interest rate but the overall effect may make such transaction bad option for the borrower40 many state statutes restrict this practice in some way often this is done by requiring lenders to ensure that an extended loan provides net benefit to the borrower41 reg z prohibits lender from refinancing covered loan within one year of originating the underlying covered loan unless the refinancing is in the borrowers best interest42 lenders are also barred from attempting to evade this regulati on by for instance engaging in pattern or practice of arranging with other creditors to refinance their own covered loans within the one year period43 g5g155g142g141g146g157g561g5g152g158g151g156g142g149g146g151g144g561 predatory lenders can take advantage of borrowers unfamiliarity with loan practices and terms by adding points and fees to loans additionally borrowers may not know that they qualify for less expensive loans than those offered by abusive lenders44 recognizing the role that knowledge plays in curbing predatory lending some statutes require borrowers to seek credit counseling before lenders may provide them highcost loan45 hoepa does not have credit counseling requirement

differences in arbitration instead of in court these clauses can be onerous to borrowers if they reduce the legal rights that borrowers would have in court require borrowers to pay the costs of arbitration force borrowers to travel far from home or otherwis discourage borrowers from raising valid claims46 for these reasons state predatory lending statutes often restrict the use of arbitration clauses in covered loans47 hoepa does not limit the use of arbitration clauses 40 see joint report at 7374 41 see eg ark code ann 2353104b 42 12 cfr 22635a3 this provision also applies to

several types of credit insurance that cover loan payments in case of the borrowers inability to pay including credit life credit accident credit disability credit unemployment and credit property insurance frequently the premiums for these products are folded into single premium and financed into highcost loans these insurance products are not always in the best interest of the borrower and because mortgage brokers are often compensated based on commissions the broker may not have an incentive to find the products that will most benefit the borrower48 to combat this practice many states prohibit the practice of financing or packing single premium credit insurance into covered loans hoepa does not restrict the practice of financing credit insurance

initiated by borrowers failure to abide by the terms of the loan agreements however they may also be predatory if done for reasons unrelated to borrowers contractual obligations because they increase the chance of default for this reason some states predatory lending statutes prohibit such practices49 hoepa does not address unilateral acceleration clauses

transaction cheaper in the frontend forces borrowers to pay more in principal and interest over the course of their loans without increasing the amount of money received through the loans lenders receive this compensation upfront regardless of whether th points and fees are financed into the loan50 similar to negative amortization terms this practice can be beneficial to borrowers that have low cashonhand at closing but who are likely to have steady incomes over the coming months or years however predatory lenders could finance points and fees in an attempt to hide loans actual cost from the borrower for this reason many state predatory lending laws limit when and how lenders may finance points and fees51 hoepa does not place restrictions on the financing of points and fees 48 see
