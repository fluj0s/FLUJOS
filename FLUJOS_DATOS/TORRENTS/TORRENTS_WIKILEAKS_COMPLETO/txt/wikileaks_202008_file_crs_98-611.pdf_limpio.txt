the two houses of congress to recommend to the people of the united states day of public thanksgiving 1 president george washington assigned thursday november 26 using an october 3 1789 instrument of proclamation2 it was the first proclamation issued by president under the federal government established by the constitution four months earlier on june 8 1789 president washington sent communique to the acting holdover officers of the confederation governme nt directing the preparation of report to impress with full precise and distinct general idea of the affairs of the united states handled by each official3 the forerunner or prototype of body of presidential directives which would subsequently come to be denominated executive orders the communique was issued of course before the creation of the great federal departments various proclamations and orders would be issued by presidents during the nineteenth century number had accumulated by the time efforts were begun during the latter half of the century to account better for them through numbering process and to standardize their forms consequently an examination of published collections of presidential papers such as james d richardsons compilation of the messages and papers of the presidents prepared under the direction of the congressional joint committee on printing reveals that prior to the lincoln administration number of documents denominated as proclamations and other presidential instruments of particular designation directed certain actions to be taken 4 these latter types of documents were what came to be officially called executive orders largely because the first of them to be selected to begin the numbered series had been captioned executive order establishing provisional court in louisiana by richardson in his compilation of presidential papers signed by president abraham lincoln it was dated october 20 1862 however another contender for the position of first executive order dated march 10 1863 and concerning soldiers absent without leave appeared in the united states statutes at large 5 furthermore the instrument selected as the second executive order dated april 4 1865 and concerning rewards for the arrest of felons from foreign countries committing felonies in the united states was signed by secretary of state william h seward rather than the president6 the sixth executive order dated july 20 1868 and concerning the ratification of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution was also signed by secretary seward and has the form of proclamation the same was true of the seventh executive order dated july 28 1868 certifying the ratification of the fourteenth amendment and ordering its publication indeed both of these last two instruments appeared in the statutes at large as proclamations7 such were the confused beginnings of bringing order out of the chaos surrounding the issuance of presidential directives 1 annals of congress vol 1 september 25 1789 pp 88 914915 ibid

century presidents it presents background on their historical development accounting use and effect turning to the last of these considerations before discussing each type of presidential directive it may be generally said that most of these instruments establish policy and many have the force of law policy in this context is understood as statement of goals or objectives which president sets and pursues whether these directives have the force of law depends upon such factors as the presidents authority to issue them their conflict with constitutional or statutory provisions and thei r promulgation in accordance with prescribed procedure indeed as history has shown presidential directives may be challenged in court or through congressional action in the latter case however difficulties may arise if congress through legislative action attempts to supersede or nullify presidential directive issued in whole or in part pursuant to the executives constitutional authority the result being possible infringement by one constitutional branch upon the powers of another congress has been more successful in overturning or modifying executive orders based solely upon or authorized by statute which of course was the creation of the legislature exercising its power of the purse congress has provided that appropriated funds may not be made available to pay the expenses of any executive agency including agencies established by executive order after such agency has been in existence for one year unless congress appropriates money specifically for it or authorizes the expenditure of funds by it 8 in some situations where congress has delegated authority to the president it has legislated requirements that executive orders exercising this authority be subject to either congressional review and possible cancellation before becoming effective or modification including cancellation after being issued 9 finally congress has legislated procedures concerning the issuance of presidential proclamations and executive orders with the federal register act of 1935 congress mandated the publication of the federal register an executive branch gazette that is produced each working day by the national archives and records administration that statute also requires the federal register publication of all presidential proclamations and executive orders except those not having general applicability and legal effect or effective only against federal agencies or persons in their 8 see 58 stat 361 at 387 31 usc 3147 9 see 47 stat 382 at 413 48 stat 8 at 16 90 stat 1255

vast majority of presidential proclamations and executive orders must be published particularly those prescribing penalty the statute also indicates that 1 documents or classes of documents that the president may determine from time to time have general applicability and legal effect and 2 documents or classes of documents that may be required so to be published by act of congress shall also be reproduced in the federal register 10 in fact presidents have elected to publish some other kinds of directives which are discussed below all such presidential instruments published in the federal register are collected in annual volumes of title 3 of the code of federal regulations for ready reference g3g141g150g146g151g146g156g157g155g138g157g146g159g142g561g17g155g141g142g155g156g561 the first administrative order so denominated was issued may 25 1940 it established the office for emergency management in the executive office of the president 11 the directive appeared to be issued pursuant to and as an extension of an executive order eo 8248 of september 8 1939 which organized the executive office of the president and made generic reference to an office for emergency management which might be subsequently established in the event of national emergency or the threat of national emergency the second administrative order dated january 7 1941 further defined the status and functions of the office for emergency management and was also issued pursuant to eo 824812 thus the impression was left that administrative orders might be subset of directives used to detail further policy primarily established by executive orders however this soon proved not to be the case the third administrative order so designated was july 29 1943 letter transferring certain functions of the office for emergency management the next two orders issued april 13 1945 concerned keeping flags at halfstaff on all federal buildings and temporarily closing federal departments and agencies in conjunction with ceremonies on the occasion of president franklin d roosevelts death both were signed by cretary of state edward r stettinius jr september 10 1945 administrative order signed by secretary of war henry l stimson indicated how the term world war ii was to be officially used the next order dated august 15 1945 and signed by president harry s truman terminated the office of censorship and voluntary censorship of the domestic press and radio 13 these and subsequent instruments denominated as administrative orders took variety of formsdelegations of authority determinations directives findings letters memoranda and orderson wide array of administrative matters in fact some items appeared to overlap other types of presidential directives for example so international trade instruments sometimes in letter form were considered to be administrative orders14 as were designations of officials15 in 1972 certain instruments identified as presidential

administrative order first appeared in the federal register and cfr in 196417 in general indications are that during at least the past 40 years presidential directives published in the federal

issued march 27 1940 pursuant to farm crop production and harvesting loan statute of 193718 the instrument certified that four washington counties were distressed emergency areas and therefore not subject to the loan limitations stated in the law19 although there is evidence that presidents had issued statutorily authorized certificates prior to this time directives of this designation have

and the cfr presidential letters designating individuals to hold specified official positions in the government have been reproduced in these publications the first dated may 28 1941 vested secretary of the interior harold l ickes with the additional position and accompanying duties of petroleum coordinator for national defense the second however established new position coordinator of information and designated william j donovan private individual to fill it 21 subsequent designations have been of both typessome being an additional position for an individual already holding an official post others being an original appointment of private person to an existing vacant or newly created position the president may unilaterally make designations where senate approval of the appointment is required and where he has the authority and resources to create new official positions to be filled by designees some designations are merely delegations of presidential authority to constitutional officers such as cabinet secretaries 22 two more recent designations one in 1979 and another in 1982 were of slightly different character officials by title were designated to have authority to

executive orders are one of the oldest types of presidential directive an early model appearing in june 1789 when president washington directed the acting holdover officers of the confederation government to prepare for him report to impress with full precise and distinct general idea of the affairs of the united states handled by each official like most executive orders it was directed to and governed actions by executive officials and agencies however some executive orders such as perhaps those concerning emergency situations and relying upon the presidents constitutional authority or powers statutorily delegated to him by congress to respond to exigencies were of more profound character for example president roosevelt used an executive order eo 9066 on february 19 1942 to require the internment of american citizens of japanese ancestry who were living in certain designated pacific coast defense areas the issuance of executive orders by presidents followed not only the practice of state governors but also relied upon constitutional authority such as the commanderinchief role and the faithful execution of the laws clause and statutory law under the new federal government the department of state was responsible for preservi ng presidential executive orders examples of early presidential directives having the characteristics of executive orders may be found in richardsons compilation of the messages and papers of the presidents in 1907 the department of state began to assign identification numbers to both executive orders and proclamations making determined but not totally successful effort to include previously issued instruments of both types in this accounting 24 the numbering of executive orders began with an october 20 1862 instrument signed by president lincoln the federal register act of 1935 effectively required that both executive orders and proclamations be published in the register 25 the first executive order so published was eo 7316 of march 13 1936 concerning the enlargement of the cape romain migratory bird refuge in south carolina beginning with this instrument all subsequent presidential executive orders have been reproduced in cfr title 3 compilations regulations governing the preparation presentation filing and publication of executive orders and proclamations are prescribed in eo 11030 as amended

cfr title 3 compilation issued december 13 1941 shortly after the japanese attack on pearl harbor and congressional declarations of war on japan and germany26 the general license signed by president roosevelt authorized the conduct of certain export transactions otherwise prohibited during wartime by the trading with the enemy act of 1917 as amended it also delegated to the secretary of the treasury responsibility to regulate such transactions 27 an emergency action taken to assist the prosecution of the war the general license facilitated the shipment of material to us allies for that

regarding the insertion in government contracts of provision obligating signatory contractors not to discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment on account of race creed color or

proceed presidential findings of this type were reproduced in cfr title compilations as administrative orders53 in 1974 the reference to presidential finding took on its current popular meaning when congress adopted the socalled hughesryan amendment to the foreign assistance act of that year set out in section 662 of the statute it prohibited the expenditure of appropriated funds by or on behalf of the central intelligence agency for intelligence activities unless and until the president finds that each such operation is important to the national security of the united states and reports in timely fashion description and scope of such operation to the appropriate committees of congress 54 the requirements of this provision subsequently went through series of transformations the vestiges of which were recently codified in the intelligence authorization act fiscal year 1991 but this act still requires written presidential finding satisfying certain conditions set forth in the statute for covert actions to occur 55 such presidential findings which are security classified are to be reported to the intelligence committees as soon as possible after being approved and before the initiation of the covert action authorized by the finding thus these findings are not published in the federal register or reproduced in cfr title 3 compilations

reorganization of the executive departments and agencies in 1939 statute56 the objective of such reconfigurations was to achieve efficiency and economy in administration presidential reorganization plan submitted to congress became effective after 60 days unless both houses of congress adopted concurrent resolution of disapproval such reorganization authority renewed periodically dozen times between 1945 and 1984 with slight variations remained available to the president for nearly half century at different junctures qualifications were placed upon its exercise for example reorganization plans could not abolish or create an entire department or deal with more than one logically consistent subject matter also the president was prohibited from submitting more than one plan within 30day period and was required to include clear statement on the projected economic savings expected to result from reorganization 52 see warren r reid public papers of the presidents american archivist vol

plans not disapproved by congress were published in the federal register prior to being implemented and also in the statutes at large and the cfr title 3 for the year in which they became effective modification of the presidents reorganization plan authority was made necessary in 1983 when the supreme court effectively invalidated continued congressional reliance upon concurrent resolution to disapprove proposed plan57 under the reorganization act amendments of 1984 several significant changes were made in the reorganization plan law any time during the period of 60 calendar days of continuous session of congress following the submission of reorganization plan the president might make amendments or modifications to it within 90 calendar days of continuous session of congress following the submission of reorganization plan both houses must adopt joint resolution which unlike concurrent resolution becomes law with the presidents signature for plan to be approved this amendment however continued the presidents reorganization plan authority only to the end of 1984 when it automatically expired 58 although presidents ronald reagan george h w bush and william clinton did not request the reestablishment of reorganization plan authority president george w bush indicated an interest in pursuing its restoration in his fy2003 budget message

declared thursday november 26 to be day of public thanksgiving like most proclamations it affected primarily the activities and interests of private individuals and like many proclamations it was at best hortative however some proclamations declaring emergency situations and invoking the presidents constitutional authority as commanderinchief or powers statutorily delegated to him by congress to respond to exigencies were of more profound char acter an early proclamation promulgated by president washington on august 7 1794 exemplified this latter use of such instruments responding to rebellious activities in western pennsylvania and virginia in protest of federal excise tax on whiskey the president called forth the militia and personally took command this was done pursuant to statutory arrangements 59 the issuance of proclamations by the president followed tradition established by british monarchs and practiced by royal governors in the north american colonies and by their elected successors after the revolution60 under the new federal government the department of state was responsible for preserving presidential proclamations numerous examples of the early proclamations may be found in richardsons compilation of the messages and papers of the presidents in 1907 the department of state began to assign identification numbers to both proclamations and executive orders making determined but not totally successful effort to include previously issued instruments of both types in this accounting61 the federal register act of 1935 effectively required that both proclamations and executive orders be published in the 57 see ins v chadha 462 us 919 1983 58 see 5 usc 901912 59 see 1 stat 264265 60 see hans aufricht presidential pr oclamations and the
