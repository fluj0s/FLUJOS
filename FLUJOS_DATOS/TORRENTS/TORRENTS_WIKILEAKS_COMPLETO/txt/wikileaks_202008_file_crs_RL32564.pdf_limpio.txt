immigration analysis of the real id act of 2005 by michael john garcia margaret mikyung lee and todd tatelmanimmigration terrorist grounds for exclusion and removal of aliens introduction in the years following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks considerable concern has been raised because the 19 terro rists were aliens ie foreign nationals who apparently entered the united states on temporary visas despite provisions in immigration law intended to bar the admission of suspected terrorists the report of the national commission on terrorist att acks upon the united states also known as the 911 commission contended that there were opportun ities for intelligence and law enforcement to exploit qaedas travel vulnerabilities the 911 commission maintained that border security was not considered national security matter prior to september 11 and as re sult the consular and immigration officers were not treated as full partne rs in counterterrorism efforts1 the 911 commissions monograph 911 and terrorist travel underscored the importance of the border security functions of immigration law and policy2 in the 108th congress several propos als were introduced in response to the 911 commissions findings some of which c ontained provisions relating to border security3 most notably the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 in the 109th congress the real id act of 2005 pl 10913 division b included among other thin gs number of provisions related to immigration reform and document security that were considered during congressional deliberations on the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act but which were ultimately not included4 under current law three departments the department of state dos the department of homeland security dhs and the department of justice doj httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32564crs2 5 other departments notably the departme nt of labor dol and the department of agriculture usda play roles in the approv process depending on the category or type of visa sought and the department of health and human services hhs sets policy on the healthrelated grounds for inadmissibility 6 certain classes of aliens are not required to obtain visa to enter the united states and are therefore exempt from the consular review pr ocess for example under the visa waiver program vwp nationals from certain

243244 1995 testimony of jamie s gorelick deputy attorney general while strongly endorsing greater antiterrorism authority also observing that it might be in our interest to allow member of terrorist organization to enter in some circumstances controversy has especially arisen from timetotime on whether to waive terrorism inadmissibility for certain palestinians public charge eg indigence seeking

not applicable in the case of nonimmigrants refugees eg public charge10 and other aliens for aliens seeking to enter temporarily as nonimmig rants even the terrorism grounds for inadmissibility may possibly be waived for aliens who do not pose an immediate danger11 as the terrorism grounds broadene d from active and former terrorists to representatives of terrorist organizations to members and supporters of terrorist organizations to those who may have ndorsed or espoused terrorism at one time many believed it was appropriate to at least leave open the possibility of waiver to allow temporary admission for limited purposes and subject to strict controls12 key legislation prior to the immigration act of 1990 pl 101649 there was express terrorismrelated ground for exclusion c ongress added the terrorism ground in the 1990 act as part of broader effort to streamline and modernize the security and foreign policy grounds for inadmissibility and removal before 1990 certain terrorists were excludable under secur ity grounds but the 1990 act opened the door for broader elaboration of what associations and promotional activities could be deemed to be terrorist activities in part as response to the 1993 world trade center bombing congress strengthened the antiterrorism provisions in the ina and passed provisions that many maintained would ramp up enforcement activities notably in the illegal immigration re form and immigrant responsib ility act iirira of 1996 pl 104208 and the an titerrorism and effective death penalty act pl 104132 as part of the vi olent crime control act of 1994 pl 103322 congress also amended the ina to establish temporary authority for an s nonimmigrant visa category for aliens who are witnesses and informants on criminal and terrorist

andorra brunospecifically in the context of this report the usa patriot act amended the ina to expand the definition of terrorism and amend the criteria and process for designating terrorist organizations the enhanced border security and vi sa entry reform act of 2002 pl 107 173 aimed to improve the visa issuance process abroad as well as immigration inspections at the border it expressly re quired the development of an interoperable electronic data system to share information relevant to alien admissibility and removability and the implementation of an integrated entryexit data system it also required that beginning in october 2004 ll newly issued visas have biometric identifiers in addition to increasing consular officers access to electronic information needed for alien screening it expanded the training requirements for consular officers who issue visas13 the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 focused primarily on targeting terrorist travel through an intelligence and security strategy based on reliable identification systems and effective integrated informationsharing its immigration provisions aimed at closer monitoring of persons entering and leaving the united states as well as tightening up the grounds for removal it also au thorized substantial increase in funding for immigration related homeland security the real id act pl 10913 division b represented continuation in the trend to expand the terrorrelated grounds for exclusion and removal of particular relevance to this report the real id act expanded the terrorrelated grounds for inadmissiblity and deportability and amended the definitions of terrorist organization and engage in terrorist activity used by the ina the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 subsequently modified the application of certain terrori smrelated provisions of the ina including exempting 10 organizations from fallin g under the definition of terrorist organization and expanding immigration authorities waiver authority over many terrorismrelated ina provisions current law since 1990 certain terrorism related activities by an alien have expressly been grounds for exclusion and removal many of the terrorismrelated grounds for inadmissibility and deportation use certain terms ie terrorist activity engage in terrorist activity and terrorist organi zation that are expressly defined by the ina to describe particular kinds of c onduct or entities the following sections provide an overview of the rrorismrelated terms defined by the ina as well as the terrorismrelated grounds for in admissibility and deportationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32564crs5 14 internationally protected person is define d under us law as chief of state or the political equivalent head of

person freedom or dignity and any member of his family th forming part of his household 18 usc 1116b4definitions of terrorrelated terms in the ina terms including terrorist activity engage in terrorist activity and terrorist organization are specifically defined for i na purposes and refer to distinct concepts as these definitions change so too does th scope of ina provisions that use them the term terrorist activity refers to certain specified acts of violence for example hijacking an airplane or assassinating head of state engaging in terrorist activity includes both the commission of direct acts of terrorism and certain activities in support of them for example soliciting participation in terrorist act the ina defines terrorist organization to include two general categories of groups the first category are those gr oups that are designated as terrorist organizations by the united states thereby providing public notice of these organizations involvement in terrorism the second cat egory includes other groups that carry out terrorrelated activities but ve not been designated either because they are operating under the radar or have shifting alliances or designating the group as terrorist organization would jeopardize ongoing us criminal or military operations the groups belonging to this second categ ory may be called non designated terrorist organizations the terms engage in terrorist activity and terrorist organization were amended by the real id act to cast wider net over groups and persons who provide more discrete forms of assistance to terrorist or ganizations particularly with respect to fundraising and soliciting mbership in those organizations the consolidated appropriations act fy2008 subsequently exempted certain groups from being considered terrorist organiza tions expanded the secretary of homeland securitys waiver authority and specified the taliban as terrorist organization for ina purposes definition of terrorist activity under the ina terrorist activity is defined by ina 212a3b in orde r for an action to constitute terrorist activity it must be unlawful in th place where it was committed and involve the hijacking or sabotage of an ai rcraft vessel or other vehicle seizing or detaining and threatening to kill injure or continue to detain another individual in or der to compel third person including governmental

quite broad potentially covering any group that engages or has subgroup that engages in terrori st activity regardless of whether the group has actually been designated by us authorities as terrorist possibly complicating matters further is that the ina defines what constitutes terrorist activity broadly arguably ignoring the context in which activity occurs and whether such activity ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32564crs7 19 see in re sk 23 i n dec 936 941 bia 2006 congress intentionally drafted the terrorist bars to relief very broadly to include even those people described as

substantial damage to property other than for monetary gain is considered terrorist activity accordingly prodemocracy group engaged in armed conflict against an oppressive re gime could potentially be considered terrorist organization under the ina ev if the groups ac tivities were supported by the united states and as result the persons involved with the group could be inadmissible and ineligible for asylum19 prior to the enactment of the cons olidated appropriations act 2008 the secretary of state or secretary of homeland security following consultation with the other and the attorney general had authority to waive the application of this provision with respect to group that might otherwise constitute terrorist organization solely on account of having subgroup that had engaged in terrorist activity20 however us authorities could not waive the application of this provision with respect to any group that had itself engaged in c onduct defi ned by the ina as terrorist activity21 the limitation on this waiver authority was source of controversy in september 2006 congressional hearing stat department repres entative testified that although secretarial exercise of the ina pplicability authority allows us to make significant progress in reaching some popul ations in need of resettlement it does not provide the flexibility required in ll refugee cases for example cuban anticastro freedom fighters and vietna mese montagnards who fought alongside us forces have been found inadmissible on this basis as have karen who participated in resistance to brutal ttacks on their families and friends by the burmese regime the administration will continue to seek solutions for these groups and to further harmonize national security concerns with the refugee admissions program22
