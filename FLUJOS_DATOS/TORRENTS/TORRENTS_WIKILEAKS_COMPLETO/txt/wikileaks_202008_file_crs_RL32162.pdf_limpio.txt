divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162the size and role of government economic issues summary the size and role of the government is one of the most fundamental and enduring debates in ameri can politics economics can be used to analyze the relative merits of governme nt intervention in the economy in specific areas but it cannot answer the question of whether th ere is too much or too little government activity overall that is not to say that one cannot find many examples of government programs that economists would consider to be highly inefficient if not counterpr oductive way to achieve policy goals reducing ineffi cient government spending would benefit the economy however reducing efficient government spending would harm it and reducing the size of government could involve either one government intervention can increase economic efficiency when market failures or externalities exist political choices may lead to secondbest economic outcomes however and some argue that for that reason market failures can be preferable to government intervention in the absence of market failures and externalities there is little ec onomic justification for government intervention which lowers efficiency and probably economic growth but government intervention is often based on the desire to achieve social goals such as income redistribution economics ca nnot quantitatively value social goals although it can often offer suggestions for how to achieve those goals in the least costly way the government intervenes in the ec onomy in four ways first it produces goods and services such as infrastru cture education and national defense measuring the effects of these goods and services is difficult because they are not bought and sold in markets second it transfers income both vertically across income levels and horizont ally among groups with s imilar incomes and different characteristics third it taxes to pay for its outlays which can lower economic efficiency by distorting behavior not ll taxes are equally di stortionary however so there are ways of reducing the costs of taxation without changing the size of government furthermore ficit spending does not allo w the government to escape the burden of taxation since deficits im pose their own burden finally government regulation alters economic activity the economic effects of regulation are the most difficult to measure in terms of both cost s and benefits yet they cannot be neglected because they can be interchangeable with taxes or government spending there are many different ways to meas ure the size of the government making its economic effects difficult to evalua budgeting conventions are partly responsible tax expenditures offsetting receipts and collections and government corporations are all excluded from the budg et but some governmental functions like regulation simply cannot be quantified robustly di scussions about the overall size of government mask significant changes in the composition of government spending over time spending has shifted from the federal to the state and local level federal production of goods and services has fa llen while fede ral transfers have grown significantly today nearly tw othirds of federal sp ending is devoted to social security medicare medicaid interest payments and nationa l defense thus there is limited scope to alter the size of government w ithout fundament ally altering these programs the share of federal spe nding devoted to the elderly has burgeoned over time and this trend is forecast to continuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162contents how does the government affect the economy 1 h w l r g i s t h g v r n m n t 2e f f c t f t h g v r n m n t n c n m i c f f i c i n c y1 3 w h t i s m r

government economic issues the appropriate size and role of the g overnment is one of the most fundamental and enduring debates in am erican politics what ro does the state play in economic activity how is the economy ffected by government intervention many of the arguments surrounding the pr oper size of government are economic in nature and they will be discussed in this report how does the government affect the economy government activity affects the economy in four ways the government produces goods nd services including roads and national defense less th an half of federal spe nding is devoted to the production of goods and services the government transfers income through both the tax system and outlays popular perception typi cally focuses on transfers across income classes through the progressive income tax system and meanstested benefits referred to as vertical redistribution but vertical redistribution is dwa rfed by horizontal redistribution transfers unrelated to income class the largest beneficiaries of transfers are the elderly through programs such as social security the government collects taxes nd that alters ec onomic behavior for instance taxes on labor change the incentives to work while taxes on specific goods eg gasoline change the incentive to consume and produce those goods the government regulates ec onomic activity for number of reasons including environmental protection workplace safety and consumer protection the ec onomic impact of regulation is probably the hardest and most cont entious to measure of the four types of government economic activity1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs2 2 federal reserve bank of minneapolis what is dollar worth httpwwwminneapolisfedorg researchdatauscalc 3 paul light the true size of the government washington brookings institution press 1999 4 all budget data are measured on fis cal year basis unless otherwise notedhow large is the government before assessing how the government affects economic activity it is necessary to agree upon how to measure the size of the government for number of reasons this exercise is less straightforward than it may seem the size of government can be expressed in number of different units of measurement should the size of government be measured in dollars on per capita basis by total employees or as percentage of gdp each measurement has its advantages but some measurements have more shortcomings than others if measured in dollars then those dollars should be adjusted for inflation the purpose of meas urement is to gauge the resources at the governments disposal and dollar of tax revenue in 1946 would buy 1063 of goods and services in 2007 because of inflation2 measuring the size of government by the number of employees is imprecise because the government can substitute capital for labor over time to accomplish the same tasks with fewer employees for example the governments purchase of co mputers has rendered many clerical jobs obsolete the federal government can also pay workers in the private labor force through contracts and grants or allow stat and local government workers to deliver federal programs in place of federal public servants one estimate puts the number of private and state and local government workers working for the federal government at more than seven times the size of the federal workforce3 comparisons over time that do not incorporate demographic change are arguablymisleading because government spending per capita is more meaningful than total government spending 4584 billion in fe deral spending in 1946 amounted to 3242 per person then but would onl finance 1533 per person in 2006 but over long periods of time because of the power of compounding any level of government spending will appear to be insignificant unless it is expressed as fraction of gross domestic pr oduct gdp measurement th at incorporates inflation and population growth in 1944 at the height of world war ii federal spending was less than half of todays fe deral budget in constant inf lationadjusted dollars yet outlays in 1944 accounted for 437 of gdp whereas the budget in 2007 accounted for only 20 of gdp 4 nevertheless some argue that stating the size of government as percentage of gdp understates increases in government spending in the short term particularly in years when growth is high for example those who claim that government spending increased sharply in 2000 point to the fact that it increased by 25 in constant dollars those who claim the increase was modest point to the fact that it fell by 02 percentage points of gdp since this report focuses on longterm trends all measurements are made as percentage of gdphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs3 5 the data reported in budget documents are net receipts and net outlays and do not include offsetting receipts and collections which are scribed below this report will follow the standard convention of defining receipts and outlays as net measurements unless otherwise noted 6 see also crs report rl30520 the national debt who bears its burden by marc labonte and gail makinen and crs report rl31775 do budget deficits raise interest rates and is this the

and receipts 19502007the size of the government can be measured by expenditures outlays or revenues receipts5 at times when the budget deficit is rge the difference between the two measures is significant as seen in figure 1 measured by receipts the size of government in the postwar period peaked in 2000 measured by outlays the size of government peaked in 1983 in 2000 the peak year as measured by receipts outlays were at their lowest level since 1966 government has grown since 2000 when measured by outlays and shrunk measured by receipts source omb budget of the us government historical tables table 12 note data measured on fiscal year basis there are two main reasons why outlays might be considered better measure of the size of government than receipts first receipts are more volatile than outlays and are only indirectly controlled by legislators they are particularly sensitive to economic conditions receipts did not peak in 2000 because of changes in the tax code but because of the interaction between the tax code and the extremely rapid growth in taxable income second outlays and revenue s can temporarily diverge because of budget deficits but eventually the budget must be brought back into balance therefore cutting taxes without corresponding spending cuts does not permanently reduce the size of government and measuring the si ze of government by revenues gives the misleading impression that government is sm aller than it is furthermore although people often refer to the burde n of high taxes that burde n cannot be avoided in the long run through deficits because deficits impose burden that is every bit as real as taxes6 in other words given level of spe nding requires the resources of individualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs4 7 mandatory spending programs for which the elderly are major beneficiaries include social security medicare supplemental security inco veterans benefits and federal civilian and military pensions this calculation does not include medicaid which finances long term caretaxpayers whether deficit financed or tax financed all that changes is the timing of its incidence while it is sometimes argued that deficits hold down the growth in spending for political reasons deficits directly increase the outlays needed to maintain fixed level of government services in the future by increasing interest payments on the national debt in other word s if spending is constant over time 1 tax cut today will lead to tax increase of 1 plus com pounded interest in the future this raises further question if interest payments are the direct result of deferring payments for past spending to the present should they be included in comparisons of the size of government over time including net interest payments as current practice does makes the government appear to be larger following periods of large deficits relative to the period before the deficits excluding them gives different budget picture for example high interest payments in the 1990s and 2000s obscure the fact that other outlays at the time were as small as they had been in the 1960s since this report focuses on longterm trends it measures the size of government by spending when measur ed by outlays the size of government followed an upward trend til 1983 and has followed dow nward trend ever since outlays rose from 147 of gdp in 1947 to 235 in 1983 they then fell to 184 of gdp in 2000 and have increased since outlays were below 20 of gdp from 19471974 with the exception of 1953 nd 1968 above 20 of gdp from 1975 1996 and were below 20 of gdp from 1997 to 2002 but r eached 20 of gdp again in 2003 and 20052007 look at total spending masks the large compositional changes in spending over th postwar period in nutshell the governments largest activity has gone from national defense in the 1960s to transfers to the elderly to day defense spending peaked at 95 of gdp in 1968 it then fell to 47 of gdp in 1978 rose to 62 of gdp in 1986 before beginning sharp decline and stood at 40 of gdp in 2007 at the same time mandatory spending excluding net interest has risen from 49 of gdp in 1962 to 106 in 2007 mandatory spending programs for which the elderly are major beneficiaries make up nearly thr eequarters of all ma ndatory spending7 non defense discretionary spending whic h includes spending on transportation education the environment and numerous other government activities grew from 34 of gdp in 1962 to 52 in 1980 it has been below 4 of gdp since 1984 and stood at 36 of gdp in 2007 net inte rest on the publicly held national debt grew significantly in the 1980s and 1990s because of the governments budget deficits in the postwar period to the 1980s it had always been below 2 of gdp in the 1980s and early 1990s it exceeded 3 of gdphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs5 source omb budget of the us government historical tables table 84 note data measured on fiscal year basis this data series not available before 1962 it is useful to remember that federal spending is overwhelmingly devoted to handful of activities defense spending social security medicare medicaid and interest payments on the nati onal debt accounted for nearly twothirds of all federal outlays today thus any proposal to redu ce the governments size would be unlikely to make much of dent in overall spendi ng unless it reduced one or more of these programs government transfers and govern ment purchases of goods and services have different and distinct effects on the economy economists draw distinction between government outlays spent on goods and services purchased from the private sector or produced directly by the government and outlays that transfer resources from one set of private individuals taxpayers to another since significant portion of government spending is devoted to government transfers to individuals much of the revenue collected through taxation is ultimately spent by the private sector on private sector goods nd services after it is transferred by the government gove rnment transfers do not employ us capital and labor except to administer those transfers in the same way as government production of

government not included interest is defined as net interest paid on the national debt subsidies are measured as net outlays to government corporations transfers can result in vertical redist ribution transfers among income classes or horizontal redistribution transfers unrelat ed to income class most transfers on the spending side of the budget result in horizontal redistributi on for example the largest portion of government transfers are directed to the elderly notably through social security social security contains an element of vertical redistribution in that the taxbenefit formula is more favorable as income declines but its main function is horizontal redistribution another large category of tran sfers is devoted to interest on the national debt which represents transfer from taxpayers to bondholders transfers also include net subsidies to g overnment corporations which are discussed below the largest portion of government production is directed to national

revenue gain from repealing all tax expenditures simultaneously si nce that would lead to interactions among the repeal of different expenditures 12 generally the refundable portion of tax expenditure is counted as an outlay but very few expenditures are refundable so only small proportion of total tax expenditures is counted as outlays refundable credits are tax credits which are paid when the taxpayer has tax liabilitythe distinction between government transfers and government production of goods and services becomes important when making historical comparisons total federal outlays have remained in the rang of 20 with slow upward trend for most of the postwar period but this masks larg changes in the composition of federal outlays since the 1950s outlays for fede ral production and tran sfers have moved in the opposite direction while governme nt production was nearly three times as large as government transfers in the ear ly 1950s production is only half as large as transfers

spending and whic h is preferable depends on which is more effective or efficient way of achieving any partic ular goal for example 1000 child tax credit is equivalent to the government sending check for 1000 to parents who have eligible children and meet the credits income requirements similarly tax deduction for mortgage interest for taxpayer in the 33 marginal income tax bracket is equivalent to the government sending the taxpayer check for 33 cents for every dollar of mortgage interest paid fr om revenue perspec tive the equivalence comes from the fact that marginal rates must be raised to the same extent to finance an expenditure whether it is tax expenditure or an outlay because tax provisions are permanent unless they include an ex piration date howev er revenue loss from specific expenditures may rise over time au tomatically without congressional action unlike appropriated spending if this equivalence argume nt is correct measures of the size of government that omit tax expe nditures drastically unde restimate its size measuring the size of government by receipts or outlays omits offsetting receipts and collections the outlay and revenue totals discussed here and in the federal budget are net measures and do not include offsetting r eceipts and collections these are the income that the government receives primarily from busine sslike activities many are user fees mostly the offsetting recei pts and collections go directly toward the provision of those activities for which they were collected in some cases without appropriation these include r eceipts collected directly by the government for health care premiums through medicare part b na tional park user fees and proceeds from the sale of government resources they also include receipts collected by government corporations defined below such as the postal service the export import bank and the federa l deposit insurance corporation the receipts and collections are not included in revenues nd the outlays that they fund are subtracted from total outlays omb justifies the exclusion of offse tting receipts and collections from the budget on the gr ounds that t he budget focuses on outlays and r eceipts that measure governmental activity rather than combination of governmental and market activity13 what should be realized is that ev if offsetting collections and receipts are not included in the budget as revenues b ecause they represent choices made in the marketplace ie they are not compulsory like taxes removing them from revenues also causes the activities that they finance to be removed from the outlay side of the budget some budget analysts argue that th is keeps many of the financed activities outside the oversight nd deliberation of the nnual appropria tion process regardless of whether offsetting receipts and collections finance public goods or governmentprovided p rivate goods when thinking about the size of the government in relation to private economic activity it may be sensible to include them and they are not an insignificant sum in 2007 offsetting collections and receipts totaled 3207 billion about 117 as large as outlays included in the budget table 2 lists offsetting receipts and coll ections that exceeded 10 billion inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs10 14 for example the general accounting office estimates that the user fees it studied

have in common are legal characteristics that in some way link them to the government for example the gses were federally chartered by the government and have special borrowing privileges from the us govern ment however they are shareholder owned corporations with mana gement structures independe nt of the government and do not receive government ppropriations although their tie s to government increase the firms market value19 the focus on an annual cash flow budget neglects the fact that policy decisions made today can have longrun consequences that are not reflected in todays budget this can occur in number of ways many recent tax cuts and spending programs are being phased in over numbe r of years for example under pl107 16 signed into law in 2001 the estate tax will not be eliminated until 2010 spending on multiyear projects can lead to implicit future spending commitments even if explicit commitments are not made for example once military hardware investment project begins it may be highly impractical to stop funding the project before it has been complete d nevertheless defense sp ending like all discretionary spending is assumed to grow at the rate of inflation in the budget baseline and future budget totals are not adjusted fo r multiyear spending projects mandatory spending can increase with change in law when the number of eligible beneficiaries increases the ex ample of this phenomenon that dwarfs all others under current policy is entitlement spending on the aged under current policy the retirement of the baby boomers and the increase in life expectancy are projected to cause spending on social security medicare and medicaid to increase from 74 of gdp in 2000 to 188 of gdp in 208020 while the spending increase will not occur until the

time22 the shortcoming of cash flow budgeting as measure of size of government is best expressed in the question does the more than doubling of elderly entitlement spending as percentage of gdp projected under current policy really imply any growth in the size of government when the benefits each individual receives remain the same spending and tax revenue are not the only ways to think about the size of the government the government can arguably have bigger smaller role in the economy without spending more less govern ment regulation in the form of laws regulations or mandates undoubtedly has an economic impact every bit as real as spending or taxation but the cost of regulation is difficult to quantify and is not measured overall by any official source23 and yet to ignore it in discussions of the size of government could be misleading for example consider government proposal to reduce the consumption of pr oduct gasoline cigarettes alcohol and so on the government could reduce cons umption by paying people not to use the product or paying them to us an alternative which woul d be counted as an increase in government outlays the government could tax the product to reduce its use by making it more costly which would be counted as an increase in government revenues or it could pass re gulations forbidding or restricting its use which would not show up on either side of the budgets ledger yet all th ree proposals could be crafted to have the exact same effect on the quantity of the good consumed effect of the government on economic efficiency how can policymakers determine the appropriate role of the government in the economy most economists judge the econo mic merit of any g overnment program based on its effect on economic efficiency does larger government raise economic efficiency or lower efficiency the only overarching answer that can be offered is it depends economic theory is clear that government intervention has the potentialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs14 to improve efficiency when market failures exist but is likely to reduce efficiency when markets are already perfect which is defined below in reality government intervenes both in cases of market failure and in cases where markets are already operating relatively efficiently as result some government policies raise economic efficiency and some lower efficiency by means are all spending decisions made by the government today justified on efficiency grounds if it were possible to isolate and eliminate all actions which lowered efficiency economic welf are could hypothetically be improved by reducing the size of government li kewise one could identify areas where government intervention could improve curre ntly uncorrected market failures and larger government would theoreti cally improve economic efficiency before discussing what constitutes market failure it is useful to define economic efficiency which differs from popul ar parlance as opposed to its popular usage economic efficiency does not involve economic growth wealth or productivity in fact one can think of exam ples where efficiency is at loggerheads with these goals generally an outcome is economically efficient if the marginal cost of producing one more unit of good is equivalent to the marginal benefit of consuming one more unit of the good wh markets function perfectly which is defined as market with many buyers and sellers barriers to entry perfect information and the costs and benefits of the transaction are completely borne by the buyer and seller an economically efficient outcome will occur and government intervention can only reduce efficiency when there are market failures government intervention has the potential to improve efficiency by moving away from the economically inefficient outcome produced by the market while economic efficiency is easy to define theoretically discord arises when applied to actual government policies typically an efficiencyenhancing measure cannot be produced without being accompanie d by efficiencyreducing side effects for example without our cr iminal justice system markets could not operate but criminal justice system cannot be operated without taxes that are likely to take efficiencyreducing form while there is broad consensus that taxfinanced criminal justice system is efficiencyimproving on net at some level there is likely to be disagreement as to whether the benefit derived from marginal increase in resources devoted to criminal justice from current levels would exceed the costs of marginal increase in taxation to finance it furthermore the democra tic process is conducive to compromises that include mixture of efficiencyenhancing and efficiencyreducing measures judging the balance between the two is unlikely to produce wide consensus economic theory can describe the economic be nefits and costs of br oad policy approach but cannot predict how the compromise that emerges from the legislative process will differ from the policy as originally conceived measuring efficiency gains and losses of any proposal is more difficult when other policie s are also distorting market personal differences in opinion on these matters go long way toward explaining the wide ideological diversity with in the economics professionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs15 24 private producers have found ways to provide some public goods for instance broadcast television and radio is nonrival and nonexcludable but can nevertheless be privately financed by advertising 25 to clarify the economic meaning of public good which may differ from popular usage it is useful to point out one government serv ice that does not meet the economic definition of public good education education is an excludable good sc hool could conceivably close its doors to keep individuals out if it wi shed education is also rival good book used by one student cannot be used by anotherwhat is market failure to understand when government inte rvention in the economy can increase economic efficiency it is necessary to define market failure before doing so it is useful to give examples of what is not market failure in equality poverty fraud discrimination bankruptcy layo ffs high prices and so on are not market failures as defined by economic theory while th ey are undesirable phenomena which may be valid targets of public policy they are problems that either are not economic in nature or do not meet the definition of economic inefficiency they do not involve mismatch between marginal cost and marginal benefit in economic theory the following are major types of market failures public goods there are some beneficial g oods that will not be provided by the market because they are nonexcl udable people cannot be prevented from using the good and they are nonrival one persons use of the good does not diminish anothers use for those two reasons private producer has incentive to supply the good economists refer to g oods meeting these two criteria as public goods which are often provide d only by the government24 the classic example of public good is national defense wh ile private armies might be capable of defending the country there is incentiv to form private army because nobody would voluntarily pay for its services ca lled the free rider problem that is because once an army is in place it has means to defend its customers from attack without also defending noncustomers only government with the power of taxation can raise the funds to finance an army similar public goods include basic knowledge which once discovered can be joyed by all and the civil and criminal justice system much of which eg property rights dispute settlement contract enforcement makes market transactions possible25 because public goods are not transacted through the marketplace it is difficult to determine whether government overspe nds or underspends on their provision the value of any given public good is differe nt for different people and the political process must sort their preferences rather than the marketplace for example could an acceptable level of national defense be attained at lower cost or is the nation not secure enough at current levels of sp ending during peacetime these questions cannot be definitively answered common resources another type of good that cannot be efficiently provided by the market is common resource such as the environment ocean fishing and certain water supplies unlik public goods these resources are rival fish or glass of water consumed by one person cannot be consumed by another buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs16 the resources are not excludabl because they cannot be assi gned property rights for that reason they may be overconsumed and can be depleted or even exhausted over time in the absence of government interven tion as result government control or regulation is necessary for an efficient and sustainable use of the resources it is coincidence that some of the common resour ces in danger of depletion are those such as ocean fishing and the environment that do not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of single national government with single sovereign entity over consumption is harder to prevent although the government has the potential to achieve economic efficiency through the regulation of common resour ces its intervention may not move the resource closer to efficient use in practi ce for example many governments have subsidized the fishing industry potentially exacerbating the depletion of ocean fisheries and because common resources also cannot be valued through the marketplace estimating the appr opriate level of government intervention is difficult monopoly power one reason perfect competition leads to economically efficient outcomes is because any one pr oducer does not have enough market power to push prices above marginal cost monopoly producers can do so to earn economic rents excess pr ofits by reducing production to an inefficiently low level theoretically ther could also be consumers with monopoly power in which case the outcome would be economically inefficient because price would be driven below marginal cost monopoly can occur for many reasons including barriers to entry legal or natural and economies of scale in the narrowest definition of the word market with single producer monopolies tend to exist only when marginal cost is continually declining pr oducing one more good is always less expensive than producing the previous good this speci case known as natural monopoly tends to occur in markets where consumpti on of g ood is nonri val one persons consumption does not come at the expense of anothers utilities electricity water cable telephone are the most common examples in most markets neither natural m onopoly nor perfect competition exists the best description for what does exist is termed monopolistic competition where each company makes product that is distinct but highly substitutable with its rival eg the big mac vs th whopper in the fa stfood hamburger market so that each company has some market power in monopolistic competition production is still inefficiently low but closer to the fficient point than in pure monopoly and economic rents do not exist as the num ber of firms increases and difference between products decreases the monopolistic competition outcome approaches the perfect competition case economic theory suggests that governments can increase economic efficiency by increasing monopolys production to its efficient point through regulation or direct ownership both approaches have been used historically for utilities over the past three decades questions have been raised whether government intervention can truly raise economic efficiency even in the case of natural monopolies given the political intervention complexity lack of profit motive and distorted incentives thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs17 26 for example see richard posner the social costs of monopoly and regulation journal of political economy vol 83 4 august 1975 p 807regulation produces for the monopoly26 some economists have argued that even when significant market concentration exists with the exception of the natural monopolies the potential for competition is powerful enough to deter producers from maximizing monopoly rents even when robus t competition does not currently exist it is noteworthy that government has rarely attempted to intervene to improve efficiency in monopolistic competition even though theoretical case could be made to do so in cases where it has such as the airline and trucki ng industries economic regulation has been widely deemed failure and eliminated monopolies are not always less effici ent than perfect competition and sometimes they are fostered by the govern ment for that reas on for example as required by the constitution the government grants patents and copyrights so that inventors and authors can enjoy monopoly pr ofits for their work without these governmentcreated monopolies there woul d frequently not be sufficient incentive to undertake those activities externalities in the market for many goods and services all the costs and benefits inherent in the consumption nd production of good are borne by the buyer and seller but some goods also creat externalities in their consumption or producti on positive externalities are benefits enjoyed by third parties negative externalities are costs borne by third parties again it is difficult to determine how much government intervention is required to correct an externality since the externality cannot be valued in the marketplace pollution is the classic case of negative externality society as whole bears the cost of environmental degradation nd there is incentive for the consumer or producer to take these societal costs in to account as result from societal perspective the good is overproduced and overconsumed in the free market outcome if good generates negative externality it does not mean that good should not be consumed it means that to maximize social welfare the consumption of the good should be reduced to the level that reflects its social costs vaccines are an example of positive exte rnality when someone is vaccinated against communicable disease society as whole benefits since that person can longer contract the disease and spread it to others from societal perspective vaccines would be underproduced and underc onsumed in the absence of government intervention some social goals are often popularly ju stified on the grounds that they generate positive externalities but the criteria to qualify as an externality are strict and economists are divided if social goals qualif for example home ownership is often viewed as generating positive externalities because home owners are viewed as having higher incomes having higher rates of civic par ticipation and committing fewer crimes than renters however it is not clear that home ownership causes incomes and civic participation to be higher and crime to be lower or if it justhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs18 27 see edward leamer and jesse shapiro the benefits of the home mortgage interest deduction nber working paper 9284 october 2002happens to be correlated w ith other personal attributes that cause these outcomes27 similar arguments apply to education asymmetric information competitive markets only work efficiently when both buyer and seller are well informed in some markets the buyer may be more informed than the seller or vice versa when this happens the market outcome is inefficient for example in insuranc markets buyers know more about their riskiness than sellers as result only buyers with higher risks will tend to purchase more insurance because they are more certain that the benefit of the insurance will exceed the cost this pushes up the price of insurance and hampers insurers efforts to pool risk when government is able to provide information to the uninformed party or make participation mandatory it can move the market back to an efficient outcome for auto insurance many st ate governments make some insurance mandatory to avoid the problem of asy mmetric information for employment insurance the government provides the insu rance directly the insurance market is also distorted by moral hazard which occurs when the insured party acts more recklessly as result of the insurance for example some drivers may be more likely to speed or run red lights when they become insured pushing up the price of automobile insurance asymmetric information is also used as rationale for financial regulation referred to as the principalagent problem the manager of company or bank may not have the same incentives eg the costs of risktaking as shareholders or depositors information disclosure and accounting laws can increase the information available to monitor the behavior of managers failure to optimize finally the assumption in economic theory that people make rational optima l economic decisions that ma ximize their wellbeing may be invalid in many cases wi thout this ssumption an array of possible government interventions has the potential to improve wellbeing an assumption that individuals do not optimize underlies diverse arguments such as social security is necessary because people do not save enough primary education should be mandatory the federal reserve should prev ent stock market bubbles and drug use should be illegal by its nature the failure to optimize in any given market is the hardest to prove or disprove much economic analysis is based on the construction of theoretical models based on optimizing individuals which are then tested against empirical evidence in many cases the models may be good approx imation of reality not because everyone is rational but because any individuals making different mistakes nearly cancel each other out failure of the evidence to match the model is not necessarily proof that individuals are not optimizing the model could simply be specified thus far robust testable models in which individuals do not optimize have not attained widespread usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs19 28 the tax on labor is not inefficient because it reduces labor supply theoretically the tax could result in less labor supply because the reward to work has diminished or more labor supply because more work is needed to reach gi ven income level it is the change in the relationship between consumption and leisure and not the direction of the change that makes the tax economically inefficient these effects are called substitution and income effects respectively and are discussed in detail below in the section on the size of government and economic growth 29 see martin feldstein tax avoidance and the deadweight loss of income taxation nber working paper 5055 march 1995 30 the link between taxes and spending can be temporarily broken through deficit financing deficitfinanced tax cuts do not necessarily ra ise efficiency however 1 deficitfinanced tax cut in effect is promise that taxes will be raised or spending will be cut by more than 1 in the future because of interest costs less inefficient spending is cut in the future deficit financing results in net loss in economic efficiency over time 31 see for example n gregory mankiw principles of microeconomics fort worth dryden press 1997 p 167 32 when the government provides private goods goods and services that are exclusive and rival it is more economically efficient for th em to be purchased directly by the consumer than financed through taxation many governmentprovided private g oods are already continuedhow do taxes affect economic efficiency economic theory characterizes taxes as reducing economic efficiency by distorting changing the behavior being taxed relative to all other behavior thus moving behavior away from the efficient market allocation where marginal benefit equals marginal cost this is the case if the behavior being taxed does not result in negative externalities if it does then the market allocation was not efficient to begin with thus sales tax on specific g ood eg passenger air travel changes the choice between the taxed good and nontaxe d goods as well as the relationship between taxed goods and saving likewise wage tax sh ifts workers allocation of his time between labor and leisure away from an efficient balance the balance that maximizes his welfare28 in the real world there is also the possibility that taxes on labor inefficiently shift behavior from taxable compensation to nontaxable compensation such as nontaxable benefits29 is economic efficiency reduced on bala nce by taxation that question cannot be answered in isolation of the other side of the government balance sheet taxes finance government and as described bove certain government interventions can increase economic efficiency30 whether any given policy increases or decreases economic efficiency depends on whether the efficiency cost of the taxes needed to finance it outweighs the policys benefits furthermore efficiency losses are difficult to estimate particularly in the presence of other policies that change the market outcome this is why broad statement can be made about whether the overall size of government is inefficiently large or small economic theory suggests that the efficiency loss from tax increases geometrically as the tax increases31 t h i s suggests that as government gets larger and tax rates get higher fewer new government programs would generate effi ciency gains large enough to offset the efficiency losses caused by their financing32 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs20 32 continued financed through user fees and are omitted from the budget see the section above on offsetting receipts and collections 33 most economists view the tax reform act of 1986 pl99514 as good example of tax reform that followed this principle 34 tax expenditures raise distributional issues compared to spending unless they are refundable income tax expenditures are only available to entities with taxable income which excludes many lower income households furthermore when tax expenditures take the form of tax deductions they are regressive because the value of the deduction increases as taxable income increases as the taxpayers marginal tax bracket increasesand yet the efficiency losses of high taxes should not be overstated that is because not all taxes distort behavior for example capitation tax fixed dollar tax that everyone must pay results in efficiency loss matter how high taxes are set because there is way to avoid the tax short of death or emigration while the example of capitation tax is extreme in general economists assert that the efficiency losses from taxation could be much lower than they are in our current system if the tax base were broadened so that an equiva lent amount of revenue could be raised with lower marginal tax rates33 it is exemptions deductions tax credits and the like that narrow the tax base and requi re marginal tax rates to be as high as they are if the tax base were broadened spe nding could be judged more on its own merits than on the costs of financing it unlike the case for smaller government where economists are sharply divided the case for broader tax base garners wide consensus among economists this suggests that considering the optimal size of government is best done on the spending si the efficiency case against taxes is more case for tax reform than tax reduction the case for broadening the tax base raises further point putting aside the spending side of the budget not all tax cu ts increase economic efficiency from an economic perspective unless they correct for an externality tax expenditures credits exemptions exclusions deductions preferential rates or deferrals reduce efficiency by creating distortions in econo mic behavior in many ways they are economically equivalent to spending and the economic di stortions they create are different than the distor tions created by an equivalent spending policy34 1000 child tax credit is different than the government paying every eligible parent 1000 per child likewise the mortgage interest deduction is different than paying every mortgageholder in the 15 tax bracket 015 for every dollar in mortgage interest they pay it is only reductions in marginal rates that increase economic efficiency just like spending tax expenditures increase economic efficiency only if they distor t behavior that suffers from market failure and they are not generally better or worse than an equi valent spending provision at doing so if tax expenditures are not aimed at correcting market failure they can divert economic resources from efficient producti on to the inefficient pursuit of the economic rents that the tax code creates such as tax shelters other tax expenditures cause marginal ra tes to be higher without any meaningful change in the targeted behavior for example there is little evidence that more children are born as result of the child tax credit if that is the case the credit mainly serves as transfer to parents from taxpayers in economic terms windfall since parents need not change anything to receive the credithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs21 35 many economists have devised sophisticated theories for achieving optimum income redistribution based on various so cial principles for exampl economists have developed different redistribution schemes based on an qual sacrifice principle that tax rates should be set by income status such that taxes reduce the welfare of all taxpayers equally so that high income individuals pay higher taxes but there is way to use economic theory to judge which theory of redistribution is most fair for an introduction and bibliography see richard musgrave fairness in taxation in joseph cordes et the encyclopedia of taxation and tax policy washington urban in stitute press 1999 p 117 36 see crs report rl32059 trade trade barriers and trade deficits implications for us economic welfare by craig elwell 37 see harold hochman and james rodger s pareto optimal redistribution american continuedthe case for tax simplification is also based on the goals of minimizing administrative cost complexity and evas ion all of which create economic costs in addition to the efficiency costs discussed above balancing economic efficiency with other goals it is crucial to remember that an policy also has noneconomic costs and benefits economic efficiency is certain ly not the only criterion for public policy equity fairness and justice are just fe w social goals that economists cannot judge quantitatively there are many social goals that policymakers may wish to pursue and they often consider whether social be nefits outweigh the efficiency loss for example civil and criminal justice system is not maintained primarily for its effect on economic efficiency but for its effect on justice equity morality and fairness progressive income tax system is less economically efficient than capitation tax but economics says nothing about whethe r the capitation tax is more socially desirable because it cannot weigh the effici ency loss against the equity motive for having progressive tax system economist can offer precise estimate of whether the economic costs and benefits of any proposal will outweigh its social costs and benefits35 economists can however evaluate how to achieve social goal in the least economically costly way for exampl economists genera lly applauded the governments decision to deal with the social costs of worker displacement from nafta by coupling free trade with work er retraining programs and extended unemployment benefits for displaced worker s this was viewed by economists as more economically efficient than preventing working displacement through trade barriers so that the gains from trade to consumers can still be enjoyed36 and in some cases public sector provision of social goal may be more economically efficient than private sector provision for example it may not be possible for the private sector to efficiently provide unemployment insurance because of the asymmetric information problems desc ribed above gove rnment provision of unemployment insurance can potentially achieve efficiency while simultaneously contributing to the social goal of prev enting economic hardship likewise some economists have argued that income redi stribution can only be carried out at an efficient level by the state because it is public good prone to underprovision in the marketplace because of the freerider problem37httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs22 37 continued economic review vol 59 4 september 1969 p 542 38 an argument has been made by fatas and mihov that larger governments can more effectively stabilize the business cycle in the short run because they have relatively larger automatic stabilizers automatic stabilizers are changes in spending and revenue that increase the deficit thereby boosting aggreg ate demand and occur without policy changes the authors offer international evidence s upporting this theory this argument can be criticized however on the grounds that there is nothing preventing smaller governments from using discretionary monetary and fiscal policy effectively mitigating the reliance on automatic stabilizers see antonio fatas and ilian mihov government size and automatic stabilizers international and intranational evidence journal of international economics october 2001effect of the government on economic growth arguments surrounding the size of governme nt are often posed in terms of their effects on economic growth like the section on efficiency this section argues that the effect of government spending on ec onomic growth can only be judged on case bycase basis but more generally the problem with using growth as policy evaluation criterion is that it tells nothing about overall welfar which includes non economic benefits such as quality of life unlike efficiency economists view growth at best as one effect of policy to be considered and not goal in and of itself even in cases where the effect on growth is positive society may be made worse off as thought experiment c onsider the effects of mandatory 80hour work week it would be expected to incr ease economic growth but society would be worse off nonetheless since economic efficiency cannot be easily measured growth will often be the best alternative criterion available the question of the relationship between the size of government and economic growth is of longterm nature thus distinction should be made between short term fluctuations in growth due to the bus iness cycle and the longterm sustainable growth rate of the economy for that reason arguments for or against larger government cannot be based on the ability of an increase in the budget deficit to increase aggregate spending in the economy in the short run notice that these short run effects are consistent with certain defi nitions of both larger government higher spending with constant taxe s and smaller government c onstant spending with lower taxes38 longterm growth increases in output is caused by increases in the labor supply hours worked or number of wo rkers the physical capital stock or productivity when the size of the labor force grows with the population there would be effect on per capita growth however growth in the physical capital stock is made possible by na tional savings or borrowing from abroad for the size of the government to affect longterm gr owth it must affect one of these three sources of growth all four types of gove rnment behavior spendi ng transfers taxes and regulation have the pot ential to influence these three sources of growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs23 39 see for example william niskanen bureaucracy and representative government chicago aldineather ton publishers 1971 40 for description of bls program that attempted to measure government productivity see bureau of labor statistics the federal productivity measurement program monthly labor review may 1997 p 19 by its estimate government productivity rose 11 year from 19671994 compared to 15 nonfarm business productivity growth over that period the article lists several reasons why the government and business productivity are non comparable this program has been discontinuedeffect of spending portion of gross domestic product gdp is produced by the government like private firm the government purchas inputs from the private sector eg the military purchases tanks and airplanes from private defense contractors and labor eg soldiers to produce final good or rvice eg national defense but unlike firm most government goods and servi ces like defense are not bought and sold in the private market and so there is way to value them nevertheless these goods and services are part of the nati ons gdp to prepare the gdp accounts the bureau of economic analysis values government production unlike private production by measuring the inputs rather th an the output this makes it difficult to measure the effect of government production on the economy empirically even if there are good empirical reasons for believing it to have an effect there is little reason to believe government spending has any direct effect on increases in the labor force since the number of jobs available expands to accommodate increases in the labor for ce over the long run but it may affect productivity gains over time so have argued that the lack of competition and the profit incentive in the government sect or leads to less innovation and lower productivity gains over time39 empirical tests of the proposition may yield little meaningful information however because of the way that government gdp is recorded in the private sector productiv ity growth occurs when the same inputs yield higher output than previously si nce government gdp is based on inputs and output is not measurable because it is not bought and sold in the marketplace there is direct way to tell how much gove rnment productivity is growing over time40 there is also the question of magnitude are differences between public and private sector productivity growth rates significant enough to have meaningful effect on economic growth as thought experiment consider that government output including state nd local accounted for about 20 of gdp in 2007 if private sector productivity growth is 2 and government productiv ity growth is only half as high total output growth will only be 02 percentage points lower year than if productivity were the same in both sect ors in that case reducing government production by half would onl raise productivity growth by 01 percentage points likewise if the governments productivity gr owth rate were higher than the private sectors the effect would be too small to make much of an impact on the overall productivity rate if anything this calculation may overstate the productivity differential since some govern ment output is produced by private sector contractors who presumably have pr oductivity growth rates s imilar to the rest of the private sector httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs24 01234567 1950 1958 1966

while possibly subject to lower productivity growth in their production alter private sector productivity growth for example government enforcement of property rights may lead to more entrepreneurial activity and new road ma reduce the costs of shipping private sector goods to market in these cases reducing government sp ending could lower total productivity growth by lowering pr ivate sector productivity growth even if government productivity growth is lower than private sector productivity growth increasing other government goods and services could lower private sector productivity growth thus far this section has focused on government spending on consumption goods and services but government spe nding can also finance public capital goods which increases the national capital

between defense and nondefense41 whether an additional dollar of spe nding on government output directly increases or decreases growth depends on wh at it is replacing to the extent that government capital spending replaces private consumption there will be net increase in economic growth through hi gher capital stock conversely to the extent that government consumption spending replaces private investment there will be net decrease in growth whether gove rnment or private investment yields higher rate of return for the economy will vary on casebycase basis and both are prone to diminishing returns to investment as investment spending is increased42 effect of transfers government spending on transfers to indi viduals has direct effect on the level of aggregate private output aside from administrative costs transfers only affect the distribution of private output the transfer recipient uses transfer funds to buy goods and services from the private sector or to save rather than the taxpayer who finances the transfers the effect on economic growth of transfers comes from the distortion in incentives caused by the transfer both on the taxpayer as discussed in the next section and the recipient since the largest recipients of transfers are retirees it is useful to consider the effects on that gr oup social security payments and other government pensions and ag ebased transfers may reduce the private saving rate by replacing private saving for retirement lthough the offset would not be one for one since some retirees do not save adequately for their retirement since these transfers are financed on payasyougo basis there is arguably public saving to offset the reduction in private saving reducing national saving th programs may also lead to earlier retirement than would otherwise occur reducing output through smaller labor force transfers for the elderly also incorporate number of insurancelike functions protecting the elderly against the risk of disability outliving their assets spousal death and so on these insuran celike functions may reduce the need for private precautionary saving43httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs26 are transfers to the elderly illadvi sed because they may reduce economic growth this example illustrates why effi ciency is better economic criterion for judging programs than growth the releva nt question is not whether the insurance like qualities of these transfers reduce private saving but whether the government can provide insurance more efficiently th an the private sector because of market failures in the private insurance market adverse selection moral hazard and incomplete markets in other words market failures in the insurance market can lead to individuals saving too much nd government intervention has the potential to make them better off by reducing the risky contingencies for which they were previously saving as result of g overnment intervention saving and economic growth would fall but economic efficiency would increase another major category of transfers are meanstested transfers meanstested transfers can potentially reduce growth by creating an incentive for recipients to keep income or wealth or hours worked below the point where benefits are phased out the incentive can be reduced by phasing transfers out more slowly as income increases the effect of meanstested transfers on economic growth are often weighed against their effect on noneconomic goals economists are least fond of transfers th at are economically inefficient and do not serve any broad social goal for example subsidies to specific industries or sectors of the economy may reduce economic efficiency by causing overproduction in those industries the introduction of an industrial subsidy would be expected to lead to onetime reduction in gdp as th economys resources are reallocated to less efficient outcome it is less clear if industrial subsidie s would reduce economic growth on an ongoing basis they may do so if they reduce competition and the incentive to innovate at the same time the benefits of the subsidy are highly concentrated and generally do not accrue to broad groups on nondiscriminatory basis for example workers in the indus try being subsidized are made better off even though their income level and employme nt situation may be superior to those in other industries that are not being subsidized effect of taxes by changing economic behavior taxes have the potential to affect overall growth taxes on saving could change savi ng rates and thereby investment rates and taxes on labor could change the labor supply theoretically income tax reduction which affects saving and bor could increase or decrease economic growth that is because tax cut affects behavior in two ways first it increases the rewards to work relative to leisure giving the worker an incentive to work more this is known as the substitution effect second it increases th workers aftertax income such that he must work less to maintain his previous standard of living this gives him an incentive to work less and is known as the income effect theoretically there is way to know wh ether the substitution or income effect dominates for any given tax it is an empirical question httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs27 44 for more extensive treatment of the issues discussed in this section see crs report rl31949 issues in dynamic revenue estimating by jane gravelle 45 see orley ashenfelter and richard layard handbook of labor economics amsterdam elsevier science publishers 1986 ch 12empirically the evidence is divided on the size and even direction of the effects on saving and labor44 some studies have concluded that labor supply increases in response to tax cuts others that it falls in any case most studies find the response to be small there is evidence that th response of certain demographic groups are greater than others workingaged male adults are overwhelmingly already employed fulltime so there is relatively little scope for them to enter the labor market or greatly increase their hours in response to tax cut on the other hand female employment rates are lower and there is some evidence that there is larger labor supply response to tax cuts among female s in highincome households the labor supply of workers near the beginning or end of their career may also be more sensitive to changes in tax rates45 casual observation is c onsistent with small overall effects on labor the average work week declined through the 1960s and 1970s and has stayed relatively constant since despite the decline in marginal income tax rates since the 1980s the male labor force pa rticipation rate s followed downward trend since the 1960s and the female partic ipation rate rose dramatically for much of the postwar period but has been relatively constant since the 1990s the effect of change in taxes on labor supply is likely to be onetime effect once individuals have adjusted their labor supply in response to tax cut they will not continue to increase or decrease it in the future thus change in taxes is expected to have only onetime effect on growth through the labor supply channel the empirical evidence on saving is particularly inconclusive at glance one can see that the household saving rate has been in steady decline over the past few decades and was close to zero in the past several years despite downward trend in marginal income tax rates and taxes on capital and dramatic expansion in taxfavored savings accounts since the 1980s since saving is not motivated solely by tax rates one cannot make simple comparison between the two to explain the empirical behavior of saving requires matching the data to some theoretical notion of why people save because the motives for saving are complex the theoretical models used by economists become very complex even under simple assumptions not only the level of taxes but also the structure of the tax code affects economic growth to the extent that l oopholes in the tax code do divert resources from the pursuit of efficient market activity this too lowers economic growth although it is difficult to estimate the size of this effect and whether there is one time reduction in growth when the loophole is introduced or an ongoing reduction in growth evaluating the effects of tax cuts on gr owth cannot be done in isolation to finance tax cut spending must be redu ced other taxes must be raised or the government must borrow if tax cut is financed through lower spending or raising other taxes then the effect of those changes on longrun growth which could be negative or positive depending on the policy change would need to be weighedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs28 against the tax cut if the tax cut is fi nanced through borrowing its effect on long run growth is likely to be negative ce borrowing reduces national saving unless the positive effects on private saving and bor supply are large enough to offset the reduction in national saving effect of regulation estimating the effect of regulation on gr owth is difficult and can only be done on casebycase basis some regulations reduce output by diverting resources to noneconomic compliance costs undoubtedly other regulations enhance growth such as the positive effects of the rule of law on commerce some regulations may reduce firms output directly such as environmental regulations but be offset partially or wholly by indirect positiv economic effects such as through an improvement in public health it is important to distinguish between regulations onetime effect on output and growth and its permanent effect on growth in the longrun most onetime effects are swamped by the compounding of growth for example if environmental regulations raise firms costs reducin g the demand for their product their output will fall but after the onetime fall the regulation may have little effect on how much their output grows in the future concluding remarks the government affects economic activ ity through four primary channels government production of g oods and services transfer payments taxation and regulation measuring the size of govern ment is not straightforward exercise relying on annual federa l outlays excludes several type s of government intervention including state and local outlays tax expe nditures government corporations and offsetting receipts and collections as resu lt the government ppears to be smaller than it is in reality annual measures of government also neglect future unfunded liabilities implicit in current policy meas uring the economic impact of regulation is difficult and is not done co mprehensively or consistently government intervention increases economic efficiency when it rectifies market failures and reduces efficiency when it distorts perfectly competitive markets political choices may lead to secondbest outcomes however and some therefore argue that accepting market failures can be preferable to government intervention in some cases to be efficiencyenhancing government spending must have greater benefits than the efficiencyreducing taxes that finance it likewise tax cuts will only increase overall efficiency if they are financed by reductions in relatively less efficient spending or increases in relatively less efficient taxes in general marginal tax reductions tend to be efficiency increasing while many tax expenditures are efficiency decreasing deficitfinanced tax cuts do not increase efficiency if they are financed by larger tax increases in the futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32162crs29 not all government spending is created equally economists universally agree that some government spending on we llfunctioning legal system for example increases economic efficiency and growth agreement is nearly as universal that some government spending on subsidie s to industries for example reduces economic efficiency or growth in between are policies that are jumble of efficiencyenhancing and efficiencyreducin g provisions for this reason general conclusions can be drawn about the overall size of the governments effect on the economy it is conceivable that very large government could devote all of its spending on efficiencyenhanc ing policies and very sma ll government could devote all of its spending on efficiency reducing policies or vice versa many policies that reduce economic efficiency or growth may meet social or noneconomic goals equity fa irness and so on that make them worthwhile currently government transfers to individuals are nearly twice as large as government spending on goods and services and the primary goal of most transfers is probably not economic efficiency government intervention increases decreases longterm growth with policies that foster hinder great er work effort capital accumulation and technological innovation economic growth is not clear normative goal such as economic efficiency however some growthenha ncing policy measures may reduce economic welfare in any case economic growth has historically been stable over long periods of time suggesting that market forces tend to be stronger than the growth effects of policy changes in sum there is not an economic rationale for either big or small government per it is not so much th size of government as what government does with its spending transfer tax and regulatory policies that affects economic efficiency and growth
