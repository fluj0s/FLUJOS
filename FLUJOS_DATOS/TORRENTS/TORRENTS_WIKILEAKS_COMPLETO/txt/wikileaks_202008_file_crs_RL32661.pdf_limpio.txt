realignment in analyzing the organization of legislative committees congressional scholars have suggested three potential models for committee systems the first model distributional explains the relationship between the creation of committees and the opportunity for members to choose committee ssignments that are most relevant to their reelection the second m odel informational explains legislatures need for specialization expertise and knowledge of the executiv branch and the opportunity for members to choose committee assignments that bring differing perspectives to committees the third model party explains the relationship between party priorities and committee members support of those priorities1 each possible scheme for organizing congressional committees emphasizes different set of values the house begi nning with the legislative reorganization act of 19462 has chosen to handle committee jurisdiction in number of ways the 1946 act itself consolidated and reduced th number of committees in both the house and senate and for the first time ve sted each with specific jurisdicti on while the house has made many incremental chan ges to committee jurisdictions since 1946 its attempts at wideranging committ ee reorganization in 1974 and 1994 were unsuccessful3 the house most recently considered the organization of its committees to handle the set of issues related

to ask the secretary of homeland security whether he or she has the resources to provide reasonable security against major terrorist acts w ithin the united states and to hold the secretary accountable for the departments performance6 the house studied committee organization related to homeland security policy area in the 108th congress and created standing committee on homeland security in the 109th congress7 the commission spoke for efficiency and accountability in its recommendation the house in its choices over committee organization has demonstrated an interest in wider range of values including in c hoosing the jurisdiction it vested in the new homeland security committee and the jurisdiction over homelandsecurityrelated issues it retained in existing committees the house is expected to further st udy its committee organization during the 109th congress8 jurisdictional approaches house rule x clause 1 contains jurisdictional statement for each standing committee other clauses in this rule set out additional powers or duties of standing committees separate clause governs the permanent select committee on intelligence these jurisdictional statements employ for the most part subjectmatter terminology rather than law program or agency names unity of effort the jurisdiction vested by rule x in the armed services committee seems to reflect the kind of unity of effort in committee organization that was sought by the 911 commission the armed services committee has jurisdiction over the department of defe nse generally including the departments of the army

recommendation of the 911 commission other outside experts and its own select committee on homeland security to centralize jurisdiction over homeland security16 the house had created the select

and security policy in sundry areas of jurisdiction occupied by other committees would not be referred to the committee on homeland security on the basis of overall homeland security policy jurisdiction21 second the legislative history interpreted the new committees legislative jurisdiction over dhss organization and admin istration to be confined to organizational and administrative

of 200224 in addition in the speakers announcements on policies in the 109th congress the speaker stated that referrals of measures to the select committee on homeland security of the 108th congress will not constitute preced ent for referrals to the new standing committee on homeland security25 in remarks to the house chairman dreier commented on the jurisdictional arrangements over homeland security affecting the houses standing committees this change in house rule x which governs the committees and their legislative jurisdictions is delicately cr afted architecture it creates primary committee while recognizing the other gitimate oversight roles of existing committees we envision system of pur poseful redundancy by that we mean more than one level of oversight and an atmosphere in which the competition of ideas is encouraged with this jurisdiction and the legislativ history that i have placed in the record the department of homeland security will have more certainty as to which committee has the primary responsib ility for homeland security at the same time the american people will live w ith the assurance that we are working to prevent anything from falling through the cracks26 the committee on homeland security was the first standing committee of the house to be created since the committ ee on the budget in 1974 and the first permanent committee to be created since the permanent select committee on intelligence in 1977 differing policy perspectives an example of the house choosing openness and differing policy perspectives over jurisdictional clarity was its abolition of the joint committee on atomic energy jcae the joint committee created in law in the atomic energy act of 194627 presided over the development of nuclear weaponry and the commercializ ation of nuclear energy by the 1970s public health and environmental concerns were part of the policy bate over nuclear energyshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32661crs7 28 see crs report rl32538 911

closeness to the nuclear power industry the jurisdiction and influence of the joint committee eroded until the house abolished it in 1977 dispersing its jurisdiction to several committees28 issues can often be looked at from more than one jurisdictional perspective and the house has sometimes chosen to grant jurisdiction over an issue to committee with specific rather than general interest for example the education and the workforce committee has jurisdiction over education or labor generally29 but jurisdiction over the education of veterans is vested in the veterans affairs committee over mining schools in the res ources committee over international education in the international relations committee and over agricultural colleges in the agriculture committee30 jurisdiction over the federal civil service is vested in the government reform committee and over transportation labor in the transportation and infrastructure committee31 although the government reform committee has jurisdiction over the federal civil service the armed services committee has jurisdiction over pay promoti on retirement and other benefits and privileges of members of the armed forces32 in similar vein the house in some instances has not chosen to consolidate arguably related issues under the jurisdic tion of one or even two committees for example while the international relations committee holds jurisdiction over relations of the united states with fore ign nations generally the ways and means committee has jurisdiction over the international relations issue of trade and the financial services committee over the issue of international financial and monetary organizations33 programs administered by the nvironmental protection agency are principally within the jurisdiction of the agriculture energy and commerce resources science trans portation and infrastructure and ways and means committees34 in addition to the agencys discretionary spending being within the jurisdiction of

been tailored to particular legislative situations or ve resolved more longstanding concerns temporary committees when jurisdiction over an important issue has spanned the jurisdictions of several or many committees the house has sometimes created temporary committees with tempor ary specific jurisdiction to handle specific piece of legislation one exam ple of this kind of committee where the legislation reported became law was the select committee on the outer continental shelf which was created to write new offshore leasing law35 the committees work resulted in the outer continenta l

jurisdiction with primary refe rral to the select committee on homeland security which the house created to develop recommendations and report to the house on such matters that relate to the establishment of department of homeland security as may be referred to it by the speaker the speaker was authorized to set time limit for each standing committee to submit its recommendations on the bill only to the select committee37 the select committees work resulted in the homeland security act of 200238 the house created new select committee on homeland security for the duration of the 108th congress and vested it with the following jurisdiction 1 legislative jurisdiction the select committee may develop recommendations and report to the house by bill or otherwise on such matters that

by hres 5 agreed to in the house jan 5 1993 the temporary authorities for the other three select committees were not renewedthe jurisdiction of the select committee provided the house with focus for homeland security legislation and overs ight without immediately changing the jurisdictions of the standing committees that held jurisdiction over aspects of homeland security as mentioned earlier the house also assigned the select committee the additional function of assisting the house in determining how it might organize itself visàvis the issue of homela nd security in the future40 realigning committees the house on occasion has chosen to reduce the number of its committees by eliminating those perceived to have narrow or redundant jurisdiction and by transferring that jurisdiction to other committees for example with the beginning of the 104th congress the house terminated the district of columbia and post office and civil service committees and added their jurisdiction to that of the government reform committee it also eliminated the merchant marine and fisheries committee and distributed its jurisdiction among the armed services transportation and in frastructure and resources committees41 previously in the 103rd congress the house eliminated four select committees having legislative jurisdiction aging children youth and families hunger and narcotics abuse and control42 the house has also chosen to redistribute committees jurisdiction when it has perceived that the jurisdiction is too broa d that components of the jurisdiction are closely related to the jurisdiction of other committees or that redistribution of jurisdiction would better distribute house committees workload for example in adopting rules for the new 104th congress the house redistributed some of the jurisdiction of the energy and commerce committee the glasssteagall act to what is now the financial services committee inland waterways and railroads to

the house agreed to resolution based in part on recommendations made by the patterson committee three years after the creation of the energy department the hous redesignated the interstate and foreign commerce committee as the energy and commerce committee and gave it jurisdiction over national energy policy generally and over many components of energy policy44 in this instance the house chose to

pl 105292 112 stat 2787referral jurisdiction and the referral of legislation are closely related and the house has resolved some jurisdictional questions with rules on referral the cornerstone of the houses referral system is directive to the speaker who refers legislation in the house the speaker is to refer legislation so as to ensure to the maximum extent fe asible that each committee that has jurisdiction under clause 1 of rule x the clause and rule spelling out each committees jurisdiction over the subject matter of provision thereof of measure to be referred may consider such provision and report to the house thereon46 making legislative policy in the house therefore often re quires the referral of legislation to more than one committee primary committees to deal with the situation of several committees having jurisdictional claim to measur the house at the beginning of the 104th congress directed the speaker to designate primary committee in referring measures and to designate other committees to r eceive referral in addition or sequentially47 committee receiving the referral quentially usually does so for the consideration of only those provi sions within its jurisdiction in the 108th congress the speaker was given discretion not to designate primary committee when he determines that extraordinary circumstances justify review by more than one committee as though primary48 the speaker also has other referral options in or der to allow each committee with jurisdictional claim to have an opportunity to review piece of legislation and he ma set appropriate time limitations on referral49 so for example in referring legislation that ultimately resulted in enactment of the international religi ous freedom act of 199850 the speaker designated the international relations co mmittee as the pr imary committee since the bill dealt primarily with relations between th united states and other nations although when enacted the bill would rgely add to the foreignpolicy work of the state department the scope of legislative policy contained in the bill as introduced was broader than the legislative jurisdiction of the international

waste56 this oversight jurisdiction was added in two stages first in relation to nuclear energy in 1977 when the joint committee on atomic energy was dissolved and second in relation to all energy in 1980 when the house realigned committee jurisdiction over energy other examples of special oversig ht functions in rule x include domestic educational programs and institutions and programs of student

activities relating to homeland security including the interaction of all departments and agencies with the department homeland security60 the house has also created purely oversight committees with legislative jurisdiction when it has wished to supplement the work done in one or more committees or when it has perceived lack of coordination or integration of committees work in policy area such committees are often di rected to report findings to legislative committees for example in 1974 the house created permanent select committee on aging to conduct oversight of problems of and programs for senior citizens the creation of the committee had been ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32661crs14 61 the select committee was created in hres 988 agreed to in the house oct 8 1974 the committee was

capabilities62 joint committees the house and senate have periodically created joint committees to study particular matters some such as the joint economic committee were created permanently in law for continuing purpose63 others were created temporarily by resolution to study and make recommendations on single matter for example the joint committee on the organization of congress was to study the organization and operation of congress and recommend improvements with view toward strengthening congress s effectiveness64 other joint activities have been undertaken such as at the initiative of house and senate committees for example the house permanent select committee on intelligence and the senate select committee on intelligence conducted joint i nquiry into the activities of the us intelligence community in connection with th terrorist attacks perpetrated against our nation on september 11 200165 finally as mentioned earlier congress created the joint committee on atomic energy in the atomic energy act of 1946 and vested it with exclusive legislative jurisdiction while there are examples of temporary joint committees with legislative jurisdiction the jcae was unique among jo int committees in that it was permanent committee with such jurisdiction as alr eady mentioned the house abolished the committee in 1977 dispersing its jurisdiction66 conclusion in the years since enactment of the gislative reorganization act of 1946 the house has made many choices on its co mmittee organization including choosing nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32661crs15 to undertake wideranging reorganizations in 1974 and 1994 most change has been incremental but the house has made clear decisions on number of occasions to expand contract or reaffirm the jurisdic tion of various committees and to create or terminate committees through changes to the referral system the house has added to its flexibility in resolving jurisdictional questions the house has also distinguished between legislative and ove rsight jurisdiction again adding to its flexibility in resolving jurisdictional questions
