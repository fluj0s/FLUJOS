differences between the two sides continue over core issues such as borders security settlements the status of jerusalem refugees and water rights despite their mutual acceptance of the concept of negotiated twostate solution that would establish palestinian state alongside israel in the west bank and the gaza strip pursuant to the principle of land for peace previously when talks have faltered

process in which talks are put on hold and resumed an indefinite number of times without finality some observers dismiss these doubts as mere tactics meant to prod either or both parties to action prospects for twostate solution appear more tenuous given uncertainties that consensus supporting the peace process will hold in the face of upcoming leadership transitions in the united states and

palestinians factionalism among palestinians israeli settlements and other impediments to palestinian movement and territorial contiguity may have significantly altered the likelihood of reaching twostate solution since the signing of the oslo accord in 1993 decreased hope in the viability of twostate solution has led to openness among some israelis and palestinians to alternative solutions that appear to be contrary to us policy these alternatives each of which is the subject of considerable debate among and between israelis and palestinians include onestate solution jordanian or regional option or other unilaterallyimposed outcomes continued failure to reach twostate solution combined with lack of consensus on any of the alternatives may also mean that the status quo in the

demonstrated the flexibility of the twostate framework failures thus far they say may be less indicative of problem with the solution than of insufficient is raeli palestinian andor us political will to take action3 secondly the annapolis conference along with subsequent efforts led by the middle east quartet the united states the united nations the european union and russia has demonstrated to some that robust international support still exists for twostate solution various mechanisms have been established or revitalizedprograms to reform and strengthen the palestinian economy and the palestinian authority pa law enforcement and security apparatus in the west bank continued humanitarian and civil society assistance egyptianbrokered efforts to minimize disruptions from and possibly even work out coexistence arrangements with hamas 4 as imperfect as these mechanisms may be it is possible that they could help create an environment in which israel and the palestinians are sufficiently motivated to conclude and implement finalstatus agreement other observers believe that the annapolis process has not generated significant progress and may even represent step backward for chances at israelipalestinian peace some assert that the parties remain stalemated on the core issues of the conflict particularly jerusalem settlements and refugees and that the situation on the ground with regard to these disputed issues has become more entrenched 5 they view the most recent round of talksand the accompanying international pledges of supportas little or different in substance from other failed negotiating cycles from the oslo era another argument is that the annapolis process may not have been primarily intended to facilitate israelipalestinian peace but to advance other us israeli and sunni arab geopolitical goalssuch as consolidating support for stability in iraq6 or possibly making diplomatic overtures to syria in order to isolate iran7

palestinians that gives to moderate leaders horizon that they ca n show to their people that indeed there is twostate solution that is possible we will lose the window for twostate solution8 in line with the concerns expressed by secretar rice senior plo negotiator and former pa prime minister ahmed qurei asserted in august 2008 that if israel continues to oppose making palestinian state within the 1967 prewar borders of the west bank and gaza reality then the palestinian demand for the palestinian people and its leadership would be one state binational state9 month after qureis remarks outgoing israeli prime minister ehud olmert said in recommending negotiated as opposed to unilateral israeli withdrawal from most of the west bank and east jerusalem time is not on israels side i used to believe that everything from the jordan river bank to the mediterranean sea was ours but eventually after great internal conflict ive realized we have to share this land with the people who dwell herethat is if we dont want to be binational state 10 several government advisors think tanks academics and media commentators in the united states israel the arab world and elsewhere also have expressed doubt that the twostate solution can be pursued indefinitely without finality and have indicated that the failure of the negotiations restarted by the annapolis process may lead to the end of the twostate solution idea11 the reut institute an israeli national security strategy think tank that provides its services pro bono to the israeli government issued report in august 2008 warning

2007 9 pa negotiator israel may make twostate solution impossible reuters august 11 2008 qureis comment was hardly the first palestinian reference to possible onestate or binational outcome nor for that matter was it the first such public reference made by qurei himself the idea of single democratic state for jews and arabs alike was one of the core principles of the plo before it began moving toward recognition of israels right to exist in fact the debate over partition and two and onestate models date back to the time of the british mandate in palestine prior to the adoption of the 1947 partition plan general assembly resolution 181 the majority report from the special committee on palestine supporting partition of the british mandate into separate jewish and arab states was opposed by minority report proposing federation of jews and arabs palestinian calls for onestate solution never completely subsided following the plos recognition of israels right to exist which was formally declared by then plo chairman yasser arafat pursuant to the letters of mutual recognition of september 9 1993 although controversy remains over whether the plo charter has been amended to accommodate this recognition these calls some of which criticized the merits or the practicability of twostate solution as well became more frequent and less confined to palestinians following th outbreak of the

tel aviv who said that failure today does not mean that tomorrow we cannot try again to arrive at two state solution which remains the best option for all13 it remains to be seen whether warnings by supporters of the twostate idea about its precariousness can be effective in prodding the parties to act with greater immediacy some might say that the peace process needs to be imbued with sense of urgency before either side is willing to make the difficult concessions that may be necessary in order to reach compromisein essence they believe that hopes for resolution require setting deadline perhaps even an artificial one others might counter that indeterminate warnings or arbitrarily chosen deadlines regarding the continuing availability of twostate solution have been voiced for several years and have lost credibility because multiple resumptions of negotiations could indicate that neither israel nor the plo truly believes that mutual termination to negotiate can be foreclosed by the passage of time see alternatives to twostate solution below for further analysis of the issues raised by the debate described above

one reason that proponents of the peace process might believe that immediate action is necessary is their concern that the current political consensus favoring the peace process within israeli palestinian and us circles is tenuousparticularly in light of upcoming leadership transitions in the united states january 2009 and israel february 2009 and conflicting claims between pa president mahmoud abbas and hamas to palestinian leadership 14 with the rise of hamass influence in palestinian affairs difficulties in maintaining strong consensus for negotiations in israel and challenges in getting top us leaders to make sustained efforts to confront the many thorny issues that divide israelis and palestinia ns the coming to power of peace process skeptic among any of the three principal sides could stall negotiations for years g9g152g146g151g144g561g8g152g155g160g138g155g141g561g143g155g152g150g561g3g151g151g138g153g152g149g146g156g561 in the aftermath of the initial timeline for the nnapolis process proponents of the twostate idea might argue that it would be better to strengthen existing political will for twostate solution than to spend time and resources building new consensus for one or more alternative solutions quest for alternatives might more accurately reflect grass is always greener mentality than qualitatively superior approach to resolving the conflict on the other hand opponents of the twostate idea might argue that recycling framework that has fallen short for over decade is unwise and that something new should be tried instead of sinking more political capital into what could be an irredeemably failed idea 13 yossi alpher onestate solution in palestine is patently unrealistic daily star beirut august 20 2008 see also david newman there is solution

between israelis and palestinians factionalism among palestinians israeli settlements and other impediments to palestinian movement and territorial contiguity may have significantly altered the likelihood of reaching twostate solution since the signing of the oslo accord in 1993 g15g146g141g141g149g142g561g7g138g156g157g561g9g142g152g153g152g149g146g157g146g140g156g561 at the time of the oslo accord in 1993 geopolitical conditions seemed wellsuited to support resolution of the israelipalestinian conflict the cold war had ended the united states had assembled broad regional and international coalition that defeated and confined saddam hussein in iraq and many significant actors in the middle east and worldwide had accepted us influence in the region as stabilizing factor the plo and jordan were both looking for opportunities to rehabilitate their images and regain influence within the region after having supported saddam hussein against the usled coalition in the gulf war bill clinton and yitzhak rabin elected to power respectively in the united states and israel in 1992 both indicated willingness to move forward with the arabisraeli peace process that was formally restarted at the 1991 madrid conference by their predecessors george hw bush and yitzhak shamir while the oslo process with the palestinians proceeded albeit with delays israel made peace with jordan in 1994 negotiated with syria and made withdrawals from lebanon in 2000 since then things have changed considerably after oslo hamas has become much more significant palestinian actorgradually throughout the 1990s with violence aimed at derailing the oslo process and then breaking to the fore during the second palestinian intifada shaking off or uprising also known as the alaqsa intifada which began in 2000 and lasted by most accounts until 2006 and with its electoral victory in 2006 the militant lebanese shia or shiite group hezbollah similarly grew in influence during the 1990s in its national sphere various developments since september 11 2001 have challenged us economic and geopolitical supremacy in the middle east iran has been bolstered by the progress of its nuclear program the usled removal of saddam hussein from power in iraq and perhaps some might argue by the attention it received from being so closely targeted as member along with iraq and north korea of president george w bushs axis of evil consequently irans profile within the regionparticularly with hamas and in iraq syria and lebanonhas grown compelling the traditional sunniled arab states egypt jordan saudi arabia and the smaller gulf states to scramble to preserve their own regional prestige by countering iranian military political economic and ideological influence this changed middle east environment makes the israelpalestinian peace process more unpredictable and raises questions over whether th prospect of peace with the sunniled arab world remains as powerful an incentive for israel to engage in the peace process as it was at the time of the madrid conference some foreign policy analysts believe that the increased willingness of sunniled arab states to support th twostate solution in recent years is reflective of an interest shared by these countries the united states and israel in aligning to counter rising iranian and shia influence in the middle east ra ther than an interest in solving the israeli palestinian conflict for its own sake some analysts as mentioned above have even speculated that countering iran was the primary purpose of the annapolis conference

measures implemented by the israeli defense forces idf have in the shortterm reestablished security for most of israels civilian population many palestinians perceive these measures to be unjustifiably oppressive and lingering resentment could lead to future resumption of violence despite the heavy israeli security measures hamas rocket attacks from gaza led israel to indirectly negotiate through egyptian mediation tahdiya or temporary ceasefire with hamas in june 2008 nevertheless occasional rocket attacks from gaza still take place most of which were attributable to nonhamas militant groups before november 200818 and recent attacks on israeli civilians by palestinian jerusalemites and arab israelis show that it is unlikely that security measures can be fully effective at calming israelis fear for their wellbeing there also has been recent upswing in israeli settler violence against palestinian civilians in the west bank such as that which according to

during the time of oslo in the 1990s vast majority of the palestinian people in both the west bank and the gaza strip clearly accepted yasser arafat and the plo as their legitimate representatives problems with internecine violence divisiveness and popular discouragement stemming from perceptions of widespread political corruption existed from the beginning of self rule in the west bank and gaza strip but with arafats death the failure of the peace process until now and the rise of hamas these prob lems have worsened although pa president mahmoud abbas has taken arafats place his legitimacy as leader of the palestinian people is not comparable and the fatah party he leads is riven by internal divisions in light of hamass rise some wonder if the pragmatic secular nationalistic positions fatah claims to take including support for twostate solution have political future 20 hamas despite and perhaps because of its role in perpetrating much of the violence on the palestinian

it out including as leader of the fatah armed group tanzim during the second intifada since 2004 barghouti has been serving multiple life sentences in an israeli prison for murder convictions stemming

but continued rapidly after oslo27 could be seen as an attempt to establish facts on the ground that increase israeli bargaining leverage in negotiations with the palestinians or as an attempt to establish an irreversible israeli presence that could lessen palestinian sovereign control of the west bank under an eventual twostate solution major question that follows from the current realities on the ground is whether and to what extent these realities might remain part of the west bank following finalstatus agreement if most of the 27 see unocha op cit which says since the beginning of the

the imposition of significant restrictions on the crossing of people and goods between israel the west bank and gaza is another major change from the time of oslo and even from clintonera attempts at finalstatus agreement in 20002001 lacking selfsufficient private sector palestinians have historically depended on easy entry into and exit out of israel for their workers and goods since the outbreak of the second intifada israel began construction of the west bank separation barrier increased security scrutiny at crossing points and in the process of issuing permits and in many cases halted the flow of people and goods altogether30 for most of the time since hamass forcible takeover of the gaza strip in june 2007 most of gazas border crossings have been closed to everything but minimum of goods deemed necessary to meet humanitarian needs as result the gazan economy has been brought to virtual standstill the palestinian federation of industries estimates that 98 of gazas industrial operations are now inactive 31 even if israel agrees to palestinian sovereignty over gaza and the west bank there are guarantees that israel will allow palestinians and their goods access to israeli jobs and markets the alternatives for the palestinians would likely be to attract investment and build selfsufficient economy which is probably years if not decades away to look to neighboring 28 see unocha op cit of the approximately 450000 jewish settlers in the west bank including east jerusalem between two thirds and three quarters live on the israeli side of the current and proposed route of

regaining the initiative palestinian strategic options to end israeli occupation 35 the smart resistance advocated in the pssg report could attempt to block israel from imposing solution unilaterally36 and to shame israel into accepting onestate solution by threatening it with international political and economic isolation eg suspension of diplomatic ties economic sanctions and

democratic state that is distinctly jewish although the characteristics of its jewishness are not defined with precision and consequently are subject to wide interpretationare the national jewish characteristics ethnic cultural legal political religious or some combination of these various types perhaps this consensus reflects shared conviction that israel fulfills an important function by providing homeland and safe space for jews and that this haven can only survive if it is predominantly led by jewish people and guided by jewish principles needless to say an arabmajority democratic state organized under the principle of oneman onevote would not be seen by most israeli jews as jewish many jews and nonjews struggle with the interrelated questions of whether israels jewish nature

cultural and geographical reasons 45 jordan administered the west bank and east jerusalem from 19481967 annexing them in 1950 although only the united kingdom and pakistan recognized the annexation and granting jordanian citizenship to west bank and east jerusalem residents in 1954 although the annexation claims and citizenship grants were rescinded in 1988 egypt administered the gaza strip from 19481967 but did not annex it or make gazans egyptian citizens major obstacle to the viability of the regional option is the stated opposition of jordan and egypt to assuming responsibility for the

time wears on some advocate that the united states should engage more vigorously in pushing the peace process forward48 they tend to believe that an urgent approach might be necessary to prevent israelis and palestinians from turning to other options others however believe that more incremental approach should be taken by the united states because current conditions particularly the division among palestinians between fatah and hamasmilitate against pressuring the two sides to reach and implement finalstatus agreement 49 an incrementalist us posture with respect to the peace process couldby buying timeincrease the chances of propitious alignment of us israeli and pale stinian leaders and publics who are willing to conclude and implement mutually beneficial finalstatus agreement or it could squander opportunities and cede the initiative to other parties in deciding whether to play more proactive role in the peace process the us could face concerns over possible joint resistance by israelis and palestinians against outside pressure50 offset by concerns that peace might not be possible without considerable thirdparty intervention 48 those from this general school of

peeling syria out of the iranian orbit that makes it easier to isolate iran so that they have tougher time developing nuclear weapon 51 what level of priority the incoming obama administration might

that these operations motivated it to pull out of november 2008 meeting in egypt aimed at restoring palestinian unity55 any possibility of us policy shifts regarding hamass role could trigger heated debate those opposing policy shifts might say that any move toward legitimizing hamas could embolden it and other palestinian militants to use the mechanisms of palestinian leadership to mount attacks on israeleither before or after the establishment of palestinian state56 those favoring policy shifts might say that hamas is less likely to attack israel if it is made stakeholder that is accountable to revived palestinian hopes regarding prospects for palestinian state57 leaving hamas out of negotiated outcome could lead the united states to pursue one of the following courses of action one would be to tr ust that the palestinian people would rally to abbass support in the event he reaches fina lstatus agreement with israel ratifying the agreement in referendum or in some other manner regardless of hamass objections another would be to help the pa andor israel prepare for containment of hamas or for military action against it it is possible that combination of both courses of action could be used there are several risks involved with both courses of action entrusting the fate of finalstatus peace agreement to divided palestinian public after so many years spent striving for resolution could lead to an unpredictable and perhaps demoralizing result along the lines of the 2006 pa elections that brought hamas to power58 even if the palestinian public backs abbas hamas could seek to nullify the popular will through force containment of or military action against hamas could backfire leading hamas to broaden andor deepen its control of gaza and possibly also the west bank even military success could come at great cost given hamass entrenchment in gaza and its possible attack capabilities against israel either with rockets or through direct attacks on idf personnel or civilians by supporting the use of force against hamas the us could also open itself up to charges that it is the primary aggressor possibly eroding the uss international credibility as an honest broker and guarantor with regard to the peace process if any of these risks materialize congress could face requests for heightened economic and security assistance in climate in which discerning whether potential aid recipients and their actions are hospitable to us interests might become increasingly difficult

capacity of palestinian moderates relative to hamas and others who through their words andor deeds appear to reject peace59 these capacitybuilding measures include the internationally and congressionally supported programs of pa security and economic reform and assistance that were relaunched in conjunction with the annapolis process in 200760 since mid2007 the united states has appropriated approximately 720 million in support of these programs including 300 million obligated in direct budgetary assistance to the pa and 160 million toward training equipment facilities strategic planning and administration appropriated to strengthen and reform the pa national security forces and presidential guard61 us security coordinator lt gen keith dayton has consulted with pa leaders and the idf in the west bank with respect to the deployment of these pa security forceswhich have shown some signs of successin cities such as nablus jenin and hebron 62 reason for skepticism regarding these measures could be the socalled chickenegg security dilemmathat israel might not leave the west bank to pa security forces until they have the capacity and willingness to suppress attacks on israel but that the pa forces cannot develop the necessary capacity and willingness while israeli occupation forces stir palestinian resentment and undermine the pa forces legitimacy and ability to take independent action63 opponents of an emphasis on capacitybuilding measures might also argue that efforts to bolster palestinian moderates in the 15 years since oslo have appeared to make hamas stronger not weaker if this trend continues their argument might go hamas might even attempt takeover of the west bank either through the pa electoral process both presidential and legislative elections are scheduled to take place later than january 2010 or through force as it took over the gaza strip in 2007 in such situation the future existence andor posture of the pa and its security forces on which millions of dollars and thousands of manhours have been spent through us sponsored programs could be thrown into doubt 64 another reason some might oppose an emphasis on capacitybuilding measures is that us security and economic assistance to the pa could come to be seen as fixture of the status quo peace process with end in sight could erode momentum for twostate solution and intensify the jockeying between and among israelis and palestinians for alternatives such as onestate solution regional option or israeli unilateralismperhaps leading ultimately to greater conflict 59 see footnote 56 60 these programs including threeyear palestinian reform and development plan introduced in december 2007 have been developed and forwarded by pa prime minister

as discussed above see israeli settlements and infrastructure extensive construction of israeli settlements in the west bank and east jerusalem since oslo may have complicated prospects for twostate

historical tendency for settlement construction to increase during usbrokered israelipalestinian peace negotiationsincluding during the annapolis process despite the roadmaps call for settlement

implementation66 although longstanding official us policy opposes the settlements as obstacles to peace and insists that existing settlement blocs should not prejudice finalstatus negotiations arab critics routinely charge that us support of israel indirectly supports settlement activity67 since 1972 the united states has periodically offered loan guarantees to israel current legislation authorizing these loan guarantees through fy 2010 specifically prohibits the use of us guaranteed funds to finance israeli settlement activity in territories occupied by israel since the 1967 war and permits the us government to make reductions in the guarantees equal in amount to israeli expenditures on settlement activity the last reduction made was in 2003 68 in recommending that the incoming obama admi nistration hold israel accountable to its commitment to freeze new construction of settlements in the west bank including in the jerusalem area december 2008 joint publication from the brookings institution and the council on foreign relations stated that conditioning portions of aid to settlement freeze can be effective in eliciting israeli compliance69 the jewish settler population in the west bank and east jerusalem has grown to constitute about 6 of the israeli population approximately 450000 out of 71 million total given the multitude of parties that exist within israels coalitionbased parliamentary system settlers can leverage 65 while serving as secretary of state under president george hw bush james baker observed every time i have gone to israel in

ideological agenda or even the same interests it has become harder for israeli governments to function without their approval this dynamic could make it very difficult for an israeli prime minister to agree to settlement dismantlement in finalstatus negotiations with the plo or even to crack down on the increased settler violence discussed above some say that the israeli governments historical permissiveness with respect to settlers has eroded the settlers sense of accountability creating uncertainty for the idf over how to protect settlers without enabling attacks against palestinians that some observers fear could lead to wider acceptance of extremism71 if settler violence worsens further it could lead to tensions between the pa and the idf regarding the management of security with respect to settlers and palestinian civilians living and traveling in close proximitywith potential implications for the us security coordinators office that consults closely on the ground with both sides there are also signs in hebron yitzhar and other places that idf measures to curb settler violence and provocations could plunge israel into domestic strife over the issue possibly further
