congressional research service the library of congress sars avian flu and other challenges for chinas political social and economic transformation summary in november 2002 sars new and deadly human illness suspected of having an animal origin made its first appearance in china chinese leaders at first minimized the effects of the new virus and covered up the extent of its spread but the disease moved rapidly to other countries prompting the world health organization in 2003 to label the virus global health threat under intense public scrutiny chinese leaders in april 2003 eventually acknowledged that people were sickening and dying apologized for their leadership failures in addressing the problem and launched series of initiatives to try to contain the disease limit its economic damage and protect public health by july 2003 the initial sars outbreak had ended but global disease specialists expressed concern that the virus could recur like influenza or that other similarly mutating viruses could leap from the animal to the human world on january 5 2004 china confirmed the first new case of sars in guangdong province where the 2003 outbreak had occurred on january 27 2004 prc officials acknowledged that several flocks of birds in china were infected with the same deadly strain of avian flu that in recent weeks had ravaged bird populations and killed humans in other asian countries the emergence of sars and other new viruses has posed steep learning curve for new generation of chinese officials who had assumed office in november 2002 only weeks before the original sars outbreak in suppressing information early in the crisis the government lost credibility and public confidence more reliable information was available from foreign media sources the internet and cellphone text messages as many as 40 million day during the 2003 sars crisis according to one report in the 2003 crisis chinese leaders were forced to adjust their strategy by publicly embracing two radical concepts the public has right to know about information directly concerning their daily lives and government officials need to be accountable to the public for their performance officials began issuing regular briefings in 2003 about sars cases and several top officials were fired for covering up the crisis since then the government has revamped emergency procedures issued rules requiring greater government transparency and worked to reduce the deficiencies and prohibitive costs of public health care some observers suggested that lessons learned from the 2003 sars outbreak could permanently influence prc governance some change can be seen in the more open and aggressive way officials have handled sars cases in 2004 officials have publicly announced both confirmed and suspected cases ordered the extermination of many civet cats culinary delicacy in china but suspected source of animaltohuman transfer of the disease and begun human trials of new sars vaccine developed in china still prc officials in early january 2004 detained and questioned journalists from chinese newspaper that first reported on the new sars cases suggesting that the government still seeks to control information flow and global health officials have criticized official secretiveness in addressing the new avian flu outbreak contents introduction 1 background of sars in the

outbreak in china of new form of atypical pneumonia severe acute respiratory syndrome sars had widespread economic political and social effects on the prc and presented serious test for new prc party leadership named at the november 2002 party congress and for new central government officials named at the march 2003 meeting of the national peoples congress1 having first minimized and tried to cover up the extent of the disease prc officials eventually were forced by circumstances to acknowledge the problem apologize for failure to be more forthcoming and respond openly and aggressively to the outbreak the governments handling of new sars cases emerging in january 2004 differs markedly from its earlier experience as result some us foreign policy observers have suggested that the initial crisis of 2003 was transformative experience for the new leadership that will have lasting implications for the prcs future and for its role in the world one set of questions is economic these include the direct costs of fighting the virus the indirect costs to and implications for the countrys economy because of lost business and the national budget implications of continuing to address the weaknesses that sars revealed about the prcs health care system social and political questions center around what the health crisis revealed about the limits of central government power in an age when public pressure can force changes in beijings policies finally the health crisis raised questions about the prcs global image and role including its responsibilities to international organizations such as the world health organization who the impact that beijings decision to obfuscate about the crisis may have had on its credibility with its neighbors and the potential implications of the crisis for prc relations with hong kong and taiwan this report will address the political social and economic questions confronting china as it continues to cope with the aftereffects of the health crisis and emerging new health crises this report also will assess the implications of these questions for chinas future and for us policy the report will be updated as events warrant 1 the new virus that causes sars was identified independently in midapril 2003 by researchers in both canada and in the united states crs2 background of sars in the prc in november and december 2002 authorities in chinas guangdong province began seeing cases involving mysterious and contagious flulike virus that prc medical officials first described as an atypical pneumonia as later press reports eventually reconstructed it cases first appeared in the provincial cities of foshan heyuan and zhongshan spreading then to guangzhou the provinces capital city although beijing sent delegation of medical experts to guangdong on january 20 2003 to help provincial officials investigate the illness government authorities made official mention of the mysterious cases nor did official prc media sources when provincial government officials finally acknowledged the mysterious pneumonia outbreak publicly in early february 2003 they continued to be secretive and duplicitous about the extent of the illness only periodically making reluctant further disclosures about the outbreak the guangdong provincial health bureau made the first official prc announcement about the mysterious illness on february 11 2003 after the outbreak had become obvious in the city according to senior guangdong health official2 taking the then unusual step of holding press conference provincial health authorities reported that 5 in guangdong had died and more than 300 had become sick numbers that proved much understated by later calculations having revealed the problem the following day on february 12 2003 the official xinhua news agency announced that the mysterious pneumonia had been brought under controland new cases had been reported this remained the official story from the prc government through midmarch 2003 even as the world health organization who issued global alert on march 12 2003 following new outbreaks of similarly described atypical pneumonia in vietnam and hong kong prc officials remained reluctant to issue information throughout march 2003 even so on march 15 2003 the who issued an unprecedented emergency travel advisory for the first time referring to the illness as sars and saying that its further spread to canada singapore and europe now made it global health threat according to who officials it was only at this point that the chinese government began providing them with information about the february atypical pneumonia outbreak in guangdong which beijing still maintained had been successfully dealt with even so who reported that the prc at this point still declined to provide biological samples test results or even details about the courses of treatment used during the february outbreak several days later on march 18 2003 prc officials admitted that the sars outbreak was continuing in guangdong but maintained that it had not spread to other locations in china on march 27 2003 prc authorities admitted that actually more than 800 people in guangdong had become sick and 34 had died including 3 in beijing the governments first admission that the illness 2 statement cited by xinhua news agency february 11 2003 attributed to huang jionglie director of the municipal health bureau crs3 had spread beyond guangdong province it was not until april 2 that prc officials allowed who investigators to visit the guangdong sars areas3 on april 4 2003 the head of the prcs center for disease control issued an unprecedented public apology for the governments poor coordination of information about the health crisis4 on april 9 prominent beijing surgeon publicly disclosed that the government was continuing seriously to underreport cases of sars in beijing and that the number actually was far more than the statistics of 22 existing cases in the city that the government had released that same day by mid april 2003 persistent rumors international inquiries and foreign press reports were bringing enormous pressure to bear on government officials who were still reporting that sars had been contained in guangdong and that only 15 more cases had been reported in beijing for total of 37 who investigators publicly announced on april 16 2003 that the international community did not trust the beijing city governments figures and that the numbers beijing was reporting did not include patients in military hospitals or those with suspected but unconfirmed cases the new york times quoted one who infectious disease expert as saying that the real number of cases in beijing more likely was in the 100to200 range now5 on april 18 2003 chinas new premier wen jiabao threatened dire consequences for any government official who did not make full and timely disclosure about sars cases on april 19 2003 the washington post reported that prc doctors were disclosing that the previous week on orders from the beijing city government authorities had physically moved more than 70 sars patients out of hospitals to prevent visiting who medical teams from finding them on their inspections the real official turnaround in the crisis came on april 20 2003 when prc leaders made an evident decision to be more forthcoming about the sars crisis in series of steps that many observers described as unprecedented in the history of the chinese communist government prc officials that day held nationally televised press conference in which they admitted that sars cases in beijing actually were more than ten times the 37 cases officially reported up to that point and that there were 339 confirmed cases and 402 suspected cases officials offered public apology for their leadership failure in addressing the sars crisis later that day both the minister of health zhang wenkang and the mayor of beijing meng xuenong were removed from their positions presumably for misleading the public about the extent of the health crisis by april 27 2003 only ten weeks after the initial announcement that mysterious pneumonia outbreak affecting few hundred people in guangdong had been brought under control sars outbreaks had been reported in 26 of the prcs 31 provinces the number of confirmed cases in beijing alone had passed 1100 and the central government had placed more than 15000 people in the city under 3 the who issued travel advisory for guangdong province on april 2 2003 4 pomfret john officials says china erred on outbreak rare

further the government cancelled the weeklong celebrations for the may 1st holiday of 2003 to discourage widespread travel in china and ordered the emergency closure of movie theaters discos churches and other public places in beijing6 outside the capital villages and towns with recorded sars cases began to put up roadblocks to isolate themselves from potentially infected travelers although new daily prc announcements showed that confirmed sars cases were now increasing on daily basis who officials on april 29 2003 again criticized the government for failure to provide more detailed information many citizens of beijing refused to venture outside their homes often wearing protective face masks when they did so according to press reports streets and public squares in the city were virtually deserted and those businesses and stores that remained open had virtually customers by july 2003 the global transmission of sars had virtually disappeared on july 15 2003 the us cdc discontinued the distribution of its health alert notices and lifted the last of its travel advisories reflecting that new cases of sars had appeared in more than 30 days7 nevertheless the international medical community warned that sars may duplicate the pattern of other respiratory diseases and recur seasonally like the flu many pointed out that the sars outbreak of late 2002early 2003 highlighted number of serious weaknesses in the prcs political and economic systems that prc leaders were forced to address particularly given the potential for other national health crises some felt that the act of addressing these weaknesses could have lasting impact on governance in the prc political and governance issues since 1978 the pressures and demands of modernization have forced the authoritarian chinese communist political system to change in important ways these changes have been incremental and selective so that the political arena in the prc today has an oddly chimerical quality about it for example while much in prc society is increasingly open the process by which government and party decisions are made is still murky matter small number of senior leaders continues to make most major policy decisions in closed sessions they give little rationale to the public about why they make given decision and information about whether some leaders have dissenting views open and direct criticism even when justifiable or wellintentioned is often treated harshly as threat to some greater good such as social stability or public safety8 what one observer has 6 quarantine figures cited in pomfret john beijing to allow who to send team to taiwan washington post may 4 2003 p a25 beijing did not reopen movie theaters in the city until june 10 2003 7 in july 2003 the cdc lifted series of travel advisories on july 3 to mainland china other than beijing on july 8 to toronto july 9 to hong kong on july 11 to beijing and on july 15 to taiwan 8 as sclerotic as this political system still appears to outside observers prc participants in the process will argue strongly that the internal decisionmaking process now is more continued crs5 referred to as the culture of secrecy surrounding the process at the top in the prc extends also into the broader sociopolitical arena9 on the other hand while the party still reserves ultimate power to itself the levers for exercising that power have weakened combined with the forces of globalization the partys institution of economic market mechanisms since 1978 has required more political flexibility and the acceptance of greater local autonomy more decisionmaking authority has devolved to various government bureaucracies and to provincial and local authorities but this shift in power has not been accompanied by the creation of supporting institutional infrastructure sufficient to regulate commerce control corruption and coordinate laws and responsibilities at all levels of governance consequently the universe of what effectively can be controlled by the core central elite today is seen to be shrinking while the capacity of noncentral actors to manage influence and interfere in daytoday activities is seen to be expanding the struggle of dealing with sars highlighted these strains and contradictions in the prc political system transparency and accountability one of the most evident consequences of the 2003 sars crisis for prc leaders was the harsh light it threw on the lack of transparency and accountability in government sars demonstrated that much of the prc governments standard operating procedure is illequipped to respond to widespread public health crisis under prc law for example the government has extensive power to determine what information is state secret and can impose severe punishments against those who reveal state secrets the definition of what are state secrets and who is entitled to know them is vague and arbitrary as evidenced by the general description contained in article 2 of the state secrets law state secrets shall be matters that have vital bearing on state security and national interests and as specified by legal procedure are entrusted to limited number of people for given period of time10 further according to some reports 1996 law the text of which does not appear to be available specifically states that serious infectious diseases shall be considered state secrets unless and until the government makes an official public announcement about the disease11 8 continued democratic than that found in earlier communist history under mao tsetung within this narrow elite political framework they argue there is research discussion debate compromise and accommodation based on interviews conducted by the author with prc government and party officials

httpproductchinawecomcgibinlawdetailpllawid357 11 internal report prepared by the library of congress asian law division 2003 crs6 adherence to laws and regulations designed to keep unfavorable information secret ostensibly for the purpose of protecting public safety proved damaging and counterproductive strategy in the case of the sars health crisis it was in fact the governments failure to provide information about the initial outbreak that ultimately endangered public safety in addition as the disease began to spread and more information about it became available government efforts to spin the sars story began to appear clumsy and incompetent the party made many early missteps in 2003 that damaged its credibility one early prc staterun media account reported that the initial reports of pneumonia outbreak were false spread by pharmaceutical company trying to create market for one of its antiflu drugs12 officials publicly insisted that mild pneumonialike epidemic had occurred but had been brought under control authorities arrested and charged some people for spreading rumors that mysterious pneumonia had broken out in southern china but confronted daily with demonstrable evidence of the diseases spread the governments official line ultimately became untenable government leaders were confronted with the fact that more prc citizens believed foreign pronouncements about the spread of sars in china than they did their own governments in part to resuscitate the partys and the governments ailing credibility prc officials opted for fuller disclosure according to some news reports in addition to the minister of health and the mayor of beijing dozens of other officials were fired suspended demoted or otherwise disciplined for non performance for what one account referred to as their slack reactions against sars13 role of public pressure public pressure played crucial role in finally forcing the governments hand the very nature of the crisis helped serve this public pressure since threat posed by disease is less responsive to political interpretation by the government than are other problems one is either sick with mysterious pneumonialike illness or one is not still it took pervasive pressure from multiple sources to change the way the government responded to sars and at each step observers noted ongoing contradictions in the prc political system international community as contagious disease sars was not problem that could be confined to limited physical area so that the prc government could shield it from public view in the age of global travel sars transcended geographic borders making it harder to hide from the international community for example in february and march 2003 while prc officials continued publicly to deny that china was having health crisis travelers to singapore canada hong kong and other countries were getting sick with the mysterious illness epidemiologists from the who and from affected nations were able to trace these 12 the company the shanghai roche pharmaceuticals ltd was reported in the southern metropolis daily smd as having spread false information about sars to boost the sale of its drug tamiflu the smd report was cited in the shanghai star february 20 2003 13 dorgan michael crackdown in china more than 120 officials punished for letting disease run rampant in mercury news beijing bureau may 9 2003 crs7 cases back to contact with particular location in or individual from the prc as the weeks went by even though prc officials publicly continued to insist that china was sarsfree foreign organizations governments and business representatives began to act independently to protect their people from exposure to sars in china medical community in addition to international organizations and governments pressure arose from what might be called an international community of experts meaning in this case medical personnel in the prc who were in consultation with each other and with their professional counterparts around the world in their efforts to diagnose and treat cases of the mysterious new disease doctors from the prc and other affected countries exchanged information with who investigative teams various national centers for disease control and others reporting on what they were seeing in their own hospital wards these avenues of nongovernmental communication allowed medical investigators to make further independent assessments about the veracity of pronouncements from prc government officials the most influential example of this reporting by medical experts involved the case of dr jiang yanyong prominent surgeon in beijing who disclosed on april 9 2003 that based on what he and his colleagues were seeing the government was seriously underreporting cases of sars in beijing14 it was this and other information that allowed who and other international medical experts to question the beijing governments official reporting on sars medical expertise became more believable than the correct political line being circulated by the government technology and communications domestic pressure on officials in beijing was significantly enhanced by the rapid spread in recent years of communications technology in the prc according to industry sources 545 million prc citizens had access to the internet by late 2002 while onefifth of the prc population of 128 billion or approximately 250 million people had access to cellular phone service by early 200315 during the months of the 20022003 sars outbreak then more prc citizens than ever before had independent access to sources of information outside government control according to news accounts much of the information about the sars outbreak was passed on almost instantaneously through cellular phone text messages at times 40 million day according to one press report volume that was well beyond the governments 14 the allegations of dr jiang former chief of surgery for the beijing 301 military hospital were published by the wall street journal pottinger matt and hutzler charles doctor finds fault with sars numbers he notes differences at hospitals in china matter of definition in asian wall street journal april 9 2003 p a1 15 according to press release from computer industry almanac inc december 16 2002 the prc ranked third in internet usage in late 2002 behind

crisis progressed for public that was placing increasingly less faith in the reliability of government pronouncements limits on central government power the sars case also demonstrated that despite the authoritarian nature of the prc government and the extensive reach it had in its early years power and authority both within the communist party and within the government bureaucracy face new limits today having been forced into greater transparency by acknowledging the extent of the 20022003 sars crisis beijing seemed unable to respond with the pervasive power and control that once had been possible government officials appeared unable to prevent mass migrations from sars affected areas unable to reconstruct the route the virus was taking across provincial borders and unable to control effectively the way the medical community in china was treating sars patients when it became apparent that some hospitals were turning away potential sars victims who were too poor to afford treatment the beijing health department reportedly promised to pay all treatment costs for those unable to pay17 subsequent newspaper interviews with some citizens suggested that this promise was greeted with skepticism18 and news accounts continued to carry stories of patients turned out of health care facilities the selfinflicted damage beijing did to its own credibility did nothing to improve its crisis management effectiveness some observers suggested that the degree of vulnerability the government felt in 2003 was demonstrated by beijings threat to execute people who violated quarantines or who spread the sars virus19 villages and townships took independent action not authorized or coordinated by beijing putting up barricades 16 the number of text messages was attributed to report by prc publication southern weekend that on february 8 2003 the text message fatal flu occurring in guangdong was sent 40 million times and was repeated 86 million times more over the next

turning an abandoned school into sars holding area even within the ranks of the government and party beijing appeared to have hard time getting people to follow its program at an emergency politburo meeting on april 18 2003 president and party secretary hu jintao reportedly warned against the covering up of sars cases and demanded the accurate timely and honest reporting of the sars situation20 in late april 2003 the central discipline inspection committee was forced to warn party members especially doctors and nurses that they would be ousted if they left their posts when threats proved insufficient to retain some health care workers government officials announced that those dealing with sars would get extra daily pay as an incentive role of the media while the prc media enjoys greater freedom and vitality today than it has in the past the sars crisis demonstrated that the party and government still were capable of reasserting control when the occasion demanded before midapril 2003 the media in guangdong and elsewhere in the prc were forbidden to report on the crisis leaving the unofficial means of communication cited above the primary sources of public information according to one hong kong press report the media in guangdong were notified repeatedly that they were not to report on cases of atypical pneumonia without specific official authorization21 at one point the ban on reporting appeared to be lifted resulting in flood of reporting in the official media only to be reinstated later the sars crisis demonstrated the degree to which the media still does not perform the function of disinterested observer to keep government honest the style of investigative journalism common in the west while not unknown in the prc is in its infant stages but the sars crisis also highlighted the fact that this may be changing the prc media increasingly are confronted with contradictory priorities they must compete against more widely available global media sources governed by different requirements of journalism than they themselves can freely follow they face increasing competition both domestically and abroad for news coverage readership and funds an increasing percentage of which are from advertising revenue rather than from the government as new member of the world trade organization wto the prc also has committed to opening its press and publication market to foreign companies consequently prc officials are undertaking press reforms that are expected to privatize much of the national media and result in the demise of many noncompetitive media organizations22 20 the new china news agency quoted in pomfret john china orders end to sars coverup officials begin belated campaign against disease the washington post april 19

problems in chinas overall health care system and finances are addressed elsewhere in this paper the 2003 sars crisis demonstrated that prc infrastructure and training mechanisms were illequipped to deal with widespread public health emergency the near nonexistence of the epidemiological profession seriously hampered the prcs ability to trace the progression of the disease and isolate those who came into contact with infected patients effective system was in place for emergency communication either within the medical community or to government health officials who needed to know about the emerging disease outbreak when the first sars case appeared the prcs own centers for disease control and prevention cdc had been in operation for less than year since january 200223 according to one observer the prc ministry of health had allocated only 80000 renminbi equivalent to about 9700 to the new chinese cdc for the purpose of monitoring epidemics24 hospitals run by the peoples liberation army pla where many of the disease victims were treated were described by who and other medical officials as nonresponsive to requests for cooperation and information economic aspects of the sars epidemic in china the rapid spread of the sars virus raised concern among chinese officials over the potential negative effects it could have on chinas economic development maintaining healthy economic growth is viewed by the government as critical to maintaining social stability especially as it attempts to restructure and reform inefficient sectors of the economy the sars epidemic threatened to interrupt the high level of economic growth china has enjoyed over the past several years the sars crisis also generated new concerns both domestically and internationally over the lack of health care services for large share of the chinese population living in rural areas and the ability of chinas public health care system to respond effectively to major nationwide epidemics chinese officials acknowledge that chinas poor health care infrastructure poses major risk to its future economic development the chinese government pledged to boost spending in order to stimulate domestic demand help economic sectors most affected by sars pay for the care of sars patients who could not afford it and to expand health care coverage throughout rural communities 23 in an interview

its effects on politics and the economy july 2 2003 crs11 economic effects of sars the economic effects of the spread of the sars epidemic appear to have begun in march 2003 and intensified after the world health organization who issued warnings on april 7 2003 against nonessential travel to guangdong province and on april 16 2003 against nonessential travel to beijing and shanxi province25 another blow came after the chinese governments april 20 2003 admission that the spread of the sars virus was far more extensive than it had previously admitted the immediate effect of these events was sharp drop in air travel to and from china followed by widespread cancellations by foreigners of tours and hotel reservations26 many foreign business representatives postponed trips to china number of international meetings exhibitions conferences and sporting events were cancelled fears over the disease began affecting consumer spending in many cities as individuals sought to avoid crowded areas such as shops and restaurants in beijing recreational facilities such as movie houses and health clubs in several cities were ordered shut down by the government in order to contain the virus the service sector tourism appears to have been one of the hardest hit economic sectors in china 27 the sars virus led to sharp drop in foreign travel to china in aprilmay while domestic travel during the may day holidays was significantly curtailed this in turn impacted service industries catering to foreign tourists foreign business travelers and domestic travelers such as hotels restaurants caterers tour companies and local vendors chinese statistics indicate that the number of stayover tourists fell by 42 in april 2003 over april 2002 levels in beijing the number of tourists dropped by nearly 94 in may 2003 over may 2002 levels28 hotel occupancy rates of 5star hotels reportedly fell to 20 and some were at zero group of scholars from the peking university predicted that the 20022003 sars epidemic ultimately would cost chinas tourism industry about 169 billion29 china southern airlines reported that its passenger traffic in may fell 83 year on year 30 according to the official airline guide oag leading source of information on international flight schedules the number of planned flights to and from china in june 2003 fell by 45 compared with june 2002 and the number of planned flights within china fell by 1531 the chinese government reported that 25 on may 8 2003 the who issued travel warnings for tianjin and inner mongolia 26 according to xinhua news agency june 11 2003 all tourism agencies in chinas guangdong province suspended operations at the end of april 27 foreign tourism accounted for 15 of chinas gdp in 2001 while domestic travel accounted for 37 of gdp 28 xinhua news agency june 11 2003 29 insidetradecom may 2003 quoting information provided by the chinese foreign ministry 30 world markets research center daily markets june 16 2003 31

sales for the month fell by 9632 gross domestic product gdp china has been successful over the past several years in maintaining rapid economic growth between 1979 and 2002 real gdp growth averaged 93 it grew by 80 in 2002 during the first quarter of 2003 real gdp grew was up 99 over the first quarter 2002 the fastest quarterly growth rate since 1997 the impact of sars was largely felt in the second quarter when yeartoyear real gdp growth slowed to 67 however by the third quarter yeartoyear real gdp surged by 91 the economist intelligence unit estimates that chinas real gdp grew by 85 for the entire year higher than 2002 growth33 this appears to indicate that overall sars had relatively minor and shortlived impact on the chinese economy as whole in 2003 foreign trade and investment many analysts feared that sars would have major impact on chinas trade and investment flows for example one of chinas largest biannual trade fairs in the city of guangzhou in guangdong province was closed down after four days in april 2003 due to sars the dollar level of purchase contracts signed 33 billion during that period was reportedly equal to less than onefifth the total 185 billion the fair generated in 200234 credit suisse first boston estimated that sars would reduce orders for chinese exporters by 101535 because it generally takes three to six months lag time between export orders and their production and delivery the negative effects of sars on chinas exports is not likely to be known until third and fourth quarter 2003 trade data are taken into account36 in 2002 chinas exports and imports grew by 223 and 212 respectively37 during the first 11 months of 2003 chinese officials reported that exports and imports rose by 329 and 391 respectively38 in 2002 china attracted 527 32 one sector that appears to have benefitted from the sars epidemic is car sales which rose by 62 year on year in may 2003 many purchases appear to been motivated by concerns over having to take public transportation sars appears also to have boosted sales of medicines and medical equipment cleansers and consumer electronics south china morning post june 17 2003 33 estimated by economist

2003 was up by 39 over the same period in 2002 an indicator that actual fdi will likely pick up in the near term40 the economist intelligence unit projects fdi in china will rise to 57 billion in 2004 production and employment little information has surfaced as to the employment and effects of the 20022003 sars outbreak press reports indicated that only few foreign firms in china experienced production disruptions due to sars41 analysts had warned that precautions taken to avoid spread of the virus and delays in visits to china by foreign business representatives would impact work and deliveries over the longer term in addition several foreign companies reportedly delayed the launching of new products opening new plants or starting new joint ventures42 export development canada contended in may 2003 that the sars outbreak was having significant impact on millions of smalland mediumsized enterprises and threatened to sharply increase unemployment in urban areas within few months43 one major group that has been acknowledged by chinese officials to have likely been significantly affected by the sars outbreak is chinas large migrant worker population estimated to number over 80 million people according to chinese government estimates 55 million migrant workers fled urban areas early in 2003 because of sars 44 the exodus led to labor shortages in some cities but the main impact was expected to be on rural incomes as many migrant workers transmit part of their incomes back home chinas xinhua news agency cited chinese analysts who estimated that migrant workers would lose 48 billion by the end of the year45 another analyst predicted that the early 2003 sars outbreak would reduce rural incomes by 15 to 20 percentage points and would cause the urbanrural income gap to widen46 39 this is an impressive figure considering that worldwide fdi in developing countries fell by over 25 according to the united nations conference on trade and development 40 contracted investment is an indicator of new investment that is pledged for the future while actual fdi indicates the amount of investment flows going to china in given year 41 for example matsushita

tax incentives tax cuts and fee reductions estimated at costing the government 12 to 24 billion for sectors most affected by the 20022003 outbreak third the government pledged to spend 725 million to fight sars including providing free medical services to needy farmers and urban workers and an additional 423 million to improve nationwide health care coverage48 finally china continued to boost government spending such as on infrastructure development in order to offset the negative affects of sars these factors likely put new strains on central and provincial budgets49 according to the world bank chinas growing public debt which as share of gdp has risen from 114 in 1997 to 253 in 2002 is hampering the ability of the government to devote resources to social sectors50 chinas health care system the sars contagion focused new attention on chinas public health system for variety of reasons first was the concern that the lack of comprehensive health care system would allow sars and other diseases to spread throughout the country unchecked this was especially of concern when millions of migrant workers returned home due to the sars outbreak who might have spread the virus throughout china resulting in social and economic disaster second the spread of the disease raised new concern over the growing disparity in health care insurance and services available to urban and rural workers the lack of health care and possibility of rapidly spreading disease also raised concerns that foreign investors would find the prc less attractive destination for fdi relatedly number of chinese and foreign analysts contend that the poor state of chinas health care system poses longterm threat to chinas future economic development51 47 china daily june 14 2003 48 bureau of national affairs international trade reporter may 15 2003 49 analysts further note that resources spent fighting sars affects the economy in that it diverts resources from more productive and jobgenerating forms of investment 50 the world bank east asia update looking beyond shortterm shocks china brief april 23 2003 51 for example in 2020 report united nations warned that china was on the verge of catastrophe that could result in unimaginable suffering economic loss and social devastationdue to the rapid rise of hivaids in china and the lack of an effective public health care system to deal

see united nations theme group on hivaids chinas titanic peril june 2002 crs15 when the chinese communist party took control of china in 1949 it sought to establish comprehensive health care system for the entire nation during this period most sectors of the economy were taken over by the government workers were provided basic health insurance by their employer the government in urban areas medical bills were paid for by their work units while in farming communities collectives helped pay for medical expenses government control over the countrys medical system through subsides and price controls kept medical costs low for most workers one major initiative by the government was to send an army of barefoot doctors individuals with basic medical training to rural areas in order to provide health care to peasants as result of these policies nearly 90 of the population nearly all urban residents and 85 of the rural population received basic health care52 according to the world bank prior to 1949 chinas population was among the least healthy in the world but after significant investment in heath care had been made the prc experienced dramatic improvements in health conditions such as increased life expectancy which rose from 40 years in 1950 to 69 years in 198253 the stage was set for the decline of the health care system in 1979 when the prc launched several economic reforms the central government gradually dissolved the collective farming system and initiated price and ownership incentives for farmers additional reforms followed in stages that sought to decentralize economic policymaking in several economic sectors economic control of various enterprises was given to provincial and local governments which were generally allowed to operate and compete on free market principles rather than under the direction and guidance of state planning stateowned enterprises were restructured and reformed laying off millions of workers54 since 1979 major objective of prc leaders has been to reduce the financial burden posed by chinas iron rice bowel system of cradletograve benefits including health care as part of this objective the government has substantially reduced its involvement in the health care system and has essentially sought to privatize health care or make it the responsibility of local governments to run programs on their own workers are now encouraged to obtain health care insurance on their own and many hospitals clinics and health care workers operate on for profit basis this policy has led to severe decline in the availability of affordable health care for large portion of chinas population particularly those living in rural areas it is estimated that in 1978 about 20 of the national health budget was spent on rural areas but this figure had been slashed to 4 by the mid 1990s55 today it is estimated that less than onetenth of chinas 900 million rural population have any form of health insurance it is often said in rural china that the fastest way to fall into poverty is to see doctor many individuals needing health care either avoid it 52 the world bank china 2020 financing health care 1997 p1 53 ibid 54 as result significant portion of the population longer works for government run enterprises but instead are employed by privatelyowned firms or foreign invested companies in china 55 chinas hiv crisis by bates gill jennifer chang and sarah palmer foreign affairs marchapril 2002 crs16 because they cant afford it or end up having to liquidate their entire familys assets to pay their medical bills56 an investigation sponsored by the chinese ministry of health found that in 1993 59 of patients in rural areas refused to be hospitalized for proper treatment because their families could not afford to pay for the service by 1998 that rate climbed to 6557 the central government has sought to control rising medical costs by putting mandatory price controls on certain procedures however in order to make up for financial losses resulting from these controls and to earn profit hospitals and clinics often order expensive medical tests and drugs for their patients these conditions became particularly troublesome to prc policymakers in their efforts to contain the spread of sars they feared that individuals infected with sars would avoid seeking medical care because of concerns over costs and therefore would quickly spread the disease across the country as result the government pledged to provide free medical care to all those infected with sars who could not afford it the sars epidemic ultimately may give an added boost to plans that reportedly have been underway by the prc government since october 2002 to establish basic health care insurance for the rural population and to develop new schemes for attracting funding and trained personnel for medical care facilities in rural areas58 sars and avian flu in 2004 some policy observers suggest that number of prc actions and decisions in the past year illustrate that the government has made significant policy changes since the 2003 sars outbreak the prc government was seen to be trying to address the more egregious weaknesses the crisis revealed about the nations health care system in early may 2003 the chinese center for disease control and prevention ccdcp announced it would establish national sars reporting system using high performance computer servers donated by sun microsystems us company to greatly improve beijings ability to monitor and analyze cases of sars and presumably other diseases59 the new reporting system went into operation on november 5 2003 initially connecting 13000 provincial and county hospitals to single sars medical information center according to statement issued then by li liming the ccdpc director up to 20000 users will eventually have access60 56 according to the international herald tribune may 8 2003 chinese hospitals typically charge 250 admission fee an amount

asian wall street journal november 7 2003 continued crs17 some maintain that prc decisions and actions early in 2004 also suggest that new if limited appreciation for transparency and accountability in government has begun to influence beijings decisions in january 2004 the prc ministry of public security announced that in order to promote transparency of police affairs local and provincial police departments must begin to hold regular press conferences and must file immediate media reports as events of public interest occur61 the prc government duly announced the emergence and confirmation of new sars cases in january 2004 the first in china since spring of 2003 in guangdong where the first new case appeared provincial officials immediately ordered the extermination of the provinces 10000 captive civet cats dinner table delicacy in southern china and suspected animal source of the sars virus the prc government also approved and solicited volunteers for human trials of new experimental sars vaccine developed by prc doctors62 but other observers have been more critical of the prc government and maintain that the lessons learned after sars are not pervasive they see significance in the fact that prc officials quickly lifted brief ban on the sale for food of exotic animals thought to be transmitters of sars to humans once again sending the animals into the food chain63 they point out that less than week after the ministry of public security mandated police departments to hold press conferences and issue media reports on matters of public interest police detained and held for questioning employees of prc newspaper that was the first to report on the new sars cases64 but critics see special cause for concern in the prcs classically secretive response to new and deadly outbreak of avian flu in asia in january 2004 avian flu in 1997 an avian flu virus in hong kongs domesticated poultry population for the first time jumped directly from its traditional animal species to humans infecting eighteen people in the territory and killing six the hong kong government responded aggressively in three days exterminating its entire poultry population of 15 million birds isolated outbreaks of human infection from avian flu have recurred annually since then by january 2004 it became evident that another avian flu outbreak was occurring throughout asia but on much wider scale appearing nearly simultaneously in multiple asian countries the outbreak of the deadly h5n1 avian flu virus already had led to 11 human fatalities by january 29 2004 raising fears that the virus could become global disaster if it adapted sufficiently to spread through 60 continued p a4 citing report in the china daily 61 the decision was announced on january

they were farmedraised and not caught in the wild 64 according to report in the new york times prc police detained employees of southern metropolis daily the first paper to report on the new sars

migratory and domestic were infected with the virus in at least 10 asian countries 65 by late january 2004 thailand alone had exterminated more than 10 million chickens 66 on january 27 2004 the prc became the tenth country to acknowledge ongoing outbreaks of avian flu within its borders prc officials confirmed three outbreaks flocks of ducks in guangxi province ducks in hunan province and chickens in hubei province some critics have seen the prcs initial actions in the avian flu outbreak as return to the secretive methods used in the early 2003 sars outbreak in china as in the 2003 sars outbreak they say prc officials denied any avian flu outbreak for months despite anecdotal reports to the contrary on january 29 2004 an official from global organization monitoring animal disease outbreaks said that it had been pressing asian governments since november 2003 for information on reports of avian flu and that it had received reports from the prc67 policy implications much international speculation has occurred since the 20022003 sars outbreak about the longerterm implications that this crisis the avian flu outbreak and others like it may have for the prc and the chinese communist party one view is that the initial sars crisis was decisive event in the prc that is likely to have lasting longerterm consequences for the government and the party less certain is what those projected consequences will be and what lessons prc leaders have learned some observers believe that the party will be able to reinterpret the sars or avian flu outbreaks so that any leadership failings will be edited out of the collective memory observers of the prc scene will be following closely number of key areas where the official governments reaction to emerging health crises could offer clues to future governance and policy in the prc for the prc in previous years there have been other known crises involving leadership coverups and government failings the blame for which has been largely contained at the local or regional level these cases have included mass food poisonings both accidental and deliberate contaminated milk for school children fireworks factory explosions mining disasters and other instances involving official malfeasance incompetence or poor judgement given the nature and extent of the sars crisis however communist party and central government officials were forced publicly to make fuller disclosure and in doing so to embrace several radical 65 as of january 29 2004 infected countries reported by who were south korea vietnam

official from the parisbased world organization for animal health oie of which the prc is member crs19 concepts they had not addressed before the right of the public to know about information that directly concerns their daily lives and the need for government to hold officials accountable for their mistakes and failings neither concept has been an endemic feature of prc governance some observers have speculated that because of this sars has sewn the seeds for longerlasting changes in the way prc officials operate they point out for example that prior to the sars outbreak public officials and party members lost their jobs generally for reasons of political rivalry or if they were involved in widely known corruption scandals in contrast during the sars outbreak two relatively senior officials were sacked for what amounted to poor job performance for covering up sars cases or mishandling the consequences of the outbreak in some way and some reports suggested that hundreds of other lowlevel officials were fired68 the implication is that public expectations for competence and accountability in government may have been raised to new level by the sars crisis and that the government will be forced by those expectations to be more forthcoming in the future they see an example of this greater accountability in the public announcement by beijing in may 2003 that 70 sailors had died in an accident aboard prc submarine the previous month at the height of the sars outbreak in the words of one prc scholar commenting on the governments response to the submarine accident this whole submarine affair has been breakthrough for openness69 the incident was the worst publicly acknowledged military accident in prc history according to this viewpoint there also is evidence that sars may put pressure on prc officials in the future to rethink the current restrictive definition of state secret that criminalizes the sharing of information about serious health epidemics already some point out the government appears to have realized that the system now in place provides key disincentives for sharing unpleasant information to address this in the wake of sars prc judicial organs reinterpreted existing laws to make more explicit the requirement that public health officials should immediately disclose the existence of health threats70 according to reports the central government also has been working on freedom of information act expected to be enacted later in 2004 that will dramatically reduce government secrecy while 68 the mayor of beijing meng xuenong and the minister of health zhang wenkang were removed from their positions the number of other officials who lost their jobs cited by vanguard media ltd may 16 2003 69 pomfret john reports

communicable diseases promulgated on may 14 2003 by the supreme peoples court and the supreme peoples procuratorate cited in xinhua domestic service in chinese may 16 2003 crs20 empowering the public to obtain more information and requiring governments to disclose what information the government has71 but other observers are less optimistic that the sacking of highlevel officials during the sars outbreak suggests change in the perception of official accountability pointing out that senior officials have been sacked before in the prc for political reasons72 some dismiss the publicity surrounding the submarine accident as matter of official selfdefense judging that prc leaders may have felt they could not afford to be scooped second time by the international media further some observers maintain that while the sars experience might prompt some prc leaders to argue for more political transparency it may reinforce for others the utility of more heavyhanded tactics such as quarantines and arrests for rumormongering they say that officials appear less likely to have opted for openness in addressing the current avian flu outbreak in 2004 perhaps because the outbreaks are still isolated enough as to lead officials to expect they can control information flow critics also are especially troubled that in the immediate aftermath of the 2002 2003 sars outbreak official prc media revealed that there were 107 cases in which public security organs investigated and punished people for spreading rumors about sars through the internet and mobile phone text messages73 in addition critics say that another judicial reinterpretation in may 2003 contains one of the more draconian measures to come out of the sars crisis provision that anyone intentionally spreading dangerous disease could be subject to life imprisonment or to the death penalty in the future74 these observers see this as evidence that the official response to crises was not changed all that much by sars and they fear that such punitive responses will also prevail in the avian flu case and in other potentially dire public health threats finally the sars epidemic appears to have focused new attention on domestic political debate in the prc over the wisdom of longstanding basic policy begun by deng xiaoping and closely associated with the jiang zemin faction that economic growth is the highest national priority and must be pursued at any cost the weaknesses that sars revealed about the poor health care system in the prc appeared to reinforce those who argue that the country can longer postpone the 71 according to an interview with one of the proposals drafters the right to know in the economist october 25 2003 72 in 1989 reformist party secretary zhao ziyang was removed from

is likely to grow in the presence of avian flu which involves massive potential economic costs to the prcs poultry industry for hong kong one potentially farreaching implication of the 2003 sars crisis involves hong kong the former british colony now under prc sovereignty hong kong struggled with its own deadly sars outbreak in the first half of 2003 and it has considerable experience with the avian flu virus75 under sinobritish agreements reached in the 1980s hong kong was granted autonomy to run its own affairs without prc interference76 while the initial political transition has gone smoothly hong kongs relationship with its new sovereign remains uneasy cynics about the prcs promises of autonomy claim that beijing is subtly interfering in hong kongs affairs mainly by assuring that political pluralism is artificially restricted such views combined with hong kongs unique political situation place special strains on hong kong and prc government officials the addition of sars to hong kongs political and economy troubles in 2003 for instance worsened the already low approval rating of c h tung hong kongs beijingapproved chief executive which then reflected poorly on beijing some say these hong kong sentiments were key factor prompting massive numbers of hong kong citizens to become more politically active in mid2003 and into 200477 many felt that the sars crisis emphasized the different approaches of the two governments the prcs secretiveness and hong kongs openness and claimed that this emphasized the importance of hong kong autonomy other hong kong observers attributed the early lack of information on sars directly to hong kongs special political circumstances saying that contact has been deliberately kept to minimum mostly to protect hong kongs political independence78 these restrictions made it easier for prc officials to not communicate with hong kong on the extent of the sars outbreak the remedy they claimed would be to facilitate communications and lower barriers to bring beijing and hong kong closer together for taiwan with its own cases of sars in 2003 and avian flu in 2004 taiwan sees emerging health crises in asia as having broader political ramifications for its international position and for its relations with beijing the prc continues to block taiwans bid to join the who without separate membership in who taiwan has official access to international disease eradication efforts or sources 75 hong kong was returned to chinese sovereignty on july 1 1997 76 under the sinobritish joint declaration on the question of hong kong initialed on september 26 1984 ratified on may 27 1985 77 hong kongers marched in june 2003 to protest new legislation proposed by chief executive tung and strongly favored by beijing beginning in july 2003 hundreds of thousands in hong kong marched in demonstrations to protest new antisedition laws proposed by the hong kong government 78 chingching hong kongs unhealthy relationship with the mainland in times april 9 2003 p a23 crs22 of information79 even as the sars crisis was underway for example prc leaders continued to block any international effort to give taiwan unofficial observer status in the who claiming that taiwan is part of china and thus does not legally qualify for any separate or independent status in the who80 prc authorities did consent to who team visit to taiwan to investigate sars early in may 2003 and the prc raised objections when taiwan scientists were invited to attend two day who sars conference in kuala lumpur on june 1718 2003 but generally the prc continues to insist that any taiwan health official wishing to take advantage of whos medical expertise should do so only as part of prc delegation some feel that the prcs objection to who help for taiwan allowed taiwans president chen shuibian to gain political mileage for his ongoing reelection campaign by claiming that the prc didnt care about the health of the 23 million people on taiwan81 in addition beijings own coverup of sars and its initial reluctance to ask for who assistance appeared to weaken the longstanding argument of chinese leaders that the prc can responsibly represent taiwans health interests in the who finally the fatality rates associated with the 2003 sars outbreak the recurrence of the disease in 2004 and the implications of the 2004 avian flu outbreak appear likely to reinforce the already strong support of us members of congress for taiwans who membership implications for us policy us foreign policy specialists are confronting the lingering political and economic consequences that global health crises in the prc could have for us policy and for uschina relations the 2003 sars outbreak and the emerging 2004 avian flu outbreak demonstrate that increasing pressures are working on the authoritarian prc system pressures involving greater public demand for information increasing government vulnerability to domestic and international opinion the prcs growing buyin into the international system and the continually closer link between all these things and the prcs predominant goal of rapid economic growth some american observers believe that new public demands in the prc are likely to emphasize funding for domestic social services public health the quality of medical care education and other programs and could lead to lesser emphasis on military spending some in this group also see the crisis as having reinforced for prc leaders the importance of communication cooperation and 79 for much of the sars crisis the

have arisen for governmental and privatesector sinous cooperation in areas such as medical research public health services technological database creation and that the us government should encourage and facilitate these exchanges as matter of policy for these observers the glass is half full for another group of observers the glass is half empty this group points out that the initial inclination of prc leaders both in the sars crisis and the emerging avian flu outbreak was to be secretive and heavyhanded and that only by combination of extraordinary circumstances and pressures did the prc opt for greater openness they focus on the harsh aspects of the prcs response the arrests for disseminating information the imprisonments for rumormongering the central governments swift crackdown on the media they also find concern in the more fragile aspects of the prcs response the inability to inspire public confidence or limit the diseases spread by more effective control of population movements they find fault with the prc governments instinct for selfprotection and nondisclosure which they say increased the risk to other countries and proved that the prc is not good neighbor the united states they say should remain wary of prc motivations and cautious in dealing with prc leaders chronology 012003 team of health experts from beijing arrived in guangzhou to investigate reports of
