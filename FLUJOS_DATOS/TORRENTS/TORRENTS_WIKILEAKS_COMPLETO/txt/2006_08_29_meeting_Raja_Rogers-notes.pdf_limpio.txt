raja rogers meeting notes 82906 raja rogers nice experience was given by peter wallace dr keith wallaces brother whose been meditating for over 43 yrs maharishi commented that we can really do anything with our attention but if we focus on gross activity then it will inhibit our ability to work on the subtle levels where everything can be done he commended ps exp but said that he should have attn more on the subtle levels if he wants to accomplish something great it became apparent today that maharishi is looking for even deeper exp than the wonde rful ones we are having here he said i want to say something but dont want to say it until i hear the experience we really want to remember that there are over 25000 people that have been trained in tmsidhi program in the us so we should easily have enough people to rotate through these 2 facilities everyone should redoubl their efforts to encourage everyone from their area to try to spend 14 weeks on the course that will also help your area because people come back much stronge r there may be change in our structure of what we have to do lot more money has been going out than coming in our domain has been very well run but still there is hundr eds of thous ands of dollars difference between income and expenses it is better than many domains but is concern to dr feldman and international they are thinking about restructuring things really really focus on keeping your expenses down and income up find way to teach give courses cic salary will be somehow determined on percentage basis until the finances become more sustainable but it is not clear yet how from business viewpoint we have situation with cash in and cash out review what expenses are costeffective eg evaluate what advertising has been successful start prioritizing revenue in produc ing activities patrick is there any place in the country where they have determined certain investments in advertising have worked consistently raja rogers have heard of what doesnt work in our domain we have held down expenses because we have not done much of this newspaper and radio advertising have not worked sarasota ft lauderdale atlanta gainesville lex seagrove beach in the black everyone else in our domain is running deficit word of mouth works adv lectures work referrals work ask people how their meditations are going check people have all the social events avoid venues where you pay 200 for several weeks in row and one starts patrick thank you to all for your suppor t during the time of my mothers passing its shown us how important our community is raja rogers its very big deal powerful emotional when parent leaves we have our group of high consciousness people who are very caring of one another that is one of our great strengths maharishi has said that we are very fortunate to have people in group such wonde rful disciples who have come to him and guru dev although he always pushes us forward maharishi has encouraged us to spend extra time and attention with our elder parents as they grow older jane b discussion of using either mum or gov in canada christian for printing labeling of cbe tour invitations also whether to use bulk mail or first class raja rogers at the raj we have not found it true that people pay more attn to first class mail than bulk mail plus we only use first class when we want to refine mailing list we go with cheaper bulk mail we usually would favor mum but this time we will use the gov in canada jane b ruth and jeff have volunteered to proofread everything raja rogers where are we in getting the names jane b in atlanta we will use mailing list provider sorry i missed some of this conve rsation jeff murphy sidha has been volunteering and found 500 names so far she found nice way of getting contact info for schools schoolbased decision making counc il sbdm principal 3 teachers and 2 parents we are asking each county if we can get list of the people on this counc il raja rogers we need to put our attn on something that will work you each know in your area what will probably work and what are the long shots so minimize the long shots we may run into roadblock with this sbdm counc il in public schools should work with private schools jeff murphy this counc il seems to be good first approach dori from janet hoffman in ny who has already had cbe tour send out tiered mailing send out mailing to most important people first superintendents principals headmasters then to guidance couns elors and social workers then down the list most effective and most important follow up each mailing with phone call she calls each superintendent to make sure they are invited she spent from 10am5pm daily for one month or more calling people jane b meeting on thurs morning with janet hoffman and other people who have had experience with the tour re what is effective it was sugge sted to have west coast calling east coast teachers at appropriate times and viceversa ok raja rogers maharishi would not suppor t as he wants each domain to be selfsufficient jane b still working on finding out if we can give continuing education learning units for the conference raja rogers good followup is crucial phone calls etc are necessary candace has used baby steps very effectively get team of volunteers in your area and have everyone call 12 people every day lewis maybe we should use first class mail with firsttier of people raja rogers the only reason we would use first class is to get it there more quickly jane b we have all the materials written cover letter 3 articles tricolor brochure envelope lewis it takes 7 sales impressions to close sale according to marketing principles why not send the letter now rather than wait say in the letter that we will be sending brochure etc jane b the letter relies on the enclosures raja rogers for the top people itd be better that they get 2 pieces of mail rather than 1 lewis top people need lot of advance notice because they book up months in advance dori we should call all the heads of schools and superintendents now to let them know to look out for the letter jeff litwin could we use email instead of letter with links to appropriate sites debbie lets wait until thurs to decide when we have meeting with bobby roth etc we are ahead of the timelines they sent raja rogers the level of organization is good so far we need to have timelines for when we do mailings etc debbie and jane b can work together on timeline and organizing debbie if we mail everything out 1 month in advance that is good raja rogers when we have the meeting on thurs we can review the timeline printing lists labeling mailing dori janet hoffman said the phone calls are the most important we need manpow er for that raja rogers get the lists and maybe we can find people from here who can call the raj is considered to be an embassy of our domain by raja wynne and maharishi jane b on mailing lists how select from the 3 companies raja rogers need more info in order to make decision lets wait for the thurs meeting with bobby lewis land for marble peace colonies what are guidelines for acreage and price per acre 8 acres at Â½ million per acre ok raja rogers unless there is something that is very very prestigious we go with less expensive if prestigious usually only get 152 acres because get resistance from intl if price is over 12 million drop an email or call when you get prices 1015 acres for peace colonies connie our land in chattoonoga 25 acres for 650000 its close to mall david humphreys is here and he submitted question to dr feldman as to who can hire civil engineer can you ask dr feldman next time you talk to him raja rogers yes or i will talk to david connie i heard that maharishi said there shouldnt be steel in buildings or if there is you cant spend the night in them rumor or not raja rogers maharishi doesnt like steel buildings so more will be ordered but some were ordered before the first reaction from maharishi was strongly against steel and he was wonde ring how we got locked into steel buildings more clarification may come but we should think we arent going to have steel buildings where you are jeff litwin there is rc in atlanta this weekend so invite your meditators jane b maybe we could waive our share of income if we send people to it because it has been challenging to get numbers there raja rogers lets do the numbers after and see how it goes meeting next tuesday night were really really proud of how everyone is doing our coherence its just wonde rful group to work with we are destined for success because of the group coherence and the group consciousness
