consolidation between banking and financial services firm s trends and prospects summary competitive legislative and regulatory developments in financial services in the united states have all contributed to significant industry changes the landmark financial services legislation the gr ammleachbliley act pl 106102 glba has been speeding ongoing changes in the u s financial services industry overall it allows providers flexibility in res ponding to economic trends global and especially technological advances continue to affect the financial services industry in ways yet unforeseen such factors are part of the larger picture reflected in recent mergers among large banking organizations in europe and japan as well and expanding or contracting product lines of domestic financial institutions mergers of very large banking organizati ons in europe and japan move the size of single organizations to new heights am erican providers of fi nancial services are similarly growing through combinations as exemplified by the fusion of jp morgan into the chase manhattan companies and the joining of wachovia and first union not to mention the increasing span of citigroup bankamerica acquired fleetboston to form the largest banking company in am erica and the second largest in the world increasing diversification of financial services within single entities in the united states is occurring through acquis itions and internal development of new businesses glba allowed new affiliations among banks insurance and securities firms and increased diversification within individual financial organizations in response to this increased flexibility many ins titutions have taken advantage of expanded organizational arrangements so have done so to marked advantage while others have retreated from their diversifications the most prominent backer of glba citigroup has shed the insuran ce businesses it went to great lengths to acquire and validate through that law and was cautioned in 2005 by the federal reserve on future expansions specific changes for policy considera tion depend on the predominant ways in which the financial system unfolds gl ba clearly ended the isolation of the investment banking business from the co mmercial banking bus inesses through its repeal of the glasssteagall act of 1933 the financing of enron worldcom parmalat and other

banking and financial services firms trends and prospects two types of structural tr ends affecting banking and financial services firms have been prominent first there have been amalgamations of financial companies including banks into everlarger entities generally within the same industries second there has been increasing diversifi cation of financial rvices offered within single entities whether through acquisitions or internal development of new businesses crossing industry lines ultimately these size and product changes will shape the performance of the domestic and international financial systems as nations gain experience with these changes legislative and regulatory bodies in the united states and elsewhere will be maintaining oversight to evaluate possible effects volatility in the insurance and securities sectors adds impetus to changes in financial acquisitions as well problems of corporate governance in nonfinancial sectors have come to have large role in the evolution of financial companies consolidation worldwide consolidation is occurring not only in th united states but worldwide varied factors are contributing in japan dominan t factor is the belief that the nation requires larger institutions to ease recovery from serious financial difficulties in europe the business philosophy is that crossboundary transactions are increasing within the european union now with rgely common monetary system and set of business practices and with former co mmunist countries the belief driving change in the united states is that orga nizations containing diversified financial services should have place alongside compartmentalized financial services firms much of the change not only domestically but worldwide is taking place through holding companies which hold controlling stock positions in banks and other financial companies th rough two forms of absorption merger and acquisition technically the term merger denotes one corporation purchasing another and absorbing it entirely into its own structur while acquisition means one holding company buying another to control it in this country most financial fusions of large size take the form of an acquisiti on canada too has m oved toward holding companybased framework of fi nancial firms acquisitions in the increasingly international financial economies of computerized world new

resultin g trilliondollar group nominally the largest banking organization in the world by assets it and another japanese firm created by merger as an alternative to collapse mitsubishi tokyo have kept that nations institutions at the top of asset sizing japanese supergiants and the european ones to lesser extent have emerged as the result not of streng th but of weakness japanese banks in particular keep vast quantities of severely overvalued bad loans and investments on their books calling into question their actual asset sizes and making them fall behind in operating re sults and market value american institutions resulting from acquisitions are among the worlds largest as they were years ago the us companies fannie mae and freddie mac have grown to dominate their mortgage market without major acquisitions however by relying on governmental support general electric and berkshire hathaway often treated as nonfinancial entities appear among the rgest businesses doing financial services as the result of acquisitions it is hard to compare the sizes of financial business that result from corporate deals and internal growth when they are so varied banks historically sized by assets have become more interested in revenuegen erating nonlending activities insurers share many of the assetsonhand features of banks except in their health lines yet are subject to payouts on policie s and thus might be sized by assets or revenues transactionbased firms such as securities brokerdealers and mortgage bankers try to minimize their own assets at risk and thus are generally stratified by revenues or profits fina ncial analysts often anal yze businesses of any kind including financial entities by the value of their enterprise in the marketplaces for stocks and bonds what investors believe the firms activities are worth multinational operations of every large financial company worldwide can move it up or down in comparative ranking when exchange rates shift thus variety of standards are used to construct table 1 which is an approximation of the sizes of the worlds largest financial firms not all mergers succeed one prominent example called off before it happened was of deutsche bank and dr esdner bank in germany that proposed merger would have created banking organization that would then have become the largest anywhere dresdner instead sold itself to the allianz insurance firm in mid2001 in transaction that weakened the new buyer other mergers here including that of citigroup noted below and abroad whic h observers had anticipated would become

national policy or pose systemic risks to their economies however they are toobigtofail governmental intervention will almost certainly occur to assure their survival in case of difficulty this is the financial situa tion of japan its g overnment has propped up enormous bad loans and i nvestments in the financia l system consequentially encouraging mergers of banks and othe r financial companies through deposit insurance tax and regulatory mechanisms mergers of large financial institutions in the united states as for bankingbased entities fusions of us institutions beginning in the mid 1990s significantly changed the countrys financial ins titutions both in size and diversification of services the buoyan t economic environment with its richly valued stock prices encouraged corporate deals of all kinds including in finance us banking law changed to encourage large amalgamations by market extension across america coasttocoast or regionally major financial legislation the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 pl 103 328 envisioned these mergers that act pr ovided the statutory authority and set the framework for bank holding companies to acquire banks outside their home states and for banks to secure branches on an inte rstate basis as result the share of industry assets of the ten largest us banking organizations essentially doubled in the decade ending in 1999 before major statutory incentive noted below meanwhile financial industrie s remain much less concentr ated than many others in notable deals the most prominen t was the formation of citigroup which uniquely mixed domestic and international financial services of many kinds it anticipated pl 106102 discussed in more detail below in its combination of banking securities and insurance businesses into one holding company its formation predated enactment of that law that would ratify all of its deals because it had received special regulatory exemp tion from the federal reserve citigroup also expanded by acquisition along traditional lines including recent deals for european american bank golden state bancorp in californi and banamex in mexico and into the securities and insurance businesses the complex formation of jp morgan chase included the former chemical taking over chase manhattan several securities businesses and then jp morgan before changing its name name change also occurred after wachovia absorbed first union the latter having been on valuedestroying path of multiple acquisitions insu rance companies too are engaging in megamergers most notably the acquisition of american general by american international group and of li ncoln re by swiss reinsurance co bank of america startled the world of finance by announcing fusion with fleetboston financial to create banking company holding 10 of us banking deposits the expanded institution is tr uly nationwide bank along lines envisioned in the riegleneal act of 1994 and yet t ouching upon

one deal flows of this as most industry s ectors have accelerated into early 2005 such mergers are important steps in the evolving deregulation of the traditionally tightly limited co mmercial banking and insura nce industries even while finance began shifting away from bank ans and deposits to securities throughout america investment banking and other securities firms have become perhaps even more important than traditional commercial banking to acquirers antitrust concerns over geographic concentration of traditiona l banking products re main however the justice department has require d divestiture of branches as condition of some recent banking fusions antitrust concerns em body societal views that banks should provide customer services in an atmosphere of some competition customers ought not to be charged much more for or be discouraged from financial services because of declines in numbers of providers many believe that fi nancial fusions have disadvantaged individuals and small businesses upon creation of large complex financial organizations lacking community orientation secu rities and insurance companies might siphon funds away from calities even further in that view expanding lines of business for us financial companies industry observers expected wave of growth and diversification among united states institutions following ongoing appli cation of legislation enacted in 1999 the grammleachbliley act pl 106102 glba that law eases affiliations among banking insurance and securities firms in the us including those owned by foreign parties and increases diversification with in individual financia l organizations most prominently glba followed the fusion of travelers insurance with the bank holding company citicorp which would eventually would have to dissolve unless legislation would allow the combination of banking with insurance under one roof responding to the increased flexibility in glba institutions have been rapidly making new organizational arrangements glba has several provisions easing di versification by financial services companies structurally companies subject to bank regulation may expand their array of financial pr oducts through several options glba provides for financial holding company option and financial subs idiary option new mechanism is also in place for the federal reserve and the department of the treasury to decide what is an appropriate financial activity besides activities authorized by name in glba companies wishing to expand services through holding company framework have more latitude to do so postglba in that measure congress repealed provisions of the 1933 glasssteagall act th at had long precluded the affiliations of banks and securities firms and parts of the 1956 bank holding company act that formerly precluded affiliati ons of banks and insuran ce underwriters bank holding companies wishing to become financial holding companies fhcs file notice of their election to choose new status w ith the fed as do foreign banks under modified procedure fhcs have ce grown to prominence more than 600 domestic and foreign financial firms of all sizes have become fhcs securitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30516crs6 based investment bank holding companies such as merrill lynch have similar potentials under securities and exchange commission regulation another way for commercial banks wish ing to expand product lines directly is through the creation of financ ial subsidiaries fs this arrangement allows banks to own companies doing fina ncial activities that the banks may do directly or more significantly activities that banks may not otherwise engage in directly banks wishing to do so follow the certification and notification procedures prescribed by their primary federal regulator most prominently the office of the comptroller of the currency which charters nd regulates nationa l banks the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation govern fs of state banks an institutions chartering authority whether the occ or state must also permit contemplated activities many fs are insurance agency subsidiaries an unforeseen aspect is that despite glbas encouragement fusions of insurance and banking companies have not been going on rapidly volatile often low returns on many lines of insu rance underwriting policywriting and investments deter bankers the propertycasualty sector in particular remains unattractive for most fhcs not only following the events of september 2001 but also because it lacks nationally uniform system of regulation such as depository institutions enjoy the prototype fhc citigroup reversed its course to exit the propertycasualty underwriting business by dive sting travelers insurance in contrast profits in the insurance field are generally greater and more predictable in the sales or agency capacity that banks often undert ake through subsidiaries because policy losses do not negatively ffect sales commissions insurance companies themselves have been moving very slowly into the banking field following the example of metlif becoming fhc in 2001 securities firms are conversely taking on fullservice ba nking especially merrill lynch which has come to have major deposits in the banks it controls under glba momentum may be gathering for both nonbanking industries increasingly to fold banks into their operations especially if economic uncertainties keep the attractiveness of federally insured deposits as safe assets high in comparison with securities competition measured as numbers of providers nationwide seems likely to continue its decline overcapacity in financial businesses became reduced over time before glba through consolidation in s ectors except securities the top ten firms have increased their share of assets since the mid1990s while the number of participants shrank the number of co mmercial banks fell from about 25000 before world war i to less than 8000 recently securities brokers nd dealers numbered more than 9500 in 1987 and have likewise dec lined in number investment firms however if defined to encompass investment advisors asset managers mutual funds hedge funds etc have grown over time life insurance underw riters fell from about 2200 in 1985 to less than 1600 in 2000 todays approxima tely 3000 property casualty insurers are generally expected to fall by perhaps onethird most us savings and loan associations vanished years ago through waves of supervisory mergers like the japanese mode that in creasing size can paper over bad loans as well as by collapse fewer than 1500 such thrift institutions remainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30516crs7 customers generally believe that enough providers to serve them at least for transacting business across political bounda ries such as many insurance and securities companies have historically done even for mortgages the historical major and locationally limited products of savings and loan associations national market developed through brokers nd other parties for this fi nancial product even though the number of associations shrank sharply because of losses and failures of firms simultaneously nonfinancial providers ffer new customer choices relating to financial services consumers may use fi nancial services thr ough software products offered by nonfinancial providers while internetonly banking has not been great success to date offerings of online access to bricksandmortar financial institutions have proven viable various kinds of businesses are also linking their products to other services directly for advertising re venues or for slice of transactions as agents such new products are increasin g competition for business in this sense in other expansions into nontraditiona l businesses banking companies have taken on trading in the kinds of derivatives that enron marketed ubs warburg unit of diversified banking company ubs of switzerland beat out citgroup

relief act of 2005 hr 3505 and the financial services re gulatory relief act of 2006 s 2856 both bills were passed by their respective houses and conference is in the process of ironing out their differences the provisions of these bills address the interactions between depository institutions and commercial firms and reaffirm the regulatory authority of state insurance supervisors another

analysis brings additional more complex measures into determining anticompetitiveness from mergers table 3 shows actual figures and summe d results as if the deals had occurred at the time when

371 national asset share that figure represents significant increase in the asset concentration of banking services nationally industry ranking s remain the same when adjusted observers believe that these megamergers will encourage wave of consolidation and thus increase resource concentration in banking for example regions financial announced its deal for uni on planters few months later seeking to create peer fhc this sector remains more competitive than most others in the economy however if viewed through the nses of other antitrust criteria because of its many providers and the many financ ial services availa ble from nonbank providers and over the internet risk management the dynamics of consolidations combined with the commingling of financial services have made risk ma nagement more difficult for the services providers and their regulators in the glba framework where services such as banking insurance and securities trading are provided by single institution the responsibi lities of regulating financial institutions are more complicated because the regulators longer have the separation of the lines of businesses that they had in the past driven by technological advances and compe tition among providers new products have helped to erase the traditional lines of demarcation in financial services that the regulatory structure and markets were built upon bank regulators for example continue to lower barriers to bank try into commodity futures and options businesses and insurance has become popular bank product rules and regulatory requirements concerning these products of ten fall under the supervision of multiplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30516crs10 regulators as bankers have gotten more involved in the securities business the business has changed causing risk manage ment issues to fall under the jurisdiction of bank regulators and the commodity futures trading commission cftc but most regulatory changes have occurred afte r the risks have risen sufficiently to show the deficiencies consequently regulators are now placing great emphasis on improving creditrisk management deve loping and improving their methods of measuring risk on transactionbytransac tion basis these methods are attempts to better quantify risk and establish mo re formal and disciplined processes to recognize price and manage risk banking to ensure compliance to federal regulators risk management requirements bank regulators have been moving fro m the traditional regime of periodic examinations to inhouse examiners the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal reserve system for example have placed resident examiners in the 24 largest national banks these examiner s and specialists in areas such as commercial and retail cred it capital markets bank technology and asset management provide the regulators with realtime risk management information in addition the federal regulatory agen cies are in the rulemaking stage of implementing the basel ii capital accord as well as modifying the existing capital accord basel i to make them more sensitive to the changing risk in banks portfolios under the basel riskbased sy stem each assets proba bility of default is estimated in each line of business such as mortgages consumer loans credit card and automobile loans given the probability of default the agencies require the banks to keep the appropria level of capital on hand similar methodology is set up for commercial paper as well as derivatives equities and bonds insurance banks and insurance and securities firm s sell deferred annu ities term life insurance and propertycasualty to individuals and commercial entities consequently most of these financial services providers have become proficient at managing the risk inherent in these produc ts consolidation is taking place within each sector as banks general merge with ba nks and insurers with insurers however risk management in the insurance business has evolved along similar form in both the banking and insurance sectors for example risk sharing is common risk mitigating technique used by bankers and insurers the institution finances its risks either directly or through an insurer or reinsurer by selling bonds to institutional investors the payment of in terest or principa l depends on the occurrence or severity of the insured event finite risk insurance is an established risk management tool these are multiyear multiperil andor mu ltitrigger coverages that combine self financed reinsurance protection and an agreement that the reinsurer will not cover losses above specified amount this ri sk management tool reduces earnings volatility for the insured and limits the reinsure rs exposure in addition insurers and bankers are active in the credit risk transfer market where insurers are net protection sellers and banks are net pr otection buyers while thes instruments may enhance the efficiency and stability of credit risk they tend to be complex and lack transparency consequently supervisor authorities have been introducing more complex requirements to make these transactions more transparent httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30516crs11 securities like the insurance industry with th exception of exchanges significant consolidation has not taken place in th securities industry however the development of financ ial instruments that incorporate characteristics of banking and insurance products has also complicated ri sk management in the securities industry furthermore overthecounter instruments ch as swaps caps collars and floors are increasingly popular alternatives to ex changetraded instruments exchange traded instruments are standardized cont racts for fixed amount delivered at specified date at partic ular location overthecount er instruments are custom designed to reflect specific needs of the participants these instruments are oneon one arrangements with feeearning broker who could be attached to securities firm an insurance company or bank many of these instruments are not transparent have default risk exposure and have limited risk pr otection and they are legally enforceable contracts risk management defined as th limitation of the risks faced by an organization due to its exposure to changes in financial market variables has been significant force behind recent changes in the business pursuits of number of the firms for example numbe r of firms have significantly increased their involvement in proprietary trading or trading for their own accounts wide ranging trading that can range from domestic equities to derivatives to foreign securities some firms have also significantly boosted their presence in th private equity market by taking direct investment stakes in worldwide enterprises in the last few years number of firms have become brokerage intermediaries fo r hedge funds and in an attempt to lure back the institutional investor trades number of securities firms have become increasingly willing to commit their own capita l to help facilitate the institutions large block trades recently the new york stock exchange and the nasdaq exchange each merged with electronicba sed securities trading rival and due in part to concerns that the consolidations could provide the two exchanges with an opportunity to boost their trade transaction fees number of wall street firms have acquired stakes in smaller rival regional stock exchanges to reduce the risk of higher transaction cost from the larger exchanges
