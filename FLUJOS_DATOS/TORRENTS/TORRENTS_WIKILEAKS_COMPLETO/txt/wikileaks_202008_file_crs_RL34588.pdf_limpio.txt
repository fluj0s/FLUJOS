defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34588chinas foreign policy what does it mean for us global interests summary since the late 1990s chinas robust inte rnational engagement has caught many by surprise and prompted growing ameri can debate over the prcs motivations and objectives this international engagement has expanded while the united states has been preoccupied with its military involveme nt in iraq and afghanistan congress and other us policymakers are becoming increasingly concerned that chinas expanded international engage ment could have its soft power projection and affect us economic and strategic interests experience suggests that abrupt unexplained shifts in policy occur with some regularity in the prc system still it is possible to point to some fundamental objectives that appear to be motivating beijings foreign policy these include an imperative to promote and enhance china s economic developmen t particularly its voracious need for energy resources and raw materials to sustain its doubledigit annual growth an effort to separate the island of taiw an over which the prc claims sovereignty from its 23 remaining official relationships and desire to increase chinas international stature and compete more successfully with perceived us supremacy to achieve these ends china in recent years has crafted multitude of bilateral agreements and partnerships joined and become more active in existing multilateral organiza tions and become founding member of new multilateral institutions in which the united states is not member of alarm to some chinas policy appro ach has several competitive soft power advantages over the united states the unrestricted nature of beijings overseas loans and investments is attractive to foreign governments wanting swifter more efficient and less intrusive solutions to their development problems than western lenders will offer and beijings large stateowned companies with deep pockets and shareholders to answer to can affo rd shortterm losses in pursuit of longer term more strategic gains but chinas approach also has structural limitations in areas where the united states is strong beijings foreign development policy operates from much narrower base with chinas winwin approach tackling easy issues first and postponing difficult issues perhaps indefi nitely acquiring and maintaining an international presence also brings certain complications that are new to the prc including multiple opportunities for intern ational misunderstanding resentment and cultural backlash finally unlike the united states china lacks the advantage of substantial privatesector i nvestment presence overseas whatever policy options the united states adopts chinas growing international political and

the late 1970s on mu ltiple global economic and political endeavors the r obust international engagement of the peoples republic of china prc since 2000 caught many by surprise and prompted spirited american disagreement and bate over the prcs foreign policy motivations and objectives the fact that much of this international engagement has expanded while the united states has been preoccupied with its military involvement in iraq and afghanistan also has brought about period of american introspection variously referred to as chinas charm offensive or its soft power approach beijings

ultimately intends direct challenge to us global power as result congress and other us policymakers are focusing attention on the critical implications chinas increasing international engagement could have for us economic and strategic interests prc diplomacy this report emphasizes the prcs foreign policy and diplomatic activities around the wo rld rather than its security policy chinas foreign policy today has changed fundamentally since the nations founding in 1949 through the 1950s and 1960s chairman ma zedongs policy of selfreliance greatly constrained the nations foreign contacts beijings foreign policy goals then centered on promoting maoist revolutiona ry parties around the world lingering dispute over the chinese communist governments legitimacy in the international community facilitated its inte rnational isolation althoug h maos forces had won the civil war conflict on ma inland china many countries including the united states continued to recognize the previous repub lic of china roc government that had fled to taiwan as the countrys righ tful government while the prc went unrepresented in much of the international community in its early decades taiwan continued to control chinas embassies ar ound the world to be chinas signatory to international agreements and to hold the chinese seat in the united nations and other multilateral organizations all this began to change in the early 1970s when president nixon initiated an opening to china and the united nations voted to recognize the prc as chinas legitimate representativ under

become an international export powerhouse has expanded its membership and participation in international organizations and increasingly has appeared willing to embr ace many norms and rules of the global economic system of which the united states is the chief architect and dominant player since 2000 in particular there has been steady increase in the quantity and sophistication of prc diplomacy beijing has courted foreign governments with highlevel diplomatic exchanges trade initiatives investment agreements and tourism and cultural understandings chinas new security concept although this report focuses on non military aspects of chinas foreign policy discussion of chinas international rise would be complete without acknowledgment of qually important changes in chinas security policy1 paralleling its foreign policy developments changes in prc security policy are thought to be based on beijings perceptions since the mid1990s that the country was facing new security challenges among these new perceived challenges were the demise of the soviet union and international communism the postcold war surge in us global do minance in particular the decisive demonstration of us military supremacy in the persian gulf war the increasing proindependence activism on taiwan and the bene fits and complications accompanying chinas own rapid economic growth as defined in series of white papers published by the state council information office since 1995 chinas new security concept states that the postcold war order requires more pragmatic secur ity policy based on mutual trust mutual equality and cooperation2 the new security concept seeks to assure that chinas economic development and military growth is not th reat to its neighbors or the world in keeping with its new international diplomacy chinas new security approach serves the multiple goals of trying to defuse international instabilities that could adversely affect chinas own deve lopment trying to expand chinas own wealth and influence in ways seen as non threatening to its neighbors and trying to balance us global power in manner that serves chinas interests unlike past security challenges to the united states chinas new security approach is difficult to categorize or define it focuses neither on spreading political ideology nor establishing global network of client states nor aggressively seeking territorial gains in tandem with its foreign policy diplomacy chinas new security concept presents unique and subtle cha llenge to us policymakers framing the debate on ch inas growing global reach discussion of chinas in ternational engagement must begin with several caveats about the limits of what is known fi rst there is little consensus within the us and global chinawatching communities on chinas ultimate foreign policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34588crs3 3 morck randall yeung bernard and zhao minyuan perspectives on chinas outward foreign direct investment august 2007 goals or on what motivates and informs chinas decisions either decisions made in general terms or with regard to speci fic regions or countries does chinas international engagement have pragmatic overarching strategy or is it series of marginally related tactical moves to seek normal economic and political advantages is beijing interested in supplanting the ited states as global power or focused mainly on fostering its own national development does the prc feel strong and confident internationally or weak and uncertain these questions remain unanswered lack of transparency in foreign policy decision making many have written on chinas fore ign policy decision making although chinas foreign policymaking has become more regularized in recent years few claim to be certain about how chinas decisions are made about who makes them or about what long term goals chinese policies seek to attain some profess certainty but they have not been able to demonstrate th at their convictions lead to any sort of consistency in analyzing or predicting chinas foreign policy decisions in the aftermath of incidents of sinous tension or confr ontation such as the case in 2001 when chinese fighter jet collided with us ep3 reconnaissance plane or the case in 2007 when the prc suddenly denied hong kong port visits to series of us ships us officials have remained larg ely in the dark about the prcs crisis management processes and bout why and how prc leader s reached their decisions the number of unknown variables that still animate chinas foreign policy decisionmaking processes is simply too gr eat these variables include uncertainties about the clashes and respective strengths of internationalists and hardliners in chinese politics about whether and how th interests of various prc bureaucracies compete and conflict on given issue nd about the extent to which bureaucratic actors seek to undermine policies that they see as disadvantageous to them given these uncertainties there appears to be magic bullet then individual or group with proven answers that definitivel can inform us views or prepare us government and congressiona l actors on how best to ddress the challenges china poses to us and global interests lack of aid and investment data relatedly study of prc international influence is hampered by lack of relia ble data on chinese foreign aid and by lack of transparency on whether and how the prc makes and implements large high profile investment agreements accord ing to one 2007 study directed by the international monetary fund imf chinas outward foreign direct investment fdi in 2005 was 5 percent that of the united st ates with 80 percent apparently going to the tax havens of hong kong cayman islands and the british virgin islands its final destinations impossible to trace3 the prc does provide assistance to ot her countries aid which comes from multiple government agencies with little or apparent oversight moreover this

assistance loans debt forgiveness the building of large public facilities and trade and investment agreements do not meet the traditional definition of overseas deve lopment assistance or oda which is how most of the worlds donor countries provide aid furt hermore prc assistance is not provided in regularized annual allotments but appears to follow funding schedule determined by beijings diplomatic priorities beijing reportedly also is reluctant officially to reveal the totals of its foreign assistance for variety of reasons including out of fear of domestic objection that beijing is not spending its money at home rather than abroad or because much of what appears to be the prcs investment and assistance ma be roundtripped or returned back to china as foreign investment5 in sum the extent of prc fo reign assistance to other countries cannot be determined accurately at the same time that the prc is providing global aid and investment it is also on the receiving end of substantial aid and investment eligible for world bank lending as one of 24 bankclassified deve loping countries in east asia and the pacific along with the philippines mongolia fiji and palau china not only is

cumulative bank lending to china since 1981 as of june 30 2007 was appr oximately 422 billion7 the prc also is the largest recipient of foreign direct investme nt fdi among developing countries questions about us policy finally although us administrations for decades have pursued consistent engagement with china periodic questions arise about whether the us approach is based on wellarticulated nd coherent strategy or is simply an approach of convenien ce that should be reassessed in the face of chinas rise outside the administration the us policy debate continues to be characterized by the divisive dynamics that arose in the mid1990s in which american hardliners selfdescribed as the blue team are pitted against those advising cooperation and engage ment with china labeled as the red team by the opposing group thus there is little agr eement about the degree of threat or challenge china poses to the united states in the vocal minority are those who view china as growing military menace with malign intent many advocates of this view have been perceived by others as agitators whose counsel to treat china as major threat to us interests has implications for us

conflict with china than to deter it the view that has been pursued more openly by us administrations is one that counsels cooperation and engagement with china as the best way to integrate china into the prevailing global system as responsible stakeholder nation that has responsibility to strengthen the international system that has enabled its success8 many opponents of this approach argue that these observers have been sedu ced by the potential of the china market are oblivious to prc hostile intent accede to prc wishes and demands unnecessarily and thereby squander us strategic leverage and compromise us interests another contentious part of this debate involves an argument over which theme should predominate in us policy decisions enterprising economic endeavor or lofty political standards the confrontational and highlycharged dynamic between these two polar views continues to make it difficult to achieve greater american consensus on how the united states should position itsel f to meet the challenges china poses within these caveats then this report seeks to lay basic framework for congressional policymakers to understand chinas intern ational engagement and address what it may mean for us interests the concept of soft power the term soft power originally was conceived in 1990 by harvard professor joseph s nye jr nye argued that the united states had reserves of power and influence that were separate from har d power or military force projection he expanded greatly on this concept in his book soft power the means to success in world politics partly he said from the frust ration of watching some policy makers ignore the importance of our soft power and make us all pay the price by unnecessarily squandering it9 according to nye soft power is crucially important in todays world politics and is significantly more than just the trappings of national culture soft power rests on the ability to shape the preferences of others it is the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments it arises from the attractiveness of countrys culture political ideals and policies when our policies are seen as gitimate in the eyes of others our soft power is enhanced america has long had great deal of soft power10 by nyes definition emphasizing the attr activeness of countrys culture and values american soft power remains for midable some define the components of soft power more broadly than nye to include not only the attractiveness of countrys policies but also its internati onal trade practices overseas investments

disaster relief ducation and travel and tourism even according to this broader definition american global power remains massive but according to another view american soft power has declined in the 21st century in absolute terms some believe this perceived decline is the result of the united states own policies and actions on former us govern ment official has speculated that although america has huge re maining reserves of soft power these reserves have become nonrenewabl resource given current us policies11 others point to multiple global survey results on international views of the united states saying the downwar d trend is unmistakable12 as nye himself puts it antiamericanism has increased in recent years and the united states soft power is in decline as resulta eu robarometer poll found that majority of europeans believes that washington has hindered efforts to fight global poverty protect the environment and maintain p eace such attitudes undercut soft power reducing the ability of the united states to achieve its goals13 others have attributed the perceived decline in american soft power as relative largely comparative decline based on the rise of other powers in particular the rapid emergence of china as us peer competitor and growing source of international influence i nvestment and political and ec onomic clout china is seen to be trying to project soft power by traying its own system as an alternative model for economic development that doe s not require compliance with western standards economic devel opment without the restricti ons and demands that come with political liberalization proves attractive to some authoritarian governments ruled by elites furthermore according to this view soft power is ephemeral the united states has recovered from loss of prestige and influence before such as occurred with the vietnam war and it will ag ain for this reason they say chinas apparent soft power gains shoul d not be blown out of proportion presumed prc foreign policy goals within the ongoing international debate about what chinas ultimate intentions may be there is broader cons ensus on some of the fundame ntal objectives that appear to be at least partial motivations fo r beijings current international outreach however adding to the uncertainty about prc policies these objectives at times are in contradiction chinas po licy direction is that much harder to predict when some of these key policy objectives are seen to clash and experience suggests that abrupt shifts in policy shifts which remain unexplained in many cases still occur with fair degree of regularity in the prc system this may be the result of fundamental incoherence in prc policy goals more likely it reflects the internal disagreements and varying priorities of th various political and bureaucr atic players in the prchttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34588crs7 14 xie fuzhan commissioner national bureau of statistics of china the national economy

routinely are in the double digits in 2007 china reached an annual rate of 114 percent the highest since 199414 this rapid and sustai ned economic growth has created voracious domestic appetites for res ources capital and technology as well as for markets for chinese goods all of which have served as powerful drivers of chinas international trade and investment agreements in energy sources alone for example china became net importer in 1995 it became net importer of oil in 1993 nd its energy demands are expected to continue increasing at an nnual rate of four to five percent through at least 2015 compared to an annual rate of about one percent in industrialized countries15 china steadily and successfully has sought trade ag reements oil and gas contracts scientific and technological cooperati on and defacto multilateral s ecurity arrangements with countries both around its periphery and around the world in africa asia and latin america where china is most active access to energy resources and raw commodities to fuel chinas domestic growth plays dominant role in beijings activities china has oil and gas exploration contracts with brazil ecuador bolivia colombia venezuela and c uba oil contracts and pipelin deals are major part of chinas relations with central asian stat such as uzbekistan and turkmenistan and chinas oil exploration interests ex tend to burma vietnam and malaysia imports of crude oil constitute the bulk of chinas imports from african states squeezing taiwans international space in addition to economic and resourcerelated imperatives chinas outreach into latin america and the caribbean africa and the pacific incorporates the political dynamic of trying to separate taiwan from its remaining diplomatic relationships china claims that taiwan is part of its sovereign territory and for decades has tr ied to make acknowledg ment of this one china policy condition for receiving chinese investment and assistance all but one of taiwans remaining 23 official re lationships are in africa asia and latin america with chinas dynamic economic growth in recent decades it effectively has been able to outbid taiwan in c ourting number of these

issue is important in chinas african relationships it is not important in chinas relati ons with central asian count ries where taiwan has official diplomatic relations nor of comp arable importance in chinas relationships with southeast asian countries where taiw an has significant economic interests but again diplomatic ties and taiwan is very important factor even perhaps the only one in chinas courtship of the 6 tiny pacific island nations that still have official relations with taiwan although the united states and europe save for the vatican do not have diplomatic relations with taiwan periodic tensions with china over us and eu statements and actions w ith respect to taiwan continue to affect bilateral relationships taiwanprc competition looms largest in chinas relationships in latin america and the caribbean not only is this where taiwan maintains most of its remaining official diplomatic ties but the regions proximity to the us mainland allows taiwans president and senior leaders to ask for controversial but symbolically meaningful transit stops in the united states when making official visits to these western hemisphere countries significant reduction or even the disappearance of taiwans latin america and caribbean relationships could impair this convenient taiw anus connection on an entirely different level taiwan also is potentially important factor in chinas activities with us allies in asia japan and australia especially but also korea and the philippines while all of these countries recognize the prc and not taiwan as us allies and hosts of us military facilities they potentially could become factor in any uschina conf lict over taiwan in 2005 for instance the united states and japan declared for the first time that taiwan is mutual security concern implying new japanese willingness to confront china over taiwan it is in chinas interests then to use its diplomatic and economic activities to exert quiet pressure on these us allies to stay out of any possible conflict over taiwan maneuvering against taiwan and ultimately recovering it provides one of the key contradictions in chinas foreign policy objectives as it is an issue that appears to trump other key policy goals chinese officials have said for instance that they will pay any price to prevent taiwan independence although this would jeopardize the otherwise key imperative of assuring strong economic growth not to mention risking armed confrontation with the united states16 but again perhaps reflecting internal disagreements among prc political actors prc policies toward taiwan also have evolved over time into as much carrot as stick prc leaders have toned down their rhetoric holding out ec onomic incentives and agreeing to resume crossstrait

decision in 2003 to tone down its antius rhetoric and criticism and instead to empha size chinas peaceful rise on the world stage18 according to this view beijing calculates that even the appearance of more overt pursuit of its regional and global in terests could prompt the united states to strengthen its alliances and form other gr oupings to counterbalance and deter chin as international

particularly strong in areas where the us political system and us values make it less competitive some suggest that these prc strengths have brighter future in toda ys global economy meaning that china will have increasing economic and political soft power clout internationally at the expense of the united states still closer l ook at some of the prcs presumed assets suggests that they may have downsides as well strings the recipient governments of prc trade and investment are particularly attracted to the fact that chinese money generally comes with none of the good governance requirements human rights conditions approvedproject restrictions and environmental quality regulations that characterize us and other western government investments with an authoritarian government that has few if any democratic imperatives china has capitalized on its willingness to make such unrestricted international investments part of its winwin international strategy prc leaders do not appear to define th eir demand that country adopt one china policy nor their frequent insistence on use of chinese companies suppliers and banks as such restrictions in response to the december 2006 military coup in fiji for instance beijing promised to continue its aid programs on the grounds that the coup was fijis internal affair china markets this capacity internationally as key competitive advantage to western capital one that is both more efficient and less intrusive for the recipients and the unrestricted nature of prc investments resonates with many foreign governments according to one african leader for instance i have found that contract that would take five years to discuss negotiate and sign with the world bank takes three months when we have dealt with chinese authorities i

an obligation to opt for swifter solutions28 the world bank and western governments may be able to increase the efficiency of their international investme nt processes and redu ce attending red tape to compete with these prc advantages but beijings willingness to make unrestricted investments while holding the recipients to standards can be seen as implicitly validating the policies of the of ten authoritarian recipient governments such handsoff approach could have negative longerterm implications for how the prc is viewed within the countries in which it is investing particularly if the authoritarian leaders in question later fall to more democratic government on balance then chinas strings pproach may have potential negative consequences that could counterba lance any soft power advantages the benefits of stateowned assets the prc is thought to reap soft power advantages by having much of its fo reign investment carried out by its strong stateowned sector given m onopoly status by the chinese government these state corporations lack transparency have deep pockets backed by government assets and operate without the constraints that come with having to issue corporate annual report unlike us corporations investin g overseas who lack this close government patronage and in addition must answer to their shareholders prc stateowned companies have the luxury of being able to take longerterm strategic view one more closely integrated with national pr iorities without having to demonstrate shortterm profits there may be potential negative cons equences some hold that there is certain discipline in having to adhere to the bottom line prc stateowned companies lacking this builtin discipline sometimes are seen to have paid above market prices for their oil and gas contr acts and to have ente red into unprofitable initial arrangements in order to improve bilateral relations and facilitate future contracts in addition chinese soes ve high retained earnings rate and notable aversion to paying dividends to their largely governmentcontrolled shareholders concerned about this trend the chinese securities regulatory commission in 2004 and 2005 enacted regulations designed to force higher dividend payouts targeting soes with positive profits but dividend payouts over three year period29 limitations on prc soft power even if its international outreach is entirely benign and centered on economic growth the prcs potential to expand quick ly to consumption and production levels comparable to those of the united states presents profound challenges to american and global interests other projections tend to minimize or overlook other limitations and complications that confront chinas overseas activities recognition of these and other limitations of prc influence may help shape more effective us responsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34588crs14 30 the study an examination of voting records from 1991 2003 conducted in 2006 by the

108 advantage us although china has expanded impressively the pace and scope of its international activities its achievements pale in comparison to the long standing and comprehensive gl obal involvement of the united states in many cases where china is newly arriving the united states is already entrenched beijing has been forced often to accommodate itself to the realities of strong us presence this was the case for instance in the east asian summit eas forum beijing originally hoped would lead to greater prc dominance in east asia at us expense but other eas participants wary asia would become divided into chinese and american blocs opposed prc attempts to craft more exclusive group with itself as the dominant member southeast asian participants in the eas succeeded in including india australia and new zeal and as counterweights to chinese power in other cases prc actions in given country do not always lead to beijings desired objective for instance the prc tried in 2005 to condition its support for renewing the peacekeeping mission in haiti on that countrys severing of relations with taiwan th is was unsuccessful and iti in 2008 continues to have diplomatic relations with ta iwan in another example the prcs efforts to extend its influence in central asia through formation of the shanghai cooperation organization did not prevent individual sco member countries from hosting us military forces after the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states moreover prc foreign policy success sometimes is constrained by the fact that the countries beijing is courting have other more complex fore ign policy interests according to one study of voting r ecords for example countrys increased dependence on trade with china does not appear to affect its willingness to vote against prc interests in the united nations30 the narrow base of prc achievements in general chinas new win win approach to international interactions is based on selfinterested approach that focuses only on those issues on which all sides supposedly can agree easy things are taken care of first while inconvenien t and difficult things are postponed possibly indefinitely racking up trade and investment agreements in this way while creating symbolically significant headlines nevertheless leaves lack of depth in chinas overall relationships moreover as alread mentioned chinas lack of transparency raises consistent doubts about whether the vels of aid and inve stment triumphantly announced are the levels of aid nd investment actually disbursed to cite one example china initially reported that it pledged 63 million in assistance to indonesia and other countries affected by the 2004 tsunami figure dwarfed by the 405 million pledged by the ited states later article in prc publication however put the actual am ount of prc tsunami assistance at 226 million31 prc foreign policy achievements may be constrained if beijing continues to shortchange its intended recipient governments in this way us observers mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34588crs15 32 prime minister tony blair doctrine of the international community in speech before the chicago economic club april 22 1999 want to be cautious then about the initia l headlines of prc involvement and more mindful of the degree of followthrough winwin strategy may prove slender reed for maximizing comprehensive soft power the soft power potential that the prc can hope to gain from such strategy pales next to the national capacity and willingness of the united states to take on costly and forlorn global tasks such as international disaster aid to demonstrate willingness in the words of tony blair to be the recipient of every demand to be called upon in ev ery crisis to be expected always and everywhere to do what needs to be done32 nothing in beijings current international engagement to date suggests it is willing to embrace such altruism the complications of an international presence even with win win strategy acquiring nd maintaining an enhanced international presence brings with it certain complications among ot her things it provides almost innumerable opport unities for international misunderstanding resentment cultural backlash kidnappings hard feelings murders and other assorted repercussions cultural backlash and resentment may be heightened by the style that prc overseas investments and construction projects have pursued to date involving the substantial import of chinese workers and supplies and the use of chinese companies instead of using local companies or the indigenous population chinese overseas operations already have begun to experience fallout from their activities prc oil drilling sites and wellworkers have been attacked kidnapped or killed in sudan somalia nigeria and elsewhere in africa some central asia countries have grown concerned about the level of energy assets that china has been accruing within their borders and have moved to limit such acqui sitions in some asian countries with large ethnic chinese populations there s been pushback against perceived chinese businesses and other interests as chinas international activities expand confrontations along these lines are likely to increase possibly garnering unfavorable publicity for the prc and putting stress on the winwin approach foreign entanglements also could raise political problems at home for prc policymakers the increasing availability of internet and cell phone use assures that growing numbers of chinese citizens ve more access to information including information about chinas in ternational activities confirmation that china is investing millions of dollars in overseas projects while at home unemployment rises and infrastructure development lags ma prove objectionable to the hundreds of millions of prc citizens still living belo w the poverty line much the way many americans sometimes react to us overseas investment the private sector calculation as noted above beijing is seen to have advantages over the united states in that its overseas activities and investments are conducted by strong well funded stateowned companies these large prc government activities attract much international attention and give hard edge to prc soft power the united states has little to match such centrally directed initiatives
