from darrell kaufman darrellkaufmannauedu to kbriffaueaacuk kbriffaueaacuk subject re 2k arctic synthesis date fri 6 mar 2009 115930 0700 xflowed great ill play with both the composite series and the three individuals i was hoping to get some spatially distributed information so might include all three i will also subdivide by proxy time and use pca to examine spatial patterns ill take stab at revising the text to include few sentences about how we chose the treering series then maybe you can take look on monday have good weekend darrell on mar 6 2009 at 1154 am kbriffaueaacuk wrote darell the short answer is yes you need to give the appropriate weight to the eurasian aggregate series though ie this one series should count as 3 in an average of all high latitude eg compared to rosanne darrigo west n american series unless you use the 3 separate seriesfennoscaniayamal taimyr individually i would use my single average series as is though while you are doing this work i suggest you also produce separate proxy type series ice lakes trees for explicit comparison and perhaps separate halfhemisphere us side and eurasian side though not sure if greenland ice should go in either cheers keith directlty keith thanks for the update id like to revise the composite proxy record over the weekend my only spare time can i assume that i need to omit the three treering series that i took from mann et 2008 because they were not processed to retain the low frequency signal and that i should replace the euraisan series with the three from your recent phil trans paper using the data on your website if you agree i can work on revising all of the calculations and figures and we can modify the text early next week would that work darrell on mar 6 2009 at 952 am keith briffa wrote darrell really sorry have not done this yet had back to back meetings for 2 days and am due to leave now for the weekend couple of days away from computer my comments are nothing earth shattering or voluminous but i would still like to make them for your consideration i will try to do this on monday now if too late just ignore sorry again keith thanks for your consideration cheers keith at 1501 03032009 you wrote keith i appreciate your willingness to squeeze this in on such short notice if you could get your comments to by the end of the week that would be more than i had hoped for thank you darrell on mar 3 2009 at 756 am keith briffa wrote darrell i would like to make some comments but the earliest i can get to this is thursday we have visitors here all day tomorrow in short i would like to be involved but i would rather wait and see the basis of your reaction to my initial thoughts when i get tracked changes version back to you you are correct that there are clear limitations in the preservation of trend over two millennia in some of the data mann et used and in the current series you cite for yamal hantemirov et i do believe that the composite series in our phil trans paper is convenient representation of the circumwestern eurasian arctic treeline data though the grudd and nauzbaev papers are virtually similar to our data for their areas however i have few reservationscomments on other aspects of the manuscript that i believe any likely referee might pick up on is it ok to wait til thursday or will this not be acceptable for getting comments back i know how these time lines are crucial best wishes keith at 1415 02032009 you wrote hello keith following the recommendations of malcolm and phil via ray its clear that i should have come to you sooner i am now well along on manuscript that summarizes 2000yearlong proxy temperature records from the arctic attached the impetus for the paper is the new compilation of highresolution lake records that my group recently published in j paleolimnology on the treering side its clear to now that i should not have used the series from the mann et compilation and i hadnt see your 2008 phil trans paper until just last week as far as i can tell the only records that meet the criteria for this study are your three new rcs series from eurasia and darrigos gulf of alaska record apparently none of the malcolms series in mann et were processed in way that would preserve the millennial trend and these should be omitted from the synthesis i now need to substantially revamp the manuscript before i do i want to be sure that i get it right this time and hope that you will be interested in joining as coauthor to help guide the treering component of the synthesis i see that you have posted the phil trans data on your website but would much prefer to have your involvement before using the data unfortunately the timing for submission is an issue i am leading 12pi proposal that is currently pending and would benefit greatly if this paper were accepted for publication please have look at the manuscript which i realize needs substantial revisions and let know if you have time and interest in getting involved thanks darrell darrell s kaufman professor of geology and environmental sciences northern arizona university 9285237192 httpjanuccnauedudsk5 hello keith following the recommendations of
