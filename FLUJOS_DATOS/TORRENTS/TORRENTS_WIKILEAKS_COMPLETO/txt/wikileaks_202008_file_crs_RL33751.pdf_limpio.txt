congress took action in the fy2007 nationa l defense authorization act pl 109364 to move the specialty metal pr ovision from the berry amendment title 10 united states code usc 2533a into separate section of title 10 10 usc 2533b section 843 of pl 109364 directed th secretary of defense to establish strategic materials protection board to determine analyze and recommend strategies to ensure the domestic availability of materials designated as critical to national security the board met in ju ly 2007 and issued report in september 2007 in july 2008 the department of defens dod proposed to amend the defense federal acquisition regulation supplemen t dfars to implement section 842 of the fy2007 national defense authorization act and sections 804 and 884 of the fy2008 national defense authorization act pl 110181 the fy2008 national defense authorization act pl 110181 contained seve ral provisions which may impact the procurement of specialty meta l section 803 required the strategic materials protection board to perform an assessment of the viability of domestic producers of strategic mate rials section 804 changed the requirement that dod procure all specialty metal from domestic sources this provision does not apply to contracts or subcontracts for the acquisiti on of commercially available offtheshelf items with certain exceptions as defined in the office of federal procurement policy act section 35c and section 884 requires dod to publish notice on the federal business opportun ities website before maki ng any nonavailability determinations that would apply to multiple contracts the specialty metal provision raises veral questions among them 1 to what extent do united states us nati onal security interests and industrial base concerns justify waiver of the specialty metal provision and 2 if the united states does not produce 100 domestic specialty metal should dod restrict procurement from foreign sources debate over the sp ecialty metal provision invites renewed debate over the efficacy of domestic source re strictions and whether the rationale for every restriction represents ba lanced and reasonable approach some policymakers believe that the specialty metal provision conflicts with free trade policies and that the presence and degree of such competition is the most effective tool for promoting efficiencies and improving quality others believe that domestic specialty metal suppliers need the protections afforded by domestic source provisions and that keeping robust domes tic specialty metal industry is hedge against

10 2006 revised at httpguidebookdcmamil225instructionshtmthe specialty metal provision in the berry amendment issues for congress introduction this report examines the specialty metal provision which was originally part of the berry amendment1 the potential oversight issues for congress and options that congress may wish to consider the debate over the specialty metal provision may also renew interest in the debate over the viability of other domestic source restrictions there is congressional interest in the specialty metal provision because 1 the specialty metal restriction affects major defense contractors who produce components for commercial airplanes 2 some prime defens contractors as well as subcontractors on the second third and fourth tiers have stated that they were unable to comply with the berry amendment specialty metal require ment 3 dod has authorized the use of waivers to purchase noncompliant items non compliant specialty metal are metal that do not meet the 100 domestic source require ment of the berry amendment and 4 the longterm impact of the specialty metal provision on the costs of defense equipment and programs particularly on the require ment that weapon system components be certified as made in the united states as early as march 2006 dod had learned th at some items containing foreign specialty metal were being delivered under some dod contracts as result the defense contract management agency issued interim instructions which detailed policy and process for how dod would provide contractors conditional acceptance for such metals2 revisions to existing specialty metal rules in july 2008 dod proposed to amend the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars to impleme nt three provisions secti on 842b of the fy2007

national defense authoriz ation act and revisions to existing specialty metal rules pl 110181 the fy2008 national defense authorization act contained two new provisions which impact the specialty metal provision sec tion 803 required the strategic materials protection board to perform an assessment of the viability of domestic producers of strategi c materials the purpose of which is to assess which domestic producers are investing or plan to invest on sustained basis in the development of continue d domestic production capability of strategic materials to meet national defense requirements such an assessment would be evaluated and weighted in any decision to grant future waivers to the specialty metal provision another provision section 804 amended th specialty metal provision to make flexible the requirement that all specialty metal come from domestic sources with several exceptions noted this provision does not apply to contracts or subcontracts for the acquisition of commerc ially available offtheshelf items as defined in the office of federal procurem ent policy act section 35 c within 180 days dod is required to review and amend existin g rules for the domestic nonavailability determinations that apply to the existing specialty metal provision the longterm impact of these new changes may not become evident until the strategic materials protection board completes its assessmen t and dod has determined how decisions will be made regarding the use of such waivers finally section 884 required dod to pub lish such notices on the federal business opport unities website strategic materials protection board section 843 of fy2007 national defense authorization act required the crea tion of strategic materials protection board to determine which items should be designated as critical to national security and to recommend changes for future domes tic source restrictions the board held its first meeting on july 17 2007 the board made the following decisions as described below that the term materials critical to national security would be taken to mean strategic materials critical to national security or simply strategic materials and would include those specialty metals listed in 10 usc 2533b and any other materials that the board chose to so designate that the board should initially focu s its efforts on determining the need to take action to ensure long term domestic supply of specialty metals as designated in 10 usc 2533b to adopt certain terms of reference appendix to shape its deliberations

at the next smpb meeting4 fy2007 national defense authorization act and the enactment of new specialty metal provision congress enacted provisions in the fy2007 national defense authorization act that changed the statutory authority fo r the special metal provision pl109364 created new specialty metal provision parate from the berry amendment moving it into separate section of title 105 also section 842b established onetime waiver of the berry amendment for noncomp liant specialty meta l incorporated into items produced manufactured or assembled in the united states before the date of the acts enactment dod can grant waiv ers provided the noncompliance was not knowing or willful6 rationale for the proposed house and senate vers ions of the specialty metal provision the houseversion of the proposed fy2007 national defense authorization bill hrept 109 452 contained provision that would move the statutory requirements for the procurement of specialty metal from the berry amendment to separate s ection of title 10 hrept 109452 offered new language to clarify that the berry amendment applied to prime contracts as well as subcontracts hrept 109452 stated that allowing foreign contractors to purchase specialty metal from any source not onl would defeat the intent of the berry amendment but also create grave risk to national security the report noted that the committee was aware that certain suppliers claimed that they were inadvertently noncompliant with the specialty metal requirement the house provision would have allowed 12month peri od for suppliers to become compliant with the specialty metal requirement it was the intent of the house that all current exceptions and waivers to the berry amendment would remain the senateversion of the bill sre pt 109254 proposed an amendment to codify the specialty metal re quirement in newlycreated section of title 10 facing the dilemma of how to supply equipment n eeded to fight the war the senate drew upon the original intent and purpose of the specialty metal provi sion as interpreted in memorandum by thensecretary of defense melvin laird this memorandum gave dod the authority to exercise some administrative flexibility in acquiring critical equipment and components for milita ry systems the laird memorandum is key to understanding how and why the pr ovision came to be as discussed in the original memorandum herehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33751crs4 7 memorandum for secretaries of the military departments and directors of the defense agencies by melvin laird cretary of defense november 30

maintains the acquisition rules which go vern dod see httpwww acqosdmildpapdarsindexhtm 10 dfars 2522257014preference for domestic specialty metals the qualifying continuedthe bulk of these specialty metals which are used in one form or another in myriad items purchased by the department of defense are actually procured at the subcontract level often many subcontract tiers removed from the prime contract so as to make impracticable any precise evaluation of all such purchases even at enormous expense in both money and time it is apparent from the legislative history of this prov ision that it was not intended that this department achieve or attempt to achieve the impossible in its implementation rather it is clear that its purpose is to afford reasonable protection to the specialty metals industry to help preserve our domestic production capacity to satisfy mobilization requirements wit hout forcing massive disruption of our existing procurement methods and programs an accommodation is therefore needed to give maximum effect to this new requirement without losing sight of other congressional objectives that the department of defense function in an efficient and economical manner in meeting its mission7 srept 109254 acknowledged that specia lty metal suppliers were required by dod to certify that their products or co mponents were compliant with the berry amendment background on specialty metal provision in order to protect the us industrial base during periods of adversity and war congress passed set of domestic source restrictions which became known as the berry amendment specialty metal repres ented one of fourteen different provisions that were covered under the berry amendment8 specialty metal defined specialty metals are defined in the defense federal acquisition regular supplement dfars they include steel metal alloys titanium and titanium alloys and zirconium and zirconium base alloys9 under the berry amendment specialty metal shall be melted in the united states or its outlying areas and any specia lty metal incorporated in items shall be melted in the united states or its outlying areas this rule does not apply to specialty metal which are either

or specialty metals not grown reprocessed reused or produced in the united states or its possessionsapplication specialty metal is used in dod contracts primarily for military aircraft weapons and equipment and w ithin integrated circuits wiring and electrical components the berry amendment did not appl to purchases of specialty metal by subcontractors at any tier ex cept if used in producing items for six applications aircraft missile and sp ace systems ships tanks weapons and ammunition these six applications were identified in the laird memorandum when enacted as part of the berry amendment dod estimated that the great bulk of the specialty metal procured fell within these six major classes of programs dod concluded that any attempt to identify and control the use of such metal for the remaining small quantities i nvolved in other procurement would not be cost effective nor justify the effort origin of the specialty metal pr ovision in the berry amendment the specialty metal provision first app eared in the 1973 defense appropriations act11 congress was concerned with protec ting domestic source materials for the vietnam war at that time the domestic specialty metal sector was hurt by subsidized imports into the united states in order to insure an adequate domestic base for domestic items cong ress provided guarantee to domestic suppliers for portion of dods specia lty metal business the test of reasonableness from the inception of the specialty metal provision both congress and dod emphasized th at test of reasonableness would be applied that the specialty metal provision should not pose an administrative burden upon dod contractors nor the federal government dods actions i n m r c h 7th hearing before the air and land forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee lieutenant general donald j hoffman air force military deputy asked that congress give its support to relieving the air force from the more arduous aspects of the specialty metal waiver process as discussed below i would ask for the committees continued he lp in one area and that is the area of specialty metals in last years authorization act congress provided some relief in the area of electronic compone nts where the source of minute amounts of specialty metals cannot be tr aced throug hout the commercial production supply chain this relief is certainly helpfu l but i would ask that there be further consideration for relief in the area of commercial products tracing the source of metals and commercial products is very problematic for industry particularly where dod is very small part of their market the cost of creating separate supply chain that is able to trace specia lty metals down to the lowest tier suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33751crs6 12 statement of lieutenant general donald j hoffman military deputy office of the assistant secretary of the air force for ac quisition before the subcommittee of air and land forces house armed services committee march 7 2007 13 excerpt from senator jacob javits remarks on the passage of hr 16593 making appropriations for the defense establishment for fiscal year 1973 118 congressional record s17967 october 13 1972 14 10 usc 2533a requirement to buy certain articles from american sources exceptionsas fasteners is something industry has been unwilling to accept if it is to remain commercially competitive while the congress has authorized waiver process the justification and support of the waivers can be very labor intensive as an example the waiver process last year for the amram advanced medium range airtoair missile the government contractor spent over 2200 man hours to review 4000 parts and produced documentation to justify the waiver this documentation was eight inches tall in printed form all this work was to justify waiver for 14000 on an item that is valued at 56600012 original congressional intent beginning with the 1973 defense appropriations act the objective of congre ss was to use thoughtful and reasonable approach in adding specia lty metal to the list of items covered under the berry amendment in the initial debate over the specialty tal provision senator jacob javits observed that the implementation of the provision would require thought and reasonableness as discussed here as an example i would certainly hope that the department of defense in administering this provision would take in to consideration the fact that it would be virtual impossibility for company par ticipating in defense contract to try to ascertain for itself let alone for th myriad of suppliers of small component metals parts that there was small amount of metals used which would come within the definition of specialty metals i would hope that the department of defense in the administration of this provision while seeking to carry out the broad intent of protecting the special metals industry would have sufficient flexibility and discretion under this provisi on so that they would not be required to go to ridiculous extremes which would result in an almost impossible administrative burden placed upon governme nt contractors and the addition of needless expenses to the government in carrying out its procurement practices13 oversight issues for congress the specialty metal provision of th berry amendment prohibits dod from procuring metal that is not produced in the united states14 such policy alone is difficult to manage when coupled with th secretary of defenses waiver authority and myriad of exceptions written into the law the policy became difficult to execute the very nature of the specialty metal provision itself creates unanticipated consequences for dod and the defense industryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33751crs7 three issues stand out as policy questi ons that congress may choose to consider in its oversight role first how does the specialty metal provision affect competition among the different contractor tiers in the us defense indus trial base second what are the factors that contribute to the success or failure of the administration and enforcement of the specialty metal pr ovision third how does one weigh the reliability of having domestic supplier base in times of urgent and compelling need coupled with the desire to promote global trade competition effect on the defense industrial base competition for defense work is affected by the availability of sufficient quantity and quality of specialty metal such metal may be critical and vital to the warfighting effort if they are used for high tech electronics and communications like personal digital assistants creating separate electronic chips for military use only with foreign content would be an expensive undertaking and some companies have elected not to do so even if it means not being able to sell to dod competition affects suppliers differently some members of the defense industry often describe the speci alty metal issue as debate between companies that advocate for global trade ve rsus those that advocate for dedicated domestic industrial supplier base on the one hand so view major aerospace companies as eager to seek waivers of domestic source restrictions because doing so would increase their access to foreign mark ets for specialty metal some industry leaders have maintained view that domestic source restrictions like the berry amendment are inconsistent with polic to encourage global competition yet some believe that the presence of compe tition particularly from the foreign markets makes it more difficult for domestic suppliers to survive each supplier in the defense industrial base views co mpetition differently for example major defense contractors contend that global competition for commercial and defense work requires establishing and veloping foreign trading partners and that the capacity of domestic suppliers to meet the needs of major defense contractors is insufficient some contractors especially those whose primary market is the us defense industry know th eir client base what they have to buy and thus are locked into one dedicated supply chain yet many other contractors particularly at the third nd fourth tiers of the supply chain market to both military and commercial sectors they find that ca rrying separate supply chains is cost prohibitive and poses significant administrative burden some companies may not know who the ultimately purchaser of their product will be so th ey cannot be certain whether the end use is for commercia l or military application for military customer each item or parts of an item mu st be traced to 100 domestic content doing business with dod could mean maintaining separate production lines the specialty metal provision as contained in the berry amendment required 100 compliance there was provision for noncompliant metal as an example when dod purchas ed avionics electroni cs components and subassemblies items with specialty metal were required to be 100 domestic however the integration of the global supply chain meant that cheaper foreign medal could make up vi rtually all products and that th ere were fewer companies thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33751crs8 15 dfars 2258721 could certify that all of the metal used in the production of their items were wholly domestic in origin suppliers who want ed to sell to dod and to the commercial sector could be forced to maintain two separate production lines this would raise dods costs competition between foreign and do mestic firms is affected by the berry amendment because the united states is not qualifying country under the berry amendment the berry amendment permits the procurement of products from certain qualifying countries qualifying countries are defined as countries that have morandum of understanding or other international agreement with the united states15 under the berry amendment qualifying countries are allowe d to sell produc ts to dod b ecause dod has determined that it is not in the public inte rest to restrict the procurement of products from qualifying countries this decision aff ects us companies in this way the united states is not listed as qualifying country under the berry amendment for this reason the berry amendment would ppear to prohibit any us company from selling items to dod unless the company can certify that any items composed of any noncompliant specialty metal are fro m qualifying countries only this posed hardship for some domestic companies that could not meet this requirement the berry amendment also allowed for the procurement of specialty metal melted in qualifying country or incorpor ated in an article manufactured in qualifying country if an item was made overseas in qualif ying country and incorporated specialty metal not melted in america or in qualifying country then dod may purchase that foreignmade item the effect of this rule meant that qualifying countries could use metal from any source even nonqualifying country and sell products to dod administration enforcement administration can dod administer and properly execute the new specialty metal provision the new specialty metal provision may not be entirely enforceable because it may be nearly impossible to determine to any degree of certainty whether the smallest of the nuts bolts screws and fasteners that make up dod weapons systems and equipment are of 100 domestic content waivers other problems include the use of waivers the use of waivers to accommodate both dod and defense contractor s suggests that the berry amendment may be difficult to enforce in april 2004 the secretary of the air force approved permanent waiver of the requirements of the berry amendment for 23 commercial aircraft systems representing more than 1200 aircraft in the air forces inventory the first waiver was granted in october 2002 when the senate voted to grant boeing waiver of the berry amendment to pur chase russian titanium on more than 100 of its 767 air refueling tankers that were to be leased to the air force at the time dod and the senate affirmed that this wa s an exception that the berry amendment would be consistently enforced in the future yet another waiver was granted in december 2002 allowing united technolog ies corporation to purchase

gao later found that the air force granted waivers without thorough analysis of all available options17 the debate over the specialty metal pr ovision was largely fueled by voluntary disclosures made by companies who ll to dod that the companies were in violation of the berry amendment specialty metal requirement for example the national semiconductor co rporation disclosed that sp ecialty metal used in its products do not meet the requirement to the best of our knowledge other semiconductor manufacturer currently is capab of meeting that standard wrote gerry fields vicepresident texas

deliver components such as fasteners and com ponents from electronic circuit boards find compliance with the berry amendment may be nearly impossible according to the coalition because of berry

if forced to do so they would terminate their business relationship w ith dod and increase their capacity for commercial work enforcement failure to adhere to the specialty metal provision can be costly to dod contractors for example federal law required that parts made for the f15 eagle and the fa18 hornet fighters be composed entirely of domestic titanium boeing was required to use domestically melted titanium in c17 transport plans f 15 fighters and fa18 fighter and attack planes during the 1990s but failed to do so the federal government ma intained that the deliver of nonconforming aircraft violated the false claims act23 boeing was charged with violating the false claims act because it used russianmelted titanium in the manufacture of military aircraft while the case was under investigation th federal government withheld 96 million contract payment from boeing boei ng and the federal government reached 6 million settlement boeing also agr eed to forfeit the remaining 36 million of the contract payment24 reliability in urgent situations and times of war the issue of reliability has been the cornerstone of why domestic source restrictions like the specialty metal provision are viewed by some as essentia l to the viability of the domestic defense industrial base cent ral to the issue of reliability is the basic premise upon which the berry amendment was first adopted the berry amendment which dates from the eve of world war ii was established for narrowly defined purpose to ensure that us troops wore military uniforms wholly produced within the united states and to ensure that us troops were fed with food products solely produced in the united states25 there were at least two congressional concerns 1 that the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33751crs12 25 continued national defense authorization act codified the berry amendment repealing sections 9005 and 8109 of the abovementioned bills the berry amendment is now codified at 10 usc 2533a 26 roundtable on the buy american act and berry amendment moderated by robert dickman executive director of the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics september 2006maintain vibrant domestic industrial ba by requiring that military troops wear uniforms made in the united states nd consume f ood produced in the united states and 2 that the nation be prepared in the event of adversity or war so the dominant congressional belief has maintained that the united states has an obligation to see that domestic i ndustries remain productive many view domestic source restrictions like the specialty metal provision as way to insure that in urgent situations and times of war the united states will have access to critical items needed to ensure national security those who advocate for maintaining robust capability among th domestic sources for titanium as an example argue that these companies will ensure that should global shortage of titanium develop or if the united states loses key trading partner the united states will not become unduly dependent on another country for cr itical item furthermore having domestic suppliers who have the protection of the berry amendment may ensure that domestic pr oduction lines remainin g open and viable maintaining productive and profitable domestic base an argument that is often raised is that as an example the three domestic titanium pr oducers would not be viable if the berry amendmen t did not exist yet look at the three domestic titanium producers as illustrated in table 1 reveals that they are robust companies that have different income str eams and are not wholly dependent on the berry amendment industry estimates are that the domestic titanium producers have about 16 of the defense market worldw ide and about 99 of the dod market one company allegheny technologies recently announced 325million investment in titanium sponge facility th is will help the company to increase its capacity to handle additional work particularly their melt capacity with the result of increasing their worldwide market share26 domestic restrictions prot ect the us industrial base there is third reason often expressed that products consumed by americans should be made at home and that the berry amendment represents jobs for the smaller domestic companies in america however when compared to the jobs generated by the major defense contractors in the global suppl chain the number of local jobs is proportionately smallerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33751crs13 27 the source for this

specialty metal provision in the berry amendment had been in place since 1972 any change in the law will likely have both upstream and downstream effects how will the change affect prime contractors and subcontractors on the second third nd fourth tiers as well as us domestic suppliers it may take some time for dod to implement the change in policy six possible options for policymakers to consider are listed below 1 eliminate the specialty metal provision or eliminate the berry amendment 2 combine the berry amendment and the buy american act into one statute 3 enforce new specialty metal provision 4 limit the inclusion of noncompliant specialty metal 5 require more c ongressional oversight and 6 convene blueribbon panel specialty metal commission httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33751crs14 28 see crs report 97765 the buy american act requiri ng government procurements to come from domestic sources by john r luckeyeliminate the specialty metal provision congress could eliminate the specialty metal provision congress could also eliminate the berry amendment some question whether the berry amendment is still good policy given the global supply chain others ques tion whether each item needs the protection of domestic source policy the effect eliminating the specialty metal provision or the berry amendment would be met with fierce opposition particularly from dom estic suppliers without strong foreign market domestic source restrictions like the berry amendment to some extent do help to insure that there is dedicated domestic source for dod products combine the berry amendment and the buy american act one option is to combine the berry amendment and the buy american act baa into one statute the berry amendment is ofte n confused with the baa often the two legislative initiatives are referred to interchangeably baa is the major domestic preference statute of the federal governme nt and prohibits th federal government from procuring items that are less than 50 domestic in origin28 the baa governs all federal government procurement not just dods procurement since the berry amendment and baa have similar goals one solution would be to create one standard to marry the berry amendm ent and baa into one domestic source standard for example since the be rry amendment requires 100 compliance and the buy american act requires 51 compliance one alternative would be that the combined berry amendmentbaa coul d have 65 compliance requirement legislative initiatives have been introdu ced to change the baa one example the buy american improvement act of 2005 was introduced during the first session of the 109th congress if enacted into law this bill would have raised the buy american acts minimum domestic conten t standard from 51 to 75 an amount much closer to the 100 standard of the berry amendment senator feingold introduced this bill and offered the following comments the bill that i am introducing today the buy american improvement act focuses on the federal governments responsibility to support domestic manufacturers and workers and on the role of federal procurement policy in achieving this goal the reintroduction of this bill which i first introduced in 2003 is part of my ongoing effort to find ways to stem th flow of manufacturing jobs abroad this buy american act of 1933 is an importa nt law but regrettably it contains number of loopholes that make it too easy for government agencies to buy foreignmade goods my bill the buy american improvement act would strengthen the existing act by tightening its waiver provisions secondly my bill would increase the minimum american content standard qualification under the act from the current 50 percent to 75 percent the definition of what qualifies as an americanmade product has been source of much debate to it seems clear that americanmade means manufactured in this country thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33751crs15 29 s 395 the buy american improvement act of 2005 30 this provision prohibits dod or prime contractor from purchasing metal not wholly domestic number of exceptions may be gr anted under the new provision the exceptions are 1 when the available quantity and quality are insufficient 2 for unusual and compelling circumstances 3 for existing reciprocal and ffsetting trade agreements with foreign governments 4 with the requirement s of section 36 of the arms export control act 22 usc 2776 and with 10 usc 2457 5 for commissaries exchanges and other nonappropriated fund instrumentalities 6 fo r purchases under the simplified acquisition threshold 7 for purchases of electronic co mponents where the degree of specialty metal content is minimis in value compared to the overall value of the lowest level electronic component produced that contains such specialty metal 31 the conditions are 1 the metals were incorporated into items produced manufactured or assembled in the united states before th date of enactment of this act and 2 contracting officials determine that the ctor is not in compliance with the specialty metals provision that it would not be prac tical or economical to remove the noncompliant specialty metals and that the contractor has submitted plan to ensure compliance with the specialty metals requirement 3 the noncomplia nce is not knowing or willful and 4 the undersecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics or the military service acquisition executive gives final approvalclassification is source of pride for manufacturing workers around our country the current 50 percent standard should be raised to minimum of 75 percent29 the effect although the bill did not rvive there was some support in the congress for raising the buy american act minimum domestic content standard while combining the two legislative initiatives appears to be simpler solution dod would likely object because with more restrictive require ment procurement costs for the federal governments goods and services would likely increase enforce the new special ty metal provision one new specialty metal provision b ecame effective in the fy2007 national defense authorization act while modifica tions to these provisions were enacted in the fy2008 national defense authorization act the first provision prohibits dod from using funds for end items or com ponents for aircraft missile and space systems ships tank and automotive items weapon systems or ammunition containing specialty metal not melte d or produced in the united states30 this provision grants the secretary of defense the authority to give onetime waiverof the specialty metal domestic source requirement under cer tain conditions31 finally the new specialty metal provision authorizes the creation of strategic materials protection board the board w ould evaluate whether each item under the berry amendment should be covered and termines if and when new items should be added the board should represent both public and private sectors meet periodically and publish its proceedings in the federal register implementation of the modifications to the specialty metal provision found in the fy2008 national defense authorization ac t will take measured and studied approach congress and dod will need to come to terms with what these modifications meanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33751crs16 32 according to the defense acquisition university multiyear procurement myp is method of competitively purchasing up to 5 ye ars requirements in one contract funded annually as appropriations permit congress t up specific rules that must be met before program gains myp statusamend the defense federal ac quisition regulation supplement part 2258721 congress could recommend that dod amend the list of qualifying countries by adding the united states as qualified country in this way domestic companies would have an opportunity to compete on an equal basis in the global supply chain for specialty metal and not have to pa more for materials nor undergo rigorous accountin g of its sources for metal limit the use of nonco mpliant specialty metal congress could limit the use of noncomplia nt specialty metal one approach is the application of marketbased st andard so that dod can tie the amount of noncompliant specialty meta l permitted to the percenta ge of business that the contractor has with dod so if cont ractor acquires 16 of the dod market it will be permitted to use compliant specialty metal for at least 16 of its total market needs require more congressional oversight congress could require congressi onal approval before non compliant specialty metal can be used in certain defense contracts as an example set forth in 10 usc 2306 b congress enacted six legal criteria that must be met for the multiyear procurement program myp to be operational32 such set of conditions could deter mine under what circumstances noncompliant specialty metal could be used in defense contracts and might include the following criteria that the use of noncompliant specialty metal will result in substantial savings of the total an ticipated costs throughout the life of the contract that the percentage of specialty metal used for the weapons program is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contract period in terms of rate of produc tion and procurement and total quantities that the contract for the use of noncompliant speci alty metal will be subject to recompetition on fiveyear basis to give the domestic specialty metal industry an opportunity to develop the capacity and capability to meet future program requirements that the estimates of both the cost of the contract and the anticipated cost avoidance are realistic nd supportable through independent audits and investigationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33751crs17 33 request for proposal is formal process for companies to submit bids for contractsthat there is reasona ble expectation that throughout the life of the contemplated contract period the head of the military service will request funding for the contract at the level required to avoid contract cancellation and that the use of such noncomp liant specialty metal in this particular weapons system is critical to the national security of the united states the effect congress has used six crite ria to evaluate each weapon programs appropriateness for mvp status and has reached conclusions as to when weapons program does not meet all of the require ments for mvp the process has been perceived for the most part as fair and balanced require more transparency and openness in the use of specialty metal for all defense contracts regarding costs and performance congress could require that all request for proposals33 for defense contracts include the specialty metal provision where appli cable and publish the rules governing the use of noncompliant specia lty metal on the federal bu siness opportun ities website once the contracts are awarded congress c ould require that any modifications or changes to the program that impact on the six designated criteria must be reported to congress within thirty days rather than wait until the next cycle of congressionally directed hearings require dod to publicly disclose when waivers are granted congress could require publication of the number and types of waivers granted to purchase items that are noncompliant and tight the waiver process so that waivers are not granted for inappropr iate or arbitrary reasons the effect requiring more transpar ency and openness may pose more of an administrative burden on dod however mo re transparency engenders more public confidence in the process require congr essional report for each platformcomponent where foreign specialty metals are used in defense contracts one approach that congress may consider is to require dod to produce separate report for each platform or compone nt of weapons program wh ere foreign specialty metal are used for example in the future combat system where there are about 2024 separate platforms each pl atform would be supported by separate report which calculates the sources types and percentages of specialty metal content both foreign and domestic the effect examining the specialty metal content by platform will get at data that is often buried in the aggregate numbe rs of larger reports on the entire weapons program the level and specificity of detail could pose an ad ministrative burden on dod and defense contractorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33751crs18 grant timelimited period of acceptance under the specialty metal provision to give dod and c ongress time to study the upturns and downturns in the market timelimited period of acceptance would mean periodic review of the specialty metal pr ovision and its effect on the industrial base on each protected item it may be that all domestic source items need the protection of the berry amendment or other domestic source restrictions but not all of the time nor at the same time such granting of protection could be based on market forces and more tied to forecasts of upturns or downswings in the market this would also give congress an opportunity to study the effect of the berry amendment and the specialty metal provi sion on socioeconomic subsidy programs for small and minorityowned businesses the effect it is difficult to predict the effect because the berry amendment has never been tied to market forces or to the state of the economy grant prime contractors the aut hority to conditionally accept non compliant end items without fe ar of substantial penalties congress could shift the authority nd responsibility to the prime contractor rather than to dod to provide type of conditional accep tance of certain ite ms congress could also give the prime contractor the author ity under prescribed set of circumstances to waive the responsibility of the downstream contractor on the 2nd 3rd or 4th tiers of the supply chain meaning that these cont ractors would not have to account for the accounting of the percentages of noncomplia nt specialty metal used in end items encourage the use of domestic specialty metal congress could develop steps to further support strong er domestic specialty metal industry one way is by encouraging the development technological capabilities and advances by providing tax incentives for investment in scientific and ma nufacturing technology congress could create socioeconomic subsidy program to support the domestic specialty metal suppliers one approach would be to create partnership between dod and domestic suppliers such an appro ach was described as way to develop greater capacity to meet the delivery requirements for aviation parts in the military as noted in the fy2007 national defense appropriations act pl 109289 where the increased demand for domestic steel suppliers was highlighted the department of defenses demand for ironbased alloy aviation specialty steels has dramatically increased as result of continuing deployments to the overseas theaters of operation today there is only one domestic supplier for unique process which utilizes vacuum inducted meltvacuum arc remelt the process which gives aviation grade steels their required properties these specialty steels are critical to buildin g high technology us military weapon systems further there has been related and dramatic increase in the raw material needed to make these specialty st eels lead times for these raw materials have grown from 3 months to 1 year according to the army the overall effect on lead times for spare part deliverables s swelled in some cases to greater than 24 months as such the conferees courage the department of defense to partner with domestic industry to develop greater capacity to meet the delivery requirements for aviation parts to the m ilitary within an acceptable time frame the conferees suggest that
