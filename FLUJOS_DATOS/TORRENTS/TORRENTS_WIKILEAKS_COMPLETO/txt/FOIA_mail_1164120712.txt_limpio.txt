from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to malcolm hughes subject fwd re mitrie bristlecones in confidence date tue nov 21 095152 2006 malcolm sorry i should have ccd this message sent to my coauthors some time agoit predates the message to you but i was sort of hoping this issue would recede it would be useful to chat about this and other stuff if you are able to phone afternoon my time preferably cheers keith date thu 16 nov 2006 115709 0000 to martin juckes mnjuckesrlacuk myles allen allenatmoxacuk from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re mitrie bristlecones cc andersmisususe eduardozoritagkssde hegerldukeedu esperwslch weberknminl tosbornueaacuk martin and all i know franco very well but he has not worked extensively with the bristlecones i still believe that it would be wise to involve malcolm hughes in this discussion though i recognise the point of view that says we might like to appear and be independent of the original mann bradley and hughes team to avoid the appearance of collusion in my opinion as someone how has worked with the bristlecone data hardly at all there are undoubtedly problems in their use that go beyond the strip bark problem that i will come back to later the main one is an ambiguity in the nature and consistency of their sensitivity to temperature variations it was widely believed some 23 decades ago that highelevation trees were predominantly responding to temperature and low elevation ones to available water supply not always related in simple way to measured precipitation however response functions ie sets of regression coefficients on monthly mean temperature and precipitation data derived using principal components regression applied to the treering data have always shown quite weak and temporally unstable associations between chronology and climate variations for the highelevations trees at least the trouble is that these results are dominated by interannual ie highfrequency variations and apparent instability in the relationships is exacerbated by the shortness of the instrumental records that restrict analyses to short periods and the large separation of the climate station records from the sites of the trees limited comparisons between treering density data which seem to display less ambiguos responses imply that there is reasonable decadal time scale association and so indicate real temperature signal on this time scale the bottom line though is that these trees likely represent mixed temperature and moisturesupply response that might vary on longer timescales the discussion is further complicated by the fact that the first pc of western us trees used in the mann et analyses is derived from mixture of species not just bristlecones and they are quite varied in their characteristics time span and effective variance spectra many show low interannual variance and longterm declining trend up until about 1850 when the bristlecones and others show the remarkable increasing trend up until the end of the record the earlier negative trend could be partly or more significantly consequence of the lack of detrending to allow for age effects in the measurements ie standardisation the very early sections of relative high growth were removed in their analysis but explicit standardistion of the data was made to account for remaining slow width changes resulting from tree aging this is also related to the strip bark problem as these types of trees will have unpredictable trends as consequence of aging and depending on the precise nature of each trees structure another serious issue to be considered relates to the fact that the pc1 time series in the mann et analysis was adjusted to reduce the positive slope in the last 150 years on the assumption following an earlier paper by lamarche et that this incressing growth was evidence of carbon dioxide fertilization by differencing the data from another record produced by other workers in northern alaska and canada which incidentally was standardised in totally different way this last adjustment obviously will have large influence on the quantification of the link between these western us trees and nhemisphere temperatures at this point it is fair to say that this adjustment was arbitrary and the link between bristlecone pine growth and co2 is at the very least arguable note that at least one author lisa gaumlich has stated that the recent growth of these trees could be temperature driven and not evidence of co2 fertilisation the point of this message is to show that that this issue is complex and i still believe the western us series and its interpretation in terms of hemispheric mean temperature is perhaps pandoras box that we might open at our peril what does jan say about this he is very acquainted with these issues cheers keith at 1501 15112006 martin juckes wrote hi concerning bristlecones i had sympathetic reply from prof north but he deferred to the person who wrote the relevant paragraph in the nas report franco biondi who is firmly of the view that stripbark bristlecones should not be used ive read few of the articles cited to back up this statement and i am surprised by the extreme weakness of the evidence there is one study of 27 stripbark pines which shows that they clearly developed anomalous growth around 1850 attributing this to co2 is odd to say the least im writing brief review of the literature which ill send round in few days time cheers martin on sunday 12 november 2006 2221 myles allen wrote although it probably doesnt feel like it it

myles allen weberknminl tosbornueaacuk subject mitrie hello well ive had few exchanges on climateaudit and decided to leave them to it for few days im going to send an email to prof north of the nas panel to ask if he really meant dont use bristlecones as he is quoted by mcintyre i believe it would be incorrect to select sites on the basis of what the data from the sites looks like and this makes up substantial part of the argument in graybill and idso 1993 does anyone know where i can get hold of the categorisation of the sheep mountain trees used by graybill and idso ca534rwl from the wdc for paleoclimatology i think into stripbark and fullbark ive sent an email to the wdc query address ive also sent of for publication which is cited by co2science as using sargasso sea data with the dating shifted by 50 years loehle 2004 ecological modelling this appears to be source of considerable confusion among the climate sceptics the shifted series fits nicely with the idea that the medieval warm period was warmer than the 20th century so there is widespread perception that it is being ignored to fudge the results apart from couple of oversights in the documentation of the data files mcintyre hasnt come up with much yet i need to read up bit more on the different tornetraeskfennoscandia series there was an interesting discussion on cherrypicking with contributors suggesting that testing the effect of removing each proxy series in turn was cherrypicking and that selecting series based on subjective analysis of what the series look like would be much better ive had comment from the editor saying that responses to nonrefereee comments are optional especially if the comments are not relevant to the paper cheers martin professor keith briffa climatic research unit
