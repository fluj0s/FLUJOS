assistance to colombia is necessary to help democratic government confront drug supported leftist and rightist illegally armed groups assistance to colombias neighbors according to supporters is merited because of an increasing threat from the spillover of violence and drug production from colombia while some critics agree with this assessment they argue that us assistance overemphasizes

to enter into the uscolombia free trade agreement cfta bilateral free trade agreement between the united states and colombia the two countries signed the agreement on november 22 2006 implementing legislation for uscolombia free trade agreement cfta hr 5724s 2830 was introduced in the 110 th congress on april 8 2008 pursuant to title xxi bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2002 of the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 the house leadership however considered that the pres ident had submitted the implementing legislation without sufficient coordination with congress on april 10 2008 the house approved hres 1092 by vote of 224 to 195 to make certain provisions in 151 of the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 establishing expedited procedures inapplicable to the cfta implementing legislation the cfta is highly controversial and it is currently unclear whether or how congress will consider implementing legislation in the future the most controversial issue is the ongoing violence against trade unionists in colombia some members of congress oppose the cfta because of concerns about the violence against labor union activists and because of the perceived negative effects of trade on the us economy the bush administration and some members of congress believe that colombia has made significant advances to combat violence and instability and views the pending trade agreement as national security issue in that it would strengthen key democratic ally in south america in his response to us congressional concerns president uribe has stated on several occasions that he would make every effort to ensure that these concerns were addressed and that the situation in colombia had improved substantially under his administration some members of congress have stated they would like to see evidence of progress in this area before supporting the agreement cfta would likely have small net economic effect on the united states because of the relatively small size of colombia as trading partner when compared to others partners and regions colombias gross domestic product gdp in 2007 was 173 billion approximately 12 of us gdp 138 trillion in 2007 the united states currently extends dutyfree treatment to selected imports from colombia under the andean trade preference act tpa regional trade preference program that expires on december 31 2008 approximately 90 of us imports from colombia enter the united states dutyfree while us exports to colombia face duties up to 20 economic studies on the impact of uscolombia free trade agreement fta have found that upon full implementation of an agreement the impact on the united states would be positive but very small in the absence of cfta and if the tpa is not renewed many colombian products entering the us market would be subject to higher duties since 1996 the us trade balance with colombia went from surplus to deficit of 14 billion in 2007 the dominant us import from colombia is crude oil followed by coal and coffee while the leading us export items are corn maize automatic data processing machine parts and accessories and vinyl chloride

ratified the fta 58 to 4 on july 11 2007 but there is one highly sensitive issue that remains to be resolved for the united states in september 2007 the panamanian national assembly elected pedro miguel gonzález pinzón to oneyear term as president of the legislative body although deputy in the national assembly since 1999 his elevation to president of the legislature drew the attention of the us congress because he is also known for his alleged role in the june 10 1992 murder of us serviceman in panama panamanian court acquitted him of the charge in 1997 but the united states does not recognize the verdict and maintains an outstanding warrant for his arrest his continued presence as national assembly president has been one factor delaying consideration of the fta by the us congress this situation could change if he is not reelected to second term in the september 1 2008 election the us trade surplus with panama was 34 billion in 2007 major us exports to panama include oil and mostly capital and technologyintensive manufactured goods such as aircraft pharmaceuticals machinery medical equipment and motor vehicles us imports from panama include seafood repaired goods gold

over 10 years ago as regional presumably wtoplus trade agreement that would include 34 nations of the western hemisphere since then three drafts of an incomplete agreement have been released but the original january 2005 date for signing it has long since passed at the center of the delay are deep differences dividing the united states and brazil the cochairs of the trade negotiating committee which is charged with defining the framework under which the ftaa negotiations can continue the united states and brazil agreed at the november 2003 miami nisterial to twotier approach that would include set of common rights and obligations to which all countries would agree augmented by optional plurilateral arrangements for countries wishing to make deeper reciprocal commitments to date the united states and brazil have been unable to define how this twotier concept would work and the united states has declined brazils offer to move ahead with the 41 market access talks with the mercosur southern common market countries brazil argentina uruguay paraguay and as of july 1 2006 venezuela the breadth of an emerging resistance to the ftaa became clearer at the fourth summit of the americas held on november 45 2005 in mar plata argentina amid dramatic and sometimes violent protests against president george w bush and the ftaa which was not scheduled as the major topic of this summit it became clear that latin american and caribbean countries were divided over how to proceed total of 29 countries supported restarting negotiations and the united states pushed to set specific date in 2006 the mercosur countries rejected this idea arguing that the conditions for balanced and equitable ftaa did not yet exist venezuela lobbied independently to end any further effort on the ftaa and called for unified resistance against us policies and presence in latin america on july 4 2006 venezuela agreed to join mercosur as its first new full member since its inception in 1991 although brazil and paraguay have yet to ratify the agreement although mercosur has collectively resisted the ftaa venezuela is the only country in latin america to reject the idea unequivocally with venezuelas newfound influence on mercosur the united states may find it even more difficult to isolate its unabashedly negative attitude on the ftaa negotiations the summit declaration called for time to reflect on the problems of the ftaa process while awaiting the outcome of the wto doha round part icularly with respect to agricultural issues given that the wto talks have also bogged down it

migration and border security in which mexico acknowledges that its workers will continue to emigrate until there are more opportunities in mexico the resolution also accepts the need to revisit its

trafficking perhaps most relevant the mexican resolution states that the mexican government does not promote illegal migration and calls for the development of guest worker program in the united states under the principle of shared responsibility the resolution commits mexico to enforcing legal emigration if guest country offers sufficient number of appropriate visas to cover the biggest

2007 which improves upon existing legal framework to prevent and sanction trafficking in persons as well as protect victims 6 mexico benefits from illegal migration in at least two ways 1 it is safety

american gangs governments throughout the region are struggling to find the right combination of suppressive and preventive policies to deal with the gangs some analysts assert that increasing us

accelerate illegal immigration and trafficking in drugs persons and weapons to the united states although may 2007 united nations report challenges those assertions others maintain that contact
