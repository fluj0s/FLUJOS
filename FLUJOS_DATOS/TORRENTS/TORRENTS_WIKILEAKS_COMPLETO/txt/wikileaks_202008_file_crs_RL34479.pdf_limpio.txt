quality standard for lead summary the administrator of the environmen tal protection agency epa under court order to review the national ambien t air quality standard naaqs for lead announced his decision october 16 2008 re ducing the standard by 90 from 15 micrograms per cubic meter µgm3 to 015 µgm3 naaqs are standards for outdoor ambient air that are intended to protect public health and welfare from harmful concentrations of pollution in strengthening the lead standard the administrator has c oncluded that protecting public health and welfare requires much lower concentrations of lead pollution in ambient air than the level previously held to be safe lead particles can be inhaled or ingested and once in the body can cause lower iq and eff ects on learning memory and behavior in children in adults lead exposure is linked to increased blood pressure cardiovascular disease nd decreased kidney function regulation of airborne lead is often described as one of the key successes of the clean air act and of the environmental pr otection agency in 1970 when lead was widely used as gasoline additive missions of lead nationwide totaled 224100 tons lead was also present then in ma ny consumer products and thus was emitted to the air from industrial pro cesses and waste incinerators the phasing out of lead from gasoline paint and other products as well as stricter controls on industrial emissions reduced lead emissions 99 to 1300 tons in 2007 the reduction in lead emissions and ambi ent concentrations led some to suggest that there was longer need for an ambient air quality standard for lead others including the clean air scientific advisory committee casac an independent panel of scientists who advise the ep administrator concluded that the old naaqs established in 1978 was far too lenien t that lead in ambient air still poses threat to public health and that the naaqs needed to be significantly strengthened casac reco mmended that the standard be reduced from 15 µgm3 to higher than 02 µgm3 in promulgating more stringent naaqs the administrator agreed with the scientis ts recommendation rejecting the argument that the standard is longer needed the administrators decision followed multiyear review of the science to implement the new standar d epa and the states will first identify nonattainment areas expected to occur later than january 2012 following which there will be 510 yearlong implementati on process in which states and local governments will identify and implement measures to reduce lead in the air epa has also proposed expanding the monitoring network for lead at present at least 24 of the 50 states including some with major sources of lead emissions have lead monitors at all under the new regulations all 101 metropolitan areas with populations greater than 500000 will be required to have monitors as will the estimated 135 areas that have sources of lead emissions greater than or equal to one ton per year whether epa will provide funds to the states to establis h the new monitoring network is an issue that congress may be asked to addresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34479contents introduction 1 the role of naaqs in

greenbklindexhtmlrevising the national ambient air quality standard for lead introduction on october 16 2008 epa administrator stephen johnson announced his final approval of more string ent national ambient air quality standard naaqs for lead the publication of th revised standard in the federal register expected within few weeks is the final step in multiyear review process range for the standard was proposed in the federal register may 20 2008 beginning public comment period that ran through august 4 public hearings took place on june 12 in st louis and baltimore1 when the previous standard for lead was promulgated in 1978 lead was widespread air pollutant eighty to ninety percent of it was emitted by the nations automobiles and trucks majority of which ran on leaded gasoline leaded gasoline was gradually phased out in the 1970s 1980s and early 1990s and both emissions and concentrations of lead in the air plummeted emissions fell more than 98 from 1980 to 2007 ambient concentrations the qua ntity of lead in the air fell by 942 as of march 12 2008 only two areas with combined population of 4664 people had air that remained in vi olation of the 1978 lead naaqs3 these developments have led some to sugge st that there is longer need for an ambient air quality standard for lead others including the independent scientific advisory panel that advises epas ad ministrator concluded that the 1978 naaqs was far too lenient that lead in ambient air still poses threat to public health and that the naaqs needed to be significantly strengthened as the result of the current review in promulgating new standard th administrator agreed with his scientific advisers lowering the standard to 90 below the 1978 standard httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34479crs2 4 authority to establish naaqs comes from both sections 108 and 109 of the act 42 usc 7408 and 7409 this definition of crite ria pollutants is found in section 108 the authority and procedures for controlling the sources of criteria pollutants are f ound throughout titles i ii and iv of the act pollutants that are less widely emitted are generally classified as hazardous air pollutant s and are regulated under different section of the act section 112 5 the clean air acts definition of welfare is found in section 302h of the act 42 usc 7602hthis report provides background on naaqs the process used to establish them the factors leading to the reduction in lead emissions the proposed and final changes to the lead standard as well as information regarding the potential effects of the revision the role of naaqs in improving air quality what are naaqs naaqs are standards that apply to ambient outdoor air pollutants that exhibit two characteristics 1 they may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare and 2 their presence in the air results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources4 the clean air act provides for two types of naaqs primary standards the attainment and ma intenance of which in the judgment of the epa administrat or are requisite to protect the public health with an adequate ma rgin of safety and seconda ry standards necessary to protect public welfare broad term th at includes damage to crops vegetation property building materials etc5 naaqs are at the core of the clean air act even though they do not directly regulate emissions in essence they are standards that define what epa considers to be clean air implementing naaqs once naaqs has been set epa uses monitoring data and other information submitted by the states to identify areas that exceed the standard and must therefore reduce pollutant concentrations to achieve it after these nonattainment areas are identified which epa estimates will occur by january 2012 at the latest for the new l ead standard state and local governments must produce state implementation plans outlining the measures they will implement to reduce pollution levels and attain the standards lead nonattainment areas will have five years after their signation to actually attain the standard with possible extension of five more years as will be noted in more detail later most areas of the country do not monitor lead concentrations in ambient air thus in addition to strengthening the lead standard the administrator expanded the requirements for lead monitoring installing the additional monitors and compiling up to three years of data to determine compliance is the main reason that implementing the new standard is likely to be lengthy processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34479crs3 6 43 federal register 46246 october 5 1978 7 as mentioned earlier the schedule was set by the consent decree in missouri coalition for the environment v us epa 2005 westlaw 2234579 ed mo september 14 2005 8 for discussion of the process and of changes to the process that epa is now implementing see crs report rl33807 air quality standards and sound science what role for casac by james mccarthy 9 epa indicates that more th an 6000 new studies on lead health effects environmental effects and lead in the air have been published since 1990other pollution control measures in addition to requiring states to submit implementation plans epa also acts to control many of the naaqs pollutants wherever they are emitted thr ough national standards for products that might emit them particularly fuels and through emission standards for new stationary sources eg lead smelters the naaqs review process schedule for review the clean air act requires the agency to review each naaqs every five years that schedule is rarely met but it of ten triggers lawsuits that force the agency to undert ake review in the case of l ead the last review of the naaqs was completed in 19786 the missouri coalition for the environment and others filed suit against epa over its failure to complete review in 2004 and consent decree established the schedule ep followed in reviewing the standard7 the schedule required epa to propose any revision of the standard by may 1 2008 and to promulgate final decision by october 15 2008 how the process works reviewing an existing naaqs is long process8 as first step epa scientists review the scientific litera ture published since the last naaqs revision and summarize it in re port known as criteria document or integrated science assessment gene rally there are hundreds or thousands of scientific documents revi ewed covering such subjects as environmental concentrations human exposure toxico logy animal studies and animaltohuman extrapolation epidemiology effects on ve getation and ecosystems and effects on manmade materials9 second document that epa prepares the staff paper or policy assessment summarizes the information compiled in the criteria document and provides the administrator with opti ons regarding the indicators averaging times statistical form and numerical level concentration of the naaqs to ensure that these reviews meet the highest scientific standards the 1977 amendments to the clean air act requi red the administrator to appoint an independent clean air scientific advisory committee casac casac has seven members largely from academia and from private research institutions in conducting naaqs reviews their expertise is supplemented by panels of the nations leading experts on the health nd environmental effects of the specific pollutant or pollutants under review these panels can be quite large the current lead review panel has 15 members in addition to

generally referred to as criteria pollutants six pollutants are currently identified as criteria pollutants ozone pa rticulates carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and lead the epa administrator can add to this list if he determines that additional pollutants meet the acts criteria endangerment of public health or welfare and numerous or dive rse sources he can delete them if he concludes that they longer do so whether lead still met these criteria was one of the issues epa considered in its review of the standard lead emission reduction success but not generally due to naaqs the reduction of lead emissions is ofte n described as one of the key successes of the clean air act and of the environmental protection agency in 1970 emissions of lead totaled 224100 tons by 2007 emissions had been reduced 99 to 1300 tons10 little of that success is attributable to the setting of naaqs however the agency did not set naaqs for lead til 1978 by which time lead emissions had already declined about 40 and it blished the naaqs then only as result of lawsuit filed by the natural re sources defense council and others11 f t r promulgating the naaqs the agency did not identify nonattainment areas until 1991 the great bulk of the lead reducti ons occurred prior to 1990 according to epa12 so in general the reduction of lead in ambient air did not come about as result of the 1978 naaqs or in the manner pr escribed by title i of the clean air act wherein nonattainment areas are identifie d and the states or areas in which they are located submit to epa state implementation plans that identify local and national measures that will be implemented to help such areas reach attainment most of the reduction was sideben efit of other clean air act programs especially the regulation of emissions fro m new automobiles beginning in the 1970s in order to meet more stringent requireme nts for emissions of hydrocarbons nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide which took eff ect

standa rd states that the median concentration of lead in childrens blood dropped 89 from 15 micrograms per deciliter µgdl in the late 1970s to 16 µgdl in 20032004 see october 2008 naaqs general

widespread adoption epa manda ted the sale of unleaded fuel in the early 1970s and eventually banned the use of lead in gasoline entirely being metal lead remains in the environment even though emissions have declined thus although human exposure to lead has declined it has not done so by as much as the decrease in emissions would suggest13 furthermore research conducted since the 1970s suggests that lead has significant health impacts at levels well below those previous ly considered safe current sources of emissions include utility and other boilers leaded fuel still used in some general aviation airplanes tr ace lead contaminants in diesel fuel and gasoline lubricating oil iron and steel foundries primary and secondary lead smelters hazardous waste in cinerators and about 30 sma ller categories of sources14 in addition there continues to be exposur from lead particles in soil or dust re suspended in the atmosphere as result of vehicular tra ffic construction agricultural operations and the wind15 epas new lead naaqs epa has decided to deal with the remaining issue of lead in ambient air by both strengthening the lead naaqs and by expandi ng the network of monitors that are used to measure attainment the primary standard the primary healthbas ed standard promulgated in 1978 has been 15 micrograms per cubic meter µgm3 averaged over three months with the exception of two small ar eas one in montana one in missouri the united states has attained this sta ndard but the current review found evidence of health effects at the levels of exposure currently experienced by much of the us population the staff paper reported significant associ ations between pb lead exposures and broad range of health ffects including in children neurological effects notably intellect ual attainment ttention and school performance with longterm consequences over lifetime16 the staff paper also reported effects on the immune system with increased risk for autoimmunity and asthma17 in adults the staff paper found associa tions between lead exposur and increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes including increased blood pressure and

exposure also was associated with reduced kidney function with adverse impacts enhanced in those with diabetes hypertension nd chronic renal insufficiency as result both epa staff and the casac recommended strengthening the naaqs according to the staff paper staff concludes that it is appropriate for the administrator to consider an appreciable reduction in the level of the standard reflecting our judgment that standard appreciably lower than the current standard could provide an appropriate degree of public health protection and would likely result in important improvements in protecting the health of sensitive groups we recommend that consideration be given to range of standard levels from approximately 0102 µgm3 particularly in conjunction with monthly averaging time down to the lower levels included in the exposure and risk assessment 002 to 005 µgm319 casac concurred stating in january 22 2008 letter that it unanimously affirms epa staffs recognition of the need to substantially lower the level of the primary naaqs for lead to an upper bound of higher than 02 µgm3 20 the administrator agreed that the primary naaqs should be substantially lowered choosing level of 015 µgm3 the administrator also proposed two op tions for revising the averaging time and form used to determine whether an area meets the standard instead of the former nottobeexceeded form based on quarterly 3month averages of lead concentrations the proposal w ould have either revised th current averaging form to clarify that it applies across threeyear span ie to demonstrate attainment an area would need to show quarterly readings lower than the standard for 12 consecutive quarters or the proposal would re vise the measure to the second highest monthly average in threeyear span according to agency staff this latter form would better capture shortterm increases in lead ex posure while allowing the average from one bad month perhaps resulting from unusua l meteorological conditions to be disregarded the agency noted that control programs to reduce quarterly mean concentrations may not have the same protective effect as control programs aimed at reducing concentrations in every individual month21 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34479crs7 22 ibid 23 us epa fact sheet proposed revi sions to the national ambient air qua lity standards for lead p 3 at httpwwwepagovairleadpdfs20080501_factsheetpdfcasac also recommended that considera tion be given to changing from the calendar quarter to the monthly averaging time in making that recommendation casac emphasized support from studies sugge sting that blood lead concentrations respond at shorter time scales than woul d be captured completely by quarterly values22 the administrator chose neither of these options instead the agency will use rolling threemonth average evaluated over threeyear period any threemonth average exceeding the standard will be c onsidered violation of the naaqs for nonattainment area to be subs equently redesignated to attainment the area would have to have three years of rolling threemonth averages that met the standard this is somewhat more stringent than the previous averaging time calendar quarters but not as protective as the second highes t monthly average would have been as shown in figure 1 17 counties have monitors showing nonattainment using the new standard by comparison only tions of two counties violate the old standard as will be discussed in more detail below less than 3 of the nations counties have active lead monitors thus more counties may be found in nonattainment once the monito ring network is expanded the secondary standard as part of its current review epa also assessed the secondary public welfare naaqs for lead the secondary standard has been identical to the primary standar d the agency concluded that significant number of new studies have been conducted since 1978 that associate lead pollution with adverse effects on organisms and ecosystems however there is lack of evidence linking various effects to specific levels of lead in the air23 lacking such evidence the administrator continued the practice of making the secondary standard identical to the primary standardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34479 crs8 source us epa figure 1 counties with monitors violating th 2008 lead standard of 015 micrograms per

httpwwwepagovairleadpdfs20080501_text1pdf p 17 25 in the support documents for the proposed and final naaqs epa provided several different estimates of the number of countie s with active monitors ranging from 86 to 111 further communication with the office of ai r quality planning and standards produced final estimate of 70 counties with total of 133 active monitors the reason for the discrepancies is that there are number of counties that have or had monitors that were switched off after years of showing attainment with the 1978 naaqs in these cases there may be data for older time periods but the agen cy does not know with certainty whether the areas would be in attainment of the new standard personal communication october 23 2008 26 in support of the lead naaqs proposal epa produced map of the united states showing the locations of lead monitors and of sources emitting more than 5 tons of lead per year the map showed that several of the stat without monitors have large sources of lead emissions arkansas for example has two of th 12 largest stationary sources of lead in the united states those with lead emissions exceeding 5 tons per year but ambient lead monitors montana which has one of the two nonattainment areas for the 1978 lead standard also has ambient lead monitors similarly large sources in oklahoma the texas panhandle and other locations appear to be located more than 100 miles from the nearest ambient monitor additional data on monitor locations confirming that 24 states have monitors was provided by epas office of air quality planning and standards may 6 2008 see also epa to seek comment on increasing air monitors as part of lead rulemaking daily environment report november 29 2007 p a10 expanding the lead monitoring network besides finding that the 1978 naaqs is inadequate to protect public hea lth and welfare epa s review concluded that the current monitoring network is inadequate to assess national compliance with the proposed revised lead standards24 only 70 of the roughly 3000 counties in the united states 23 have active lead monitors leaving many areas of the country without any means of determining wh ether they are in violation of the lead naaqs25 twentyfour entire states including some with major sources of lead emissions have lead monitors26 under the old 1978 standa rd this was not much of an issue there were at one time about 900 lead monitors in operati on but as lead emi ssions decreased and as the monitors showed consistent attainment of the standards many of the monitors were shut down or removed with substa ntially more stringen t standard however it cannot be assumed that areas without monitors are still in attainment the locations of monitors and of the ma jor sources of lead emissions are shown in figure 2 the figure shows that large sour ces of emissions in alaska arizona arkansas florida illinois indiana io wa kansas michigan mississippi nebraska new york oklahoma

industry says urban monitoring key to final epa lead naaqs decision inside epa clean air report october 2 2008 the results of the new monitoring may indicate which of the categories of monitor locations is more likely to detect nonattainment and whether further changes in emphasis are warranted epa emissions data indicate that about 55 of l ead emissions come from point sources with the remaining 45 coming primarily from aviation gasoline see october 2008 naaqs general overview previously cited p 9 emissions from the latter category might correlate with areas that have general aviation airports or more broadly urban areas 28 according to omb watch draft of the ru attached to an october 13 2008 email from epa to omb stated that the em issions threshold would be set at 05 tons per year and the urban area cutoff at one million the draft is available at httpwwwombwatchorgregspdfshalfton_exc erptpdf in changing the emissions threshold to 1 ton per year as many as 124 areas with sources emitting between 05 tons and 1 ton per year were exempted from required monitoring in changing the urban area threshold on the other hand 49 areas were dded thus overall 75 fewer areas were required to monitor as result of the changes seeepa to reduce airborne lead omb watch october 21 2008 at httpwwwombwat chorgarticlearticleview4390to address this shortfa ll epa proposed in addition to the revised lead naaqs to require monitors near all sour ces of lead that exceed threshold of between 200 and 600 kilograms 441 to 1323 pounds of emissions per year the agency also proposed to require small network of monitors to be placed in urban areas with populations greater than one milli on to gather information on the general populations exposure to lead in the air in the final rule the administrator chos thresholds different than proposed he set the source threshold at one ton of missions rather than 200600 kilograms and required monitors in urban areas with popul ations of 500000 or more rather than one million the final choice appears to have reflected concerns by industry groups including the battery council internationa l who argued that emphasis should be placed more on exposureoriented monitoring than on specific sources of emissions27 according to press reports the white house office of management and budget weighed in at the last minute in support of the change in emphasis28 the states remain free to install more monitors than epa requires if they believe that the effects of industrial sources with less than one ton of emissions should be monitored but finding the mone to do so may be difficult at time when many of the states are experiencing shortage of revenues epa estimates the initial cost of the required network at 45 milli on and the operational costs at 35 million annually even finding this amount may pos challenges in some states potentially causing delays in implement ation of the new

see for example environmentalists pu sh new lead standard industry warns of consequences for business daily environment report august 28 2008issues raised by the naaqs review perhaps the two largest issues raised during the lead naaqs review process whether naaqs was still needed and whet her the administrators proposed range of standards reflected the scientific advi ce he received have now been resolved with little remaining controversy casac and epa staff both concluded that airborne lead still meets the naaqs crite ria endangerment of public health or welfare and numerous or diverse sources rather than support the deletion of lead from the list of criteria pollutants they concluded that lead in ambient air still poses threat to public health that the ol d naaqs established in 1978 was far too lenient and that the 1978 naaqs needed to be significantly strengthened29 the administrator agreed second major issue was whether the proposed range of standards as opposed to the final promulgated version was suppor ted by the available science the range proposed by the administrator while substa ntially stronger than the 1978 standard would have allowed him to set final naaqs 50 higher ie less stringent than the least stringent level recommended by both epas scientific staff and by the independent casac pa nel given uncertainties in the science particularly the estimated correlation between airborne lead and bl ood lead levels and the uncertainties in the concentrationresponse f unctions ie the effect that changes in blood lead levels have on iq the ad ministrator stated in the may 2008 proposal that his decision would be supported by the science at any point in the proposed range of 010 to 030 µgm330 his final choice 015 µgm3 fell within the range recommended by epa staff and casac and thus appears less likely to provoke controvers at that level the standard is supported by the staffs conclusions which we re themselves based on the review of more than 6000 scientific studi and by the unanimous conclusions of the 22member casa c review panel there are of course some who wanted weaker or stronger standards in comments on the proposed range some co mmenters expressed disappointment that the administrator did not consider the potential economic impacts in making his choice31 these comments were echoed by the association of battery recyclers abr

of naaqs however point underlined by the supreme court in unanimous 2001 decision33 and repeated by the agency in announcing the final decision thus the administrator appears to have been on firm ground in rejecting economic arguments others including epas childrens health protection advisory committee chpac argued for stronger standard34 chpac cited evidence that lead exposure at low levels poses even greater harm per unit of lead than does exposure at higher levels and argued that the standard should be set at 002 µgm3 almost an order of magnitude below the administrators final choice35

of chpac and the chief health scientist on the staff of the envir onmental defense fund while epas own analysis justifies an even lower lead standard this tenfold reduction will go long way to protecting children most at risk from airborne lead its refreshing to see the agency follow the science and the advice of its experts in making this decision36 costs and benefits of the new standard

purposes and to comply with an executive order38 the ria analyzes in detail the co sts and benefits of new or revisedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34479crs14 38 continued benefits and costs of selected

for the final lead standard as part of the final regulatory package october 16 2008 the ria presented range of both cost s and benefits from the new standard assuming full implementation of control measures in 2016 both the cost and benefit ranges were large and epa stressed that there are important overall data limitations and uncertainties in these estimates39 i n g n r l c s t s and benefits may be understated because the study develope d estimates only for the 17 counties that currently have monitors s howing nonattainment until ne w monitors are installed the agency has way of estimating how many additional areas will be affected by the standard but the ria emphasizes that there may be many more potential nonattainment areas than have been analyzed in this ria40 costs the cost estimates ranged from 150 million annually in 2016 to as much as 28 billion 19 times as much the difference is attributable to epas inability to demonstrate attainment of the standard in all areas through the application of identified control technol ogies the ria states for the selected standard of 015 µgm3 over 94 of the estimated emission reductions needed for attainment are achi eved through application of identified controls and less than 6 through specified emission reductions identified point source controls include known asures for known sources that may be implemented to attain the selected standard whereas the achievement of unspecified emission reductions requi res implementation of hypothetical additional measures in areas that would not attain the selected standard following the implementation of identified controls to known sources41 the known controls are estimated to cost 130 million to 150 million annually depending on the discount rate chosen but the unspecified emission controls are estimated at from 20 million to 31 billion annually depending on the methodology used key feature of epas analysis is that it assumed all emi ssion reductions would come from controls on point source emissions eg smelters foundries incinerators etc but according to the agency 45 of emissions come from aviation fuel in october 2006 epa received petition from friends of the earth to reduce orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34479crs15 42 for the petition and additional informati on see http wwwepago votaqaviationhtm 43 ria p es4 44 ria chapter 5 pp 114eliminate lead from aviation gasoline42 the agency in coordination with the federal aviation administration faa is analyzin g the petition the ria does not address the costs or benefits of such step in addition the agency notes in this ria we have not accounted for th effect of improvements that tend to occur such as technology improvem ent process changes efficiency improvements materials substitution etc we believe these typical improvements will tend to result in more cost effective approaches than simply adding extremely expensive pollution controls in many areas by the attainment date of 2016 many industrial sources of lead emissions emit very small quantities of lead in absolute terms ou r cost modeling shows that some could face significant costs to reduce these low levels of lead costs which could be prohibitively expensive rather than applying additional controls it may be possible for firms emitting small amounts of pb lead to modify their production processes or other operational parameters including pollution prevention techniques which would be more cost ffective than adding additional control technology such measures might include increasing the enclosure of buildings increasing air flow in hoods modifying operation and maintenance procedures changing feed materials to lower pb content measures to suppress dust from tailings piles etc43 benefits the ria estimates that benef its of the naaqs will range from 37 billion to 69 billion annually in 2016 and t hus that benefits will outweigh costs at all points in the estimated range the benefits mostly represent the expected increase in lifetime earnings that would re sult from children under seven years of age avoiding iq loss due to exposure to lea d the ria focuses primarily on childrens health effects it does not attempt to estimate the changes in leadrelated health effects among adults unquan tified health effects include hypertension nonfatal coronary heart disease nonfatal strokes premature mortality other cardiovascular diseases neurobehavioral function renal effects reproductive effects fetal effects from maternal exposure including diminished iq44 it is beyond the agencys capability at pr esent to quantify these effects thus the benefits just like the costs are subject to substantial uncertaintyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34479crs16 45 for additional information on those rules see crs report rl34057 ozone air quality standards epas march 2008 revision and crs report rl33254 air quality epas 2006 changes to the particulate matter pm standard issues for congress the lead naaqs appears to be less controversial than the recent naaqs decisions on ozone and particul ate matter both of which are being challenged in the dc circuit court of appeals45 but given the importance of its potential health benefits and the uncertainties regarding bot h the number of areas affected and the means by which areas will reach attain ment implementation of the naaqs may continue to be of interest to the committees of jurisdiction in congress an immediate issue will be whether state governments at time of fiscal crisis can find the resources to implement the monitoring network required by the new standard without which it will not be implemented in many areas expected to be in violation epa estimates the initial cost of this network at 45 million and the operational costs at 35 million annually epa has in the past requested funds for the establishment of monitoring ne twork when new naaqs was promulgated in the current fiscal year however the agency like most of the government is operating under continuing resolution that limits its ability to take on new programs thus the states may be left to establish the monitoring network with their own resources and in some cases ther may be delays in implementation
