6307c18 shspec287 errors in time the insistence on having lived only once seems odd it takes more than gpm to produce such frenzy on the subject behind all aberration and illness there must be lie aberration cannot exist in the presence of truth pavlov apparently never noticed that reward was one of the stimuli that he was observing communism based on pavlov and the physiological nature of man becomes disastrous when practiced pavlov did total anatomy of punishment but left out reward capitalism works only because one analyzed it and pay is still part of the system if capitalism were earnest about fighting communism it would dig up such truths and promulgate them punishment does not uniformly control response at all it is not constant not all beings succumb to threat of punishment the reward part of existence is at least as important men will do more for reward than to avoid punishment the more that reward is taken away eg by taxation the more difficulty society gets into the lie that man is driven animal is destroying the social structure of man as long as you are trying to isolate the truth you will be 0k matter how much trouble you have in getting at the truth the trouble starts when you settle on lie and stop looking for truth you can have misconceptions and still not go nuts but when you settle on lie and say that that is the truth you have had it the lie will pervade your life it takes lie of the only lived once magnitude to continue the aberration of man to maintain such lie must take fantastic amount of duress someone must be working at it all psychosomatic healing could probably be done by finding the lie about the somatic for instance you could use the command recall lie behind the psychosomatic what would be the most disastrous type of lie it would be one about time here is how to aberrate someone give him false time track implant him with false past complete with pictures and times times in the order of magnitude of thetans actual existence of trillions and trillions of years only wrong time will freeze case as reflected in frozen ta so this must be pervasive common denominator of aberration this suggests processes like recall lie about time or dating everything in the pcs lifetime hence the importance of history with this view of the subject of time lrh investigated to see if someone earlier had played around with peoples time in the past sure enough there were implanted times and areas of track where time was utterly confused and incomprehensible you could get guy fixed up with enough false pasts that he would dramatize them he would get the opinion that he should never return on the time track because it is too dangerous or too confusing you could confuse the guy further by giving him some incomprehensible dates r3r is good enough to be able to find moment when false past was installed date it and find its duration and then run it out the incident pretends to be trillions of years long when it was really two or three hours long the common denominator of these incidents is that the point where you approached is commonly repeated in the incident one moment is actual the other is picture of it in the incident so you get two beginnings as well as two departures commonly such implants also have mechanism showing troops marching to the pc the beginning and troops marching away the end with numbers running along the sides of these implanted pictures to give their times the implant will often have these pictures of beginning and end reversed it is very confusing the way you can tell false track is that it really doesnt move there is time in false track for all the details between major events and the sound is seldom included true time track is more sequitur but can have periods of anaten the reason the pc is likely to be on false track is that most of it except for the beginning and end points is safer and less uncomfortable than actual track false track is lie about time it may have dates neatly placed on the sides one thing you can say about false track is that gpm is on false track this would be pointless they may be implants but they are not on false track so if you are running gpm it is not the false time track you can find gpms and date them there are two things that you want to know when you find an incident and date it 1 does it contain oppositefiring items in which case it is gpm 2 does it contain any false past you need this data discouraging though it seems to say so on false track be especially alert for false date and duration the darwinian theory is just an implant putting out the idea that man is mud it starts with goal to persist they have you in cell so they start by showing you being in cell then they show you pictures of your arriving in the cell to be implanted then they show you complete with pictures like movie all that has happened to you this is background data that lets you know how mean you are then they show you being implanted while you are watching you are having the hell picked out of you by electronic mass stacking around your body you are hit with electronic waves and the mass becomes associated with the pictures nothing at all is said there is sonic in this incident some false pasts do have sonic but beware of running things in these incidents that arent there the darwinian implant makes evolution appear true but it isnt when there are horses on planet it is because someone came along and mocked up some horses this sort of false past implant was done lot before the helatrobus implants some was also done after the helatrobus implants you have to know about this in order to get dates corrected you have to know that some are false not just wrong look for false pasts not false dates per the time track can also contain false future fortune tellers practice this to this day someone who is always trying to know the future is just dramatizing false future implant sound and motion are seldom found in false track incidents rather these incidents tend to jump from still to still more like lantern slides than movie the helatrobus dear gorilla and glade implants dont use pictures the helatrobus implant only uses pictures of railway and house in the gorilla and bear implants they have guy with pink striped shirt with monkey or sometimes gorilla that they put on the cart with you this is not the same as getting whole set of pictures that purport to be your past or future while getting electronic blasts false track can get in the way of running actual track some of it is pretty incredible but if false past doesnt read go ahead and run it run it anyway even if it is false maybe you will be able to find the real beginning however it is hard to find the beginning of falsepast incident when you run across something in session handle it but dont louse up your pc when you start correcting dates you will run into false pasts and futures so beware of redating just get in and clean up first the fact that it is false past and run it so you wont have it in the way if you locate source of wrong dates dont ask for another source of wrong dates run the one you have here is rule when you have your hands on an incident that contains false past or future run it with r3r to get it off the track get its actual duration the real beginning of the incident and also its end are hard to find since such incidents generally have two beginnings and two ends dont do anything extraordinary just be prepared to reduration it if necessary dont just redate it and leave it because thousands of dates will have been restimulated in the course of auditing and finding it again will be difficult apart from the fact that that incident is all you should run anyway until you have run it out so when you have your hands on something handle it dont leave the pc struggling with it while you try to do something else remember that your major auditing cycle is to accomplish some particular result on the pc if you get into something outside the perimeter of what you were going to do dont neglect it because it may never show up again when you have found the source of the pcs upset what else is there to find if you invalidate the source how will you accomplish you major purpose dont bypass achieving what you set out to do cognition can signal the end of your major auditing cycle
