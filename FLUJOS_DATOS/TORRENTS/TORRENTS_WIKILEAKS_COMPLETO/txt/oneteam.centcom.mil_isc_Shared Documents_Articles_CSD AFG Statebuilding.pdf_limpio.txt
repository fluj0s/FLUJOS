this materialdownloaded by open university library at 1741 18 july 2008 opinion afghanistan an unsuitable candidate for state building anatol lieven if the west loses in afghanistan and its region perhaps the most important reason leaving aside pashtun courage grit and fanaticism in the misguided service of the talebanwill be that we are pursuing ﬁve different goals simultaneously most of which are in contradiction to the others however this shambolic strategy is not fortuitouseach goal has been set by powerful western forces and indeed real western needsthe problem is that the west in general and the us in particular lacks institutions and leaders capable of choosing between these goals and coordinating strategy in pursuit of the most desirable and achievable ones these goals are victory in the war against the taliban force which now embodies large part ofpashtun ethnoreligious sentiment the creation of afghanistan as moreorless modern effective and democratic state success in destroying or at least containing wider terrorist and extremist forces in theregion and the muslim world as part of the global war on t error radical reduction in afghanistans role as the principal source of heroin making its way to the west and the preservation of nato as meaningful international military organisation and through this the preservation of close transatlantic relationship in

open university library at 1741 18 july 2008 not merely are these goals to considerable extent incompatible but in several cases we have not even really thought through what victory in this context would actually mean and whether any meaningful success is actually achievable in principle and in western rhetoric the war against the taliban is the cardinal element in western strategy it is the hinge on which the other elements depend and this hinge in turn is ﬁxed into the larger structure of the war on terror thus the us backed by its western allies overthrew the taliban because they gave base to qaeda who carried out911 the us and its allies continue to ﬁght in afghanistan because if the taliban were toreturn to power in all or large part of afghanistan they would once again give safe haven to qaeda in order to win in this ﬁghtand one day to withdraw from afghanistanthat country has to be turned into successful modern state the drugstrade has to be suppressed because it helps fund the taliban moreover nato is ﬁghtingin afghanistan because of the national interests of its members in combating the terrorist threat but also to show its relevance as an organisation to the most important security issue now affecting the west none of these propositions is necessarily false in itselfthe questions are whether they are complete explanations whether they hang together and if not whether they can be made to hang together the two greatest tensions are between the war in afghanistan and the wider war on terror and between the war against the taliban and the war on drugs thus while it iscertain that the talibans afghanistan provided the chief base for qaeda before 911 this does not necessarily prove that afghanistan will be central to the war on terror in future in the ﬁrst place as numerous experts have pointed out it is grave mistake to see theworld of sunni islamist terrorism and extremism as an organisation with hierarchy and acentre or even number of centres it is rather an evergrowing web with numerous nodes in numerous countries of which osama bin laden aiman alzawahiri and their immediate lieutenants form only one second and much more importantly there may be direct clash between the shortterm priority of beating the taliban and the wider longterm goal of combating islamist extremism and terrorism this dilemma is summed up in one word pakistan on the one hand when it comes to the ﬁght against the taliban it cannot reasonably be denied thatthe possession of safe havens and supply bases in the pashtun tribal areas of pakistan are avery important asset for our enemies the possession or lack of such safe bases on the other side of international frontiers has played vital role in the great majority of guerrilla wars over the past three generations in wars in indochina algeria various african and central484 anatol lievendownloaded by open university library at 1741 18 july 2008 american conﬂicts and even northern ireland putting pressure on pakistan to crack down on taliban support in the tribal areas would seem therefore to represent elementary military logic alternatively however when it comes to the wider war on terror pakistan not afghanistan is the crucial country in this region the reasons for this should be obvious afghanistan has always been backwater of the muslim world pakistan is central to that worlds future it has six times afghanistans population powerful army and nuclearweapons pakistans relations with india are critical to the peace and development of southasia the large pakistani diaspora in britain means that islamist extremism in pakistan reaches into the heart of the west as recent years have shown this represents the single greatest terrorist threat to europe and perhaps to the us as well the collapse of pakistanwould be disaster of immense proportions great deal of the talibans support comes from the pashtun areas of pakistan whose people are closely linked to their coethnics in afghanistan and among whom hostility to the us is overwhelming the taliban are using these areas as safe havens from which tolaunch attacks into afghanistan this is understandably causing great anger and frustration in both the afghan government and the west the danger is that if taliban attacks intensify and the prospect of western victory recedes still further the us may react either with open military raids into pakistan or byputting massive and successful pressure on the pakistani government to launch an overwhelming military offensive against the taliban and their local supporters in the pashtun areas the ﬁrst strategy would utterly humiliate the pakistani government and spread anti western fury and islamist extremism across pakistan the second would almost certainly lead to civil war in pakistan and the present war in afghanistan becoming regional one this might temporarily reduce the talibans pressure on nato in afghanistan but at thecost of radically destabilising pakistan in other words we would have gained limited andtemporary tactical victory at the cost of grave strategic defeat the second most obvious tension is between the war against the taliban and the war on drugs it is entirely true that the taliban derives much of its income from the heroin tradeunfortunately this is also true of the karzai administration many of its members at bothnational and provincial level are major ﬁgures in the trade in fact in one important province of my acquaintance every single leading ﬁgure on the antitaliban side has been credibly linked to the tradeafghanistan and state building 485downloaded by open university library at 1741 18 july 2008 heroin is also critical to the administrationand hence to the west as wellin that it is critical to the afghan economy in general on which rests public contentment and state revenues according to nato ﬁgures opium poppy cultivation and processing makes upat least two ﬁfths of afghanistans real gdp in fact its role in afghanistans commercialeconomy is much greater even than this ﬁgure would suggest since so much of the rest of the economy is either subsistence farming or directly dependent on international aid when i visited poppy farmers in thethenvery prokarzai province of nangrahar after the fall of the taliban i asked them what their response would be if the west launcheda major programme of crop eradication one headman replied to general agreement first we will kill every westerner in the provincea pauseexcept you of course because you are our guest and then we will join the taliban i asked them about ﬁnancialcompensation every one replied in some approximation of these words dont make funof us you say you know afghanistan therefore you know what will happen of any money the west gives for compensation the ofﬁcials in kabul will steal three quarters and the ofﬁcials here will steal the rest you cant seriously believe that we will see any of itunfortunately i found their words on both points entirely credible the us administration and the new us ambassador to kabul now seem determined on major push for crop eradication with what are likely to be truly disastrous results for thestruggle against the taliban they have categorically rejected proposals from the senliscouncil and other organisations that the west should replicate its strategy towards turkey and elsewhere from the 1970s on and buy the crop to turn it into morphinebased anaesthetics for distribution to africa and other impoverished regions where the demandis huge but health services are too poor to buy them this is of course problematical proposal in several ways especially when it comes to stimulating more and more production in afghanistan and undermining world prices in ways that will harm turkish indian and thai farmers who have received productionlicenses under previous deals however after consideration of this issue i simply cannot seeany other approach that stands even limited chance of reducing the heroin trade without radically alienating many afghan farmers and driving them into the arms of the taliban certainly it would be grotesque to baulk at the cost involved in buying the crop when eventhe highest estimates of this are small fraction of what we are spending on the war inafghanistan moreover as my nangrahar informants pointed out for the foreseeable future it will be hopeless to rely on the afghan state to distribute compensation or to hope that we can create sufﬁcient cadres of our own to do so effectively486 anatol lievendownloaded by open university library at 1741 18 july 2008 this leads in turn to the whole question of building up an afghan state as part of the struggle against the taliban this is worthy and indeed noble project which appears to be going nowhere the afghan state under president hamid karzai on the whole remains anempty shell occupied by forces which claim to be acting in the name of the state but are infact pursuing their own ends there is nothing surprising or even unusual about this it is true of many african countries for example in afghanistan three immensely powerful factors are at play the ancient cultural traditions which have always inclined manyafghans and pashtuns in particular to resist state power the shattering effects of ageneration of savage warfare and the fact that this warfare is continuing and intensifying today to judge by historical precedents the chances of an outside occupying force building up an indigenous state in the middle of civil war look poor this is especiallytrue because western development bureaucracies as opposed to those concerned withhumanitarian aid are not designed to operate in the complete absence of functioning state institutions and appear largely paralysed the problem about the continuing emphasis on building up the karzai state creating afghan ownership of afghan development processes an ownership that does indeed exist on the part of many afghan ofﬁcials but not quite in the sense we would wish and so on is that it often seems to be getting in the way of western efforts to bring development directlyto local communities some of the provincial reconstruction teams are doing excellentwork in this regard but they are far too few to make really substantial and visible difference in country larger than france or spain perhaps even more seriously the emphasis on trying to create highly centralised modern stateor at least the outward forms of onemay impede efforts to win overtaliban elements and create regional peace agreements these will inevitably have to involve very considerable formal devolution of power to local councils and leaders and there is certain history in afghanistan of such deals sticking at the local and regionallevel however imperfectly by contrast i ﬁnd it almost impossible to imagine formertaliban ﬁgures sitting in government in kabul and sharing real power and exercising real authority alongside representatives of the northern alliance the killings would be likely to begin after the very ﬁrst cabinet meeting my recommendations for western strategy in afghanistan therefore are the following the us and eu should coordinate an international strategy to purchase afghanistans opium poppy crop for conversion into pharmaceutical stocks for international aidafghanistan and state building 487downloaded by open university library at 1741 18 july 2008 or when necessary simply for destruction as set out in this essay this strategy has real risks the strategy presently being pursued by the us however involves not risks but certain disaster hopes for the rapid creation of an effective modern state in afghanistan should beradically scaled back instead the west should recognise and subsidise the authority of local councils and religious ﬁgures and seek to draw local protaliban leaders into these institutions international aid should be focused above all on projects designed to generate largenumbers of reasonably paid jobs for manual labourers especially in the construction of transport infrastructure and urban housing all residential educational and medical projects should have new mosque and where appropriate madrasah at their heart considerations of afghanistans vital interests should be placed at the heart of the westsrelations with iran the offer of western recognition and international legitimisation of strong institutionalised iranian role in afghanistan should be part of negotiations over irans nuclear programme however we also need to recognise that such rolewould in fact be very much in our and afghanistans interestsand is in any case to degree already reality above all afghan economic development requires close links with iran and access to irans large reserves of darispeaking professional skill remember that in the long term and especially from british and europeanperspective pakistan and not afghanistan is the important country in this region we should do everything reasonably possible in the years to come to defeat the taliban however we should also recognise that threats from failed afghan state in civil warcould be contained as they could have been prior to 911 given wiser western policiesgiven pakistans size nuclear weapons and diaspora the problems generated by pakistani collapse would be of wholly different order of magnitude therefore while the west does need to press pakistan to do more to combat islamist extremism on noaccount should we put such pressure on pakistan that it would seriously underminepakistans own internal stability this being so if over the next 10 years the situation in afghanistan fails to improve andthe military and ﬁnancial support of european nato members for the operationevaporates the us and its remaining allies should not adopt desperate and perilousstrategies to save the existing western project there instead we should adopt as fallback position the facto informal partition of afghanistan between iranian pakistani and uzbek spheres of inﬂuence with force to protect the city of kabul488 anatol lievendownloaded by open university library at 1741 18 july 2008 as neutral zone the taliban would doubtless achieve dominant power in the pashtun areas but military assistance to their rivals would prevent them from conquering non pashtun areas and would put pressure on them to create armistices with their enemiesthe key regional actors would have to undertakeunder threat of severe sanctionstodo their utmost to prevent the establishment of terrorist bases in their spheres the policy proposals set out in this essay do not just look highly unsatisfactorythey arehighly unsatisfactory especially when set against the high hopes which followed the overthrow of the taliban it is however the task of ministers ofﬁcials and analysts in thewest to face facts squarely and not comfort themselves with fantasiesespecially since the lives of large numbers of their fellow citizens in uniform depend on the policies they adopt the question therefore is not whether these proposals are ideal but whether anyother policies can possibly work better or indeed work at all in this context we also need to face another fact over the past 170 odd years both the british and soviet empires tried to rule afghanistan and shape it to their own ends like the americans in vietnam the soviets never lost battle but they were worn down by adecade of guerrilla war with possible end in sight the british in the 19th and early 20th centuries lost several battles sometimes disastrously and though they won all the wars they leaned not to rule afghanistan directly instead they adopted strategy of managing afghanistan and the tribes of theafghan frontier this was very unsatisfactory strategy and required constant bribery astute diplomacy brave and expert cadre of ofﬁcials and soldiers with long expertise and literally dozens of punitive expeditions involving thousands of casualties amongbritish and indian troops however the british had learned the lesson that unsatisfactorythough this was it was better than the disastrous alternatives do we really think that we are better people than british frontier administrators like colonels warburton sandeman and jacob and can do better in managing this region what on earth in our recent historywould suggest that i still believe that it is possible for us to wear down this latest pashtunupsurge as the british wore down previous such upsurges in the past for this however we will need not only the fortitude and local knowledge of our distinguished ancestors but their patience and ﬂexibilityafghanistan and state building 489
