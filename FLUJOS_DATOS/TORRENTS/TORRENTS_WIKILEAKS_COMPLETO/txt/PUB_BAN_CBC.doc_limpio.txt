brants lawyer said the court documents released friday after being freed from publication ban are transcripts from fantinos testimony in august 2007 at brants preliminary hearing in napanee ont court preliminary hearings are held to determine if there is enough evidence to warrant trial brant is charged with nine counts including mischief stemming from the first nations blockades on highway 401

montrealtoronto corridor lawyer calls for provincial review of fantinos conduct brants defence lawyer peter rosenthal has called on the province to launch review of the statements and actions of fantino who personally came to napanee at the time of the standoff despite regular contact between protesters and other opp officers fantino testified at the preliminary hearing that he gave brant deadline and was prepared to move in if the protesters didnt lift the blockades he said he believed the public interest demanded that the highway be reopened there were in fact plans underway at that time for forced removal of the blockade were there rosenthal asked him during his testimony yes there was fantino replied there comes time when the balance of the greater public good shifts and the feeling was that under the circumstances this situation could longer continue and we were in fact preparing to move on the blockades the raid ultimately did not happen and protesters removed the blockades peacefully later in the day but the closures snarled traffic and brought commercial rail traffic to standstill for several hours on day that featured peaceful protests across the country i think were running out of time shawn fantino said the documents include court transcripts of rosenthal reading out statements from the secret police wiretaps of at least three conversations between fantino and brant in the early hours of june 29 about removing the barriers rosenthal quoted fantino as saying i think were running out of time shawn you know weve been back and forth all night on this and weve got lot of very angry people who are absolutely beyond themselves with whats going on and you know we just have to close shop here and we cant go on any longer to be honest with you brant is quoted as replying that he needed to speak with several members of the group in order to reach consensus on ending the blockade sometimes the wheels turn slowly but you know its important that you know we came in here on consensus and we need to resolve this on consensus he is quoted as saying fantino then told rosenthal he believed that was stalling tactic and that brant had full control over the protesters rosenthal also brought up the provincial police document titled framework for police preparedness for aboriginal critical incidents which was created after the ipperwash affair the document calls for building trusting relationship with mutual respect between the culture of aboriginals and police as well as need for special concerns with respect to aboriginal protests and blockades given their historical rights and doesnt though that document and many other documents speak to the way you should do that in situations involving aboriginal protesters rosenthal asked mr rosenthal these are guidelines and theyre principles fantino replied theyre not firm and fixed mandated way of doing business police wiretapped calls without judicial approval the legality of the wiretaps was called into question by brants lawyer during his pre trial hearing as police did not receive judicial approval for the recordings police have said the secret recordings were legal citing littleknown emergency provision in the criminal code of interception in exceptional circumstances but brants lawyer said the polices use of wiretapping in the case was outrageous how often are the opp using wiretaps without judges permission in the province rosenthal told cbc news in an interview outside the courtroom fantino testified that he was aware the conversations with brant were being recorded but said he had role in the decision to wiretap the calls detconst douglas weiss the lead investigator in the case against brant also couldnt say who in the opp authorized the wiretaps he also testified at brants pretrial hearing that he has to this date never heard them and never asked for them to be included as evidence the opp only decided that they would disclose the existence of the wiretaps week before the pretrial hearing began weiss told the court in canada proceedings from preliminary hearings are usually protected by publication bans in order to protect the accused persons right to fair trial especially when the case might later go before jury however brant whose trial is scheduled to begin in january waived his right to publication ban in this case saying he wanted the testimony from the preliminary hearing to be made public the judge imposed ban anyway after the crown requested one but lifted it friday in napanee after cbc news legal team argued for the right to publish the material
