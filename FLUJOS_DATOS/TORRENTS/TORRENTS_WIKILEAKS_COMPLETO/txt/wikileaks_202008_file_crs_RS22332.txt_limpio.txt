summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22332 this report examines trade entering and leaving the united states through the gulf of mexico and its 16 major ports region extending from southern florida to southern texas it is designed as tool for planning or reaction in the 109th congress 2nd session as congress continues to deal with the hurricanes aftermath and as resource to help quickly identify some of the potential trade effects of any other natural or manmade disaster that might strike the us gulf coast included are five graphs map and table summarizing specific trade data for the 16 ports finally this report looks at potential trade implications of any such disasters and identifies some policy issues it will not be updated1 purpose of this report the gulf of mexico can be likened to gigantic harbor whose span is roughly equal to onehalf the distance between the us atlantic and pacific coasts it is not surprising therefore that roughly 80 of the value of all trade that enters or leaves the united states along the gulf coast does so by water the strength of the gulf harbor is that it is somewhat protected and centrally located for easy water access to europe and the mediterranean africa south america or through the panama canal asia the problem with the gulf however is that because of recent weather changes it has been the site of increased numbers of higher intensity hurricanes these include hurricane katrina which struck the gulf coast on august 29 2005 and hurricane rita which struck the gulf coast on september 24 2005 temporarily closing or partially closing five of the 16 trade ports2 and paralyzing the massive network 1 carolyn smith and michael donnelly ksgfdt crs provided statistical assistance 2 see table 1 footnotes for list of ports

congress crs2 of oil and gas facilities including drilling platforms pipelines and refineries such disasters can result in considerable disruption to trade as commodities some of them perishable are delayed diverted destroyed or simply hung up and unable to get through blocked ports the us national hurricane center has reported that it expects recent wind and water temperature changes in the atlantic ocean which spawned these more intense storms to continue possibly for 25 years or more3 this report examines trade entering and leaving the united states through the gulf of mexicos 16 major ports which together account for 99 of all gulf waterborne trade it is designed as tool for planning or reaction as resource to help quickly identify some of the potential trade effects of any natural

commodities may be lost although figure 6 shows commodity specialization by port many ports export high volumes of key commodities all 16 ports except gulfport handle oil as an export or import and typically include refineries all 16 ports export chemicals although only 10 specialize in chemical exports most grain exports pass through texas or louisiana only pascagoula specializes in exporting poultry although sizable quantities of poultry not shown in table 1 also pass through mobile new orleans gulf port or houston gulfport specializes in textile and apparel exports hurricane katrina closed or partially closed five main gulf ports new orleans south louisiana mobile pascagoula and gulfport hurricane rita affected two beaumont and galveston most ports were quickly reopened while some goods found other import or export routes some oil production facilities have still not reopened at the time this report was published currently monthly statistics on waterborne trade in us gulf ports are lagging economic activity by at least seven months thus statistics from which to estimate changes in the value of exports and imports as result of these hurricanes will likely not be available until about mid2006 meanwhile the us census bureau has begun releasing preliminary export and import data for all gulf ports covering months since hurricanes katrina and rita struck however these data have not been further refined by the us maritime administration these data are available at httpwwwcensusgovforeigntradepressreleasegulf_indexhtml with data from either source however it may be hard to separate out effects of katrina from other effects such as overall weather and supply and demand especially on agricultural products which may vary considerably in tonnage and value from year to year the potential for additional hurricanes in the gulf region in the coming years raises number of trade policy questions some of the most important ones revolve around options for protecting the trade infrastructure which includes the mississippi river grain storage elevators the various ports oil facilities in the gulf of mexico and us merchant vessels crs6 table 1 commodity
