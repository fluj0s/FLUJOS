summary many bills relating to child care have been introduced since 1996 but most have failed to be enacted into law the notab exceptions were appropriations acts that included increases in discretionary funding for child care and some related programs in 2001 the bush administration introduced new proposals and initiatives as part of the fy2002 budget and the fy2002 appropriati ons process addressed the issue of funding levels for some of those proposals the fy2002 appropriations act for the departments of labor health and human services hhs and education ed pl 107116 included 21 billion in discretionary funding for the ccdbg 100 million less than president bushs fy2002 budget request and did not incl ude the administrations proposed 400 million setaside for new afterschool certificate program within the ccdbg in its fy2003 budget request the adminis tration proposed to maintain level funding for the ccdf while increasing head start funding and eliminating the early learning fund at the close of the 107th congress laborhhsed appropriations bill had not been passed instead fundi ng was provided tem porarily at fy2002 levels through series of continuing resolutions the ccdbg provides child care subsidies to lowincome families with children under age 13 it is the primary source of federal child care assistance for lowincome families and is funded thr ough both mandatory and disc retionary funds referred to in total as the child care and development fund ccdf authorization for both funding streams was due to expire at the end of fy 2002 reau thorization bills pertaining to welfare legislation which includes mandatory child care funding and the ccdbg act which authorizes discre tionary funding and sets program rules were introduced and in the house consolidated bill was passed hr 4737 however in the senate neither welfare nor child care reauthorization bill made it further than committee approval during the 107th congress as result child care funding and welfare funding was extended temporarily vi continuing resolutions leaving reauthorization legislation on the agenda for the incoming 108th congress with respect to other child carerelate d grants or tax provisions earlier proposed bills and initiatives reflected attempts to approach the overarching issues of child care availability affordability and quality with changes to the block grant andor tax code although most of those earlier bills and initia tives failed to reach law several similar bills were introduced in the 107th congress including an omnibus tax bill which was signed into law and contained chan ges to the dependent care tax credit child care has become an area of increased focus during reauthorization debates and the overall i ssue of early childhood

legislative activity section of this report reauthorization legislation failed to be passed in the 107th congress and funding was extended on temporary basis via series of continuing resolutions the ccdbg is administered by hhs and provides block grants to states according to formula which are used to subsidize the child care expenses of families with children under age 13 if the parents are working or in school and family income is less than 85 of the state median in practice many states establish income eligibility levels that are lowerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30944crs2 2 for more

the quality and availability of ch ild care and according to statute must target 70 of entitlement funds on welfare recipients work ing toward selfsufficiency or families at risk of welfare dependency howeve r because all families falling below the 85 of state median income requirement can be categorized as at risk the 70 targeting of the welfare and atrisk population does not necessarily mean welfare families must be served in theory all funds may be used for lowincome nonwelfare working families however state plans indicate that many states guarantee child care to welfare families more
