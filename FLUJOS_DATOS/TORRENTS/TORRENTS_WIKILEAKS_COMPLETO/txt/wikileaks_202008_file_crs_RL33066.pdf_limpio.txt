opinions authored by chief justice rehnquist given the chief justices long tenure on the court our selection of opinions covers only portion of those he authored including significant dissents federalism during chief justi ce rehnquists early years on the court in the 1970s there were growing conflicts between state gove rnments and the fede ral government the federal government was expa nding in size while imposing new mandates on states because of these new responsibilities state governments developed increased administrative capacities and were soon ar guing for greater control over many of statefederal programs however this was also time of increasing federal controls over states for instance the economic stabilizati on act of 1970 was used by president nixon to reduce raise that had been promised to ohio state employees this action was challenged in the case of fry v united states1 in fry the supreme court considered the argument that the states should be immune fro m federal regulation in brief opinion the majority reasserted based on prior cas law that states are not immune from federal regulati on under the commerce clause merely because of their sovereign statushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33066crs2 2 421 us at 551559 3 426 us 833 1976 4 426 us at 856 5 469 us 528 1985 6 440 us 410 1979 7 440 us at 437 8 440 us at 433justice rehnquist who was then new to th bench wrote dissent in this case2 he argued that while the commerce clause might apply to the states the states should also have positive constitutional defense against such regulation under justice rehnquists reasoning if the federa l government was allowed to impose any type of regulation on state this would eliminate the sovereignty of the state although he did not fully articulate th limits which were suggested by state sovereignty he did argue that there had to be logical limit to how far the federal government could go other ju stice however joined his dissent however this soon changed in 1976 the court decided the case of national league of cities v usery 3 which dealt with the fair labor standards act and the question of whether the federal gove rnment could impose minimum wage and overtime requirements for state employees justice rehnquist managed to attract four more votes to his position by dis tinguishing the temporary freeze on state employee wages in fry from the longterm reordering of the economic priorities of the states in national league of cities justice rehnquists opinion carefully considered the economic impact of the minimum wage and overtime requirements and made the case that the intrusion on the state was far greater than was the case in fry the coalition assembled by chief jus tice rehnquist crumbled however when justice blackmun who in concurrence in national league of cities had advocated balancing approach to federalstate relations4 reversed his position in 1985 justice blackmun authored an opinion in garcia v san antonio metropolitan transit authority5 which overruled national league of cities garcia concluded that the national league of cities test for integral operati ons in areas of traditional governmental functions had proven impractical and that federalism disputes were to be considered political questions consequently for the next 10 years justice rehnquist had to make his federalism arguments from dissent for instance in nevada v hall 6 the court considered whether one state could be sued in the courts of another state while the court allowed such suits justice rehnqui st suggested that previous case law supported the concept that unconsenting stat are not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of other states7 this was the beginning of line of reasoning that led to the rebirth of 11th amendment state sovereign immunity in hall justice rehnquist based his dissent on the implic it ordering of relationships within the federal system necessary to make the constitution workable

courts configura tion that was to last until 2005 was in place in that year chief justice re hnquist authored the courts opinion in united states v lopez9 which brought into question the extent to which congress can rely on the commerce clause as basis for federal legislation under the gunfree school zones act of 1990 cong ress made it federal offe nse for any individual knowingly to possess firearm at place that the individual knows or has reasonable cause to believe is school zone10 in lopez the court held that because the act neither regulated commercial activity nor contained requirement that the possession was connected to interstate commerce the act exceeded the authority of congress under the commerce clause the lopez case was significant in that it was the first time since 1937 with the possible exception of usery that the supreme court struck down federal statute purely based on findi ng that the congress had exceeded its powers under the commerce clause the five justices who decided lopez chief justice rehnqui st justices scalia thomas kennedy and oconnor became in strumental in number of other federalism cases11 for instance these four associate justices joined an opinion authored by chief justice rehnquist in united states v morrison12 which invalidated portion of the violence against women ac t allowing party to obtain damages from person who commits gendermotivated crime13 applying its holding in lopez the court concluded that the activity regulated by the act could not be classified as economic activity and cons equently was not am enable to federal regulation under the commerce clause of particular note was that in morrison unlike in lopez there were numerous congressional findings as to the effect of gendermotivated crime on commerce again writing for the court chief justi ce rehnquist stressed that although findings by the legislative branch can serve to illuminate the relationship between the regulation and interstate commerce constitutionality is for the court to decide in this case the court determined that the gislative findings detailing the effects on interstate commerce by gender motivated violence were based in large part on the costs of crime which was nearly identical to reasoning expressly rejected by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33066crs4 14 529 us at 615 stating that the reasoning of congress would

court to show less deference to congress in establishing the constitutional basis of legislation15 however chief justice rehnquist was so the author of an opinion which appeared to show the limits of the courts emphasis on federalism nevada department of human resources v hibbs 16 63 decision involved the question of whether the family and medical leave act of 1993 fmla could be applied to the states in hibbs the court held that congress c ould use its enforcement authority under the 14th amendment17 to abrogate state sovereig n immunity based on history of state discrimination against women in employment previously the court had been reluctant to find such an abrogation for instance in kimel v florida board of regents 18 which evaluated the application of the age discrimination in employment act of 1967 against the states the court noted that age discrimination was ev aluated under rational basis test consequently it was difficult for the congress to show pattern of unconstitutional age discrimination by the states similarly in the case of board of trustees v garrett 19 which dealt with the american w ith disabilities act the court found pattern of unconstitutional discrimination against the disabled by the states in hibbs however the court held that cong ress had the power to abrogate states eleventh amendment immunity unde r the fmla so that state employee could recover money damages the difference here is that the court has found that legislation which makes genderb ased classifications is subject to higher level of scrutiny than the classifications made in kimel and garrett consequently it was easier for congress to show pattern of state constitutional violations regarding women and employment and the court appear ed to be more lenient in the types of evidence it would consider to establish this justice rehnquists opinion found that congress had established significant evidence of long and extensive history of sex discrimination with respect to the administration of leave benefits by the states and that history was sufficient to justify the enactment of the legislation under the 14th amendment still by assigning the opini on to himself justice rehnquist may have sought to limit the scope of the decision20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33066crs5 20 continued immunity by title ii of the ada based on

sharing of power between branches and concerns itself mainly with the preservation of the core func tion of particular branch see strauss supra note 21 at 489 29 487 us 654 1988separation of powers chief justice rehnquist participated in veral major cases in this area often though not exclusively appearing to align himself with what might be considered formalistic view of separation of powers21 justice rehnquist joined with the formalists in buckley v valeo 22 which held that congress could not appoint officials to any executive agency ins v chadha 23 which struck down congresss use of the onehouse legislative veto and bowsher v synar 24 which held that congress had unconstitutionally usurped executive branch functions by assigning executive duties to the comptroller general legislative branch officer similarly justice rehnquist had dissented from the courts holding nixon v administrator of general services 25 in which the majority rejected the archaic view of separation of powers as requiring three airtight compartme nts of government26 justice rehnquist however joined the majoritys opinion in commodities futures trading commission v schor which held that congresss grant of authority to the cftc to entertain state law count erclaims in reparation proceedings did not violate article iii of the cons titution27 the majority opinion expressly rejected the formalistic approach to sepa ration of powers in favor of what has been characterized by some scholars as more f unctional or flexible approach28 in 1988 in the case of morrison v olsen29 the court was presented

independent counsel charged with the i nvestigation of government officials suspected of illegal activity as well as for their subsequent pros ecution the statute further provided that the i ndependent counsel may be removed from office other than by impeachment and conviction only by the personal action of the attorney general and only for good cause physical di sability mental incapacity or any other condition that substantially impairs the performance of such independent counsels duties31 by the time the case reached the supreme court it contained not only separation of powers questions but so questions arising under both the appointments clause32 and article iii of the cons titution the court in groundbreaking opini on by chief justice rehnquist again departed from its previous formalistic pproach in favor of more functional position holding that the independent c ounsel statute was valid exercise of congresss power in reaching his conclusions chief justice rehnquist distinguished morrison from previous decisions in both bowsher v synar33 and myers v untied states34 on the basis that the independent couns statute before the court does not involve an attempt by congress itself to gain role in the removal of executive officials other than its establishe d powers of impeachment and conviction35 the court found that removal author ity was vested not in the congress but rather in the attorney general an executive branch offici who answers directly to the president subject only to the requirement that g ood cause be shown the court could find reason why the presidents need to co ntrol the exercise of the independent counsels discretion is so central to the functioning of the executive branch as to require as matter of constitu tional law that the counsel be terminable at will by the president36 chief justice rehnquists opinion again fo cused on the fact that congress did not attempt to increase its own powers with respect to the removal of officers of the united states in concluding that thi s case simply does not pose danger of congressional usurpation of executive branch functions37 moreover the court noted that the statute did not impermissibl grant the judiciary powers that could behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33066crs7 38 id at 696 39 410 us 113 1973 40 id at 173 41 505 us 833 1992 42 id at 966 43 497 us 261 1990considered usurpation of executive functi ons because the judiciary could not have acted independently of request from the attorney general the extensive role that the attorney general and by extension the president possesses within the statutes framework provided in the courts opinion the executive branch sufficient control over the independent counsel to ensure that the president is able to perform his constitutionally assigned duties38 the right to privacy chief justice rehnquist was an early skeptic of cases regarding the constitutional right to privacy for instance he was one of only two dissenters to the courts opinion in roe v wade 39 finding that the right to an abortion did not fit comfortably into either the text of the constitution or the kind of privacy protections which had previously b een found protected under the constitution considering the specificity of the decisi ons mandate which di vided pregnancy into trimesters and treated regulation of each stage differently justice rehnquist dissent questioned whether the court was undertakin g role more appropriately left to legislatures40 justice rehnquists skepticism regarding roe can be further seen in his opinion concurring in part and dissen ting in part in the case of planned pa renthood v casey41 in that opinion joined by justices white scalia and thomas the chief justice concluded that roe v wade had been incorrectly decided and that its subsequent interpretation had been increas ingly confused and uncertain instead of the standard adopted by the plurality in casey which allowed for restrictions that were not unduly burdensome the chief ju stice would have upheld restrictions on abortion where such procedures are rationally related to legitimate state interest42 however justice rehnquist also had pa rt in the recognition of an arguably new privacy right the right to terminate medical treatment in the case of cruzan v missouri department of health43 the court considered two legal issues novel to the supreme court first whether an incompetent patient had the constitutional right even absent legislative approval to c onsent to the withdrawal of nutrition and hydration second whether this right coul d be exercised by guardian and what standard of proof would be required to s how that such course of action was the intent of the patient in an opinion by chief justice rehnquist the supreme court ultimately decided that the state may re quire clear and convincing evidence of patients wishes and if the guardians of the patient did not have sufficient proofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33066crs8 44 the court found that it was not constitutionally required that guardians or family be allowed to effectuate such decision cruzan 497 us at 284 rather the court determined that not only could state requi re that patients own personal wishes be examined but that absent clear and convinci ng evidence of such wishes state could decline to allow withdrawal of treatment 45 see crs report rl32830 pdf the schiavo case legal issues crs report 97244 pdf the right to die c onstitutional and statutory analysis 46 see us const amend 1 stating that congress

establish new constitutional right justice rehnquist declined to explicitly endorse right to die instead presuming the existence of such right in order to reach the issue of standard of proof regardless this case is generally cited as the basis for the establishment of this right and has been central to other cases such as the recent litigation regarding theresa schiavo45 churchstate since joining the court in 1971 chief ju stice rehnquist has played major role in developing the courts blishment clause jurisprudence46 the threepart test established by the courts 1971 decision in lemon v kurtzman47 has in one form or another dominated this area justice re hnquist however has consistently advocated narrow interpretation of the estab lishment clause one which has found constitutional many of the more controversial practices to come before the court in recent years justice rehnquists views ar reflected in numer ous cases concerning the establishment of religion the three cas highlighted here however involving school vouchers the pledge of allegi ance and public display of the ten commandments best reflect his overall view of narrow conception of the establishment clauses prohibition on r ecognition of religion by government48 in the case of zelman v simonsharris 49 the court addressed the constitutionality of the ohio pilot scholarship program which was created as partial res ponse to 1995 court decision that directed ohio to take control of clevelands failing public schools the program which per mitted voucher funds to be used to pay parochial school tuition

plainti ffs claimed standingprogram served the valid secular purpose of providing educational assistance to poor children in demonstrably failing public school system50 according to the chief justice however the central question was not whether the program had secular purpose but rather whether it had an unconstitutional effect of advancing or inhi biting religion to determine this the chief justice relied on three prior cases involving indirect assistance to sectarian schools namely mueller v allen 51 witters v washington department of services for the blind 52 and zobrest v catalina f oothills school district 53 in each of these cases the central question for the court was whether the aid was distributed on re ligionneutral basis and whether the beneficiaries had true pr ivate choice about whet her to use the aid at religious or secular schools54 applying the precedent to the cleveland program the court held that ohios program provided educational assistance di rectly to broad class of individuals defined without reference to religion ie any parent of schoolage child who resides in the cleveland school district55 and therefore according to the chief justice was consistent with the previous cases as program of true private choice in elk grove unified school district v newdow 56 commonly referred to as the pledge of allegiance case the courts majority opinion did not directly address the merits of the case choosing instead to fo cus on mr newdows standing to challenge the school districts po licy in federal court57 the chief justice along with justices

recognition of our nations religious history and character58 given the long history of public recognition of god for the chief justice the only remaining question was whether the recitation on the pledge impermissibly coerced religious act59 important to this point is the fact that under the challenged california state law the recitation remained voluntary and therefore could not be considered coercive religi ous act such as was found in lee v weisman the chief justice was unwilling to find that the phras under god could be reasonably seen as religious act thus according to his opinion it ca nnot possibly lead to the establishment of religion or anything like it60 in van orden v perry 61 the court was presented with monument of the ten commandments displayed on the grounds of the texas state capitol an establishment clause challenge seeking removal of the monument was brought by an attorney who frequently encountered it as he was traveling to and from the capitol grounds the chief justice writing for hims elf and three other justices began his analysis as in newdow by citing numerous examples of official acknowledgment by all three branches of government of the role of religion in american life and noting that recognition of the role of g od in our nations heritage has also been reflected in its decisions62 the chief justices opinion found that ac knowledgments of the role played by the ten commandments in our nations he ritage are common throughout america and cited numerous places where the co mmandments can be found on government buildings throughout washington dc63 while he acknowledged that the ten commandments are and remain inherently religious the chief justice noted that simply having religious content or prom oting message consistent with religious doctrine does not run afoul of the establishment clause64 chief justice rehnquist distinguished this case from stone v graham 65 which struck down kentucky stat ute requiring the posting of privately purchased copy of the ten commandments on the wall of each public school classroom in the state by making distinction between religious displays in classroom context and the more passive display of

absence of the particular concerns that arise in the context of public elementary and secondary schools coupled with the fact that the petitioner had walked past the monument for number of years before bringing the lawsuit the chief justice determined th at the monument in question was different from the texts that confronted elem entary school students every day in stone 67 thus the chief justice held that the monumen t in question had dual significance partaking of both religion and government and therefore its inclusion among the monuments on the capitol grounds did not violate the establishment clause68 chief justice rehnquist also joined dissent in the other ten commandments case of his final term mccreary county v aclu of kentucky69 in mccreary the court held that displays of the ten co mmandments in kentucky county courthouses violated the establishment clause this dissent authored by justice scalia70 was broadbased attack on the c ourts establishment clause jurisprudence

against executing 16 and 17yearolds and arguing against reliance on indicia of consensu s other than statutes and the behavior of prosecutors and juriesdecision73 further as the verbal requireme nts of miranda may not have been constitutionally required but were rather prophylactic measure to protect underlying rights an argument could be made that congress had the authority to amend the requirements nonetheless in dickerson v united states 74 when the court considered the constitutionality of 18 us c 3501 statute which in essence reversed miranda and made the admissibility of confessions turn solely on whether they were made voluntarily chief justi ce rehnquist wrote an opinion invalidating the statute in the opinion he noted that despite the invitation of the court in miranda for the legislature to develop other methods of ensuring the voluntariness of confessions that the cong ress had merely sought to overturn the original ruling which was held to be beyond th power of congress to accomplish75 chief justice rehnquist also dissented from the courts ma jor decisions limiting application of capital punishment for pers ons of diminished capacity the chief justice consistently favored reliance on two categories of objective criteria the work product of legislatures and sentencing jury determinations76 to determine what is cruel and unusual and di sfavored reliance on foreign law or the justices own views in ford v wainwright 77 which held that the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment prohibits state from executing someone who is insane and that florida s procedures authorizing the governor to make the determinati on fell short of due process ju stice rehnquist dissented on the basis that there was common law tradition of leaving such issues to executive clemency78 few years later chief justice rehnquist voted with the majority in holding that the eighth amendment does not prohibit execution of the mentally retarded79 and that states likewise are not prohibited from executing persons who were 16 or 17 years of age at the time they committed their offenses80 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33066crs13 81 justice scalias dissent in atkins objected to the arrogance he viewed as underlying the courts assertion that in the end our own judg ment will be brought to bear on the question of the acceptability of the death penalty 536 us at 348 justice scalia was again vehement on the subject in simmons the real driving force of the decision is the courts own judgment if the court is going to re ly on evolving standards of decency it should not prescribe those standards but instead should discern them from the practices of our people 125 s ct at 1221 1222 82 536 us at 322 83 536 us at 324 84 the

reversed its field holding in 2002 in atkins v virginia that national consensus had devel oped against execution of the mentally retarded and holding in 2005 in roper v simmons that such consensus had developed against execution of juveniles under the age of 18 chief justice rehnquist maintained his position in dissent each time he joined broadbased dissents by justice scalia challenging the courts own evaluation of the issue as well as its finding that national consensu s had developed81 and in atkins he added his own dissent writing separately to object to the courts reliance on foreign laws the views of professional and religious organizations and opinion polls82 the chief justice explained that statutes and sentencing jury determinations are the only objective indicia of contemporary values firmly supported by our precedents but more importantly that these democratic institutions are better suited than courts to evaluating and giving effect to the complex societal and moral considerations that inform the selection of publicly accepta ble criminal punishments83 property rights and fifth amendment takings chief justice rehnquist frequently favored the side of the property owner in the fifth amendment takings cases84 decided by the court most often joined by justices scalia and thomas in the seminal case of first english evangelical lutheran church v county of angeles 85 for example he wrote for the majority that when the government is found by c ourt to have taken pr operty through severe regulation of its use the government has the option of rescinding the regulation but must still pay for the temporary taking while the regulation was in effect and in dolan v city of tigard 86 he wrote for the majority th at to avoid being taking an exaction condition

invigorating depressed economy was public use satisfying the takings clause even though the property might be turned over to private developers the majority opinion was based on century of supreme court decisions holdi ng that the term public use in the takings clause must be read broadly to mean for public purpose in this instance revitalization of the local economy the dissenters howev er argued that even broad reading of public use does not extend to privatetoprivate transfers solely to improve the tax base and create jobs in strong language justice oconnor joined by rehnquist and others declared that under the banne r of economic development the majority opinion makes all private property vulnera ble to being taken and transferred to another private owner so long as it might be upgraded the kelo decision has triggered legislative proposals in most of th state legislatures and in congress aimed at discouraging or prohibiting the us of condemnation solely for economic development affirmative action one of the most contentious areas of affirmative action has been in the area of preference in admissions of educational institutions over quarter century ago the supreme court issued an opinion in the case of regents of the university of california v bakke88 controlling concurrence by justice powell in that case concluded that the attain ment of diverse student body is constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education noting that the atmosphere of speculation experiment and creation so essentia l to the quality of higher education is widely belie ved to be promoted by diverse student body89 subsequently many colleges and universities established affirmative action policies in grutter v bollinger 90 five justice majority of the justices held that the university of michigan law school had compelling interest in the educational benefits that flow from diverse student body which justified its consideration of race in admissions to assemble criti cal mass of underrepresented minority students however in the companion case of gratz v bollinger 91 authored by chief justice rehnquist six justices decided that the universitys policy of awarding racial bonus points to minority applicants was not narrowly tailore d enough to pass constitutional scrutiny chief justice rehnqui st noted that justice powells opinion called for evaluating an individuals ability to contribute to student body in the unique setting of higher edu cation chief justice rehnquist interpreted this to mean that individualized consideration of divers characteristics was permissible but that automatic assignment of poi nts to members of an underrepresented minority group was not of particular cern was that the number of points assigned would ensure that virtually every minimally qualified minority applicant would be admittedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33066crs15 92 457 us 307 1982 93 estelle v gamble 429 us 97 103 1976 94 489 us 189 1989 95 this cases is now settled law as illustrated by the courts opinion in town of castle rock v gonzales 125 s ct 2796 2005ultimately the court concluded that there were limits on what procedures university could employ to achieve its desired goal of diversity fourteenth amendment over the years the supreme court s recognized increased responsibilities of the state governments to protect certain of their citizens for instance in youngberg v romeo 92 the supreme court held that an individual who was involuntarily committed to state institution for the mentally retarded had constitutionally protected liberty interest in safety freedom of movement and training within the institution and that the state was within limits required to protect such rights similarly the court has noted that pris oner has liberty interest in receiving medical care since it is the only entity in position to provide those services93 in the case of deshaney v winnebago county department of social service94 child who had been the subject of numer ous investigations by local department of social service because of suspicions th at he had been abused was severely beaten by his father suit was brought against the department alleging that since the state had undertaken to protect joshua from this danger the state acqui red an affirmative duty enforceable through the due process clause the argument was made that based on this special rela tionshipfailure to discharg this duty was actionable the supreme court took the case to resolv split in the circuits chief justice rehnquist wrote an opinion noting that previ ous findings of special relationships had been based on the state having confined or otherwise restricted the actions of an individual however the harm suffered by th is child occurred not while he was in the states custody but while he was in the cust ody of his natural father the state played part in the creation of the danger nor did it do anything to render the child more vulnerable to them consequently chief justice rehnquist found that the state had constitutional duty to protect joshua95
