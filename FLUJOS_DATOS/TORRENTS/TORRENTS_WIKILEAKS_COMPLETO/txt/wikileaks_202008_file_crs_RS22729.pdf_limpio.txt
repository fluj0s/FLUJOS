deteriorating balance sheet outstanding imf credit has decreased from peak of 82 billion in 1999 to 204 billion in 2006 over half of which is lent to turkey1 these are the lowest loan levels the imf has seen in 25 years2 many of the imfs middleincome and developing country borrowers including thailand russia argentina and brazil have been repaying their imf loans early these early payments may also signal that with the emergence of new class of creditor nations including china and many persian gulf countries developing country borrowers longer view imf loans as attractive furthermore some prefer not to put themselves in position where they must take the imfs policy advice as condition for access to imf loans total imf resources at the end of may 2007 were 340 billion of which 248 billion were usable resources however the imf possesses only small portion of this total therefore it cannot invest money from its quota resources in order to raise money to fund its operations 3 with decline in lending has come decline in operating revenue with the imf reporting small shortfall in its fy2007 budget compounding the imfs fiscal challenges many emerging market economies are rapidly accumulating central bank reserves in order to avoid having to borrow from the imf in the future table 1 additionally were major financial crisis to occur it is unclear how effective the imf would be in shoring up the financial markets ev ery day over 2 trillion changes hands in world currency markets in the 1970s and earlier the imf could loan countries enough money to defend their currencies against shortterm speculative pressure most experts agree that the imf could longer do this today and if it were to lend 30 bi llion to medium size country to help it defend its currency against widespread perceptions that it was overvalued the money from the imf loan would be lost very quickly and the country would be forced to devalue anyway 4 experts generally agree that the imf must now work with market forces rather than against them if it wishes to help countries deal with currency or balance of payments crises t able 1 ratio of reser v to impor ts of goods and ser vices 199 9 200

its member countries and it relends that money to its own borrower countries repayments from imf borrowers are used to repay countries for quota resources used countries pay the imf interest for their loans and the imf pays interest to the countries whose quotas are used the difference in these interest rates produces the income the imf currently uses to fund its operations 4 see for example

g11g15g8g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561 to stimulate discussion on possible reform options former imf managing director rodrigo rato convened committee of eminent persons to examine the imfs income model headed by andrew crockett former head of the bank for international settlements the committee also included former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and former european central bank president jean claude trichet current imf managing director dominique strauss kahn is expected to introduce reform proposals during 2008 as the crockett report illustrates the imfs income derives largely from single sourcethe difference between the rate the imf charges when it lends and the rate the imf pays countries for use of their quota resources this creates perverse situation where according to mr crockett when the world economy is not doing well and the fund has to lend in crisis situations it is well furnished with resources when the fund is successful in stabilizing the global economy then it is short of resources 5 g22g145g142g561g5g155g152g140g148g142g157g157g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g20g142g140g152g150g150g142g151g141g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 the committee released its report on january 31 20076 the report made several recommendations to provide sufficient financing for the imfs three major functions 1 providing source of shortterm finance for countries suffering from balance of payments crises 2 providing public good of surveillance of the international economy and 3 providing bilateral technical assistance to countries as they pursue marketoriented economic reform to meet these goals the committee recommends 1 revising the imfs investment operations 2 creating an endowment fund 3 charging sepa rately for imf services and 4 eliminating the imfs

imfs oversight and research functions through periodic levy on member nations due to fear that this would overly politicize the imfs activities according to the committee subjecting the funds administrative expenditure to national budgetary procedures might indirectly threaten the independence of the funds policy advice7 the committee made two recommendations regarding the imfs existing investment options 1 broaden the imfs investment mandate for existing reserves by extending portfolio duration beyond the current 13 year benchmark index and expand the types of financial instruments that the imf is allowed to invest and 2 use quota resources subscribed by member countries to invest in marketable securities the committee also recommended that the imf create an endowment fund through the sale of 129 million ounces of gold held in its reserves gold sales have been used in the past to generate income in 1957 for example gold was sold to create special reserve to cover fund losses incurred early in its existence between 1976 and 1980 50 million ounces were sold by public auction to fund special loans to lowincome countries g11g15g8g561g9g152g149g141g561 the imf holds 1034 million ounces of gold in reserves valued at around 9501 billion at current market prices 8 the imf acquired virtually all of this gold through four types of transactions first before they were revised in 1978 the imf articles of agreement required that 25 percent of countrys quota subscriptions was to be paid in gold this was the largest source of imf gold second all payments of charges ie interest on members use of imf credit were originally made in gold third member wanting to obtain the currency of another member could do so by selling gold to the imf south african gold sales between 1970 and 1971 for example were the main such source of gold fourth members could use gold to repay the imf for previously extended imf credit in 1978 imf members adopted an amendment to the articles of agreement allowing each country to determine its own exchange rate system the amendment officially severed the link between currency and gold imf member countries were prohibited from defining the value of their currency in terms of gold and the imf was prohibited from lending gold or defining its assets in terms of gold countries could use any exchange rate system other than using gold as base for defining the value of their currencies prior imf approval of exchange rate changes would longer be required since the 1978 amendment the use of gold in the imfs operations has been severely limited if an 85 percent majority approves the imf may sell gold outright on the basis of prevailing market prices it may also accept gold in the discharge of members obligations using the market price at the time of acceptance all other transactions such as gold purchases loans leases swaps or use of gold as collateral are prohibited in 1995 the imf executive board undertook review of the role of gold in the imf in post gold standard international economy following this review there was broad agreement from members of the imf executive board that the imfs policy on gold should be governed by several principles including 7 ibid p 8 8 the price of gold on january 28 2008 was 91888 per ounce see httpgoldpriceorg

strength to its balance sheet any mobilization of imf gold should avoid weakening its overall financial position and the imf should continue to hold relatively large amount of gold among its assets not only for prudential reasons but also to meet unforeseen9 contingencies g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 in the past proposals to sell imf gold reserves have been unpopular among some members of congress some have argued that there is potential lack of imf transparency some claim that the gold held by the imf belongs to the member nations and it is not the imfs place to propose gold sales to fund current operating expenses some also claim that gold sales have the potential to weaken the global price of gold and the effect on the imf balance sheet is unclear in the late 1990s limited goldsales were proposed to finance the imfs initial contribution to the heavily indebted poor countries hipc initiative due to the concerns raised above the clinton administration and several members of congress strongly objected to these plans and compromise was reached at the september 1999 imf annual meetings which authorized off market transactions in gold of up to 14 million ounces to help finance imf participation in the hipc program between december 1999 and april 2000 transactions involving total of 129 million ounces of gold were carried out between the imf and two members brazil and mexico that had financial obligations to the imf gold was sold at the market price and profits were placed in special imf hipc account at the same time the imf accepted back the gold sold to brazil and mexico in settlement of their financial obligations to the bank the result was that the balance of the imfs holdings of physical gold remained unchanged although its usable resources shrank 10 under article v sec 12 of the imfs articles of agreement approval of gold sales by the imf requires an 85 percent imf voting majority the united states has almost 17 percent vote and could thus block any sale of imf gold understanding this virtual veto congress in 1999 enacted legislation in the fy 2000 consolidated appropriations act that authorized the united states to vote at the imf in favor of limited sale of imf gold to fund the imfs participation in hipc debt cancellation however the act requires the explicit consent of congress before the executive branch can support any future gold sales 11 prior to the adoption of this law the requirement for congressional agreement was less clear in 1976 congress approved legislation section 3 of pl

membership of the fund12 subsequently congress approved section 4 a1 of pl 95147 which stated in part 9 see gold in the imf factsheet international monetary fund httpwwwimforgexternalnpexrfactsgoldhtm 10 the imf may hold gold as an asset but it cannot lend gold nor can it use gold as security for borrowing funds the transactions in 1999 shifted money out of the imfs general resources account into special fund for hipc debt cancellation to offset this deduction the imf revalued some of its gold by an equal amount see jonathan sanford imf gold and the world banks unfunded hipc mandate

the establishment of any additional trust fund whereby resources of the international monetary fund would be used for the special benefit of single member or of particular segment of the membership of the fund13 were these provisions of law still in effect the secretary of the treasury might arguably be able to support sale of imf gold for the purpose of establishing trust fund if the proceeds would benefit the whole membership of the fund as might be the case with the present proposal for sale that would help offset imf operating expenses with the passage of the 1999 law however that option is not possible and an act of congress is required before the administration can support any sale of imf gold the crockett panel also proposed in addition to gold sales that the imf should augment its income through more aggressive investment program the imf would borrow money from its member countries by drawing on their quota resources to fund these investments the sale of gold and the use of quota resources were not posed as alternatives nevertheless it could be argued that if gold is not sold to fund the proposed endowment plan more quota resources will be needed to fund the investment program questions might be raised about this use of quota resources first the imfs quota resources were originally intended to finance the imfs loan operations not to subsidize its administrative costs their use for the latter purpose deserves careful consideration second only the countries with strong currencies are likely to be asked to prov ide permanent lowcost loans to the imf for this purpose as the imf deliberates on the crockett report recommendations congress may wish to consider the following questions in anticipation of potential request to authorize the sale of portion of imf gold reserves 1 are gold sales desirable compared to the other alternatives for raising revenue 2 if gold sales are not authorized should the imf fund its new investment plan by borrowing quota resources from the united states and other countries with strong currencies without also asking other countries to bear some of the costs 3 how should the united states raise the moneybe it onbudget or offbudgetto finance its share of the investment plan 4 will the imf be more effective if it is autonomously financed rather than being dependent solely on income from its loan operations to fund in its administrative budget in particular will the imf be more effective in the exercise of its surveillance and its other economic oversight functions if these activities are funded autonomous ly through an endowment or investment plan alternatively some in congress might wish to reconsider the raison detre of the imf in an international economy marked by rapidly growing emerging market reserves and capital flows from the emerging to the developed countries the funds three current functionscrisis lending technical assistance and surveillance of the international monetary systemmight be reoriented within the imf or allocated to other institutions to better reflect the new reality for example the imfs function as lender of last resort could be performed by regional reservepooling arrangements such as that developed in asia under the chiang mai initiative or through enhanced functions of the bank for international settlement the funds technical assistance functions could be provided by the multilateral development banks renewed imf could focus on its member countries economic policies and on surveillance of the international exchange rate and monetary systems such reforms will likely be on the imfs agenda over the next several years 13 pl 95147 bill to authorize the secretary of the treasury to invest public moneys
