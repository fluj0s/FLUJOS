protect human health with an adequate margin of safety after years of litigation and other delays epa is implementing the naaqs for pm25 promulgated in 1997 this report outlines the impleme ntation process for the 1997 pm25 naaqs and describes issues raised as epa and st ates develop impleme ntation strategies the epas final designation of 38 areas consisting of 205 counties in 20 states and the district of columbia as nonattainment out of compliance areas for the 1997 pm25 naaqs became effective in april 2005 comb ined population of almost 90 million resides in these areas states with pm25 nonattainment areas are required to develop comprehensive impleme ntation plans referred to as state implementation plans sips demonstratin g how attainment will be reached by designated deadline sips include polluti on control measures that rely on models of the impact on air quality of projected emission reductions to demonstrate attainment states were required to submit sips for the 1997 pm25 naaqs by april 2008 but epa did not begin receiving most of them until july 2008 states must be in compliance by 2010 unless they are granted an extension number of issues will continue to be debated as the implementation of the 1997 pm25 naaqs progresses the us court of appeals for the dc circuits july 11 2008 decision north carolina v epa to vacate the clean air interstate rule cair could further delay implementation which s heightened interest in congress cair was expected to assist states in addressing upwind emission contributions for achieving attainment of the 1997 pm25 naaqs in addition other epa rulemakings promulgated and proposed that influence various aspects of regulating air quality could affect the pm25 naaqs implementation process epas april 25 2007 final pm25 implementation rule to provide guidance and procedures for establishing controls to achieve and maintain attainment has raised concerns six petitions for review of the rule were filed with the dc circuit and two petitions for reconsideration have been filed with epa additionally as required under the caa epa reviewed the pm25 and pm10 naaqs and on october 17 2006 promulgated final revisions that included strengthening of the 1997 pm25 standard pending judicial actions regarding the 2006 pm naaqs could affect implementation of the 1997 pm25 naaqs as implementation of the 1997 naaqs move s forward its effects on states and tribes will be continued issue of interest to congress many questions and concerns remain including whether special provisi ons can be made for meeting attainment

regulate emissi on sources directly rather they define the level of pollution in am bient outdoor air above which health and welfare effects occur the statute requires that based on review of the scientific literature the environmental protection agency epa set 1 primary standards at level requisite to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety and 2 secondary standards at level r equisite to protect the public welfare2 naaqs have been promulgated for six prin cipal pollutants classified by epa as criteria pollutants sulfur oxides meas ured in terms of sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen dioxide no2 carbon monoxide co ozone lead and particulate matter this report provides an ove rview of the naaqs impleme ntation process in the context of the 1997 standards for fine

as result of the courts decision regarding cair could re sult in some stakeholders advocating moving directly to impleme ntation of the 2006 standards geographical area designation process the naaqs designation process35 the designation of geographical areas failing to comply with the n aaqs based on monitoring and analysis of relevant air quality data is critical step in naaqs implementation the caa establishes pr ocess for designating nonattainment areas and setting their boundaries but it allows th epa administrator some discretion in determining what the final boundaries of th areas will be areas are identified as nonattainment when they violate or c ontribute to the viol ation of naaqs areas are identified as attainmentunclassified36 when they meet the standard or when the data are insufficient for determining compliance with the naaqs37 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32431crs7 38 though not required to do so tribes have been encouraged to submit recommendations the area designation requirements under the c aa section 107 are specific with respect to states but not to tribes the epa follows the same designation process for tribes per sections 110o and 301d of the caa and pursuant to the 1988 tribal authority rule which specifies that tribes shall be treated as states in selected cases 40 cfr part 49 for information regarding tribes that have participated in the pm25

7407 the statute states that the governor of each state shall sub mit list to epa of all areas in the state designating as nonattainment any area that does not meet or that contributes to ambient air quality in nearby area that does not meet an air quality standard emphasis added following state and tribal designation submissions the epa administrator has discretion to make modifications includi ng to the area boundaries as required by statute section 107d1bii the agency must notify the states and tribes regarding any modifications allowing them suffi cient opportunity to demonstrate why proposed modification is ina ppropriate but the final dete rmination rests with epa 1997 pm25 naaqs designation process pm25 attainment or nonattainment designations we re made primarily on the basis of threeyear federally referenced pm25 monitoring data39 at the time the pm25 naaqs were being finaliz ed in 1997 epa began developing methods for monitoring fine particles using funding specifically authorized for this purpose in fy1998fy 2000 epa appr opriations40 the agency worked closely with states and tribes to initiate the deployment of portion of the network of 1200 monitors in january 1999 the majority of the monitors were not in place until january 2000 states and tribes were expected to re ly on data collected during 20002002 for their recommendations the epa considered the 20012003 data to make the final pm25 designations published in january 2005 in its guidance document41 epa identified several factors that would be considered in determining attainment with the 1997 pm25 naaqs and specified data and conditions that would not be accepta ble the epas nonbinding guidance also included recommendation that states and tribes consider using the same boundaries for nonattainment for both the pm25 and eighthour ozone st andards to facilitatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32431crs8 42 map showing the final designation areas for pm25 and for the eighthour ozone naaqs is available on epas website at httpwwwepagovoaroaqpsgreenbkmappm 25o3html 43 as defined by the office of management budget for more information on metropolitan areas see httpwwwcensusgovpopulationwwwestimatesaboutmetrohtml 44 for epas final and proposed pm25 geographical designation recommendations and those from individual states and tribes see httpwwwepagovpmdesignationsconsistency in future implementation plans the epa expected that many of the pm25 nonattainment areas would overlap with the eighthour ozone designations42 however pm25 designations do not include nonatta inment classifications based on severity as specified by statute for pm10 and ozone which ve two and seven classifications respectively pm25 is governed by the general nonattainment planning requirements of t itle i part and part d subpart 1 of the act the epa recognized that determining th geographic extent of nearby source areas that contribute to nonattainment would be complicated the caa does not specifically require combining neighborin g counties within th same nonattainment area but it does require the use of metropo litan statistical area boundaries in the more severely polluted areas section 107d4a iv echoing this requirement and similar to the eighthour ozone appro ach epa recommended that metropolitan statistical areas or consolidated metropolitan statistical areas43 serve as the presumptive boundary for nonattainment areas under the 1997 pm25 standards metropolitan areas are generally treated as units even when part of the area lies in separate state or does not have readings exceeding the standards in the latter case even though specifi c county may not exceed the standards the pollution generated there is likely to influence pm25 levels elsewhere in the metropolitan area in addition including the entire metropolita n area avoids the creation of additional incentives for sprawl development on the fri nges of urban areas for rural areas in violation of the 1997 pm25 standards epas guidance pr esumed that the full county would be designated nonattainment area the epa has generally used its discre tion to expand the size of nonattainment areas or to combine areas that state listed as separate areas into single larger unit as it did in implementing other naaqs ep also combined nonattainment counties across state lines into the same nonattainment area if the counties are part of the same metropolitan area although according to epa staff in the regions and the agencys office of air quality planning and standards were available for assistance and consultation throughout the designa tion process pursuant to the statutory requirements for working with states some states disagreed with epas final designations relative to th states own recommendations 1997 pm25 area designations timeline by the end of february 2004 18 states and the district of columbia had recommended 142 counties as potential nonattainment areas for the 1997 pm25 naaqs44 after reviewing the state recomme ndations epa proposed modificationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32431crs9 45 included seven cities baltimore md st louis mo alexandria va fairfax va falls church va manassas va and manassas park va 46 the epa designates an area as attainment unclassifiable if 1 monitored air quality data show that the area has not violated the standa rd during threeyear period or2 there is not enough information to determin the air quality in the area despite the caa section 107d1a definitions for nonattainment attainment and unclassifiable epa does not apply the attainment nomenclature it is generally the case that the agency has sufficient data to determine that an area is not in nonattainment but the data are insufficient or incomplete to fully determine attainment 47 the epa concluded that there was insuffici ent information to designate these areas as either nonattainment or attainmentunclassifi able according to the january 2005 federal register notice 70 federal registe r 65984 these areas had violating monitors for years 20002002 but incomplete data or other data issues for years 20012003resulting in nonattainment signations for 244 counties45 in 21 states and the district of columbia at the end of june 2004 as required by statute epa notified each of the affected states regarding their specific modifications providing them with the opportunity to sub mit new information and demonstrate why proposed modification was inappropriate so states responding to epa s proposal continued to support their original recommendations the epas final pm25 designation rule published on january 5 2005 70 federal register 9441019 established the boundaries for areas designated as nonattainment unc lassifiable data not sufficien t to make determination regarding compliance or attainmentunclassifiable46 the epa designated 47 areas composed of 225 counties in 20 stat and the district of columbia as nonattainment 5 areas consisting of 7 counties as unclassifiable47 and the remaining counties in the united states as attainmentunclassifiable the epas designations reflected minor modifications to its june 2004 proposal primarily 19 counties were removed from the list of nonattainment areas and other counties were redefined by designating only specified locations partial within the county as nonattainment in some cases when considering factors defined in its guidance in conjunction with the additional information provided by the states and tribes epa determined that only those portions of county that contained the significant sources of emissions should be considered as contributing to the violations in other cases the agency determined that if emissions from large identifiable source in county contribute to the violations in nearby area the portion of the county where the source is cated would be designated nonattainment even if it is not contiguous with the re mainder of the designated area the boundaries for these noncontiguous portions are based on legally recognized government boundaries such as township s tax districts and census blocks some states and stakeholde rs continued to contend th at several counties should not be designated nonattain ment particularly when taking into account 2004 pm25 monitoring data the epas final designa tions were based on monitoring data for the threeyear period from 20012003 monito ring data for 2004 were not available in time for epa to meet its statutory deadline for pm25 geographical area

pollution from upwi nd areas is one of the more frequently raised issues in nonattainment areas unlik the larger coarse particles which generally settle more rapidl and fall near their source of emission the smaller pm25 particles frequently remain in the atmosphere longer and can travel significant distances from their original source the transport of pm25 can contribute to and in some cases can be the primary cause of nonattainment in areas downwind of an emission source subpart 1 of the caa allows epa to classify the area for the purpose of applying an attainment date and to consider such factors as the availability and feasibility of pollution control measures as referenced in the proposed pm25 implementation rule areas also may pe tition the agency under 126 of the caa to impose

address pollution from upwind sources others mostly individual utilities contended that the rules emission budgets would disproportionally ffect certain opera tions and facilities the dc circuit found

these states and the district constitute the region covered under cairs annual nox and so2 caps based on air quality analyses in support of the cair epa predicted that 17 of 36 areas in the eastern united st ates designated as nonattainment out of compliance with the 1997 pm25 naaqs would reach attainment by 2010 as result of implementing cair in conjunction with other ex isting national programs82 on the other hand the epa analyses recognized that as many as 19 of the areas would remain in nonattainment highlighting the importance of local and state emission reduction efforts the

complementing the trading programs states had been working to put implementing rules in place and some in the regulated community had been going forward with investing in equipment for cair the courts decision regarding cair presents major setback to the implementation of the 1997 pm25 and ozone naaqs epas director of atmospheric programs tes tified before congress that in many cases states in the cair region have relied heavily on the emission reductions required by cair as they c onducted their modeling to show that they will meet the 1997 ambient air quality standards on time these attainment demonstration components of the sips will likely need to be revised to show how the states will achieve the emission re ductions previously required by cair85 the vacating of cair means that sips from downwind states may be inadequate because they assumed the cair reductions in interstate transport of pollutants sips from upwind states on the other hand could be inadequate if they do not prevent downwind nonattainment the caa makes clear that states are to impose controls on stationary sources of pollution that contribute significantly to downwind nonattainment or inte rfere with the maintenan ce of air quality standards in other states 110a2d this provision of the statute has been widely disregarded in the past with little epa effort other than regional capandtrade programs to address it this reluctance to act can be challenged through caa 126 petitions and the courts decision puts the focus on these petitions as the available means of addressing interstate transport of air pollutants in the immediate future as discussed previously epa has neve r granted 126 petition in the manner outlined by the statute on august 8 2008 the state of north carolina petitioned the dc

cair case notes that downwind states retain their statutory right to petition for immediate relief from unlawful interstate po llution under section 12686 court finding in favor of north carolinas 126 petition might therefore bring on numerous 126 petitions from other states on august 11 2008 epa and in terveners motioned the dc circuit to hold in abeyance the case regarding the denial of north

resources fense council nrdc the national mining association and the utility air regulatory group in separate petitions granting reconsideration or rehearing banc is unusual and success is especially unlikely given that the initial north carolina v epa decision was unanimous and appeared to give the court little pause granting rehearing requires the vote of majority of the active duty judges on

deadlines are fast approaching for stat in nonattainment to submit sips and reach attainment of the 1997 pm25 and ozone naaqs it is also unclear whether the agency can salvage the regional capandtrade

these challenges could affect the current implementation schedule for the 1997 pm25 naaqs congressional action related to particulates naaqs implementation concerns regarding the potential impacts of the ozone and particulate standards have led to several attempts by congress over the years to modify the implementation requirements100 attempts in recent years were generally attached to larger pieces of legislation such as the energy101 and transportation bills as well the proposed multi pollutant clear skies bills to reduce emissions from coalfired power

dc circuits july 11 2008 decision north carolina v epa that would vacate the clean air interstate rule cair106 epa projected that cair in conjunction with other federal measures such as recent auto

epas predictions regarding the relative magnitude of the emission reductions associated with exis ting and proposed air quality controls the vacating of cair is seen as significantly hampering downwind states ability to achieve emission reductions nd compliance with the 1997 pm25 and ozone naaqshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32431crs25 cair has been viewed as the linchpin that held together the administrations strategy for improving air quality through not only the attainment of the ozone and fine particulate naaqs but also by achievi ng reductions in mercury emissions from coalfired powerplants by addressing re gional haze impacts from powerplants and by responding to state petitions to c ontrol upwind sources of ozone and fine particulate pollution under 126 of the caa the courts decision that would vacate cair presents all stakeholders with complicated task as advised by epa guidance many sips for demonstr ating attainment of the 1997 pm25 naaqs already submitted or nearing completion have relied on emission reductions required by cair these sips will have to be revised and downwind states may have to rely on provisions in 126 of the caa to ddress interstate transport of pm25 unless the intent of cair can some how otherwise be revived time is in short supply for states nd cities in nonattainme nt although epa and others have requested rehearing bl anc of the july 2008 decision whether the court would grant such rehearing is in stion whatever the outcome and courses of action taken deadlines for states to submit their sips for 1997 pm25 naaqs have elapsed and deadlines for reaching attainment are looming given the most recent events and the potential for further delays in implementing the 1997 standards some have questioned whether moving direc tly to implementation of the revised particulates naaqs pr omulgated by epa in october 2006 should be considered however opponents contend that an appr oach relying on the schedule for the 2006 revised particulates naaqs would further lay the projected benefits of reducing exposures to pm25 in addition the 2006 revised pa rticulates naaqs have sparked their own controversies and have been challenged in the courts given that several key implementation milestones and attainment deadlines are nearing pm25 will likely remain an issue of considerable debate for many stakeholders and
