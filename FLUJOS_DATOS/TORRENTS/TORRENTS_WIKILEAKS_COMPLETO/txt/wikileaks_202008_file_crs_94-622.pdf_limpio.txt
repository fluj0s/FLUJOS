security raising the retirement age background and issues geoffrey kollmann domestic social policy division summary the social security full retirement age the age at which retired workers aged spouses or surviving aged spouses receive benefits that are not reduced for early retirement will gradually rise from 65 to 67 beginning with people who attain age 62 in 2000 ie those born in 1938 early re tirement benefits w ill still be available beginning at age 62 age 60 for aged wi dows and widowers but at lower levels to help solve social securitys long range financing problems it has been proposed that these ages be ra ised further bills introduced in the last five congresses would among other things accelerate the phasein of the increase in the full retirement age to 67 raise the early retirement age to 65 or 67 and raise the full retirement age to 69 or 70 this report will be updated to reflect any legislative developments background the original social security act of 1935 set the minimum age at which workers could receive social security retirement bene fits at 65 the reason for this choice is not clear but it is often said that age 65 was selected because it was used in most state oldage assistance plans and in many pension plans and foreign social insurance programs in 1956 congress lowered the minimum age to age 62 for women but also provided that benefits taken before age 65 would be permanently reduced to account for the longer period over which benefits would be paid th is actuarial reduction is 59 of 1 for each month benefits are received before ag 65 20 reduction at age 62 congress extended this early retirement provision to men in 1961 in 1972 congress set aged widowers benefits at 100 of the deceased workers benefit if elected at age 65 or later reduced widowers benefits c ould be elected as early as age 60 the reduction is 1940 of 1 per month 285 reduction at age 60 beginning in the mid1970s raising the retirement age was studied by several advisory panels the initial impetus for these studies was concern over projections of growing longrange deficits in the program major part of th problem reflected declining ratio of workers to retirees for ecasts showed that whereas little more than three workers were supporting each recipient then only two would do so in the next century it was argued that increasing the retirement age would offset this decline thushttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94622crs2 bolstering the financing of the program it also was argued that it would properly recognize the substantial increases in longev ity that had occurred and were projected to continue raising the full retirement age to 67 when congress enacted legislation in 1983 pl 9821 to solve social securitys financing problems it included provision that gradually will raise the full retirement age the age at which one receives unreduced benefits from age 65 to age 67 it does so in two steps first the full retirement age fra will increase by 2 months for each year that person is born after 1937 ie attains age 62 after 1999 until it reaches age 66 for those who were born in 1943 who attain age 62 in 2005 second it will increase again by 2 months for each year that person is born after 1954 ie attains age 62 after 2016 until it reaches age 67 for those who were born after 1959 who attain age 62 after 2021 early retirement st ill will be available but benefits will be lower eg the actuarial reduction in retirement benefits ultimately will be 30 instead of the presen t 20 at age 62 the age for full benefits for aged spouses and widowers likewise will rise to 67 1983 changes in the social security retirement age year of birth year age 62full retirement age yearmonth reduction at age 62 before 1938 before 2000 65 200 1938 2000

9821 was projected to balance social s ecuritys income and outgo over the next 75 years since 1983 social securitys financ ial picture has worsen ed under the latest best estimate of the social

ing the programs income and outgo over long periods 75 years by describing what porti on of taxable earnings they represent is more meaningful than using dollar amounts because th value of the dollar changes over time the systems longrange costs and income are projected to be 1559 and 1372 of taxable earnings respectively difference of 14 to restore actuarial balance revenues would have to be raised andor outgo reduced by the quivalent of 187 15591372 of taxable earningstaxable earnings1 said another way the programs expenditures are projected to exceed its income by 14 combined with grow ing concern about the cost of entitlement programs generally this longrange problem has renewed interest in examining changes in the retirement age arguments for raising the retirement age advocates of raising the retirement age point out that life expectancy has improved significantly since social secu rity was enacted when bene fits were first paid in 1940 65yearold on average lived about 13 more years in 2002 65yearold is expected to live about 18 more years and it is proj ected that by 2030 65yearold will live 20 more years they cite these longevity increases as well as improvements in the health of the elderly as reasonable basis for encouraging workers to retire later also they highlight the savings it would produce accord ing to the social security administration raising the fra to 70 in 2029 would reduce longrange costs by about 6 proponents of raising the retirement age say th at it is an equitable way to control the programs costs because it would give the pe ople affected time to ad just their retirement plans they contrast this with cuts in benefits for current retirees such as restraints on cost of living increases that would impos the burden on elderly people who have few options for offsetting their losses it is argued that current workers would probably prefer change in the retirement age to which they could adjust by lengthening their work careers or by increasing savings to supplement social security to an increase in their social security taxes proponents portray ra ising the retirement age as unlike benefit cut because full benefits s till would be payable people ju st would receive them later arguments against raising the retirement age opponents of raising the retirement age say th at it is simply cut in benefits which would unfairly penalize workers who planned their retirement based on current law they aver that the burden would be concentrated on those unable to work until later ages because they are unemployed or work in ar duous occupations they maintain it would adversely affect those racial minorities that have relatively shorter life spans they dispute that increased longevity necessarily corresponds with ability to work at later ages people may be living longer but with more chronic illnesses and impairments opponents also disagree that it would be better to place the burden on current workers rather than current recipients they point out that todays retirees receive better deal from the program than will todays workers for example person who earned average wages and who retires at age 65 in 2000 recove rs the value of the retirement portion ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94622crs4 2 disability benefits are computed similarly to re tirement benefits but are calculated as if the worker attained the full retiremen t age in the year he or she became disabled thus if worker between the ages for early retirement and full retirement can qualify for disability the disability benefit can be significantly greater than the actu arially reduced retirement benefit for example if worker today could qualify for disability at age 62 his or her benefit would be 26 higher than if he or she received early retirement be nefits for people whose full retirement age will be 67 this difference would grow to 43his and his employers social security taxes plus interest in 17 years this payback time expands to 21 years for similar individual re tiring in 2020 also as social security is subject to the income tax only if recipients income is above certain thresholds the benefits of 68 of current recipients are ex empt from taxation as these thresholds are not indexed it is projected that eventually inflation will cause virtually all future social security recipients to pay tax on their bene fits furthermore oppone nts maintain that it would not necessarily be burdensome to ask current retirees to share in cutting costs especially if the measures are targeted on those with higher incomes finally opponents contend that raising the retirement age would raise costs for the social security disability program first it could increase the incentive for elderly workers to apply for disability rather than wait to attain more distant retirement age second if early retirement bene fits were still available at age 62 but subject to higher actuarial reductions they would become less attractive compared to disability benefits2 for more about raising the retirement age see gao report social security reform implications of raising the retirement age hehs99112 august 1999 for

security program however pl 103296 which made the social security administration independe nt in 1995 created permanent advisory board and abolished future advisory councilsproposals by the 19941996 advisory council on social security in january 1997 the last advisory council on social security3 issued report on recommendations to solve social securitys longrange financial problems although it split into three factions because it could not ag ree on single set of proposals two of the factions recommended that the increase in the fra to 67 in current law be accelerated so that it would be fully effective in 2016 instead of 2027 and indexed thereafter to increases in longevity one of these two factions also recommended that the early retirement age be raised in tandem with the fra until it reached age 65 where it would remain but with increased actuarial reduc tions as the fra continues to increase legislative proposals in the 105th congress s 321 gregg raised the fra and the early retirement age to 70 and 65 respectively by 2037 and by oneh alf month per year thereafter hr 2768 sanford raised the fra to 70 by 2037 in the same manner as s 825 in the 104th congress hr 2782

every 2 yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94622crs6 4 an appropriate actuarial reduction is that re quired so that the value of benefits over an average lifespan is the same regardless of when person retires because these reductions equalize the costs of early and later retirement if the early retirement age were raised in these examples there would be little or effect on so cial securitys
