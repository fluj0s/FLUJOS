art and practice of conducting ne gotiations between representatives of groups or states it usually refers to international diplomacy the conduct of international relations through professional diplomats with regard to issues of treaties trade war and peace economics and culture according to senator hagel diplomacy is not weakness but rather an essential tool in world affairs using it where possible to ratchet down the pressure of conflict and increase the leverage of strength 1 going back to benjamin franklin americas first diplomat and thomas jefferson americas first secretary of state the united states has engaged in diplomacy to represent america and further its interests around the world according to the henry l stimson center since 1945 the united states has conducted its foreign relations in the context of world that practiced what can be called classic diplomacy it was world in which governmenttogovernment relations were the principal activity world in which ambassadors and embassies were often nations only venue for expressing its national interests world in which heads of state met to discuss the great questions of the day it was world in short in which nations were more sovereign and independent actors than todays environment allows them to be on the cusp of the 21 st century2 many viewed the first term of the george w bush administration as not engaging in diplomacy often enough or as first line of action in implementing its foreign policy the administration gained the reputation in some quarters as conducting cowboy diplomacy or having goit alone approach to international relations the bush administration has responded to its critics by saying that the world is different place since september 11th and traditional diplomacy may not always be the right strategy3 diplomacy became more visible option in december 2006 when the iraq study group highlighted diplomacy in its recommendations and urged the administration to launch comprehensive new diplomatic offensive to deal with the problems of iraq and the region4 in early 2007 secretary rice seemed to shift the administrations iraq policy when she stated in testimony that the administration would engage in talks with syria and iran5 as transformational diplomacy continues to be implemented congress may opt to consider the implications it has for future funding requests changes to the foreign service system and its representation of us interests around the world the nature of the us foreign assistance program the reconstruction and stabilization initiative and ultimately how the proposal in its totality addresses us interests at issue is how the united states adjusts its diplomacy to address foreign policy demands for the 21st century 1 senator hagel speech

undergoing momentous transition affecting its very nature for indicators of this change they point to the end of the bipolar world of the cold war the changing nature of the nation state on which the existing international system is based the rise of new national power relationships as well as the growth in the number and the role of nonstate participants in the international arena these experts also note the impact that the changes in worldwide communications due to advances in technology have had on international relations for the united states to continue to lead in this world they argue it will have to make adjustments to how it operates and relates within the changing system and the new intense political aspirations causing these changes 6 even before the united states entered the 21st century however foreign affairs officials and experts were calling for reforms of the foreign affairs infrastructure foreign assistance and public diplomacy programs as well as the need to address the changing roles between the department of state state and the department of defense dod in foreign affairs according to then secretary of state madeleine albright in 1999 the past decade has witnessed transformation of the world political situation challenges such as transnational law enforcement global terrorism democracy building protection of the environment refugee issues and access to global markets and energy sources now compete with traditional security and political issues for policymakers attention these changes demand that we reexamine the nature and basic structure of our overseas presence 7

1990s several organizations and think tanks voiced concerns about the inadequacy of the us diplomatic infrastructure the department of states own report said that the united states overseas presence is near state of crisis and perilously close to the point of system failure8 experts called for the enhancement of the security of us posts and missions abroad the right sizing of these posts based upon us interests in particular country and continual readjustment as policy needs changed the improvement of training opportunities in terms of foreign language skills and jobrelated training and the modernization of communicationsinformation technology at the st ate department and its posts and missions abroad furthermore in 1999 congress reorganized the us foreign policy mechanism by eliminating

many foreign assistance experts have concluded that after six decades us foreign assistance lacks strategic coherence and accountability and needs major readjustments critics point out that us foreign assistance has been highly fragmented among the state department the us agency for international development usaid and approximately 20 other federal government agencies that have their own assistance programs 9 in looking at us foreign assistance allocations many observers conclude that application of us foreign aid has been neither strategic nor consistent further as early as 2002 the president bush called for change in the methodology of foreign assistance that looks not just at the resources spent but results achieved10 going beyond the use of traditional foreign assistance programs the bush administration began new initiatives such as the millennium challenge account the global hi vaids initiative ghai and the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar11

transfer of its functions to state some have contended that public diplomacy has become the weakest part of us foreign policy and is in need of significant reform 13 however it appears that while public diplomacy programs were becoming weaker the importance of public diplomacy quickly became apparent as the image and influence of the united states decreased around much of the world questions were raised as to whether the united states is losing the war of ideas and inspiration the government accountability office gao and others criticized states public diplomacy program for its general lack of strategic planning inadequate coordination of agency efforts problems with measuring performance and results and posts not 9 see crs report rl33420 foreign operations housestate foreign

concerns the 911 commission report said that the role of the department of state has diminished somewhat over the decades following the 1960s state came into the 1990s overmatched by the resources of other departments and with little support for its budget either in congress or in the pr esidents office of management and budget increasingly the embassies themselves were overshadowed by powerful regional commanders in chief reporting to the pentagon 15 since the 1990s with experience in somalia haiti bosnia and kosovo some concluded that calling on the military for nationbuilding placed heavy burden on these forces that were neither trained nor equipped for such assignments16 nevertheless us policy makers continued to turn to the military because there was civilian government organization with either the same resources or ongoing organizational and management experience required for complex reconstruction and stabilization situations many experts suggested that designated civilian office was needed those calling for new civilian organization believed winning war as opposed to winning the peace draws on different attitudes and training and that states role in nationbuilding needs to be more clearly defined g22g155g138g151g156g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g6g146g153g149g152g150g138g140g162g561 on january 18 2006 in speech at georgetown university in

transformational development program and the lack of transparency and consultation involved some proponents of development assistance have concerns about the proposal for example some are questioning whet her the dfa has sufficient authority to truly coordinate all us foreign assistance noting that dfa authority extends to only about 53 of the total governmentwide foreign aid funds 43 among the greatest concerns expressed by traditional supporters of development assistance is the continued importance of us development and humanitarian programs they ask about the meaning of phrase stated by acting dfa henrietta fore and others in the administration foreign assistance advances our foreign policy objectives44 these supporters of traditional development assistance question whether sustainable development and poverty alleviation as rationales for us foreign assistance are being replaced by national security and democracy promotion considerations as evidence those concerned point to the fact that earlier versions of the foreign assistance framework had reference to poverty alleviation the shifting of large amount of foreign assistance funds from development assistance da to the economic support fund esf in the administrations fy 2008 budget request and the overwhelming focus on the capacity of states and little reference to the well being of the poorest as evidence that longterm development was being subordinate d to shortterm strategic diplomatic goals 45 furthermore physically locating the dfa in the state department adds to their concerns of potential politicization of foreign assistance and diminishing of usaids role the administration counters that the emphasis on development continues and the changes in funding for da and esf was to make the distribution of these funds more easily identified in terms of the funding the needs of each country categories acknowledging criticism by the congress nongovernmental organizations and from usaid personnel in the field regarding the lack of transparency and consultation in developing these plans acting dfa fore said we are at the beginning of this important reform process not the end we must continually work to improve our reform and she expressed her commitment to an increased spirit of consultation and transparency 46 42 for full discussion of the secretarys transformational development

dr james zogby noted pollster and president of the arab american institute testified in early 2007 before two house foreign affairs subcommittees that arabs generally have favorable view of americans their values culture and products more often now though according to zogby it is bush administration policies that are negatively influencing their opinions of the united states he reports that while they express positive views regarding americans they overwhelmingly assert that they do not want us help in dealing with matters of internal reform or the propagation of americanstyle democracy in their countries 47 organizational and structural difficulties continue to impede the full implementation of public diplomacy within transformational diplomacy the government accountability office gao reports that there are too few public diplomacy officers they have insufficient time to do their work and many positions are filled by officers without the requisite language skills 48 further questions continue as to the appropriate balance between foreign service personnel posted abroad and limitations largely due to security concerns that impede them getting out to talk to local officials and citizens gao reports that in many cases the security requirements at overseas posts send an ancillary message that the united states is unapproachable and distrustful49 another concern developed with the establishmen t of the public diplomacy strategic framework the framework and the new implementing programs resulted in single message being provided to us officials as well as foreign audiences some public diplomacy experts are concerned that the top down approach is reflective of public relationsstyle approach to public diplomacy more suited to politics than foreign affairs50 some also raise the concern that public diplomacy is matter of persuasion and not onesided propaganda when the united states information agency existed there were ongoing debates between public diplomacy officers and political officers as to whether official speakers and official events should support only the party line or incorporate opposing ideas as well two retired usia public diplomacy foreign service officers explained the reaction to the usia pproach of providing diversity of views in our experience when foreign audiences heard us officials discussing policy they were attentive when usiasponsored academics respectfully differed with current policy the result from the audiences was unalloyed admiration for the courage of the us in showcasing free and open discussion

opening of apps the department of state in response to senator sarbanes question explained that states bureau of diplomatic security working with an inte rdepartmental working group studies the security needs of apps once post has identified potential site for an app and before it can be occupied states diplomatic security bureau will examine whether the proposed site meets security standards or is being modified and will soon meet security requirements if waiver of certain requirements is found to be necessary so that an app can be opened and staffed the secretary may make such

unaccompanied tours new personnel need to be found to staff those positions every year the secretary of state has the authority to assign qualified member of the foreign service to any position classified as foreign service position as the needs of the service may require54 she says however that she prefers to staff the positions on voluntary basis and currently both the hardship positions and other regular positions around the world are being filled with growing difficulty by foreign service personnel bidding for these positions since january 2005 the state department has made several changes to the personnel and assignment bidding systems changes include requ iring hardship tour before person can be considered for promotion to the senior foreign service and changing the bidding system itself so that hardshipdanger posts would have to be filled first however indicative of the difficulty of staffing posts especially in iraq the state department announced further changes to the bidding system in june 2007an unprecedented countryspecific assignment cycle for iraq 55 the iraq assignments would have to be filled before any of the other positions including other hardshipdanger posts for the 2008 assignment cycle the announcement further stated that if iraq was not fully staffed states human resource s bureau would hold the assignments of highly qualified individuals until the iraq staffing issue was resolved56 in addition staffing became stretched when congress did not provide the administration requested appropriations to fund additional generalist staffing positions in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 some also believe increased staffing levels called for by the global repositioning of the foreign service and transferring personnel slots to an increasing number of hardship assignments will only aggravate the staffing situation further57

thinks the character of regime is the fundamental issue of the current international politics as long as the supreme state characterized by the disappearance of the borders of states has not come it is reasonable to protect countrys sovereignty therefore the theory that in order to protect the us national security it denies other countrys sovereignty is an arbitrary logic as if it only let itself live but not others us democracy is not necessarily the prioritized choice for every country under the pretext of promoting democracy to intervene in other countrys domestic affairs us action will surely inflict boycott from various nations and peoples 59 g11g156g155g138g142g149g561 where the middle east is concerned the plan signifies change in attitude not in policy its call for many more

transform the posture of us diplomacy to focus more on promoting democratic and economic changes washington has apparently recognized the rapid changes in the global political environment and is now making preparations to cope with these changes but we are afraid that this usstyle democracy may not be applicable in the present day emerging world environment if this usstyle democracy cannot improve the lives of people of other countries this transformational diplomacy can only remain political slogan of us politicians it is only when the united states is able to reduce the 30 percent high unemployment rate in iraq we can see successful model of us democracy taking shape in the middle east 61 g11g151g141g152g151g142g156g146g138g561 indonesia is receiving extraordinary attention in

authority was requested from congress in 2007 at the state departments request congress considered but did not move forward bills to authorize the full implementation of the civilian response corps in the reconstruction and stabilization civilian management act of 2007 s 613hr 1084 as the proposal continues to be implemented increased transformational diplomacyrelated appropriations may be requested congress may so exercise its oversight responsibilities to monitor the effect that transformational diplomacy has on achieving foreign policy goals maintaining top quality foreign service and providing the best possible representation around the world some areas of consideration may include the following foreign service personnel and security issuesreports of personnel shortfalls at the department of state because of the staffing effects of iraq afghanistan and the new transformational diplomacy proposal and the lack of authority to expand the number of positions may need to be addressed in future appropriations and authorizations concern about adequate security may also need to be monitored as foreign service personnel are regularly posted to more difficult and dangerous assignments monitoring the impact of transformational diplomacy on foreign service morale recruitment and attrition may be required to maintain strong and effective diplomatic representation of

transformational diplomacywhile many foreign policy experts generally agree that the world has changed and diplomacy must change with it experts and foreign governments have raised concerns about specific aspects of the administrations proposal secretary rice said that transforming our diplomacy and transforming the state department is the work of generation 64 if transformational diplomacy is perceived as negatively affecting us interests around the world the next administration may rethink or replace it it is unclear how flexible the plan is and how diffic ult in terms of financial and human resource costs this plan may be to adjust or replace transformational diplomacy still does not address states organizational structure which was never fully reorganized when the us foreign policy mechanism was reformed merging new functions into the department some including the former house speaker newt gingrich have said the department is broken and needs to be overhauled 65 state and defense departments roles in some activities and division of labor between the two continue to be unclear according to former usaid administrator andrew natsios if state doesnt become more operational its going to be overwhelmed by the defense department retired ambassador prudence bushnell said to implement transformational diplomacy you need clear chain of command and accountability this is
