odically updated see also crs report rs21354 the nato summit at prague 2002 background1 in february 2003 the united states aske d that nato begin planning to provide turkey with defensive systems in the event of an attack by iraq during the impending war with saddam husseins regime the request also asked that nato members backfill for some us forces in the balkans needed for the possible conflict with iraq france germany and belgium objected in the nort h atlantic council nac natos supreme political body they contended that grantin g the request would be the equivalent of acknowledging that iraq had impeded weapons inspections as yet unproven in the view of the three governments and be pretext for war nato secretary general robertson at that point invoked the silence procedure under which any member government objecting to the request must send him formal letter stating its opposition the three governments sent such letter in the stated time frame stymieing the us request turkey itself then asked for consultations concerning its defense needs under article iv of the north atlantic treaty the united states asked that turkeys request for assistance be discussed in the defense planning committee dpc where france is not member the german government was willing to grant the request for assistance to turkey and dropped itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21510crs2 opposition the belgian government now isol ated dropped its objection the dpc then granted the request for defense planning wh ich resulted in the ployment of awacs patriot missiles and other defensive systems to protect turkey consensus in the nato decisionmaking process consensus in the nac is generally sought when allied governments must formulate policy on an important strategic issue ex amples include approva l of natos strategic concept natos document that serves as strategic guideline relations with partnership for peace countri the nato budget deployme nt of forces for peace operations and invocation of article v consensus is clearly differentiated from unanimity which nato does not seek unanimity would require an actively stated vote in favor of measure structure and process nato has civil and military structure the supreme political decisionmaking body the north atlan tic council nac sits in brussels and is chaired by the secretary general each of the 19 member states has representative on the nac key proposals for military decisions are ma by the military committee mc senior european military officer chairs the military committee the mc has 18 members because france withdrew from the alliances integrated military structure in 1966 france sends an observer without vote to the mc france has full representation on the nac however as paris did not withdraw from natos political decisionmaking structure the nac has the authority to approve all key mc documents normally any government may have two opport unities to influence major nato decision for example the mc established working group at the level of colonel to work out the deployment and res ponsibilities of nato member stat forces to be sent to bosnia for peace operations in the 1990s the 18 representatives on the working group met for eight months and eventually drafte d document that was approved by the mc the mc then sent the document to the nacs international staff ultimately all 19 representatives on the nac refined th documents langua ge and approved it reaching consensus is therefore process in which member governments have ample opportunity to provide language to nato documents and decisions that reflect national governments individual views the north atlantic council nac the nac achieves consensus through process in which government states its obj ection formal vote in which governments state their position is not taken during the kosovo conflict for example it was clear to all governments that greece was uncomfortable with decision to go to war nato does not require government to vote in favor of conflict but rather to object explicitly if it opposes such decision athens chose not to object knowing its allies wished to take military action against serbia in contrast to nato the eu seeks unanimity on key issues unanimity characterizes eu decisionmaking when for example new members are invited to join or revisions to the unions governing trea ties must be adopted at nato the silence procedure may be used for any decision requiring consensus at times the procedure allows governments in opposition to measure tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21510crs3 avoid confronting other llies around the table during session of the nac the procedure can also provide cover for g overnment from unwante d press reporting that might characterize its policy as out of step with other allies by not sending letter to the secretary general within specified time period government can avoid the step of stating its explicit objection to policy if it believes other allies are set on course of action this procedure failed in the effort to begin defense planning for turkey when three governments were in opposition the pr ocedure can be more successful if only one government is put in the position of having to take the formal step of sending letter of opposition to the secretary general and may refrain from doing so to avoid being isolated nato uses the same principle of consensus in the dpc where 18 members make proposals on such matters as force structure normally the dpcs proposals are sent to the military committee or to the nac for approval when france withdrew from the military committee in 1966 it also surrendered its seat on the dpc nato in the past has made important preliminary decisions on military operations in the dpc however in 1992 when nato decided to enforce the arms embargo in the adriatic sea against the countries of the disintegrating yugoslavia fr ance wished to participate in the decision and to send forces as part of the opera tion for this reason nato transferred the decision to the nac where france could play role this practice set precedent for subsequent nato military operations the nac made the decisions to establish sfor approve the plan for operation allied force in kosovo and establish kfor in the conflicts aftermath each time because france wi shed to participate in these operations when france and belgium and germany objected in february 2003 to military assistance to turkey however the united states was instrumental in the maneuver to move out of the nac and back to the dpc to approve ankaras request for assistance under article iv the maneuver raised the question of whether the united states and other allies were attempting to avoid or weaken the principle of consensus assessment of the u of consensus within the us government and in allied governments there is varied support for preserving decisionmaking by consensus most senior us officials associated with nato affairs contend that they support th principle of consensus although some acknowledge that forging consensus in an era when nato may go outofarea is likely to be difficult support for preserving the principle of c onsensus centers upon desire to maintain political solidarity for controversial measures in this view the consent of 19 sovereign governments each taking an independent decision to work with other governments is formidable expression of solidarity at the same time there can be political costs due to the sparring and the time involved in reaching consensus natos decision to go to war against serbia in 1999 was an example of such an instance military action against serbia had been postponed for number of days wh ile civilians were losing their lives in kosovo the allies first made an effort to achieve legitimization fo r the operation in the but did not submit the requisite resolution when russia signalled that it would cast veto the allies decided to bate in the nac the issue of going to war without such resolution in the end deciding that 19 govern ments consenting to the use of military force supplied measure of political legitimacy offi cials involved in that nac debate say that the need for obtaining consensus out weighed the need for acting quicklyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21510crs4 2 wesley k clark waging modern war new york 2001 pp 164 176178 215219 224225 249256the kosovo conflict illustrate d some of the difficulties involved in maintaining consensus some critics of management of the conflict including some members of congress criticized the targetselection process press reports indicated that all governments in the nac had to approve nat individual targets for serbia france in particular was singled out in press reports for criticism for objecting to specific targets in fact nato was following very different procedure for target selection member governments including the united states wished to be careful to avoid civilian casualties particularly in the absence of resolution that might be cited to legitimize the ends used to compel the milosevic g overnment to cease ethnic cleansing they made decision before the conflict began after an initial operational plan produced by the mc to attack targets in three phases each phase marked an escalation over the previous one stepping up to the next phase and not i ndividual targets required consent from the nac phase i targets were indisputably military targets such as air defense systems airfields and troop concentrations and there was strong agreement that these must be struck phase ii targets were infrastructure such as brid ges and petroleum depots that might serve both civilian and military usage and were therefore more controversial phase iii targets were the more significant targets associated with serb repressi on such as police headquarters involved in ethnic cleansing often cated in urban centers such as belgrade according to then sace ur general wesley clark and to sources interviewed it was the pentagon and the white house as well as the british government that above all raised barri ers and sought delays befo re attacking phase ii and iii targets with france and other governments raising occasional objections2 the kosovo conflict underscores the po litical pressure pl aced on the nac in maintaining consensus when military action comes into play and the fact that the french government has often been singled out when disagreements arise different governments place varying degrees of emphasis on civilian control of the military and on the reactions of their own populations when there ar civilian casualties the united states government tends to have more confidence in its armed forces in target selection and in making decisions on the battlefield than do most allied governments some allies given the recent history of their militaries stepping in to political affairs or using excessive force against civilians place greater restraints on th eir armed forces in france the effort by army officers to overthrow president gaulles government in 196062 and in germany excesses of the wehrmacht and the gestapo in the second world war are within the memory of many leaders and popul ations and affect how these governments seek to manage military conflict the diversity of viewpoints in the nac means that constant negotiation is necessa ry in providing authority to the saceur to plan and execute military operation wrangling over precise phrasing of document can be means to provide clarity for decisionmakers in contrast it can also be meant to provide vagueness that gives political cover to member government that may give its own interpretation to its populace about the purpose of nato decision altering or abandoning the principle of consensus at moment when nato may accept new members poses other problems for candidate state governments the prospect of such change raises the question of whether the united states and other current members lack confidence in the candidates to participate in the full range of alliedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21510crs5 3 for discussion of range of options in nato decisionmaking see leo michel nato decisionmaking au revoir to the consensus rule strategic forum inss national defense university august 2003decisionmaking representatives of some of these governme nts also express displeasure with the tendency of some administration officials to divide the continent into an old and new europe even if the characterization is meant to favor them such division suggests possible marginalization of france and germany and of an alliance where member states are set against each other implicit for some in any abandonment of the consensus principle some officials view any prospective effort by the united states to move away from the consensus principle as version of us unilateralism in which washington might pressure weaker or smallstate governments to follow its lead an issue raised when the bush administration sought support of severa l allied governments in the coalition against iraq suggestions for alteration of nato decisionmaking the political complexities inherent in nac and mc debates mean that there is simple fix to improve nato decisionmaking at the same time some us officials believe that the growing necessity for outofarea missions indicates clear need to develop new process to pe rmit participation under nato au spices by willing allies in such operations3 some us officials without enthusia sm suggest an eu model where member states votes are weighted based on their popul ations this form of qualifie d majority voting qmv gives greater influence to the largest countries but small states may still band together to block an in itiative critics of adopting ch an approach for nato point out that the alliance is mutual defense organization where supr eme national interests such as the survival of country and the lives of governments soldiers are at issue in such circumstances they believe that the eus mechanistic approach to decisionmaking over less momentous issues is inappropriate for nato the eu is different in nature from nato the eu must grapple with issues involving the sharing of national sovereignty on wide range of issues as result extensive dealmaking has been part of the eu earlier the european community since its origins but has not been prevalent in nato nonetheless qmv in nato could l ead as it often does in the eu to faction building or extended horsetrading however one system used in elements of eu decisionmaking is drawing interest from those in nato who support coalitions of the willing and capable for issues that involve only selected governments the eu has devised committees of contributors in this concept governments that wish to participate in project receive general approval from principal eu governing body to proceed among themselves while the other governments take general in terest and responsibility that might involve oversight an element of the concept involves constructiv abstention in which governments with interests not directly affected stand aside and permit action by those with interests that are directly in play committee of contributors in nato might follow similar outline and might appeal especially to governments that ar both nato and eu members countries onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21510crs6 the committee for military operation for exampl would be those willing to contribute troops and other assets the committee would formulate general plan for operations and submit it to the nac for blessing the nac might allow the committee to use nato assets such as awacs and the planning staff the nac in effect would endorse the right of committee members to act in thei r own interests but not specifically endorse the operation itself committee members among themselves could then make key decisions possibly based on consensus such as how much authority to delegate to saceur for contingency planning and targ et selection the committee would keep the nac informed on regular basis should the nato response force nrf comprised of 25000 troops be fully developed for ex peditionary operations beyond the treaty area committees of contributors could be means to streamline decisionmaking and keep it within the ken of interested governments such committees could serve to avoid the recent maneuver of having to go to the dpc since that step is effective only for sidelining france france after all has been involved in virtually all ke nato military operations and might in the future wish to participate in missions frances forces c onstitute large component of the eurocorps one of the highvalue multinational military formations available to nato france with britain has the only other continental expeditionary military able to serve in high intensity conflicts the committees of contri butors might isolate small countries such as belgium which in recent times has in creasingly criticized nato as toolbox of us policy and opposed outofarea opera tions but has only minimal military capability to contribute in any event some officials who have served at nato ma ke contrary argument to the possible usefulness of committees of contributors they believe that small countries such as belgium might insist that any outofarea mission be decided by the nac as whole since assets awacs intelligence being used would belong to nato as whole and would thus be assets for whic h in part each country pays
