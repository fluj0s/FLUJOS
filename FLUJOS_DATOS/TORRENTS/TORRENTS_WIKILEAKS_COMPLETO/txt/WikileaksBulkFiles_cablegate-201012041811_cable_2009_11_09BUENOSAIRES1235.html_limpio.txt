pinr ar subject c argentina cfks first two cabinet chiefs say kirchners shelflife will expire in 2011 ref buenos aires 1026 buenos aires 301 classified by tom kelly dcm dos exec reason 14b d 1 c summary over the past six weeks we have held several conversations with president fernandez kirchners first two cabinet chiefs alberto fernandez and sergio massa both believe that the kirchners despite their recent political successes cannot win reelection in 2011 they disagree on whom is next in line fernandez thinks that the next president will be vice president julio cobos while massa believes that senator carlos reutemann will prevail both excabinet chiefs are separately plotting their futures in postkirchner political landscape massa expanded on earlier comments to us ref on life with the kirchners describing expresident nestor kirchner as monster and psychopath end summary 2 c we have had several conversations with the first two cabinet chiefs of cristina fernandez kirchner cfk alberto fernandez and sergio massa the ambassador had an introductory meeting with alberto fernandez who served as cabinet chief in both nestor and cfks administrations on october 28 and dcm lunched with fernandez on october 2 the ambassador and dcm also had dinner with cfks second cabinet chief sergio massa and his wife city councilorelect malena galmarini at the home of massas former casa rosada aide businessman jorge oreilly on november 12 in each of these conversations the two prominent peronists who during their tenures in the casa rosada worked every day with the kirchners to run the argentine government were quite frank in expressing their estrangement from the kirchners and their pessimism about the first couples political prospects alberto and massa agree kirchners will lose in 2011 3 c massa said that the kirchners have chance to capture the presidency in 2011 when asked to estimate their chances massa replied zero he also discounted the view that the kirchners would extend their rule through chavezstyle governance massa said that for all of its problems argentina is not venezuela its society remained too literate too middle class and too temperate and its economy is far more complex and diverse than venezuelas oil monoculture argentina he said would not abide the kirchners attempts to consolidate power through more autocratic rule the result of their hardball tactics after the midterm elections he argued was even more negative ratings in the polls 4 c fernandez predicted that nestor would be the kirchners presidential candidate in 2011 he claimed that nestor has better reputation for competence than cfk fernandez told the dcm that his soundings on cfks potential run for reelection invariably provoked reactions of alarm and exasperation 5 c but nestor cannot possibly win continued fernandez comparing the former president to carlos menem circa 1999 he said that like menem ten years ago kirchner could hope for more than 20 percent of the votes in the first round of the presidential election these voters he continued are kirchner fundamentalists whose votes reflect ideological affinity or association with the various political machines controlled by piqueteros labor leaders etc that remain loyal to the kirchner project fernandez said that because kirchner at this point in his political career has zero attraction to independent voters he could expect to win more votes in the second round of elections than he would in the first fernandez predicted that nestor would run and cfk would increasingly govern from the left as that is the only constituency that remains to them he added though that such strategy was doomed to fail the left on its own cant elect anyone to the presidency in this country he said alberto and massa disagree on next president 6 c massa identified santa fe senator carlos reutemann as the likely presidential winner in 2011 he said that reutemanns strategy of lying low was prudent not blunder or sign of indecision as often portrayed in the press with reutemann quiet the kirchner machine was focused on pummeling vice president cobos and buenos aires mayor mauricio macri the onslaught he argued would damage both of those potential opponents to reutemann candidacy when the race really begins reutemann would be wellplaced to obtain the peronist nomination and steamroll the rest of the field massa said that the peronist race would not begin in earnest until may 1 2010 when he said five large peronist rallies would mark may day for the first time in years 7 c alberto fernandez identified vice president cobos as the next president of argentina fernandez noted that cobos continues to be the most popular politician in the country and is conserving his advantage intelligently he expected that coalicion civica leader elisa carrio the runnerup in the 2007 election and bitter rival of cobos would run in the first round and win maximum of 12 percent of the vote deflating the vice presidents firstround numbers but cobos would come out on top its his election to lose concluded fernandez he took issue with massas view that peronists would prevail once they united behind candidate fernandez longtime peronist activist who headed the party apparatus in buenos aires city for many years said that his party only controls the loyalty of 38 percent of the electorate given the kirchners continuing control over the party apparatus the peronist candidate even if it ends up being someone with last name that is not kirchner would not appeal to nonperonist voters in 2011 the partys presidential prospects in the coming election were therefore in fernandezs view poor massa nestor is monster and psychopath 8 c massa was scathing in his criticism of the first couple especially nestor though he made light of press reports that he and kirchner came to blows at the campaign bunker in the predawn hours after their midterm defeat last june he called nestor psychopath monster and coward whose bullying approach to politics masks deep sense of insecurity and inferiority massas wife registered such alarm at these uninhibited comments that he asked her to stop making faces at he disputed the argument that nestor deserved credit as savvy tactician describing the expresident as blunderprone and so convinced of his own brilliance that he was certain to keep making mistakes weve heard similar comments from fernandez on nestors faltering political judgment ref b he said that nestor could not relate to others outside the narrow gauge of his own political ambitions kirchners not perverse genius massa concluded he is just perverse 9 c massa described his twelvemonth term as cabinet chief as an ordeal as he struggled to deal with controlling presidential spouse and submissive withdrawn president who would be much better without nestor than she is with him he said that during his tenure at the casa rosada he decided to do the oprahlike daytime tv show hosted by grand dame mirtha legrand on the set minutes before the shows taping began he received call from nestor instructing him to walk off the set because the apolitical legrand was an opposition figure massa told him he would do the show unless his official boss cfk who was travelling abroad instructed him otherwise he then received three successive calls from cabinet members pleading with him not to do the show massa did not follow their advice both focusing on postkirchner future 10 c as for his own plans massa confirmed that he plans to run in 2011 for governor of buenos aires province which could pit him against midterm winner francisco narvaez incumbent daniel scioli and labor strongman hugo moyano massa said that he will announce his candidacy on the third week of january the week when largely vacationing argentines buy the most newspapers fernandez also commented on the buenos aires race opining that sciolis political moment had passed calling the governor nice guy he observed that nestor had used him by grabbing him as his slatemate in the province during the midterms and then cast him aside scioli is trapped and he knows it fernandez said 11 c fernandez remains politically active as well he told the dcm that he is talking to many political figures within and outside peronism including cobos and the fellow wouldbe peronist kingmaker expresident eduardo duhalde within the party he expressed particular interest in the 40yearold governor of salta province juan manuel urtubey he said that despite his belief that cobos is likely to win the presidency he is counseling urtubey to throw his hat in the ring he says that the campaign strategy would be to nudge nestor out in the first round for second place and then emerge as the peronist candidate in the runoff against cobos comment it appears that urtubey once regarded as reliable kirchner ally is listening he agreed to host fernandez in muchphotographed visit to salta on november 14 fueling speculation that the two were plotting presidential run comment common views divergent paths 12 c massa and fernandez have much in common from their unique experience in cfks cabinet to their active roles in the burgeoning antikirchner movement within peronism they are both generally proamerican in orientation they do not however work together very closely and their futures seem quite different fernandez 50 is lowkey and content to operate in the background while others take the spotlight the most that he seems to aspire to is success in behindthescenes political kingmaking which could restore him to his former status as the countrys most influential political consigliore massa 37 the younger man by more than decade has more ambitious plans he hopes to win the buenos aires governorship and eventually the argentine presidency martinez
