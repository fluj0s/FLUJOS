policy issues seem fixed on cong resss legislative agenda one such issue is the taxation of small firms and its effects on their formation performance and growth in the view of some lawmak ers the current fede ral tax burden on small firms though smaller than it could be becau of existing small business tax benefits should be reduced further because it hinders their formation and retards their growth others find it difficult to justify on econo mic grounds additional tax relief for small business owners the federal tax code offers numerous be nefits of varying importance to small firms regardless of their lines of business most of these benefits take the form of deductions exclusions and ex emptions credits deferrals and preferential tax rates growing number of proposals to expa nd certain existing small business tax preferences or create new ones have been introduced in the 110th congress several related bills are worth noting because they played central role in congressional approval of legislation to increase the federal minimum wage early in the current congress the hous and senate passed differing versions of legislation hr 2 to raise th federal minimum wage from 515 to 725 over two years the house version included tax benefits intended to soften the impact of the increase on the financial condition of small firms whereas the senate version contained set of such bene fits and package of revenue raisers intended to offset their revenue cost over 10 years with negotiations over moving to conference on minimum wage legislation stalled the house passed on march 23 fy2007 supplemental appropriations bill hr 1591 that included the minimum wage provisions from hr 2 and the business tax benefits from bill it approved in februa ry hr 976 the senate responded by passing an amended versi on of hr 1591 on march 29 that included the same minimum wage increase and an expanded version of the business tax benefits from hr 2 differences between the two versions of hr 1591 led to the formation of conference conference report hrept 110107 was filed on april 24 that combined set of business tax bene fits with package of revenue raisers intended to offset their estimated 10year revenue cost of 48 billion the house approved the report on april 25 and the senate did likewise the next day but president bush vetoed the bill on may 1 mainly because it included timetable for removing us combat troops from iraq that he opposed the house and senate then passed second fy2007 supplemental appropriation bill hr 2206 that omitted any such timeta ble but contained

significant legislative proposals in the 110th congress some policy issues seem fixed on cong resss legislative agenda case in point is the taxation of small firms and its effect on their rate of formation economic performance and prospects for growth many bills to assist small firms through new or enhanced tax preferences were introdu ced in the past few congresses though relatively few of the proposals were enact ed the perennial congressional interest in small business taxation stems from the interplay of combination of factors chief among them are the economic importance of small firms as whole the widely held belief that such firms are major driving force behind technological innovation over time and relentless pressure from the small business community for additional tax relief1 the powerful allure of small entrepreneurial firms and the considerable political clout of small business owners are reflected in the federal tax code which contains number of tax benefits for small fi rms across broad range of industries nonetheless some lawmakers say existing tax relief for small firms is inadequate thus they favor the adoption of further ta rgeted reductions in the tax burden on small business owners in the 110th congress growing numbe r of proposals to enhance certain existing small business tax preferences or create new ones are being considered this report scribes those proposals and discusses how they would change current tax law current small business tax preferences firm size plays significant role in the performance of certain industries and behavior of certain markets but it exerts similar influence on the organization of the federal tax code the c ode makes formal or exp licit distinction between the taxation of small firms and all other firms for example there are separate sections in the code for the tax treatment of small and large firms instead current tax law contains numerous provisions sca ttered throughout its many sections that confer preferential treatment on small firms but not on firms that many would regard as large httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32275crs2 2 joel slemrod small business and the tax system in the

weisssmall business tax be nefits differ in kind most take the form of deductions exclusions and exemptions credits defe rrals and preferential tax rates in combination tax benefits such as these lower marginal effective tax rates on the income earned by small firms relative to all other firms still existing small business tax benefits are not confined to those that shrink tax burdens few tax code provisions benefit small firm s by reducing their cost of tax compliance research has indicated that this cost tends to be regressive with respect to firm size which means that tax compliance costs typically claim larger share of pretax income as firm size shrinks2 in addition some other provisions grant tax relief to eligible small firms in exchange for the provision of certain fringe benefits eg pension plans to employees not only does the federal ta x code make formal distinction between the taxation of small firms and all other firms it also incorporates uniform definition of small firm nor any consistent criteria for identifying the firms that qualify for current small business tax benefits as consequence eligibility criteria can vary from one such benefit to the next for exam ple some tax benef its are available only to firms with annual gross receipts below certain level while other benefits are limited to firms beneath certain asset or employment size some may find it surprising that among the eligibility criteria for current small business tax preferences employment size is seldom found by contrast the small business administration relies heavily on employment size to collect and publish data on the economic condition of small business and to provide support to small business through the programs it administers3 existing small business tax benefits also differ in scope and economic importance some apply to small firm s in specific industries only eg life insurance banking and energy production nd distribution while others can affect nearly every small firm regardless of indus try affiliation those benefits with the broadest reach outside agriculture include the rules governing the taxation of passthrough entities including subchapter s

the short run but owing to insufficient data and disa greement among budget analysts over which provisions in the tax code rightfully constitute small business tax benefits it is difficult to derive

significant legislative proposals in the 110th congress growing number of proposals to nhance existing small business tax preferences or create new ones have been introduced in the current congress they vary in scope potential ec onomic effects revenue cost and the support they command among the republican and democra tic leaders in the house and senate several such proposals merit discussion b ecause they played central role in congressional approval of legislation to increase the federal minimum wage they are hr 2s 349 hr 976 hr 1591 and hr 2206 pl 11028 legislation to increase th federal minimum wage the house took the first major step in enacting an increase in the federal minimum wage by passing hr 2 on janua ry 10 2007 hr 2 would have increased the federal minimum wage from its current level of 515 to 725 over two years but it would have done so without extending tax benefits to small firms likely to be affected by the increase the senate responded by passing an ame nded version of hr 2 on february 1 its version of the bill replaced the text of the housepassed version with the text of s 349 which was introduced by senator max baucus and unan imously approved by the senate finance committee srept 110 1 on january 17 s 349 paired the same increase in the federal minimum wage with package of tax benefits intended to mitigate the impact of the increase on the financial conditions of small firms in addition the measure would have offset th estimated revenue cost of those benefits 83 billion from fy2007 to fy2016 with package of revenue raisers none of which would have disproporti onately affected small firm s for senate democratic leaders chief motive for combining an increase in the minimum wage with package of small business tax benefits was to secure the 60 votes needed for passage of the measure in the senate6 republican leaders in th senate and house had said that they would support legislation incr easing the minimum wage only if it included significant targeted tax relief for small firms despite news reports to the contrary not all of the six tax preferences included in the senatepassed version of hr 2 would have benefitted small firms exclusively or even predominantly but some of them would have benefitted small firms more than others three of the preferences woul d have bestowed most of their benefits on such firms oneyear extension of the expensing allowance an increase in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32275crs5 threshold for using cash accounting methods and modification of certain rules governing the formation and taxation of subc hapter s corporations but the measure also included two tax preferences that could have benefitted firms of all asset or employment sizes namely 1 an extensi on of the straightline 15year depreciation life for restaurant and leasehold improve ments through march 2008 and an expansion of the property eligible for this tax trea tment to include comparable improvements in retail property and new restaurant construction nd 2 an extension of the work opportunity tax credit wotc for five years through 2012 and an expansion of the credit to include veterans disabled after september 11 2001 and certain highrisk youths in bid to pave the way for conferen ce with the senate over hr 2 the house passed hr 976 on february 16 though th measure did not address the minimum wage it contained more modest package of tax benefits targeted at small firms than the package of business tax benefits in th senatepassed versi on of hr 2 and it would have offset their estimated re venue cost 13 billion from fy2007 to fy2016 with package of revenue raisers that also differed in kind and size from the revenue raisers in hr 2 once agai n none of the revenue raisers in hr 976 would have disproportionate ly affected small firms hr 976 would have provided five bus iness tax benefits 1 oneyear extension of the wotc through 2008 an expansion of the credit to include disabled veterans and an increase from 25 to 40 in the age limit for eligible employees living in empowerment zones and enterprise and renewal communities 2 oneyear extension of the expensin g allowance through 2010 an increase in the maximum allowance to 125000 and th phaseout threshold to 500000 starting in 2007 and an indexation of both amounts fo r inflation 3 freeze in the minimum wage at the current level of

current tax f iling requirements to llow married couple who owns an unincorporated business to file as sole proprietorship instead of partnership without incurring penalty nd to allow both spouses to receive credit for payroll taxes paid while many small firms would be likely to benefit from each provision only the proposed changes to th expensing allowance and tax filing requirements would ve

expeditious way to break the impasse added the minimum wage provisions from hr 2 and the business tax provisions nd revenue raisers from hr 976 to bill hr 1591 to provide supplemental fy2007 appropriations the house passed the measure on march 23 facing pressure to act quickly the senate passed its version of the bill on march 29 it included the minimum wage provisions from hr 2 and package of business tax benefits whose estimated revenue cost would be offset by package of revenue raisers both p ackages differed somewhat from the business tax benefits and reve nue raisers

governing the tax treatment of subchapter s corporations first it eliminated gains from th sale or exchange of stock or securities held by an s corporation as source of passive investment income second it exempted shares of stock held by bank directors from the rules governing the tax treatment of s corporations third it allowed banks that stop using the reserve method of accounting for bad debts in their first tax year as an s corporation to ma ke the needed adjustments to income under irc section 481 during the final year they operated as c corporations f ourth it modified the tax treatment of the sale of an s corporations interest in an of its qualified subchapter s subsidiaries fifth it required all corporations not organized as s corporations in their first tax year after 1996 to reduce their accumulated earnings and profits at the beginning of the 2008 tax year by any accumulated earnings and profits they had in tax year before 1983 when they operated as an electing small business corporation under subchapter s and sixth it allowed electing small business trusts to deduct any interest paid or accrued on debt used to acquire s corporation stock in com puting the taxable income of their s portionsfirst hr 1591 would have extended the st raightline 15year cost recovery period for leasehold and restaurant improveme nts through 2008 while hr 2 would have extended

and package of revenue raisers designed to offset that cost the house approved the report on april 25 and the senate di d likewise on the following day but president bush vetoed the measure on may 1

provide supplementa l appropriations for fy2007 hr 2206 was passed by the house on may 10 and by the senate on may 17 it omitted any timetable for withdrawing troops from iraq but included the same packages of business tax benefits and ffsetting revenue raisers fro m the version of hr 1591 vetoed by the president president bush signed the measure on may 25 the new law included the following small business tax benefits 1 an increase in the maximum expensing allowance to 125000 and the phaseout threshold for the allowance to 500000 in 2007 and an indexation of both amounts for inflation in 2008 through 2010 2 modifications in some of the rules governing subchapter s status7 and 3 change in tax filing requi rements so that married couples who jointly own an unincorporated business may f ile as sole proprietorship rather than partnership none of the revenue raiser s included in the new law was likely to have disproportionate ffect on small firmshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32275crs7 other proposals four other legislative proposals are wo rth noting because they were introduced by members of the house and senate with significant influence over the legislative agenda for small business in the 110th congress one such proposal is hr 324 which was introduced on january 9 2007 by representative mckeon with the backing of house republican leaders the measure has three key elements 1 gradual rise in the federal minimum wage 2 three tax preferences intended to benefit small business owners likely to be affected by an increase in the minimum wage and 3 removal of the legal obstacles to the creation of association health plans only one of the three tax preferences targets most of its benefits at small firms oneyear extension through the end of 2010 of the enhanced small business expensin g allowance enacted under jgtrra the other two reduction in the period for recovering the cost of new restaurant buildings through depreciation allowances from 39 years to 15 years and repeal of the surtax for the federal unemployment trust fund enacted in 1976 could benefit firms of all sizes it seems reasonable to maintain that hr 324 is intended in part to set forth some of the key conditions th at must be satisfied before the republican leadership could accept an increase in the federal minimum wage representative nadia velazquez chairwoman of the house committee on small business introduced hr 46 in ear ly january 2007 among other things the bill would allow buyers of eligible small firms to amortize over five years up to 5 million in qualified intangible assets

subchapter s corporations to 150 senator john kerry chairman of the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship introduced bill s 99 that would create partially refundable tax credit for certain small firms that provide health insurance coverage to employees the credit would range from 50 of qualified health insurance expenses for employers with fewer than 10 such em ployees to 20 for employers with 25 to 49 employees firms with 50 or more empl oyees would be ineligible for the credit senator max baucus chairman of th senate finance committee introduced bill s 41 that seeks to bolster the domestic climate for t echnological innovation while its central focus is improving the fficacy of the research tax credit under irc section 41 the bill includes new nonref undable personal tax credit to encourage an increased flow of equity investment in small firms that invest heavily in research and development r d the credit would be equal to 5 of the amount paid to

partners hip that provides investment capital for qualifying small busine ss innovation companies an explanation of how these and other legislative proposals would change current tax law follows the

business taxpayers buying qualified assets may write off as current expense some or all of their cost depending on the amount in the year they are placed into service certain conditions must be met in order to claim this expensing allowance for the most part the qualified assets consist of machinery and equipment including motor vehicles taxpayers unable to claim the allowance may recover the cost of qualified assets over longer periods through allowable deprecia tion deductions expensing is the most accelerated form of depreciation as result it lowers the cost of capital simplif ies tax accounting and can boost the cash flow of firms that take advantage of it8 in 2007 the maximum allowance for most firms is set at 125000 from 2008 through 2010 this amount is indexed for inflation beginning in 2011 and beyond the maximum allowance will drop to 25000 its level before the enactment of jgtrra the allowance begins to phase out dollar for dollar when the total cost of qualified assets placed in service in the 2007 tax year exceeds threshold of not less than 500000 this amount is also indexed for inflation in 2008 to 2010 assuming change in current law the phaseout threshold will fa ll to 100000 in 2011 and beyond its level before th enactment of jgtrra so in 2007 firms that purchase and place in service 625000 or more in qualified assets may claim expensing allo wance

method of accounting they use to compute taxable income nonetheless rega rdless of which method of accounting firm uses for tax purposes it must clearly reflect all relevant items of income two methods of financial acc ounting are widely used in the private sector cash basis and accrual basis under the former which is generally the preferred method for selfemployed individuals income is recorded when it is received in the form of cash or its equivalent and expenses are r ecorded when they are paid regardless of when income is actually earned and expenses actually incurred under accrualbasis accounting by contrast income and expenses are recorded when the transactions giving rise to them are completed or nearly completed regardless of when cash or its equivalent is received or paid in general company using accrual acc ounting records income when its right to receive it is legally established and expenses when the amounts are fixed and its liability for them is legally established each accounting method has its advantag cash accounting is simpler to administer but accrual accounting often yiel ds more accurate measure of firms economic income as it does better job of matching income with expenses in addition firms using the cash method have more control over when income is recognized for tax purposes under irc section 448 c corporations pa rtnerships with c corporations as partners trusts subject to taxation on unrelated business income and legal tax shelters are barred from using cash accountin g an exception is made for firms engaged in farming or the commercial cultivation of trees and firms organized as personal service corporations this excep tion also applies to c corporations and partnerships with c corporations as part ners when those entities have average annual gross receipts in the three previous tax years not in excess of 5 million under irc section 471 the irs may require firms to maintain inventories using the accrual method to make sure that the accounting method used for tax purposes clearly reflects all relevant items of income this requirement is generally applied to firms whose income hinges on the produc tion purchase or sa of merchandise nevertheless an exception is made for fi rms in this position whose average annual gross receipts in the three previous tax years do not exceed 1 million they are free to

corporation9 s corporations are passthrough entities that are treated like partnerships for federal tax purposes unlike c corporations s corporations do not pay an entitylevel tax like the corporate income tax instead their items of income or loss are passed on or through to shareholders who must account for them separately on their individual income tax returns this attribution of income occurs even if the s corporation retains its earnings instead of distributin g them to shareholders to avoid double taxation of income when shareholder sells or otherwise disposes of his or her s corporation stock each share holders basis in the stock is increased by any amount included in his or her income in tax year or decreased by any loss that is taken into account shareholders loss may be deducted on his or her individual income tax return only to the extent of his or her basi s in the stock or debt of the s corporation while s corporations generally are not taxed on the income they earn they are subject to taxation at corporate tax rates on passive investment income in excess of 25 of their gross receipts s corporations also are subject to tax on accumulated earning and profits under irc section 1375 not all firms are eligible for subchapter s status only those that qualify as small business corporation such corpora tion is defined as domestic corporation with more than 100 qualifie d shareholders and more than one class of stock qualified shareholders are estates certain trusts and taxexempt organizations and individuals who are residents or citizens of the united states families have the option of being treated as single share holder partnerships and c corporations cannot serve as s cor poration shareholders firms that meet the requirements for classification as small business corporation do not automatically gain subchapter s status to gain that status qualifying corporation must elect to do so and all shareholders at the time of the election must consent to the

p g13end of the year for three consecutive tax years once firm loses its s status it or any successor must wait five years before it can elect that status again for many investors and bus iness owners key advantage of seeking s status rather than c status is the avoidance of double taxation of business income in 2007 the maximum individual tax rate is the same as the maximum corporate tax rate 35 so avoiding one layer of taxation can have its appeal especially for individuals taxed at the highest marginal rates but other tax considerations might lessen this appeal for example s corporation earni ngs passed through to shareholders are not considered dividends and thus are not taxe d at the current 15 rate for dividends by contrast c corporation earnings distributed to shareholders as dividends are taxed at that rate another important advantage of s status ove r c status is that shareholders of s corporations have greater titude to take advantage of corporate losses while c corporation may use net operating losses only to offset income in the last two or next 20 tax years s corporation shareholders can use corporate losses immediately to offset income from other sources
