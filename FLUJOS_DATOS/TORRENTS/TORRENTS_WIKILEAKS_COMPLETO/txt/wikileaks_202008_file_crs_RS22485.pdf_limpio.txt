involves challenge to regulation promulgated by the federal agency that charters and regulates national banks the office of the comptroller of the currency occ occs authority has been upheld both by the lower courts3 in this case and by three other federal appellate courts4 the regulation 12 cfr 74006 74006 reads in pertinent part unless otherwise provided by federal law or occ regulation state laws apply to national bank operating subsidiaries to the same extent that those laws apply to the parent national bank the lower courts have held 74006 preempts the application of the michigan mortgage brokers lenders and services licensing act 5 to wachovia mortgage corporation wachovia mortgage statechartered subsidiary of wachovia bank wachovia or the bank national bank the michigan law requires state registration of mortgage brokers imposes fees and various standards upon them and authorizes state regulators to investigate consumer complaints not being pursued by federal regulators the occ relies primarily on two provisions to promulgate its regulation 12 usc 24 seventh 24 and 12 usc 484a both of which are part of the national bank act nba section 24 authorizes national banks to exercise all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking section 484a specifies that national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by federal law vested in the courts of justice or such as shall be exercised by congress in the banking context visitorial powers involve the authority to visit bank and examine its activities and observance of laws and regulations including the examination of records by promulgating its regulation the occ has determined that the creation of subsidiaries is an incidental power of national banks and that visitorial powers are exclusively allocated to the occ with respect to subsidiaries as well as to national banks g6g146g156g157g155g146g140g157g561g5g152g158g155g157g561 the district court ruled the michigan law inapplicable to statechartered operating subsidiaries of national banks by holding that the occ had aut hority to preempt state law under the nba it used rationale called the chevron test to review the occs interpretation of its authority 6 the test has two components or prongs 1 if congress has directly spoken on the precise question at issue and its intent is clear and unambiguous courts must defer to that interpretation of the law 2 if the meaning or intent of statute is silent or ambiguous courts must give deference to the agencys interpretation of the law if it is based on permissible and reasonable construction concluding that congress has not spoken on the precise question in this case the court used the second prong of the chevron test and deferred to the occs interpretation of its broad and 1 this report was originally prepared on august 1 2006 by aaron droller who was then law clerk in the american law division 2 051342 550 us ___ 2007 3 wachovia

it found that under the nba the occ has exclusive visitorial authority over national banks including their duly authorized operating subsidiaries since the michigan law conflicted with the federal regulation the court permitted federal preemption of state law8 the district court also held that the occ had not violated the tenth amendment to the us constitution9 while the commissioner of the michigan office of insurance and financial services commissioner suggested that 74006 federalized state corporation by converting it into an instrumentality of federal law the court dismissed this claim by asserting that congress had authority to regulate national banks under the commerce clause and thus there was violation of the tenth amendment 10

occ to issue regulations covering both national banks and their subsidiaries pursuant to congressional authorization of incidental powers to national banks 11 the commissioner contended that the occ without adequate statutory authorization expanded the definition of national banks to include operating subsidiaries12 the appellate court however deferred to the occ under chevron and held that incidental powers included the authority to conduct business through an operating subsidiary and that the exclusive visitorial powers of national banks trumped any state authority to examine their operating subsidiaries 13 the court also affirmed the district courts ruling on tenth amendment implications g21g158g153g155g142g150g142g561g5g152g158g155g157g561g6g142g140g146g156g146g152g151g561 the supreme court in 53 decision ruled that nba preempts state regulation of the mortgage lending activities of national bank operating subsidiaries the majority opinion was written by justice ginsburg joined by justices kennedy souter breyer and alito 14 it holds that national bank has the power to engage in real estate lending through an operating subsidiary subject to the same terms and conditions that govern the national bank itself that power cannot be significantly impaired or impeded by state law15 the basic premise of the opinion is that under the nbas real estate lending and incidental pow ers clauses congress gave national banks the power to conduct real estate lending activities in operating subsidiaries and that grants of 7 wachovia bank v watters 334 f supp 2d at 964

relied on the express language of the visitorial powers clause providing exclus ive authority to occ to examine and regulate national banks as indicative of congressional intent to protect the national banking system from intrusive or inconsistent state laws it reviewed long line of cases beginning with mccullough v maryland 16 that have held the federal bank system generally immune to state laws negatively affecting operations the court emphasized the reach of the nbas preemptive effect by characterizing earlier decisions with respect to how they defined the test for determining whether state law was preempted by the nba it spoke of federal law as shielding national banks from unduly burdensome and duplicative regulation 17 and national banks as being subject to state laws of general application in their daily business to the extent such laws do not conflict with the letter or the general purposes of the nba 18 it emphasized that the standard the court applied to preempt state law in barnett bank of marion county na v nelson19 extends to powers of the national bank regulator occ and to powers exercised under the incidental powers clause states are permitted to regulate the activities of national banks where doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere with the national banks or the national bank regulators exercise of its powers but when state prescr iptions significantly impair the exercise of authority enumerated or incidental under the nba the states regulations must give way 20 the court noted that operating subsidiaries have been authorized since 1966 are generally subject to the same regulatory oversight as their parent national banks are not treated as separate economic enterprises by occ and have not been distinguished from national banks by the court in earlier cases testing the preemptive effect of national bank powers 21 in terms of the courts analysis the focus was on the exercise of national banks powers not its corporate structure22 the court found tenth amendment issue and expeditiously rejected any concern that the issue that had been central in the lower courts preemption by regulation was implicated both the trial court and the court of appeals decisions looked at the question of whether in the absence of clear statutory delegation to an administrative agency the authority to determine the preemptive effect of statute is judicial prerogative the supreme court however dismissed the issue as an academic question and beside the point 23 the nba according to the court is properly read by occ to protect from state hindrance national banks engagement in the business of banking whether conducted by the bank itself or by an operating subsidiary empowered to do only what the bank can do 24 essentially the courts reliance on statutory preemption eliminated the need for chevron analysis of whether courts should defer to occs preemption regulation 16 17 us 4 wheat 316 1819 17 waters v

justice roberts and justice scalia emphasized the absence of clear statutory language stating that national bank operating subsidiaries need not comply with state laws regulating mortgage brokers it noted that the supreme court decisions even those upholding the preemptive effect of various powers granted to national banks carefully recognized that wide range of national bank operations are committed to state oversight until today we have remained faithful to the principle that nondiscriminatory laws of general application that do not forbid or impair significantly national bank activities should not be preempted congress has consistently recognized that state law must usually govern the activities of both national and state banks for the dual banking system to operate effectively 25 it also noted that national bank subsidiaries have not been directly authorized by congress and found congressional acquiescence in occs expansive interpretation of its authority plainly insufficient basis for finding preemption26 g18g152g156g156g146g139g149g142g561g11g150g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 this decision is likely to be viewed favorably not only by national banks but also by some others in the banking industry as clarification of distinctions between federal and state bank charters 27 on the other hand consumer advocates may find only minimal solace in the fact that the decision actually involves only one states laws covering licensing and reporting requirements of mortgage broker subsidiary of national bank although all state laws regulating the terms and conditions of loans were not actually before the court occ regulations are broadly written to preempt state laws on virtually every aspect of the core banking business real estate lending deposittaking and nonreal estate lending 28 moreover there are regulations extending the preemptive effect to national bank operating subsidiaries29 and covering all state laws that obstruct impair or condition national banks ability to fully exercise its powers to conduct activities under federal law30 the dissent included prediction of the potential effect this decision might have on the applicability of state consumer protection laws the courts eagerness to infuse congressional silence with preemptive force threatens the vitality of most state laws as applied to national banksa result at odds with the long and unbroken history of dual state and federal authority over national banks not to mention our federal system of government it is especially troubling that the court so blithely preempts 25 watters v wachovia bank na stevens j dissenting slip op at 34 26 id slip op at 10 27 see r christian bruce questions raised about occ preemption as justices eye case on

quintessentially field which the states have traditionally occupied31 considering the size32 of the national bank subsidiary presence in the real estate lending business the impact of this decision is likely to increase the calls for federal legislation33 states and some members of congress have been expressing the vi ew that preemption of state banking laws will disturb the delicate balance of the dual banking system particularly with respect to the dilution of consumer protection laws34 preemption of state consumer protection laws including the increasing number of predatory lending laws carries with it various implications in terms that may garner attention from legislators among the issues that might be raised in legislative oversight are 1 the competitive edge preemption gives to national banks over statechartered banks which must comply with state laws 2 the extent of the gap left by the possibility that state consumer protection laws would longer cover national banks 3 the sufficiency of occs consumer protection enforcement regime and personnel to replace the enforcement activities of 50 state attorneys general and administrative agencies policing and 4 the extent to which occs expertise is adequate to the task of licensing and regulating the array of national bank subsidiaries
